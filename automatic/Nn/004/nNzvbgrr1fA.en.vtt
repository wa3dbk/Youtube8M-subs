00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
all right what the sprawl is asking us

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.339 
all right what the sprawl is asking us
to<00:00:07.049> do<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.670> put<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.849> expression<00:00:09.690> into

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
to do is put this expression into

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.110 
to do is put this expression into
standard<00:00:10.650> form

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
standard form

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.459 
standard form
well<00:00:12.120> scope<00:00:12.660> things<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:12.960> need<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.139> know<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
well scope things we need to know the

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.900 
well scope things we need to know the
first<00:00:13.710> thing<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.009> need<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.190> know<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.370> stare

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
first thing we need to know that stare

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.599 
first thing we need to know that stare
form<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.540> plus<00:00:21.529> so<00:00:22.529> where<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.980> represents

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
form is a plus so where a represents

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.210 
form is a plus so where a represents
your<00:00:23.730> real<00:00:24.119> number<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.529> these<00:00:25.980> gonna

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
your real number and these gonna

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.509 
your real number and these gonna
represent<00:00:26.640> your<00:00:26.880> imaginary<00:00:28.130> now<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:29.400> we

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
represent your imaginary now what we

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.250 
represent your imaginary now what we
have<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:30.150> don't<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.330> an<00:00:30.539> i<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:30.960> an<00:00:31.080> I

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
have is we don't have an i we have an I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.729 
have is we don't have an i we have an I
squared<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.800> an<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.099> cute<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.750> I'll<00:00:34.350> guess<00:00:34.590> I'll

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
squared and an I cute so I'll guess I'll

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.650 
squared and an I cute so I'll guess I'll
do<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> little<00:00:35.190> overview<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.149> well

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
do a little overview of what is I well

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.470 
do a little overview of what is I well
we're<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> let<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.910> represent<00:00:38.910> square

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
we're going to let I represent square

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479 
we're going to let I represent square
root<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.719> negative<00:00:39.870> 1<00:00:40.200> because<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.100> can't<00:00:41.309> find

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
root of negative 1 because we can't find

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.350 
root of negative 1 because we can't find
take<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> square<00:00:42.000> root<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.239> negative

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
take the square root of a negative

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.540 
take the square root of a negative
number<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.070> we're<00:00:44.160> gonna<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.399> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
number and so we're gonna have I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.029 
number and so we're gonna have I
represent<00:00:45.120> squared<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.480> negative<00:00:45.570> 1<00:00:45.930> most<00:00:46.590> x

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
represent squared is negative 1 most x

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.720 
represent squared is negative 1 most x
on<00:00:47.610> both<00:00:47.640> sides<00:00:48.090> I'll<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.960> squared<00:00:49.020> equals

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.939 

if<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.030> represent<00:00:54.239> squared<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.809> 91<00:00:55.230> square<00:00:55.800> root

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
if I represent squared of 91 square root

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.520 
if I represent squared of 91 square root
of<00:00:56.010> negative<00:00:56.219> 1<00:00:56.640> times<00:00:56.930> square<00:00:57.930> root<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
of negative 1 times square root of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.799 
of negative 1 times square root of
negative<00:00:58.680> 1<00:00:59.070> would<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.910> square<00:01:00.480> root<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
negative 1 would be the square root of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.700 
negative 1 would be the square root of
negative<00:01:01.079> 1<00:01:01.530> squared<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:03.290> therefore<00:01:04.290> those

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
negative 1 squared so therefore those

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.260 
negative 1 squared so therefore those
who<00:01:04.769> cast<00:01:05.100> low<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.670> I'm<00:01:05.760> left<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.060> negative

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
who cast low and I'm left with negative

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.780 
who cast low and I'm left with negative
1<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.950> work<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> out<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.490> square<00:01:08.760> both

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
1 you can work it out to square both

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.359 
1 you can work it out to square both
sides<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.299> you'll<00:01:09.450> see<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.409> I<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.650> x<00:01:11.010> on

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
sides and you'll see that if I was x on

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.490 
sides and you'll see that if I was x on
both<00:01:11.549> sides<00:01:11.790> again<00:01:12.060> I'll<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.810> cubed<00:01:13.260> I

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
both sides again I'll get I cubed I

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.160 
both sides again I'll get I cubed I
squared<00:01:14.430> times<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.939> cubed<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:15.990> get

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
squared times I cubed and then get

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.980 
squared times I cubed and then get
what's<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.770> will<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> negative<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.030> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
what's that I will be a negative I I to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.940 
what's that I will be a negative I I to
the<00:01:19.290> fourth<00:01:19.619> equals<00:01:20.540> again<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> square

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the fourth equals again we have a square

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.990 
the fourth equals again we have a square
root<00:01:22.979> website<00:01:23.909> we're<00:01:24.060> doing<00:01:24.270> negative<00:01:26.000> don't

root website we're doing negative don't
say<00:01:27.119> hi<00:01:27.299> skirt<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:28.729> negative<00:01:29.729> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
say hi skirt so we have negative I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.240 
say hi skirt so we have negative I
squared<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:31.140> would<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.590> negative<00:01:31.770> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
squared which would be the negative and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.670 
squared which would be the negative and
the<00:01:32.310> negative<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.810> negative<00:01:33.990> 1<00:01:34.530> would
