00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.930 
watering let's go take a look well let's
turn<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.620> system<00:00:07.799> on<00:00:08.099> here<00:00:08.429> real<00:00:08.639> quick

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
turn the system on here real quick

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.879 
turn the system on here real quick
that's<00:00:09.210> important<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.200> do<00:00:10.349> during<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
that's important to do during the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.410 
that's important to do during the
daylight<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.940> see<00:00:12.120> where<00:00:12.269> their

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
daylight so you can see where their

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.720 
daylight so you can see where their
sprinklers<00:00:12.990> are<00:00:13.139> going<00:00:13.440> this<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> manual

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
sprinklers are going this is a manual

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.609 
sprinklers are going this is a manual
system<00:00:15.000> what<00:00:15.719> we're<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.049> do<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.289> turn<00:00:16.560> it

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
system what we're going to do is turn it

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.380 
system what we're going to do is turn it
on<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.100> minute<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.640> then<00:00:18.090> we're<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.359> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
on for a minute and then we're going to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.140 
on for a minute and then we're going to
flag<00:00:18.810> any<00:00:19.170> areas<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.369> see<00:00:20.640> need<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.000> be

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
flag any areas that we see need to be

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.950 
flag any areas that we see need to be
repaired<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.810> adjusted<00:00:23.180> turn<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.570> ever

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
repaired or adjusted turn this on ever

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.640 
repaired or adjusted turn this on ever
so<00:00:25.590> gently<00:00:29.630> what<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.349> this

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
so gently what you can see is that this

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.970 
so gently what you can see is that this
sprinkler<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.540> below<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.750> surface<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.590> I

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
sprinkler is below the surface here so I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
sprinkler is below the surface here so I
probably<00:00:35.280> bring<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.360> little<00:00:36.540> bit

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
probably bring that one up a little bit

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.360 
probably bring that one up a little bit
but<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> most<00:00:37.469> important<00:00:38.010> thing<00:00:38.129> at<00:00:38.250> this

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
but the most important thing at this

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.979 
but the most important thing at this
point<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> sprinklers<00:00:39.870> are

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
point is you can see the sprinklers are

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.340 
point is you can see the sprinklers are
spraying<00:00:40.290> out<00:00:40.640> onto<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> driveway<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:43.200> I'm

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
spraying out onto the driveway so I'm

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.440 
spraying out onto the driveway so I'm
going<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> flag<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.430> check<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
going to flag that one and check the the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.779 
going to flag that one and check the the
throw<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.649> sprinkler<00:00:47.010> head<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
throw on what that sprinkler head is and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.279 
throw on what that sprinkler head is and
if<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.450> look<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> corner

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
if you look in the corner

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830 
if you look in the corner
we<00:00:50.190> also<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.670> another<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:51.329> spraying

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
we also have another one that's spraying

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.000 
we also have another one that's spraying
out<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> sidewalk<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:54.829> you<00:00:55.829> also

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
out there on the sidewalk if you also

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.889 
out there on the sidewalk if you also
notice<00:00:56.219> we've<00:00:57.000> got<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.210> sprinkler<00:00:57.660> head

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
notice we've got a sprinkler head

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.709 
notice we've got a sprinkler head
that's<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.649> even<00:00:58.859> spraying<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.570> either

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that's not even spraying so it's either

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.740 
that's not even spraying so it's either
blocked<00:01:01.199> or<00:01:01.590> there's<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> break

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
blocked or there's a break

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.090 
blocked or there's a break
something's<00:01:03.750> happening<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.710> there's<00:01:04.920> no

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
water coming out of it making the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.200 
water coming out of it making the
adjustments<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.130> getting<00:01:08.369> rid<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.729> over

throw of water onto the sidewalks is as
easy<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:11.850> changing<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.330> nozzle<00:01:13.130> what<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> do

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479

good on this corner screw it in the top

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.520 
good on this corner screw it in the top
make<00:01:29.280> sure<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.759> pointing<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.869> grass<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
make sure it's pointing at the grass and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.770 
make sure it's pointing at the grass and
that's<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.640> well<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> other

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that's it well this is the other

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.960 
that's it well this is the other
sprinkler<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.950> didn't<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.640> any<00:01:35.790> water

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
sprinkler that didn't have any water

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.609 
sprinkler that didn't have any water
coming<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> first<00:01:37.439> thing

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
coming out of it so the first thing

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.870 
coming out of it so the first thing
we're<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.979> check<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.820> if

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
we're going to check is just to see if

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940 
we're going to check is just to see if
maybe<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.240> filter<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.020> just<00:01:40.229> blocked<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
maybe that filter is just blocked and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.679 
maybe that filter is just blocked and
dirty<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.400> could<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.759> something<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.240> simple<00:01:42.270> as

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
dirty it could be something as simple as

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:42.950 
dirty it could be something as simple as
that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.030 
that
if<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:44.040> take<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> nozzle<00:01:44.579> off<00:01:45.920> you're<00:01:46.920> going

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
if you take the nozzle off you're going

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.190 
if you take the nozzle off you're going
to<00:01:47.100> pull<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.430> filter<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.030> aha

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
to pull this filter out aha

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.289 
to pull this filter out aha
it's<00:01:49.439> got<00:01:49.710> some<00:01:49.979> blockage<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.030> filter

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
it's got some blockage on that filter

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.240 
it's got some blockage on that filter
that<00:01:51.960> could<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.320> part<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> problem<00:01:52.920> why

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that could be part of the problem why

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.280 
that could be part of the problem why
the<00:01:53.310> water<00:01:53.610> wasn't<00:01:54.030> coming<00:01:54.270> out<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.689> so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the water wasn't coming out of this so

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.630 
the water wasn't coming out of this so
we're<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> clean<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.040> put<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.610> back

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
we're going to clean it up put it back

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.880 
we're going to clean it up put it back
together<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:57.990> we'll<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> final

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
together and then we'll do a final

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.679 
together and then we'll do a final
inspection<00:01:59.040> turn<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> water<00:01:59.880> back<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.600> if

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
inspection turn the water back on see if

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.149 
inspection turn the water back on see if
that<00:02:00.840> helped<00:02:01.170> all<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:01.799> we're<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
that helped all right we're going to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.830 
that helped all right we're going to
turn<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.490> sprinklers<00:02:02.640> back<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.270> here<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.630> see

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
turn the sprinklers back on here and see

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.069 
turn the sprinklers back on here and see
how<00:02:03.990> our<00:02:04.170> repairs<00:02:04.560> did<00:02:04.880> all<00:02:05.880> right<00:02:05.939> hope<00:02:06.930> we

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
how our repairs did all right hope we

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.889 
how our repairs did all right hope we
look<00:02:07.229> at<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.439> now<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.670> water<00:02:08.879> is<00:02:09.090> staying<00:02:09.750> on

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
look at this now the water is staying on

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.140 
look at this now the water is staying on
the<00:02:10.050> grass<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.619> throwing<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.489> 90<00:02:11.849> degree

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the grass it's throwing in a 90 degree

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.820 
the grass it's throwing in a 90 degree
angle<00:02:12.319> perfect

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
angle perfect

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.290 
angle perfect
well<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.280> sprinkler<00:02:14.550> over<00:02:14.880> here<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.210> we

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
well this sprinkler over here that we

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.570 
well this sprinkler over here that we
clean<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> filter<00:02:15.990> on<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.740> not<00:02:17.040> going<00:02:17.430> off

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
clean the filter on it's not going off

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.250 
clean the filter on it's not going off
it's<00:02:17.820> still<00:02:17.910> gurgling<00:02:18.600> out<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.930> head<00:02:19.080> we're

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
it's still gurgling out the head we're

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.170 
it's still gurgling out the head we're
not<00:02:19.410> getting<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.770> spray<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.730> there's<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.910> couple

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
not getting a spray so there's a couple

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.240 
not getting a spray so there's a couple
of<00:02:21.270> different<00:02:21.570> options<00:02:21.720> what<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.410> would<00:02:22.920> advise

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
of different options what I would advise

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.520 
of different options what I would advise
is<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.610> dig<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.240> spray<00:02:24.660> head<00:02:24.930> out<00:02:25.200> just

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
is to dig that spray head out just

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.470 
is to dig that spray head out just
unscrew<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.310> from<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.610> riser<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.180> see<00:02:27.360> if

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
unscrew it from the riser and see if

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.390 
unscrew it from the riser and see if
there's<00:02:27.660> some<00:02:27.840> debris<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.560> was<00:02:28.740> actually<00:02:29.250> in

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
there's some debris that was actually in

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.910 
there's some debris that was actually in
the<00:02:29.460> sprinkler<00:02:30.120> line<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:31.230> wash<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.830> out

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
the sprinkler line and just wash it out

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.980 
the sprinkler line and just wash it out
clean<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.400> put<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.030> back<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.600> see<00:02:33.660> if<00:02:33.870> it

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
clean it put it back on and see if it

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.430 
clean it put it back on and see if it
works

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
works

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.740 
works
the<00:02:34.830> other<00:02:35.010> option<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.180> there's<00:02:36.570> too

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
the other option is that there's too

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.870 
the other option is that there's too
many<00:02:36.840> spray<00:02:37.230> heads<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.920> line<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.430> it's

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
many spray heads on this line and it's

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.880 
many spray heads on this line and it's
the<00:02:39.330> very<00:02:39.570> end<00:02:39.840> sprinkler<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.560> there's<00:02:40.680> just

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
the very end sprinkler and there's just

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.460 
the very end sprinkler and there's just
not<00:02:41.010> enough<00:02:41.070> water<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:42.090> make<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.420> spray<00:02:42.750> so

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
not enough water to make it spray so

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.080 
not enough water to make it spray so
that<00:02:43.590> gives<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> couple<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.400> different

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
that gives you a couple of different

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.490 
that gives you a couple of different
things<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.420> think<00:02:45.600> about<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.960> can<00:02:45.990> change<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
things to think about you can change the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.920 
things to think about you can change the
nozzles<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.160> put<00:02:47.910> low<00:02:48.090> precipitation<00:02:48.780> rate

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
nozzles and put low precipitation rate

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.270 
nozzles and put low precipitation rate
nozzles<00:02:49.380> on<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.710> then<00:02:49.800> you'll<00:02:49.920> have<00:02:50.040> more

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
nozzles on and then you'll have more

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.310 
nozzles on and then you'll have more
pressure<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.910> whole<00:02:51.060> system<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.990> solve

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
pressure in the whole system and solve

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.020 
pressure in the whole system and solve
that<00:02:52.380> problem<00:02:52.890> without<00:02:53.190> having<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.640> put<00:02:53.820> a<00:02:53.850> new

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
that problem without having to put a new

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.060 
that problem without having to put a new
valve<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.420> all<00:02:55.020> right<00:02:55.260> let's<00:02:55.500> turn<00:02:55.710> this<00:02:55.890> other

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
valve in all right let's turn this other

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.780 
valve in all right let's turn this other
one<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.460> see<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:56.850> we<00:02:56.940> see<00:02:57.120> any<00:02:57.270> issues<00:02:57.660> ah<00:02:58.790> there

one on see if we see any issues ah there

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.140 
one on see if we see any issues ah there
we<00:02:59.940> go

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
we go

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.810 
we go
all<00:03:00.750> right<00:03:00.990> let's<00:03:01.920> flag<00:03:02.160> this<00:03:02.370> we've<00:03:02.640> got<00:03:02.790> a

all right let's flag this we've got a

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.060 
all right let's flag this we've got a
broken<00:03:03.060> pipe<00:03:03.360> under<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:04.020> you<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.770> see<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
broken pipe under here you can see the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.550 
broken pipe under here you can see the
water<00:03:05.280> flowing<00:03:05.760> out<00:03:05.910> at<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.180> strong<00:03:06.840> stream<00:03:07.290> so

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
water flowing out at a strong stream so

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.710 
water flowing out at a strong stream so
we<00:03:07.680> better<00:03:07.800> shut<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.220> one<00:03:08.430> off<00:03:08.490> got<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> lot<00:03:09.690> of

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
we better shut this one off got a lot of

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.710 
we better shut this one off got a lot of
water<00:03:09.930> wasted<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:10.530> that

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
water wasted with that

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.910 
water wasted with that
unfortunately<00:03:12.720> there's<00:03:12.900> plant<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:13.410> top<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.800> it

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
unfortunately there's plant on top of it

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.950 
unfortunately there's plant on top of it
so<00:03:14.130> what<00:03:14.700> we're<00:03:14.850> going<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.030> need<00:03:15.240> to<00:03:15.390> do<00:03:15.570> is

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
so what we're going to need to do is

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.110 
so what we're going to need to do is
going<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.800> have<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.010> pull<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.460> plant<00:03:17.760> up<00:03:17.940> and

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
going to have to pull this plant up and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.630 
going to have to pull this plant up and
out<00:03:18.270> expose<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.050> pipe<00:03:19.260> underneath<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.160> then

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
out expose the pipe underneath and then
