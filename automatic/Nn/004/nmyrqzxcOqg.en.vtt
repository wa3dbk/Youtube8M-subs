engine<00:00:14.110> let's<00:00:14.410> go<00:00:14.559> check<00:00:14.799> it<00:00:14.859> out<00:00:18.089> now<00:00:19.089> this<00:00:19.330> is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
engine let's go check it out now this is

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.470 
engine let's go check it out now this is
a<00:00:19.509> right<00:00:20.050> j5<00:00:20.800> engine<00:00:21.490> and<00:00:21.789> it<00:00:21.910> was<00:00:21.999> the<00:00:22.119> same

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
a right j5 engine and it was the same

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.329 
a right j5 engine and it was the same
type<00:00:22.839> of<00:00:22.869> engine<00:00:23.380> that<00:00:23.410> powered<00:00:23.859> Charles

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
type of engine that powered Charles

type of engine that powered Charles
Lindbergh<00:00:24.730> across<00:00:25.029> the<00:00:25.210> Atlantic<00:00:25.660> in<00:00:25.810> 1927

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
Lindbergh across the Atlantic in 1927

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.880 
Lindbergh across the Atlantic in 1927
it's<00:00:27.939> got<00:00:28.089> a<00:00:28.119> very<00:00:28.599> unique<00:00:28.720> sound<00:00:29.470> because<00:00:29.859> of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
it's got a very unique sound because of

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.190 
it's got a very unique sound because of
the<00:00:30.099> individual<00:00:30.730> exhaust<00:00:31.179> decks<00:00:31.570> coming<00:00:32.050> out

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
the individual exhaust decks coming out

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.410 
the individual exhaust decks coming out
of<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.410> cylinders<00:00:32.950> now<00:00:33.760> there's<00:00:33.940> a<00:00:34.000> couple<00:00:34.240> of

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
of the cylinders now there's a couple of

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.210 
of the cylinders now there's a couple of
ways<00:00:34.540> we<00:00:34.750> can<00:00:34.900> start<00:00:35.260> this<00:00:35.530> one<00:00:35.800> of<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.040> ways

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
ways we can start this one of the ways

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.950 
ways we can start this one of the ways
is<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.730> way<00:00:36.880> they<00:00:37.030> started<00:00:37.420> most<00:00:37.750> of<00:00:37.900> the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
is the way they started most of the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.510 
is the way they started most of the
airplanes<00:00:38.320> back<00:00:38.590> then<00:00:38.800> and<00:00:39.010> that's<00:00:39.310> by

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
airplanes back then and that's by

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.520 
airplanes back then and that's by
pulling<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.060> propeller<00:00:40.480> through<00:00:40.840> but<00:00:41.350> this

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
pulling the propeller through but this

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.620 
pulling the propeller through but this
airplane<00:00:41.950> actually<00:00:42.190> has<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.700> capability<00:00:43.510> of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
airplane actually has the capability of

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.870 
airplane actually has the capability of
starting<00:00:44.170> with<00:00:44.350> an<00:00:44.500> inertial<00:00:45.160> starter<00:00:45.640> system

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
starting with an inertial starter system

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.370 
starting with an inertial starter system
which<00:00:46.450> is<00:00:46.570> how<00:00:46.660> we're<00:00:46.810> going<00:00:46.900> to<00:00:46.960> start<00:00:47.230> it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
which is how we're going to start it

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.700 
which is how we're going to start it
today

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
today

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.300 
today
so<00:00:48.190> let's<00:00:48.760> check<00:00:49.030> it<00:00:49.060> out
