of different things and they're working

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.150 
of different things and they're working
very<00:00:56.800> closely<00:00:57.219> with<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:58.210> director<00:00:58.690> to

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
very closely with the director to

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.250 
very closely with the director to

will<00:01:20.950> use<00:01:21.130> Maya<00:01:21.490> for<00:01:22.770> modeling<00:01:24.029> texturing

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:25.029 
will use Maya for modeling texturing

virtual<00:02:19.610> filmmaking<00:02:20.610> experience<00:02:21.410> directors

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
virtual filmmaking experience directors

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.310 
virtual filmmaking experience directors
like<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.709> work<00:02:22.950> with<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.280> virtual<00:02:23.880> camera<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.989> we

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
like to work with a virtual camera so we

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.020 
like to work with a virtual camera so we
have<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> system<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.370> allows<00:02:26.730> them<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
have a system that allows them to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.020 
have a system that allows them to
manipulate<00:02:28.019> a<00:02:28.260> real<00:02:28.860> actual<00:02:29.250> physical<00:02:29.760> camera

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
manipulate a real actual physical camera

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.229 
manipulate a real actual physical camera
with<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> sensor<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:31.860> fed<00:02:32.220> live<00:02:32.640> into

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
with a sensor on it it's fed live into

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.390 
with a sensor on it it's fed live into
MotionBuilder<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.500> actually<00:02:35.010> lets<00:02:35.220> them

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
MotionBuilder that actually lets them

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400 
MotionBuilder that actually lets them
manipulate<00:02:35.970> around<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.840> MotionBuilder

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
manipulate around the MotionBuilder

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.710 
manipulate around the MotionBuilder
camera<00:02:37.800> we<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.580> actually<00:02:39.150> added<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:40.340> monitor

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
camera we have actually added a monitor

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.590 
camera we have actually added a monitor
actually<00:02:42.720> it's<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.370> Wacom<00:02:44.370> tablet<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.090> we<00:02:45.390> use

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
actually it's a Wacom tablet and we use

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.949 
actually it's a Wacom tablet and we use
that<00:02:45.630> as<00:02:46.080> our<00:02:46.230> viewer<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.150> our<00:02:48.150> input<00:02:48.600> device

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
that as our viewer and our input device

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.320 
that as our viewer and our input device

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
virtual world from there if we integrate

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.380 
virtual world from there if we integrate
the<00:02:55.170> motion<00:02:55.530> capture<00:02:55.890> suit<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.730> those<00:02:57.120> two

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
the motion capture suit so those two

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.060 
the motion capture suit so those two
tools<00:02:57.630> integrate<00:02:58.290> very<00:02:58.500> well<00:02:58.769> into

tools integrate very well into
motionbuilder<00:02:59.910> we<00:03:00.420> can<00:03:00.630> record<00:03:00.959> this

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
motionbuilder we can record this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.020 
motionbuilder we can record this
information<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:02.070> they<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.489> actually<00:03:02.790> create

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
information and they can actually create

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.270 
information and they can actually create
their<00:03:03.540> own<00:03:03.570> shots<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.410> really<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.130> an

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
out but behind the scenes you can't just

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.970 
out but behind the scenes you can't just
wing<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.780> need<00:03:36.960> to<00:03:36.990> you<00:03:37.410> need<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.770> have

certain plan for what's going to happen
let's<00:03:40.500> say<00:03:40.620> we<00:03:40.740> had<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.890> shot<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.280> was<00:03:41.400> broken

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
let's say we had a shot that was broken

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.730 
let's say we had a shot that was broken
into<00:03:41.910> five<00:03:42.150> different<00:03:42.420> takes<00:03:43.050> so<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:43.530> they

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
into five different takes so that they

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.260 
into five different takes so that they
can<00:03:43.890> get<00:03:44.010> all<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.310> action<00:03:44.460> you<00:03:44.790> just<00:03:45.000> spit<00:03:45.240> out

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
can get all the action you just spit out

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.630 
can get all the action you just spit out
each<00:03:45.510> number<00:03:45.900> we<00:03:46.020> file<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.620> roughly<00:03:47.490> speaking

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
each number we file and roughly speaking

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.820 
each number we file and roughly speaking
the<00:03:47.940> data<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:48.480> layout<00:03:48.960> for<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.320> action<00:03:49.710> that

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
the data and layout for the action that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.800 
the data and layout for the action that
took<00:03:49.980> place<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.580> then<00:03:50.940> they<00:03:51.090> would<00:03:51.240> go<00:03:51.270> and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
took place and then they would go and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.780 
took place and then they would go and
use<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.380> at<00:03:52.650> least<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:53.010> starting<00:03:53.340> Porter<00:03:53.670> an

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
use that at least a starting Porter an

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.670 
use that at least a starting Porter an
idea<00:03:54.090> for<00:03:54.510> what<00:03:54.540> what<00:03:54.960> they<00:03:55.080> would<00:03:55.230> actually

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
idea for what what they would actually

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.700 
idea for what what they would actually
do<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.760> beauty<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.300> previous<00:03:57.780> process<00:03:58.200> is

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
do the beauty of the previous process is

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.800 
do the beauty of the previous process is
that<00:03:58.740> we<00:03:59.010> get<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.340> start<00:03:59.670> very<00:03:59.940> early<00:04:00.090> on<00:04:00.390> with

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
that we get to start very early on with

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.080 
that we get to start very early on with
the<00:04:01.050> directors<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.010> we<00:04:02.280> were<00:04:02.460> working

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
the directors and we were working

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.840 
the directors and we were working
constantly<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:04.080> preserve<00:04:04.710> that<00:04:05.070> vision<00:04:05.670> all

the way through the process by

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.590 
the way through the process by

process of what we do we are actually
able<00:04:18.360> to<00:04:18.570> optimize<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:20.400> entire<00:04:20.850> movie

able to optimize the entire movie

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.320 
able to optimize the entire movie
hopefully<00:04:22.200> make<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.380> more<00:04:22.860> creative<00:04:23.580> but

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
hopefully make it more creative but

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.410 
hopefully make it more creative but
literally<00:04:25.140> get<00:04:25.440> more<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.640> cost<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.360> the

literally get more of the cost of the
