00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.390 

I<00:00:17.580> will<00:00:18.330> give<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.570> an<00:00:18.690> example<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.800> think

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
I will give you an example that I think

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.630 
I will give you an example that I think
one<00:00:20.670> thing<00:00:20.700> that<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.689> know<00:00:22.200> excites<00:00:22.980> teachers

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
one thing that you know excites teachers

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.570 
one thing that you know excites teachers
is<00:00:23.970> when<00:00:24.270> they<00:00:24.960> see<00:00:25.020> other<00:00:25.619> teachers<00:00:26.220> doing

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
is when they see other teachers doing

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.019 
is when they see other teachers doing
new<00:00:27.390> things<00:00:27.419> and<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.740> think<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.700> a<00:00:29.730> matter

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
new things and I think it's all a matter

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.930 
new things and I think it's all a matter
of<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:31.020> know<00:00:31.169> seeing<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.890> works<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
of you know seeing what works for you

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.830 
of you know seeing what works for you
and<00:00:33.830> I<00:00:34.830> think<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.430> confidence<00:00:36.150> comes<00:00:36.660> only

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and I think that confidence comes only

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.710 
and I think that confidence comes only
by<00:00:37.350> doing<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.129> all<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.760> actually

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
by doing and I think all of you actually

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.900 
by doing and I think all of you actually
I<00:00:39.930> hope<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.890> know<00:00:40.920> through<00:00:41.280> all<00:00:41.400> this<00:00:41.550> course

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
I hope you know through all this course

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.750 
I hope you know through all this course
and<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.720> you<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.199> doing<00:00:43.410> through<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.920> unit

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and what you are doing through this unit

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.360 
and what you are doing through this unit
you<00:00:45.089> likely<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.750> some<00:00:46.500> bit<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.100> that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
you likely have some bit of that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.289 
you likely have some bit of that
confidence<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.650> hope<00:00:49.890> that's<00:00:50.159> true<00:00:50.309> not

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
confidence and I hope that's true not

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.829 
confidence and I hope that's true not
only<00:00:51.570> where<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.589> are<00:00:52.799> but<00:00:53.040> also<00:00:53.479> where<00:00:54.479> I<00:00:54.510> am

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
only where you are but also where I am

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.750 
only where you are but also where I am
because<00:00:55.260> everything<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:55.979> you<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.699> said

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
because everything that you have said

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.130 
because everything that you have said
also<00:00:57.449> applies<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.820> our<00:00:59.820> context<00:01:00.659> here<00:01:00.869> and<00:01:01.049> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
also applies to our context here and I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.369 
also applies to our context here and I
think<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.409> everybody's<00:01:02.070> context<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.930> if

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
think to everybody's context as if

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.609 
think to everybody's context as if
anybody<00:01:04.799> says<00:01:04.949> we've<00:01:05.159> been<00:01:05.400> writing<00:01:06.090> about

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
anybody says we've been writing about

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.440 
anybody says we've been writing about
models<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> theories<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.909> gave<00:01:09.060> us<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
models and theories and that gave us a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.320 
models and theories and that gave us a
little<00:01:09.840> bit<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> problem<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:11.460> start<00:01:12.119> with

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
little bit of a problem to start with

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.410 
little bit of a problem to start with
don't<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.200> did<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.799> yes<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.400> had<00:01:14.610> quite<00:01:15.270> an

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
don't it did do yes we had quite an

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.080 
don't it did do yes we had quite an
interesting<00:01:15.810> discussion<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:17.159> how<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:17.610> both

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
interesting discussion about how we both

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.980 
interesting discussion about how we both
understood<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.049> idea<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.799> model<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
understood the idea of a model and the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.410 
understood the idea of a model and the
more<00:01:22.829> we<00:01:22.859> talked<00:01:23.369> about<00:01:23.609> it<00:01:23.969> the<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.240> we

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
more we talked about it the more we

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.139 
more we talked about it the more we
began<00:01:24.719> to<00:01:25.049> think<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.789> although<00:01:26.789> there<00:01:27.000> are

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
began to think that although there are

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.169 
began to think that although there are
definitions<00:01:28.039> people<00:01:29.039> tend<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.429> understand

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
definitions people tend to understand

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.660 
definitions people tend to understand
curriculum<00:01:30.929> models<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.679> a<00:01:32.130> number<00:01:32.609> of

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
curriculum models in a number of

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.480 
curriculum models in a number of
different<00:01:32.759> ways<00:01:33.679> and<00:01:34.679> we<00:01:34.859> didn't<00:01:35.159> necessarily

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
different ways and we didn't necessarily

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.779 
different ways and we didn't necessarily
have<00:01:35.999> the<00:01:36.149> theme<00:01:36.479> view<00:01:37.469> in<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.310> came

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
have the theme view in that and I came

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.620 
have the theme view in that and I came
to<00:01:38.969> e<00:01:39.270> assessment<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.380> online<00:01:41.189> testing<00:01:41.969> many

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
to e assessment and online testing many

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.480 
to e assessment and online testing many
years<00:01:42.810> ago<00:01:42.929> back<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.469> 1990's<00:01:44.249> and<00:01:44.399> I

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
years ago back in the 1990's and I

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.999 
years ago back in the 1990's and I
suppose<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> sort<00:01:46.289> of<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:46.530> online

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
suppose I would be a sort of an online

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.039 
suppose I would be a sort of an online
testing<00:01:47.460> entrepreneur<00:01:47.999> in<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> tried<00:01:49.020> out

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
testing entrepreneur in that I tried out

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.800 
testing entrepreneur in that I tried out
lots<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.189> versions<00:01:50.369> failed<00:01:50.880> miserably<00:01:51.149> have

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
lots of versions failed miserably have

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.239 
lots of versions failed miserably have
learned<00:01:52.049> lots<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.530> lessons<00:01:52.679> along<00:01:53.039> the<00:01:53.100> way

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
learned lots of lessons along the way

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.130 
learned lots of lessons along the way
which<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.179> one<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.539> reasons<00:01:54.810> I'm<00:01:54.899> involved

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
which is one of the reasons I'm involved

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.539 
which is one of the reasons I'm involved
in<00:01:55.350> writing<00:01:55.469> this<00:01:55.679> module<00:01:56.069> i<00:01:56.130> want<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> share

succeed as a GP that's a really

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.220 
succeed as a GP that's a really
difficult<00:02:08.670> question<00:02:09.240> that<00:02:10.280> attributes<00:02:11.280> i

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
difficult question that attributes i

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.050 
difficult question that attributes i
think<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.350> probably<00:02:13.590> more<00:02:14.010> about<00:02:14.490> caring

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
think is probably more about caring

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.390 
think is probably more about caring
about<00:02:15.240> people<00:02:15.930> than<00:02:16.380> as<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.709> main<00:02:16.890> that's<00:02:17.280> an

about people than as the main that's an

about people than as the main that's an
attribute<00:02:18.050> caring<00:02:19.050> about<00:02:19.110> people

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
attribute caring about people

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.190

liking<00:02:21.489> people<00:02:21.730> being<00:02:22.450> curious<00:02:22.750> about<00:02:23.170> people

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
liking people being curious about people

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.430 
liking people being curious about people
and<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:25.000> what<00:02:25.270> main<00:02:25.480> attribute<00:02:25.989> said<00:02:26.230> that's

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
and this what main attribute said that's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
motomiya no rule or practice so i had to

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.830

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
do certain technical things there are

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.210 
do certain technical things there are
stitch<00:02:44.170> people<00:02:44.560> up<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:44.830> things<00:02:45.040> like<00:02:45.160> that

but in the mean it's the the attribute
so<00:02:47.920> really<00:02:48.160> i<00:02:48.190> think<00:02:48.280> around<00:02:48.580> just<00:02:49.030> having

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
so really i think around just having

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.710 
so really i think around just having
some<00:02:50.140> compassion<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.150> curiosity<00:02:52.150> for<00:02:52.330> people

there's<00:02:53.170> been<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.410> main<00:02:53.560> thing<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.860> sustain

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
there's been the main thing to sustain

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
there's been the main thing to sustain
me<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:56.430> recognized<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.730> can't<00:02:58.000> see

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
me and that recognized you can't see

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.440 
me and that recognized you can't see
regulation<00:02:59.019> as<00:02:59.230> an<00:02:59.380> activity<00:02:59.880> in<00:03:00.880> isolation

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450

of societal political and national
issues<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:07.209> it's<00:03:07.360> quite<00:03:07.569> a<00:03:07.599> challenge<00:03:07.750> there

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
issues so it's quite a challenge there

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.059 
issues so it's quite a challenge there
