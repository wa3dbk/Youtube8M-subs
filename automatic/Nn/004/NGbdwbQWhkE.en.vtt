rack I did make sure that it would fit

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.030 
rack I did make sure that it would fit
on<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.180> shelf<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.380> spices<00:01:42.650> laced

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
on the shelf and the spices laced

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.890 
on the shelf and the spices laced
sideways<00:01:43.460> I<00:01:43.670> really<00:01:44.000> like<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.330> aesthetic

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
sideways I really like the aesthetic

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.410 
sideways I really like the aesthetic
look<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.320> this<00:01:45.500> with<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.400> circle<00:01:46.850> tops<00:01:47.120> and

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
look of this with the circle tops and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.750 
look of this with the circle tops and
then<00:01:47.570> also<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:48.020> they<00:01:48.320> were<00:01:48.430> facing<00:01:49.430> the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
then also that they were facing the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.970 
then also that they were facing the
outside<00:01:49.790> of<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.480> cabinet<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.080> I<00:01:51.500> like<00:01:51.740> that

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
outside of the cabinet and I like that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.440 
outside of the cabinet and I like that
I'm<00:01:52.100> still<00:01:52.400> gonna<00:01:52.490> be<00:01:52.670> able<00:01:52.910> to<00:01:52.970> keep<00:01:53.150> all<00:01:53.420> of

Store they have these clear labels and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.410 
Store they have these clear labels and

spices<00:02:11.660> on<00:02:12.080> there<00:02:12.230> there's<00:02:12.470> actually<00:02:12.590> 60

home<00:02:16.160> labels<00:02:16.490> in<00:02:16.610> 8<00:02:16.790> blank<00:02:17.030> labels<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.450> I

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
home labels in 8 blank labels so I

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.030 
home labels in 8 blank labels so I
thought<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:17.990> would<00:02:18.140> be<00:02:18.200> great<00:02:18.410> for<00:02:18.920> me

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
thought that this would be great for me

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.530 
thought that this would be great for me
not<00:02:19.190> to<00:02:19.400> only<00:02:19.490> use<00:02:19.730> these<00:02:19.910> labels<00:02:20.240> for<00:02:20.420> this

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
not to only use these labels for this

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.390 
not to only use these labels for this
project<00:02:20.750> but<00:02:21.350> possibly<00:02:21.740> to<00:02:21.920> use<00:02:22.070> some<00:02:22.250> these

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
project but possibly to use some these

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.040 
project but possibly to use some these
other<00:02:22.520> labels<00:02:23.060> for<00:02:23.210> other<00:02:23.360> things<00:02:23.660> these<00:02:23.900> were

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
other labels for other things these were

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.200 
other labels for other things these were
only<00:02:24.140> 399<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.610> thought<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:25.910> they<00:02:26.030> were<00:02:26.120> a

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
only 399 so I thought that they were a

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.030 
only 399 so I thought that they were a
great<00:02:26.480> deal<00:02:26.720> already<00:02:27.020> printed<00:02:27.590> off<00:02:27.740> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
great deal already printed off and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.980 
great deal already printed off and
already<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.760> circle<00:02:29.180> shape<00:02:29.450> which<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.720> what

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
already in a circle shape which is what

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.780 
already in a circle shape which is what
I<00:02:30.020> really<00:02:30.290> liked<00:02:30.500> about<00:02:30.620> these<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.490> these<00:02:31.640> are

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
I really liked about these so these are

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.100 
I really liked about these so these are
going<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:31.940> be<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.360> circle<00:02:32.690> shape<00:02:32.840> and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
going to be on the circle shape and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.570 
going to be on the circle shape and
going<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.350> fit<00:02:33.500> right<00:02:33.800> on<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.130> end<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.400> these

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
going to fit right on the end of these

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.430 
going to fit right on the end of these
spice<00:02:35.090> containers<00:02:35.630> next<00:02:36.080> I'm<00:02:36.170> just<00:02:36.320> gonna

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
spice containers next I'm just gonna

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.790 
spice containers next I'm just gonna
wipe<00:02:36.740> out<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.370> cabinet<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.630> it's<00:02:42.200> not<00:02:42.380> really

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
wipe out the cabinet and it's not really

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.470 
wipe out the cabinet and it's not really
that<00:02:42.920> bad<00:02:43.130> because<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.790> said<00:02:43.850> we've<00:02:44.210> only

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
that bad because like I said we've only

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.140 
that bad because like I said we've only
been<00:02:44.900> at<00:02:45.200> this<00:02:45.230> house<00:02:45.530> for<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.800> year<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.730> it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
been at this house for a year so it

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.390 
been at this house for a year so it
hasn't<00:02:47.360> really<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.170> know<00:02:48.290> have<00:02:48.680> very<00:02:49.220> much

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
hasn't really you know have very much

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.670 
hasn't really you know have very much
time<00:02:49.640> for<00:02:49.880> anything<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.330> collect<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.810> think<00:02:51.020> so

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
time for anything to collect I think so

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.290 
time for anything to collect I think so
this<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:51.980> all<00:02:52.190> that<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.490> little<00:02:52.730> spice<00:02:53.030> rack

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
this is all that the little spice rack

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.360 
this is all that the little spice rack
looks<00:02:53.480> like<00:02:53.750> it's<00:02:53.990> just<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.290> basic<00:02:54.530> chrome<00:02:55.040> rack

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
looks like it's just a basic chrome rack

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.700 
looks like it's just a basic chrome rack
and<00:02:55.640> then<00:02:55.820> you<00:02:55.970> take<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.570> canisters<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.590> you

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
and then you take the canisters and you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.320 
and then you take the canisters and you
just<00:02:57.860> set<00:02:58.070> them<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:58.370> there<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.640> they<00:02:59.000> have

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
just set them on there and they have

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.240 
just set them on there and they have
just<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.810> little<00:02:59.960> bit<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.290> tilt<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.680> them<00:03:00.830> all

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
just a little bit of a tilt to them all

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.400 
just a little bit of a tilt to them all
of<00:03:01.520> these<00:03:01.700> canisters<00:03:02.120> are<00:03:02.660> just<00:03:03.020> clear<00:03:03.380> glass

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
of these canisters are just clear glass

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.280 
of these canisters are just clear glass
and<00:03:04.190> they<00:03:04.640> do<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:05.270> a<00:03:05.300> little<00:03:05.660> shaker<00:03:05.989> already

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
and they do have a little shaker already

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.500 
and they do have a little shaker already
on<00:03:06.770> them<00:03:07.130> so<00:03:07.790> I'm<00:03:07.880> going<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.030> go<00:03:08.150> ahead<00:03:08.360> and

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
on them so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.270 
on them so I'm going to go ahead and
start<00:03:08.660> transferring<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.290> spices<00:03:09.739> over<00:03:09.950> and

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
start transferring the spices over and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.729 
start transferring the spices over and
what<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.760> really<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.330> about<00:03:11.360> this<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.440> it

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
what I really like about this is that it

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.010 
what I really like about this is that it
would<00:03:12.980> easily<00:03:13.250> fit<00:03:13.790> into<00:03:14.000> probably<00:03:14.540> any<00:03:14.780> house

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
would easily fit into probably any house

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.750 
would easily fit into probably any house
that<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.350> move<00:03:15.530> into<00:03:15.680> in<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:15.950> future<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.580> think

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
that we move into in the future I think

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.040 
that we move into in the future I think
I've<00:03:16.970> talked<00:03:17.150> up<00:03:17.300> a<00:03:17.390> little<00:03:17.540> bit<00:03:17.690> about<00:03:17.870> this

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
I've talked up a little bit about this

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.900 
I've talked up a little bit about this
on<00:03:18.230> my<00:03:18.320> other<00:03:18.440> channel<00:03:18.530> but<00:03:18.950> we<00:03:19.070> do<00:03:19.250> move<00:03:19.610> quite

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
on my other channel but we do move quite

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.030 
on my other channel but we do move quite
often<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.989> fact<00:03:21.200> this<00:03:21.500> location<00:03:21.950> that

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
often and in fact this location that

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.160 
often and in fact this location that
we're<00:03:22.160> at<00:03:22.310> currently<00:03:22.790> we<00:03:23.480> don't<00:03:23.840> know<00:03:24.020> how

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
we're at currently we don't know how

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.810 
we're at currently we don't know how
long<00:03:24.290> we're<00:03:24.500> gonna<00:03:24.560> be<00:03:24.680> here<00:03:25.070> so<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.520> always

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
long we're gonna be here so I always

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.090 
long we're gonna be here so I always
have<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.030> keep<00:03:26.300> in<00:03:26.450> mind<00:03:26.480> right<00:03:27.350> now<00:03:27.380> over<00:03:27.980> in

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
have to keep in mind right now over in

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.380 
have to keep in mind right now over in
this<00:03:28.280> stage<00:03:28.459> well<00:03:28.670> we<00:03:28.760> have<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.970> move<00:03:29.180> fairly

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
this stage well we have to move fairly

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.660 
this stage well we have to move fairly
frequently<00:03:29.959> solutions<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.190> will<00:03:31.310> kind<00:03:31.580> of

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
frequently solutions that will kind of

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.610 
frequently solutions that will kind of
travel<00:03:32.120> with<00:03:32.270> us<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.720> probably<00:03:32.900> work<00:03:33.440> at<00:03:33.560> a

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
travel with us and probably work at a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.680 
travel with us and probably work at a
different<00:03:33.950> house<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:34.760> do<00:03:34.880> really<00:03:35.209> like<00:03:35.450> this

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
different house so I do really like this

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.330 
different house so I do really like this
because<00:03:36.020> this<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.260> something<00:03:36.530> that<00:03:36.890> I<00:03:36.920> can<00:03:37.190> use

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
because this is something that I can use

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.550 
because this is something that I can use
at<00:03:37.489> this<00:03:37.670> house<00:03:37.850> but<00:03:38.150> then<00:03:38.270> also<00:03:38.510> if<00:03:39.080> we<00:03:39.320> end<00:03:39.470> up

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
at this house but then also if we end up

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.140 
at this house but then also if we end up
moving<00:03:39.770> anytime<00:03:40.220> in<00:03:40.520> the<00:03:40.580> future<00:03:40.640> it's

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
moving anytime in the future it's

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.760 
moving anytime in the future it's
something<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.810> could<00:03:41.930> easily<00:03:42.200> take<00:03:42.560> with

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
something that I could easily take with

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.440 
something that I could easily take with
me<00:03:42.920> and<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.220> should<00:03:43.459> work<00:03:43.670> in<00:03:43.850> any<00:03:44.330> other

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450

to put up here in the cabinet and then
this<00:04:23.340> project<00:04:23.580> should<00:04:23.970> be<00:04:24.060> pretty<00:04:24.240> well<00:04:24.419> done

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
this project should be pretty well done

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.029 
this project should be pretty well done
all<00:04:24.870> maybe<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.169> need<00:04:25.410> additionally<00:04:25.830> is<00:04:25.919> the

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
all maybe I need additionally is the

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.070 
all maybe I need additionally is the
turntable<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.789> those<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:27.599> I'm<00:04:27.810> really

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
turntable and those but I'm really

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.499 
turntable and those but I'm really
liking<00:04:28.500> how<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.680> spice<00:04:29.070> cabinet<00:04:29.310> looks<00:04:29.940> the

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
liking how the spice cabinet looks the

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.230 
liking how the spice cabinet looks the
only<00:04:30.810> real<00:04:31.050> downside<00:04:31.320> I<00:04:31.680> would<00:04:31.919> say<00:04:32.160> is<00:04:32.550> these

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
only real downside I would say is these

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.140 
only real downside I would say is these
are<00:04:33.570> glass<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:35.070> really<00:04:35.400> wanted<00:04:35.669> ones<00:04:35.940> that

were plastic Uhler spice rack the one
that<00:04:38.580> was<00:04:38.759> had<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.330> spices<00:04:39.780> laying<00:04:39.960> on<00:04:40.050> the

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
that was had the spices laying on the

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.050 
that was had the spices laying on the
side<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.500> only<00:04:40.800> version<00:04:41.009> you<00:04:41.280> could<00:04:41.460> get<00:04:41.610> was

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
side the only version you could get was

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.790 
side the only version you could get was
with<00:04:42.210> glass<00:04:42.479> bottles<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:43.020> have<00:04:43.229> already<00:04:43.440> broken

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
with glass bottles I have already broken

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.240 
with glass bottles I have already broken
one<00:04:44.190> of<00:04:44.310> them<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.690> I'm<00:04:46.199> really<00:04:46.590> hoping<00:04:46.919> it

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
one of them and so I'm really hoping it

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.129 
one of them and so I'm really hoping it
was<00:04:47.370> just<00:04:47.639> an<00:04:47.789> instance<00:04:48.210> where<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:48.419> cracked<00:04:48.960> the

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
was just an instance where I cracked the

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.570 
was just an instance where I cracked the
top<00:04:49.320> when<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.620> was<00:04:49.770> trying<00:04:49.949> to<00:04:50.039> flip<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.400> lid

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
top when I was trying to flip the lid

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.070 
top when I was trying to flip the lid
off<00:04:50.699> and<00:04:50.940> now<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.300> know<00:04:51.389> how<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.660> use<00:04:51.900> it

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
off and now that I know how to use it

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.080 
off and now that I know how to use it
that's<00:04:52.530> not<00:04:52.740> a<00:04:52.800> problem<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.460> slightly

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
that's not a problem and slightly

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.760 
that's not a problem and slightly
apprehensive<00:04:54.330> about<00:04:54.780> having<00:04:54.960> glass

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
apprehensive about having glass

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.409 
apprehensive about having glass
containers<00:04:56.280> in<00:04:56.400> case<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:56.699> was<00:04:56.820> to<00:04:56.940> get<00:04:57.090> dropped

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
containers in case it was to get dropped

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.480 
containers in case it was to get dropped
or<00:04:57.660> whatever<00:04:58.050> while<00:04:58.229> I<00:04:58.259> was<00:04:58.470> cooking<00:04:58.650> so<00:04:59.340> we'll

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
or whatever while I was cooking so we'll

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.430 
or whatever while I was cooking so we'll
see<00:04:59.639> how<00:04:59.820> that<00:04:59.880> aspect<00:05:00.419> goes<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:00.990> eventually

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
see how that aspect goes and eventually

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.529 
see how that aspect goes and eventually
I<00:05:01.500> may<00:05:01.800> actually<00:05:02.099> even<00:05:02.910> replace<00:05:03.240> these

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
I may actually even replace these

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:04.939 
I may actually even replace these
containers<00:05:04.110> for<00:05:04.259> something<00:05:04.560> that<00:05:04.680> might<00:05:04.830> work

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
containers for something that might work

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.560 
containers for something that might work
a<00:05:05.130> little<00:05:05.220> bit<00:05:05.400> better<00:05:05.610> for<00:05:05.849> me<00:05:06.000> but<00:05:06.449> I<00:05:06.479> do

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
a little bit better for me but I do

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.540 
a little bit better for me but I do
really<00:05:06.930> love<00:05:07.199> how<00:05:07.500> this<00:05:07.680> rack<00:05:07.949> functions

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
really love how this rack functions

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.310 
really love how this rack functions
where<00:05:09.060> I<00:05:09.090> can<00:05:09.270> see<00:05:09.479> all<00:05:09.599> the<00:05:09.630> labels<00:05:10.169> on<00:05:10.259> the

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
where I can see all the labels on the

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.100 
where I can see all the labels on the
ends<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:11.270> everything's<00:05:12.270> in<00:05:12.509> there<00:05:12.720> sideways

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
ends and everything's in there sideways

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.290 
ends and everything's in there sideways
so<00:05:13.560> I'm<00:05:13.680> using<00:05:13.919> the<00:05:14.130> whole<00:05:14.310> vertical<00:05:14.820> space<00:05:15.060> in

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
so I'm using the whole vertical space in

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.029 
so I'm using the whole vertical space in
the<00:05:15.419> cabinet<00:05:15.810> I<00:05:15.960> do<00:05:16.169> really<00:05:16.500> like<00:05:16.680> that<00:05:16.740> aspect

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
the cabinet I do really like that aspect

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.749 
the cabinet I do really like that aspect
of<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:18.320> so<00:05:19.320> this<00:05:19.440> is<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.710> finished<00:05:20.220> cabinet

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
of it so this is the finished cabinet

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.640 
of it so this is the finished cabinet
and<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.210> have<00:05:21.419> to<00:05:21.570> everything<00:05:21.840> back<00:05:22.199> in<00:05:22.409> there

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
and I have to everything back in there

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.310 
and I have to everything back in there
where<00:05:22.949> I<00:05:23.009> want<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.639> and<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.690> do<00:05:24.750> still<00:05:25.110> have<00:05:25.169> some

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
where I want it and I do still have some

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.230 
where I want it and I do still have some
components<00:05:26.039> that<00:05:26.159> I'd<00:05:26.280> like<00:05:26.490> to<00:05:26.639> get<00:05:26.789> I<00:05:26.849> want

to get the turning bamboo raft for over

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.370 
to get the turning bamboo raft for over
here<00:05:29.639> so<00:05:30.090> that<00:05:30.300> all<00:05:30.419> these<00:05:30.659> items<00:05:30.870> are<00:05:31.139> easily

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
here so that all these items are easily

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.710 
here so that all these items are easily
accessible<00:05:32.039> and<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.669> do<00:05:32.729> really<00:05:33.060> like<00:05:33.300> how<00:05:33.509> all

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
accessible and I do really like how all

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.450 
accessible and I do really like how all
of<00:05:33.750> these<00:05:34.020> are<00:05:34.080> straight<00:05:34.710> up<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.009> down<00:05:35.159> and<00:05:35.400> I

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
of these are straight up and down and I

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.100 
of these are straight up and down and I
can<00:05:35.669> still<00:05:35.909> fit<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.090> few<00:05:36.270> things<00:05:36.539> over<00:05:36.720> here<00:05:36.960> to

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
can still fit a few things over here to

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.290 
can still fit a few things over here to
the<00:05:37.259> side<00:05:37.500> there<00:05:38.159> is<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.340> little<00:05:38.669> bit<00:05:38.820> of<00:05:38.940> wasted

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
the side there is a little bit of wasted

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.450 
the side there is a little bit of wasted
space<00:05:39.539> in<00:05:39.780> the<00:05:39.930> front<00:05:40.229> and<00:05:40.470> I<00:05:40.889> know<00:05:40.949> that<00:05:41.280> that

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
space in the front and I know that that

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.129 
space in the front and I know that that
can<00:05:41.699> be<00:05:41.880> used<00:05:42.060> on<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.300> counter<00:05:42.659> but<00:05:42.810> right<00:05:42.990> now

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
can be used on the counter but right now

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.959 
can be used on the counter but right now
I<00:05:43.440> would<00:05:43.710> like<00:05:43.889> to<00:05:44.039> just<00:05:44.190> kind<00:05:44.400> of<00:05:44.520> keep<00:05:44.789> things

I would like to just kind of keep things
like<00:05:45.180> that<00:05:45.210> off<00:05:45.509> of<00:05:45.690> my<00:05:45.810> counter<00:05:46.139> space<00:05:46.409> but<00:05:46.650> I

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
like that off of my counter space but I

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.050 
like that off of my counter space but I
do<00:05:46.770> like<00:05:47.070> that<00:05:47.219> it<00:05:47.370> could<00:05:47.550> be<00:05:47.699> used<00:05:47.880> on<00:05:48.030> a

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
do like that it could be used on a

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.390 
do like that it could be used on a
counter<00:05:48.449> later<00:05:48.630> on<00:05:48.810> if<00:05:49.020> I<00:05:49.110> wanted<00:05:49.409> to<00:05:49.530> do<00:05:49.620> and

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
counter later on if I wanted to do and

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.180 
counter later on if I wanted to do and
then<00:05:50.789> for<00:05:51.180> up<00:05:51.300> here<00:05:51.750> I'm<00:05:52.289> gonna<00:05:52.500> go<00:05:52.770> get<00:05:52.979> those

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
then for up here I'm gonna go get those

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.529
