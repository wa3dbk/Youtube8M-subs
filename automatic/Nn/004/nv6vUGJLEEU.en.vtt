right<00:00:43.629> here<00:00:43.870> is<00:00:44.080> my<00:00:44.379> y-axis<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:46.030> it's<00:00:46.239> what

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
right here is my y-axis and it's what

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.640 
right here is my y-axis and it's what
I'm<00:00:46.510> going<00:00:46.720> to<00:00:46.750> do<00:00:46.900> is<00:00:47.019> I'm<00:00:47.140> gonna<00:00:47.290> start<00:00:47.410> out

I'm going to do is I'm gonna start out

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.740 
I'm going to do is I'm gonna start out
with<00:00:47.680> the<00:00:47.800> plane<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:49.120> I'm<00:00:49.239> just<00:00:49.390> trying<00:00:49.629> to

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
with the plane and I'm just trying to

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.030 
with the plane and I'm just trying to
bring<00:00:49.899> that<00:00:50.020> in<00:00:50.200> right<00:00:50.440> here

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
bring that in right here

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.069 
bring that in right here
and<00:00:51.300> then<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.890> thing<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.190> like<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.399> do<00:00:54.640> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and then one thing I like to do is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.709 
and then one thing I like to do is
obviously<00:00:56.079> I<00:00:56.289> like<00:00:56.559> to<00:00:56.770> get<00:00:56.890> these<00:00:57.010> lined<00:00:57.309> up

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
obviously I like to get these lined up

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.160 
obviously I like to get these lined up
on<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:59.320> y-axis<00:00:59.770> so<00:01:00.760> if<00:01:00.850> you<00:01:00.969> just<00:01:01.180> hold<00:01:01.690> an<00:01:01.930> X

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
on the y-axis so if you just hold an X

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.109 
on the y-axis so if you just hold an X
and<00:01:02.530> then<00:01:03.039> you<00:01:03.160> can<00:01:03.340> move<00:01:03.520> those<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:04.000> they'll

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
and then you can move those and they'll

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.650 
and then you can move those and they'll
snap<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.660> grid<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:06.149> so<00:01:07.149> when<00:01:07.300> i<00:01:07.330> mirror

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
snap to the grid and so when i mirror

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.230 
snap to the grid and so when i mirror
things<00:01:07.930> over<00:01:08.200> that'll<00:01:08.470> look<00:01:08.590> nice<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:10.060> me

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
things over that'll look nice for me

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.840 
things over that'll look nice for me

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
then we come in here with my insert edge

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:51.980 
then we come in here with my insert edge
of<00:01:41.700> tool<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.850> split<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:50.990> I'm

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
of tool and you just split that up I'm

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.200 
of tool and you just split that up I'm
going<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.979> would<00:01:53.550> you'd<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.729> doing<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.030> lot<00:01:54.150> of

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
going to would you'd be doing a lot of

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.359 
going to would you'd be doing a lot of
extrusions<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:55.800> I<00:01:55.860> want<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.190> all<00:01:56.340> my

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
extrusions and I want to do all my

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.190 
extrusions and I want to do all my
extrusions<00:01:57.150> before<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.660> do<00:01:57.750> anything<00:01:58.020> else

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
extrusions before I do anything else

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.630 
extrusions before I do anything else
just<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.650> can<00:01:58.740> do<00:01:59.369> them<00:01:59.460> quick<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.000> easy<00:02:01.640> so

just so I can do them quick and easy so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.359 
just so I can do them quick and easy so
I'm<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.090> doing<00:02:03.330> extrusion<00:02:04.020> I'm<00:02:04.920> gonna<00:02:05.220> bring

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
I'm just doing extrusion I'm gonna bring

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.580 
I'm just doing extrusion I'm gonna bring
it<00:02:05.490> over<00:02:05.580> here<00:02:08.479> pull<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.509> back<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.290> maybe

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
it over here pull it back and maybe

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.160 
it over here pull it back and maybe
rotate<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:13.340> again<00:02:14.340> I'm<00:02:14.489> doing<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:15.170> little

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
rotate it again I'm doing this a little

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.410 
rotate it again I'm doing this a little
bit<00:02:16.290> faster<00:02:16.770> than<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.040> normally<00:02:17.340> might<00:02:17.900> but

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
bit faster than I normally might but

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.280 
bit faster than I normally might but
that's<00:02:21.420> just<00:02:21.570> because<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:22.440> want<00:02:22.920> these<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.550> be

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
that's just because I want these to be

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.340 
that's just because I want these to be
kind<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.350> more<00:02:25.590> fast<00:02:26.160> tutorials<00:02:26.910> and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
kind of more fast tutorials and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.770 
kind of more fast tutorials and
hopefully<00:02:28.350> just<00:02:28.560> helpful<00:02:28.860> quick<00:02:29.250> tips<00:02:29.780> okay

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
hopefully just helpful quick tips okay

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.930 
hopefully just helpful quick tips okay
and<00:02:31.590> then<00:02:31.739> again<00:02:31.770> I'm<00:02:32.070> just<00:02:32.220> taking<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.640> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
and then again I'm just taking that the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:43.440 
and then again I'm just taking that the
G<00:02:33.150> key<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:34.260> repeat<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.770> step

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.170 

bring<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.900> back<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:45.520> this<00:02:45.730> one's<00:02:45.940> gonna

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
bring it back and so this one's gonna

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.089 
bring it back and so this one's gonna
come<00:02:46.420> up<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:46.870> I'm<00:02:46.989> gonna<00:02:47.140> drag<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.590> around<00:02:47.800> the

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
come up and I'm gonna drag it around the

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.440 
come up and I'm gonna drag it around the
eyeball<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.550> this<00:02:48.670> one's<00:02:48.849> get<00:02:49.030> coming<00:02:49.239> down

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
eyeball and this one's get coming down

00:02:49.450 --> 00:03:04.649 
eyeball and this one's get coming down
and<00:02:49.750> around<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.200> chena<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.739> mouth

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.110 

so<00:03:06.159> and<00:03:07.159> then<00:03:07.519> I'll<00:03:07.939> bring<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.360> one<00:03:08.629> down

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
so and then I'll bring this one down

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.949 
so and then I'll bring this one down
like<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:13.269> eventually<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.299> can<00:03:14.420> get<00:03:14.629> come<00:03:14.840> in

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
like so and eventually I can get come in

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.140 
like so and eventually I can get come in
and<00:03:15.140> connect<00:03:15.470> those<00:03:15.650> but<00:03:16.040> not<00:03:16.189> eat<00:03:16.489> just<00:03:16.790> yet

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
and connect those but not eat just yet

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.089 
and connect those but not eat just yet
because<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.780> still<00:03:17.810> have<00:03:18.140> some<00:03:18.319> extrusions<00:03:18.860> to

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
because I still have some extrusions to

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:34.179 
because I still have some extrusions to
me<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:21.500> bring<00:03:21.739> this<00:03:21.920> one<00:03:22.129> up<00:03:30.879> and<00:03:31.879> this<00:03:32.299> is<00:03:33.189> the

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
me you bring this one up and this is the

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.099 
me you bring this one up and this is the
whole<00:03:34.340> idea<00:03:34.609> behind<00:03:34.670> here<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.329> just<00:03:35.750> trying<00:03:35.989> to

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
whole idea behind here is just trying to

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.860 
whole idea behind here is just trying to
get<00:03:36.290> good<00:03:36.440> at<00:03:36.590> full<00:03:36.859> let's<00:03:37.670> flow<00:03:37.940> for<00:03:38.180> our<00:03:38.599> face

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
get good at full let's flow for our face

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:55.570 
get good at full let's flow for our face
and<00:03:40.060> how<00:03:41.060> things<00:03:41.299> are<00:03:41.480> gonna<00:03:41.569> work

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.850 

and<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.090> probably<00:03:56.390> pulled<00:03:56.810> this<00:03:56.990> one<00:03:57.260> back<00:03:57.530> just

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
and I probably pulled this one back just

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.140 
and I probably pulled this one back just
the<00:03:58.160> farther<00:03:59.060> than<00:03:59.300> I<00:03:59.450> wanted

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
the farther than I wanted

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.720 
the farther than I wanted
and<00:04:01.690> then<00:04:01.900> one<00:04:02.140> more

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.170 

yes<00:04:06.459> okay<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:08.860> then<00:04:09.860> their<00:04:10.099> final<00:04:10.730> one<00:04:11.060> I'll

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
yes okay and then their final one I'll

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.530 
yes okay and then their final one I'll
do<00:04:12.099> I'll<00:04:13.099> bring<00:04:13.340> one<00:04:13.610> down<00:04:13.640> here<00:04:15.459> okay<00:04:16.489> now<00:04:17.269> and

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
do I'll bring one down here okay now and

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.819 
do I'll bring one down here okay now and
I<00:04:17.780> think<00:04:17.840> I'm<00:04:18.139> done<00:04:18.320> with<00:04:18.470> most<00:04:18.680> of<00:04:18.769> my

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
I think I'm done with most of my

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.570 
I think I'm done with most of my
extrusions<00:04:19.639> for<00:04:19.880> now

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.580 

I'm<00:04:25.060> just<00:04:25.270> gonna<00:04:25.479> clean<00:04:25.990> this<00:04:26.139> up<00:04:26.349> a<00:04:26.500> little

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
I'm just gonna clean this up a little

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:40.950 
I'm just gonna clean this up a little
bit

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.200 

and<00:04:41.740> then<00:04:41.919> I'm<00:04:42.070> gonna<00:04:42.250> use<00:04:42.460> my<00:04:42.699> merge<00:04:42.910> vert

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
and then I'm gonna use my merge vert

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.719 
and then I'm gonna use my merge vert
tool<00:04:45.060> just<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.210> come<00:04:46.419> in<00:04:46.570> here<00:04:47.460> snap<00:04:48.460> these

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
tool just to come in here snap these

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.810 
tool just to come in here snap these
together

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.740 

I<00:04:53.910> really<00:04:54.840> Beth<00:04:55.380> so<00:04:55.740> that's<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.460> basis<00:04:56.910> of<00:04:57.180> our

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
I really Beth so that's the basis of our

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.410 
I really Beth so that's the basis of our
face<00:04:58.110> one<00:04:59.100> thing<00:04:59.310> everyone<00:04:59.550> come<00:05:00.000> in<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.270> do

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
face one thing everyone come in and do

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.280 
face one thing everyone come in and do
it<00:05:00.450> is<00:05:00.840> add<00:05:01.140> some<00:05:01.170> insert<00:05:01.920> edge<00:05:02.070> ups<00:05:03.290> because

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
it is add some insert edge ups because

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.410 
it is add some insert edge ups because
we<00:05:04.650> obviously<00:05:04.920> need<00:05:05.370> a<00:05:05.400> lot<00:05:05.640> more<00:05:05.670> geometry

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
we obviously need a lot more geometry

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.000 
we obviously need a lot more geometry
than<00:05:06.690> what<00:05:06.930> we<00:05:07.050> have<00:05:07.760> and<00:05:08.760> so<00:05:09.150> if<00:05:09.270> we<00:05:09.390> just

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
than what we have and so if we just

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.940 
than what we have and so if we just
divide<00:05:11.010> all<00:05:11.370> these<00:05:12.110> not<00:05:13.110> subdivide<00:05:13.710> but

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
divide all these not subdivide but

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.190 
divide all these not subdivide but
insert<00:05:14.850> a<00:05:15.030> chip<00:05:15.270> on<00:05:15.450> all<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:15.750> them

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
insert a chip on all of them

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.610 
insert a chip on all of them
cut<00:05:16.800> them<00:05:16.920> in<00:05:17.010> half<00:05:18.050> we'll<00:05:19.050> get<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.380> geometry

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
cut them in half we'll get the geometry

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.950 
cut them in half we'll get the geometry
that<00:05:20.070> we're<00:05:20.190> looking<00:05:20.310> for<00:05:20.630> in<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.780> last

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
that we're looking for in the last

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.990 
that we're looking for in the last
little<00:05:22.140> bit<00:05:22.350> I'll<00:05:22.500> show<00:05:22.530> you<00:05:22.740> is<00:05:23.010> feeling<00:05:23.790> this

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
little bit I'll show you is feeling this

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.160 
little bit I'll show you is feeling this
edge<00:05:24.860> little<00:05:25.860> section<00:05:26.400> in<00:05:26.780> sometimes<00:05:27.780> it<00:05:27.960> can

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
edge little section in sometimes it can

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.790 
edge little section in sometimes it can
be<00:05:28.200> a<00:05:28.380> little<00:05:28.590> bit<00:05:28.710> tricky<00:05:30.200> so<00:05:31.200> I<00:05:31.230> come<00:05:31.650> in<00:05:31.680> here

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
be a little bit tricky so I come in here

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.880 
be a little bit tricky so I come in here
and<00:05:33.230> I<00:05:34.230> extrude<00:05:34.710> my<00:05:34.920> edges<00:05:35.600> and<00:05:36.650> then<00:05:37.650> I'll

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
and I extrude my edges and then I'll

00:05:37.890 --> 00:06:01.570 
and I extrude my edges and then I'll
extrude<00:05:38.550> this<00:05:40.490> one-time<00:05:46.850> tool<00:05:47.850> again

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:09.990 

and<00:06:02.800> there<00:06:03.800> we<00:06:03.980> go<00:06:04.930> there's<00:06:06.760> the<00:06:07.760> face

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
and there we go there's the face

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.090 
and there we go there's the face
obviously<00:06:11.000> it's<00:06:11.180> really<00:06:11.710> really<00:06:12.710> basic<00:06:12.860> but

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
obviously it's really really basic but

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.500 
obviously it's really really basic but
from<00:06:16.100> here<00:06:16.280> you<00:06:16.490> can<00:06:16.670> insert<00:06:17.090> it<00:06:17.240> in<00:06:17.300> more

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
from here you can insert it in more

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.420 
from here you can insert it in more
geometry<00:06:18.230> but<00:06:18.410> your<00:06:18.560> edge<00:06:18.710> flow<00:06:18.950> is<00:06:19.010> gonna<00:06:19.280> be

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
geometry but your edge flow is gonna be

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.220 
geometry but your edge flow is gonna be
coming<00:06:19.670> down<00:06:19.820> and<00:06:20.180> around<00:06:20.450> under<00:06:20.900> your<00:06:21.020> chin

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
coming down and around under your chin

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.470 
coming down and around under your chin
and<00:06:22.160> obviously<00:06:22.640> it's<00:06:22.850> coming<00:06:23.150> around<00:06:23.300> the

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
and obviously it's coming around the

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.370 
and obviously it's coming around the
face<00:06:23.660> which<00:06:23.930> is<00:06:23.960> what<00:06:24.350> we<00:06:24.440> want<00:06:25.480> so<00:06:26.480> hopefully

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
face which is what we want so hopefully

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.450 
face which is what we want so hopefully
this<00:06:27.530> was<00:06:27.740> helpful<00:06:27.770> and<00:06:30.070> look<00:06:31.070> for<00:06:31.340> more

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
this was helpful and look for more

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.300 
this was helpful and look for more
