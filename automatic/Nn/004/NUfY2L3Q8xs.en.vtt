I believe the heavy ion research lab in
Darmstadt<00:01:17.820> Germany<00:01:18.560> has<00:01:19.560> reached<00:01:20.340> element

Darmstadt Germany has reached element

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.679 
Darmstadt Germany has reached element
112<00:01:20.970> recently<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.850> 115<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.240> isn't<00:01:24.659> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
112 recently so 115 is and isn't that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.140 
112 recently so 115 is and isn't that
