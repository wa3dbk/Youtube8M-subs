the<00:02:41.790> really<00:02:41.970> cool<00:02:42.090> thing<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.480> we<00:02:42.540> get<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.720> do

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the really cool thing that we get to do

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.240 
the really cool thing that we get to do
with<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.770> when<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:43.980> when<00:02:44.220> you

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
with that is like when you when you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.010 
with that is like when you when you
fight<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.700> scion<00:02:45.180> for<00:02:45.420> example<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.930> it's

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
fight like a scion for example and it's

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.900 
fight like a scion for example and it's
been<00:02:46.140> taken<00:02:46.530> its<00:02:46.950> behaviors<00:02:47.400> completely

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
been taken its behaviors completely

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.250 
been taken its behaviors completely
change<00:02:48.210> so<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.510> really<00:02:48.630> defies<00:02:48.990> what<00:02:49.200> you

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
change so it really defies what you

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.170 
change so it really defies what you
expect<00:02:49.680> for<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.130> enemy<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.640> really<00:02:50.790> tweaks

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
expect for that enemy it really tweaks

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.690 
expect for that enemy it really tweaks
the<00:02:51.270> way<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.780> approach<00:02:52.500> encounters<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
the way that you approach encounters and

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.460 
the way that you approach encounters and
of<00:02:53.760> course<00:02:53.850> strikes<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.750> new<00:02:54.840> story<00:02:55.110> missions

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.850 
challenges and yeah and you know there's
the<00:04:46.539> approach<00:04:46.810> that<00:04:46.840> we<00:04:47.050> expect<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.770> then

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
the approach that we expect and then

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.340 
the approach that we expect and then
there's<00:04:48.009> what<00:04:48.190> they<00:04:48.310> actually<00:04:48.460> do<00:04:48.759> so

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
there's what they actually do so

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.510 
there's what they actually do so
efficient<00:04:50.350> you'll<00:04:50.889> be<00:04:50.979> very<00:04:51.130> different

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
efficient you'll be very different

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.580 
efficient you'll be very different
