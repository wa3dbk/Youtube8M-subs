another stink trick tutorial video on
this<00:00:04.830> week's<00:00:05.190> trick<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.819> going<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.180> be<00:00:06.299> what<00:00:06.450> I

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
this week's trick is going to be what I

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.940 
this week's trick is going to be what I
call<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.899> sweep<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.440> it<00:00:07.560> looks<00:00:07.740> something

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
call the sweep and it looks something

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.079 
call the sweep and it looks something
like<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:12.679> okay<00:00:13.679> basically<00:00:14.429> what<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.759> is

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
like this okay basically what that is is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.330 
like this okay basically what that is is
you<00:00:15.570> have<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.960> match<00:00:16.199> group<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.770> traditional

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
you have a match group and traditional

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250 
you have a match group and traditional
grip<00:00:17.490> stick<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.480> are<00:00:18.690> kind<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.930> swapping

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
grip stick that are kind of swapping

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.740 
grip stick that are kind of swapping
places<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:20.010> kind<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.400> sweeping<00:00:20.820> motion<00:00:21.000> well

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
places in kind of a sweeping motion well

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.929 
places in kind of a sweeping motion well
what's<00:00:21.960> happening<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.340> matter<00:00:23.670> of

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
what's happening is is the matter of

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.609 
what's happening is is the matter of
hand<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.539> doing<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.900> little<00:00:25.170> sweeping

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
hand is doing this little sweeping

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.870 
hand is doing this little sweeping
motion<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.160> that's<00:00:26.279> actually<00:00:26.490> how<00:00:26.820> you

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
motion and that's actually how you

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.300 
motion and that's actually how you
perform<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.390> trick<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.380> traditional<00:00:28.949> grip

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
perform the trick the traditional grip

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.669 
perform the trick the traditional grip
stick<00:00:29.820> stays<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.420> place<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.260> match<00:00:31.470> grip

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
stick stays in place and the match grip

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.580 
stick stays in place and the match grip
stick<00:00:32.009> slides<00:00:32.669> underneath<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.600> sweeps

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
stick slides underneath it or sweeps

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.220 
stick slides underneath it or sweeps
underneath<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.930> although<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
underneath it and although the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.810 
underneath it and although the
traditional<00:00:40.739> grip<00:00:40.860> bounces<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> little<00:00:41.700> bit

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
traditional grip bounces a little bit

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.450 
traditional grip bounces a little bit
the<00:00:42.030> match<00:00:42.210> grip<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.629> doing<00:00:42.960> most<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.440> work

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.279 

just<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.450> accommodate<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
just like that to accommodate for the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
just like that to accommodate for the
poor<00:00:49.530> quality<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:50.039> sound<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> get<00:00:50.879> when

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
poor quality of sound that you get when

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
poor quality of sound that you get when
doing<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> sweeping<00:00:52.379> motion<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> masker

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
doing the sweeping motion in the masker

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.330 
doing the sweeping motion in the masker
pan<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:54.719> play<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> traditional<00:00:55.770> grip<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.129> its

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
pan we play the traditional grip in its

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.610 
pan we play the traditional grip in its
natural<00:00:56.579> position<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:57.960> many<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
natural position now many of you that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.260 
natural position now many of you that
learned<00:00:58.800> traditional<00:00:59.280> grip<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> flat<00:00:59.969> drum

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
learned traditional grip on a flat drum

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.670 
learned traditional grip on a flat drum
may<00:01:00.539> think<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> natural

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
may think that this is the natural

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.549 
may think that this is the natural
position<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.320> actually

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
position but it's not this is actually

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.289 
position but it's not this is actually
the<00:01:04.860> natural<00:01:05.220> position<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> traditional

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the natural position of the traditional

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.820 
the natural position of the traditional
grip<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.200> were<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> play<00:01:07.500> sling

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
grip because if you were to play sling

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.100 
grip because if you were to play sling
drum<00:01:08.070> that's<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.240> position<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> stick

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
drum that's the position that the stick

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.950 
drum that's the position that the stick
would<00:01:10.260> be<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> would<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.630> low<00:01:12.630> like

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
would be in it would not be low like

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.750 
would be in it would not be low like
that<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.740> actually<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> move<00:01:14.369> that's<00:01:14.520> used

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
that this is actually a move that's used

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.609 
that this is actually a move that's used
to<00:01:14.820> accommodate<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.479> flat<00:01:15.659> drunk<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.439> for

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
to accommodate for a flat drunk but for

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.499 
to accommodate for a flat drunk but for
this<00:01:16.830> we're<00:01:17.369> using<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.790> natural<00:01:17.939> position

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
this we're using the natural position

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.270 
this we're using the natural position
because<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.080> creates<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.380> kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.799> pecking

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
because it creates this kind of pecking

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.060 
because it creates this kind of pecking
emotion<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:22.140> pecking<00:01:22.500> sound<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.950> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
emotion and this pecking sound that is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.840 
emotion and this pecking sound that is
low<00:01:23.340> quality<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:26.070> when<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> play<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.670> low

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
low quality so when you play the low

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.210 
low quality so when you play the low
quality<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.479> sound<00:01:27.860> sweeping<00:01:28.860> motion

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
quality of sound sweeping motion

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
quality of sound sweeping motion
combined<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> low<00:01:30.420> quality<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.930> sound

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
combined with the low quality of sound

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.770 
combined with the low quality of sound
pecking<00:01:31.560> motion<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.759> actually<00:01:33.090> sound<00:01:33.329> even

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
pecking motion and actually sound even

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.560 
pecking motion and actually sound even
if<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.380> were<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> play<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.070> regular<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> one

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
if you were to play one regular and one

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.420 
if you were to play one regular and one
with<00:01:37.020> low<00:01:37.259> quality<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.710> sound<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.189> would<00:01:38.280> sound

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
with low quality of sound it would sound

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.410 
with low quality of sound it would sound
something<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.909> this

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.780 

or<00:01:41.930> like<00:01:42.560> this<00:01:45.040> but<00:01:46.040> when<00:01:46.220> we<00:01:46.340> make<00:01:46.549> both<00:01:46.759> of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
or like this but when we make both of

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.149 
or like this but when we make both of
them<00:01:47.090> low<00:01:47.270> quality<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:51.470> kind<00:01:51.680> of<00:01:51.740> just<00:01:51.920> sounds

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
them low quality it kind of just sounds

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.010 
them low quality it kind of just sounds
like<00:01:52.189> we're<00:01:52.430> playing<00:01:52.549> piano<00:01:52.970> or<00:01:53.330> penis<00:01:53.689> and

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
like we're playing piano or penis and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.590 
like we're playing piano or penis and
this<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.430> cover<00:01:55.670> up<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.030> fact<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.360> both

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
this is to cover up the fact that both

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.690 
this is to cover up the fact that both
of<00:01:56.659> those<00:01:57.140> motions<00:01:57.740> produce<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.190> poor<00:01:58.369> quality

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
of those motions produce a poor quality

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.789
