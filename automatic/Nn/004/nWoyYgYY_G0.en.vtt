experiment mr. Vaughn I don't think you
should<00:00:41.610> we<00:00:42.210> must<00:00:42.450> try<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> Machine<00:00:43.290> Gregory

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
should we must try the Machine Gregory

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.610 
should we must try the Machine Gregory
but<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:44.790> dangerous<00:00:45.140> it<00:00:46.140> would<00:00:46.260> be<00:00:46.410> even<00:00:46.590> more

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
but it's dangerous it would be even more

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.280 
but it's dangerous it would be even more
dangerous<00:00:47.220> if<00:00:47.400> we<00:00:47.430> didn't<00:00:47.879> try<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.900> must<00:00:49.110> be

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
dangerous if we didn't try it we must be

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.960 
dangerous if we didn't try it we must be
sure<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.739> an<00:00:49.980> effective<00:00:50.400> weapon<00:00:50.699> against

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970

possibly but I think we've proved that
the<00:02:36.040> professor's<00:02:36.460> machine<00:02:36.760> can<00:02:36.970> be<00:02:37.090> effective

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
the professor's machine can be effective
