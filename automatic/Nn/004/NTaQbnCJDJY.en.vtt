00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
intelligent control now I never saw

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.399 
intelligent control now I never saw

personally a mechanical ship or some

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.980 
personally a mechanical ship or some
clearly<00:01:52.860> defined<00:01:53.310> shape<00:01:53.700> what<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.270> saw<00:01:54.689> were

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
clearly defined shape what I saw were

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.460 
clearly defined shape what I saw were
lights

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
lights

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.469 
lights
I<00:01:55.619> saw<00:01:56.159> three<00:01:56.520> different<00:01:56.640> things<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.270> saw<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
I saw three different things I saw a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.959 
I saw three different things I saw a
glowing<00:01:57.840> red<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.890> bald<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.640> was<00:01:59.759> dripping

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
glowing red I like bald it was dripping

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.179 
glowing red I like bald it was dripping
like<00:02:00.270> molten<00:02:00.570> metal<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.439> came<00:02:01.680> toward<00:02:02.040> us

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
like molten metal that came toward us

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.100 
like molten metal that came toward us
that<00:02:02.399> moved<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.880> came<00:02:03.030> into<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> force<00:02:03.630> moved

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
that moved it came into the force moved

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.569 
that moved it came into the force moved
through<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.439> trees<00:02:04.710> missing<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> trees

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
through the trees missing the trees

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.039 
through the trees missing the trees
obviously<00:02:05.850> under<00:02:06.420> control

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
obviously under control

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.930 
obviously under control
the<00:02:07.649> item<00:02:07.890> moved<00:02:08.160> back<00:02:08.310> into<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.580> field<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the item moved back into the field and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.400 
the item moved back into the field and
exploded<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.539> was<00:02:09.599> gone

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
exploded and was gone

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.660 
exploded and was gone
there<00:02:10.530> were<00:02:10.620> all<00:02:10.740> three<00:02:10.980> objects<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.580> the

multicolored<00:02:13.620> lights<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.250> moved<00:02:14.490> in

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
multicolored lights that moved in

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.220 
multicolored lights that moved in
synchronization<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.690> they<00:02:15.810> were<00:02:15.870> doing<00:02:16.050> a

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
synchronization so they were doing a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.350 
synchronization so they were doing a
grid<00:02:16.440> search<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:17.550> watched<00:02:17.790> them<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.150> quite<00:02:18.300> a
