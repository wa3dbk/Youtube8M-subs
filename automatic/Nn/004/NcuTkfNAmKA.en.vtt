00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
of rotary cutter from king cutter this

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.259 
of rotary cutter from king cutter this
has<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.900> lot<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.259> just<00:00:13.590> pure<00:00:13.950> heavy<00:00:14.370> weight<00:00:14.759> into

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
has a lot of just pure heavy weight into

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.490 
has a lot of just pure heavy weight into
it<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.540> I'm<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.780> show<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.020> some<00:00:16.350> of

it and I'm going to show you some of
that<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.730> flywheel<00:00:18.630> assembly<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.770> holds

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
that on the flywheel assembly that holds

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.040 
that on the flywheel assembly that holds
the<00:00:20.400> blades<00:00:20.699> underneath<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.689> three

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the blades underneath it's a three

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.380 
the blades underneath it's a three
quarter<00:00:22.470> inch<00:00:22.500> piece<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.010> steel<00:00:23.460> which<00:00:24.240> is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
quarter inch piece of steel which is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.910 
quarter inch piece of steel which is
going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:24.779> two<00:00:25.019> things<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.740> act

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
going to do two things it's going to act

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.679 
going to do two things it's going to act
like<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> Stumpjumper<00:00:26.670> because<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.420> round

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
like a Stumpjumper because it's round

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.960 
like a Stumpjumper because it's round
but<00:00:28.380> simply<00:00:28.830> because<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.340> has<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.789> much

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
but simply because it has so much

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.540 
but simply because it has so much
rotating<00:00:30.750> weight<00:00:31.019> every<00:00:31.800> time<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.279> hit<00:00:32.489> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
rotating weight every time you hit a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.150 
rotating weight every time you hit a
large<00:00:32.940> tree<00:00:33.480> 2<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.020> 3<00:00:34.260> inch<00:00:34.410> tree<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.010> you're

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
large tree 2 or 3 inch tree that you're

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.280 
large tree 2 or 3 inch tree that you're
cutting<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.910> simply<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> take<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.930> lot<00:00:37.260> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
cutting is simply going to take a lot of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.010 
cutting is simply going to take a lot of
the<00:00:37.469> shock<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.610> vibration<00:00:39.420> out<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
the shock and the vibration out of the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410 
the shock and the vibration out of the
machine<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.280> drive<00:00:41.579> line<00:00:41.910> isn't

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
machine so your drive line isn't

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.869 
machine so your drive line isn't
catching<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.350> hard<00:00:43.590> end<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.640> does

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
catching the the hard end of it it does

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
catching the the hard end of it it does
have<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.180> slip<00:00:45.510> clutch<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.140> if<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> hit

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
have a slip clutch so if you hit

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.170 
have a slip clutch so if you hit
something<00:00:46.800> hard<00:00:47.219> enough<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.910> enough

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
something hard enough or you get enough

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
something hard enough or you get enough
pull<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.600> will<00:00:48.750> slip<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.530> won't<00:00:49.739> be

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
pull it will slip and you won't be

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.910 
pull it will slip and you won't be
