00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259 
only time out of field man what a beauty

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:55.439 
only time out of field man what a beauty
it<00:06:53.919> was<00:06:54.099> a<00:06:54.129> beauty<00:06:54.459> in<00:06:54.550> the<00:06:54.639> air<00:06:54.789> as<00:06:55.029> well<00:06:55.179> right

it was a beauty in the air as well right
so<00:06:56.039> first<00:06:57.039> test<00:06:57.279> flight<00:06:57.490> was<00:06:57.699> very<00:06:57.909> very<00:06:58.059> good

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300

so first test flight was very very good
with<00:06:58.479> 1800<00:06:59.020> mAh<00:06:59.319> battery<00:06:59.709> and<00:06:59.939> I'm<00:07:00.939> sure<00:07:01.179> I<00:07:01.209> can

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
with 1800 mAh battery and I'm sure I can

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:04.079 
with 1800 mAh battery and I'm sure I can
still<00:07:01.779> fly<00:07:02.020> it<00:07:02.139> four<00:07:02.740> more<00:07:03.069> minutes<00:07:03.219> on<00:07:03.550> 1800

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:04.089 
still fly it four more minutes on 1800

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:06.179 
still fly it four more minutes on 1800
mAh<00:07:04.509> battery<00:07:04.899> this<00:07:05.379> thing<00:07:05.589> will<00:07:05.709> fly<00:07:05.949> four

00:07:06.179 --> 00:07:06.189 
mAh battery this thing will fly four

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:07.769 
mAh battery this thing will fly four
nine<00:07:06.369> eight<00:07:06.610> -<00:07:06.969> nine<00:07:07.119> minutes<00:07:07.270> very<00:07:07.599> easily

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:07.779 
nine eight - nine minutes very easily

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:11.519 
nine eight - nine minutes very easily
now<00:07:08.439> max<00:07:08.740> we<00:07:08.919> are<00:07:09.009> gonna<00:07:09.129> do<00:07:09.279> is<00:07:09.490> put<00:07:10.259> 4000<00:07:11.259> M<00:07:11.379> at

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:11.529 
now max we are gonna do is put 4000 M at

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:13.709 
now max we are gonna do is put 4000 M at
inside<00:07:12.009> and<00:07:12.279> see<00:07:12.550> how<00:07:12.729> it<00:07:12.879> will<00:07:13.059> behave<00:07:13.209> just

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:13.719 
inside and see how it will behave just

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:16.800 
inside and see how it will behave just
longer<00:07:14.110> flight<00:07:14.409> time<00:07:14.619> it
