course if it is in the image we rather

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.569 
course if it is in the image we rather
have<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.410> live<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:59.010> shoot<00:00:59.219> another

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that works well well let's have a look

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.240 
that works well well let's have a look
at<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.780> going<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.380> off<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.680> mean<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.979> is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
at it going on and off I mean this is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.090 
at it going on and off I mean this is
what<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.360> cameras<00:01:30.810> seeing<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.680> I'm<00:01:31.950> moving

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
what the cameras seeing as I'm moving

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.800 
what the cameras seeing as I'm moving
the<00:01:32.400> card<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.329> see<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.780> very

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the card and you can see it's a very

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
the card and you can see it's a very
washed<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.619> image<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.670> about

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
washed out image so that's it about

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.359 
washed out image so that's it about
Flint<00:01:39.180> well<00:01:39.689> tell<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> what<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.100> go<00:01:41.220> back

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
Flint well tell you what then we go back

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.179 
Flint well tell you what then we go back
into<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> studio<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.560> see<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.070> do

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
into the studio and see what we can do

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.679 
into the studio and see what we can do
in<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.640> show<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.939> how<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.119> maybe<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.540> use

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
in there to show you how to maybe to use

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.030 
in there to show you how to maybe to use
it<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.930> creative<00:01:46.170> way

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.170 

well<00:01:50.040> walking<00:01:50.430> back<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> studio<00:01:51.149> I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
well walking back to the studio I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.179 
well walking back to the studio I
noticed<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.470> tree<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.070> way

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
noticed that there was a tree in the way

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.429 
noticed that there was a tree in the way
of<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> Sun<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.479> realized<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.049> that's

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
of the Sun and then realized that that's

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.980 
of the Sun and then realized that that's
quite<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> good<00:01:56.040> way<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.939> block<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
quite a good way if you can block the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.889 
quite a good way if you can block the
Sun<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.890> by<00:01:59.729> putting<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.149> behind<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.450> tree<00:02:00.659> like

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
Sun out by putting it behind a tree like

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.800 
Sun out by putting it behind a tree like
this<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.649> ideal<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:03.149> then<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.570> put

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
this and it's ideal so then I have put

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.690 
this and it's ideal so then I have put
on<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> crosshair<00:02:04.469> filter<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.520> what

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
on a crosshair filter just to see what

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.910 
on a crosshair filter just to see what
would<00:02:05.759> happen<00:02:06.350> now<00:02:07.350> that's<00:02:07.560> interesting

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
would happen now that's interesting

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.010 
would happen now that's interesting
because<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.789> picture<00:02:09.060> gets<00:02:09.149> darker<00:02:09.780> you

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
because as the picture gets darker you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.690 
because as the picture gets darker you
can<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.410> how<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.800> difference<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.459> aperture

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
can see how the difference in aperture

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.630 
can see how the difference in aperture
affects<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:14.349> filter<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:14.920> this<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.069> happens

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
affects the filter and this is happens

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.600 
affects the filter and this is happens
in<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.819> lot<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.000> cases<00:02:16.769> so<00:02:17.769> let's<00:02:17.980> get<00:02:18.160> on<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.580> a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
in a lot of cases so let's get on to a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.170 
in a lot of cases so let's get on to a
much<00:02:18.879> more<00:02:19.180> agreeable<00:02:19.599> type<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.410> subject<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
much more agreeable type of subject the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.860 
much more agreeable type of subject the
way<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.870> using<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.560> created<00:02:24.489> creatively<00:02:25.239> now

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
way of using it created creatively now

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.420 
way of using it created creatively now
it's<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.260> see<00:02:26.470> what's<00:02:26.739> happening<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
it's you see what's happening is the

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.089 
it's you see what's happening is the
light<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.790> coming<00:02:27.970> through<00:02:28.239> this<00:02:28.390> window<00:02:29.099> now

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
light is coming through this window now

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.589 
light is coming through this window now
a<00:02:30.130> little<00:02:30.489> bit<00:02:30.640> of<00:02:30.730> dust<00:02:30.910> in<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.209> air<00:02:31.360> and

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
a little bit of dust in the air and

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.820 
a little bit of dust in the air and
that's<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:31.870> happens<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.349> that's<00:02:32.530> that's

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
that's what happens and that's that's

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.650 
that's what happens and that's that's
really<00:02:33.190> flare<00:02:34.319> now<00:02:35.319> we<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:36.010> move<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.340> a

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
really flare now we can move on to a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.300 
really flare now we can move on to a
portrait<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.290> see<00:02:38.470> how<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.680> fan<00:02:38.950> area<00:02:39.190> is

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
portrait and you see how the fan area is

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.979 
portrait and you see how the fan area is
causing<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.910> very<00:02:40.090> high<00:02:40.390> key<00:02:40.840> type<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.860> effect

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
causing a very high key type of effect

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.509 
causing a very high key type of effect
now<00:02:43.989> when<00:02:44.260> we<00:02:44.410> change<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.980> black<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.220> white

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
now when we change it to black and white

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.949 
now when we change it to black and white
you<00:02:45.819> can<00:02:45.970> see<00:02:46.120> what<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:46.269> mean<00:02:46.480> about<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.840> high

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
you can see what I mean about the high

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.860 
you can see what I mean about the high
key<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:48.190> can<00:02:48.370> also<00:02:48.549> see<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.390> flare<00:02:49.690> has

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
key you can also see that the flare has

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.949 
key you can also see that the flare has
caused<00:02:50.230> more<00:02:50.980> grain<00:02:51.370> now<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.299> happens<00:02:52.660> on

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
caused more grain now this happens on

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.039 
caused more grain now this happens on
film<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:54.400> does<00:02:54.610> increase<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.000> grain<00:02:55.450> which<00:02:55.780> is

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
film it does increase the grain which is

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.420 
film it does increase the grain which is
a<00:02:56.349> strange<00:02:57.010> effect<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.519> I<00:02:57.579> don't<00:02:57.790> know<00:02:57.880> why

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
a strange effect and I don't know why

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.130 
a strange effect and I don't know why
well<00:03:00.430> here's<00:03:00.849> an<00:03:01.000> even<00:03:01.239> more<00:03:01.390> agreeable<00:03:01.959> sort

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
well here's an even more agreeable sort

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.640 
well here's an even more agreeable sort
of<00:03:02.260> subject<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:03.010> thought<00:03:03.579> we'd<00:03:03.700> do<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.880> little

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
of subject I thought we'd do a little

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.300 
of subject I thought we'd do a little
Autoport<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:06.010> or<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.459> self-portrait<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:08.220> see<00:03:09.220> if

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
Autoport a or a self-portrait and see if

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.770 
Autoport a or a self-portrait and see if
we<00:03:09.430> can<00:03:09.610> add<00:03:09.730> some<00:03:09.910> flare<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.360> background

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
we can add some flare in the background

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.140 
we can add some flare in the background
now<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.349> lot<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.650> people<00:03:11.860> think<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.459> can't<00:03:12.790> have

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
now a lot of people think you can't have

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.970 
now a lot of people think you can't have
a<00:03:13.360> light<00:03:13.599> directly<00:03:14.049> into<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.410> lens<00:03:14.530> well

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
a light directly into the lens well

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.390 
a light directly into the lens well
here's<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.489> proof<00:03:15.670> you<00:03:15.910> can<00:03:16.799> now<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.859> most

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
here's the proof you can now the most

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.920 
here's the proof you can now the most
important<00:03:18.880> thing<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.150> course<00:03:19.389> is<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.660> know<00:03:19.870> to

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
important thing of course is to know to

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.740 
important thing of course is to know to
control<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.970> now<00:03:21.970> with<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.209> type<00:03:22.450> of<00:03:22.480> light

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
control it now with this type of light

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.020 
control it now with this type of light
you<00:03:23.200> have<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.380> be<00:03:23.530> very<00:03:23.680> careful<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.760> see

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
you have to be very careful you see

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.390 
you have to be very careful you see
virtually<00:03:25.900> every<00:03:26.290> fault<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:27.010> see<00:03:27.190> every

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
virtually every fault you see every

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.930 
virtually every fault you see every
little<00:03:27.670> hair<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:29.170> it's<00:03:29.319> not<00:03:29.470> really<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.790> light

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
little hair so it's not really the light

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:50.220 
little hair so it's not really the light
to<00:03:31.120> use<00:03:31.299> with<00:03:31.889> elegant<00:03:32.889> sort<00:03:33.069> of<00:03:33.130> lady

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:58.230 

but<00:03:51.430> it's<00:03:52.430> got<00:03:52.580> no<00:03:52.990> no<00:03:53.990> diffusion<00:03:54.860> on<00:03:54.950> the

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.680 

table<00:04:02.410> that's<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:04.180> reflection<00:04:05.180> in<00:04:05.540> the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
table that's it a reflection in the

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
table that's it a reflection in the
front<00:04:06.340> just<00:04:07.340> reflecting<00:04:08.080> we<00:04:09.080> have<00:04:09.230> obviously

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
front just reflecting we have obviously

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.930

our<00:04:09.890> flash<00:04:10.250> in<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.520> back<00:04:12.370> swing<00:04:13.370> key<00:04:13.640> chair

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
our flash in the back swing key chair

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.360 
our flash in the back swing key chair
and<00:04:15.700> we<00:04:16.700> have<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:16.850> big<00:04:17.090> light<00:04:17.860> just<00:04:18.860> on<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.130> side

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
and we have a big light just on the side

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.590 
and we have a big light just on the side
which<00:04:19.730> is<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:20.180> smooth<00:04:24.460> right<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:26.120> that's<00:04:26.300> just

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
which is a smooth right so that's just

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.530

the<00:04:38.120> main<00:04:38.270> light<00:04:38.540> is<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:38.780> 400<00:04:39.440> what<00:04:39.620> of<00:04:40.010> what

the main light is a 400 what of what

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:49.090 
the main light is a 400 what of what
second<00:04:44.260> these<00:04:45.260> are<00:04:45.530> 250<00:04:46.460> what's<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.330> suit<00:04:48.100> and

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
second these are 250 what's the suit and

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.340 
second these are 250 what's the suit and
that's<00:04:49.250> about<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:49.610> half<00:04:49.880> pound<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.900> main<00:04:51.140> light

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
that's about a half pound the main light

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.240 
that's about a half pound the main light
at<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.680> back<00:04:51.890> is<00:04:52.190> on<00:04:52.340> full<00:04:52.610> power<00:04:52.850> it's<00:04:53.210> a<00:04:53.330> 250

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
at the back is on full power it's a 250

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.300 
at the back is on full power it's a 250
so<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:55.640> gives<00:04:55.820> you<00:04:55.910> an<00:04:56.000> idea<00:04:56.150> now<00:04:57.310> because

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
so that gives you an idea now because

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.040 
so that gives you an idea now because
more<00:04:58.490> work<00:04:58.670> on<00:04:58.910> anything<00:04:59.210> focus

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
more work on anything focus

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:11.380 
more work on anything focus
I<00:05:00.080> stopped<00:05:01.010> down<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.370> about<00:05:01.490> 16<00:05:02.150> so<00:05:10.270> there<00:05:11.270> are

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
I stopped down to about 16 so there are

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.900 
I stopped down to about 16 so there are
some<00:05:11.570> ways<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.960> provoking<00:05:12.380> Flair<00:05:12.890> that's<00:05:13.730> for

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
some ways of provoking Flair that's for

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.780 
some ways of provoking Flair that's for
example<00:05:13.970> with<00:05:14.660> a<00:05:14.690> UV<00:05:15.140> filter<00:05:15.310> UV<00:05:16.310> filter<00:05:16.730> in

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
example with a UV filter UV filter in

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.000 
example with a UV filter UV filter in
front<00:05:17.030> of<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.240> lens<00:05:17.390> and<00:05:17.750> just<00:05:18.260> smearing<00:05:18.830> a

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
front of the lens and just smearing a

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.670 
front of the lens and just smearing a
little<00:05:19.250> Vaseline<00:05:19.430> on<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.150> or<00:05:21.140> any<00:05:21.290> greasy

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
little Vaseline on it or any greasy

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.990 
little Vaseline on it or any greasy
substance<00:05:22.070> you<00:05:23.030> can<00:05:23.180> also<00:05:23.620> join<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:25.010> light<00:05:25.370> onto

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
substance you can also join a light onto

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.770 
substance you can also join a light onto
the<00:05:26.120> lens<00:05:26.300> from<00:05:26.810> 90<00:05:27.590> degrees<00:05:27.920> so<00:05:28.160> this<00:05:28.820> avoids

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
the lens from 90 degrees so this avoids

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.650 
the lens from 90 degrees so this avoids
having<00:05:30.050> a<00:05:30.290> light<00:05:31.040> in<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.610> lens<00:05:31.790> or<00:05:32.330> in<00:05:32.540> the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
having a light in the lens or in the

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.350 
having a light in the lens or in the
shot<00:05:32.900> that<00:05:33.680> gives<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.100> a<00:05:34.310> lot<00:05:34.550> of<00:05:34.610> control<00:05:34.820> and

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
shot that gives you a lot of control and

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.870 
shot that gives you a lot of control and
it<00:05:35.720> really<00:05:36.020> requires<00:05:36.590> an<00:05:36.919> awful<00:05:37.310> lot<00:05:37.460> of<00:05:37.490> trial

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
it really requires an awful lot of trial

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.850 
it really requires an awful lot of trial
and<00:05:37.910> error<00:05:38.180> as<00:05:38.480> I<00:05:38.810> say<00:05:39.020> an<00:05:39.140> awful<00:05:39.560> lot<00:05:39.650> of<00:05:39.680> these
