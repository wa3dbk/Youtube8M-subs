00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
completely stuck into position as well

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.949 
completely stuck into position as well
you<00:02:55.310> can<00:02:55.519> move<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.819> legs<00:02:56.030> off<00:02:56.209> or<00:02:56.450> take<00:02:56.660> that

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
is what the stand looks like with the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.960 
is what the stand looks like with the
finger<00:02:59.450> off<00:02:59.599> if<00:03:00.560> we<00:03:00.829> take<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.430> fig<00:03:01.610> off<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
finger off if we take the fig off the

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.270 
finger off if we take the fig off the
standing<00:03:02.450> you'll<00:03:03.049> see<00:03:03.290> we<00:03:03.440> can<00:03:03.709> move<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.069> legs

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
standing you'll see we can move the legs

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.120 
standing you'll see we can move the legs
at<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.630> top<00:03:05.959> of<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.260> leg<00:03:06.410> there<00:03:06.620> by<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:06.829> waist

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
and the feet won't move either so we

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.500 
and the feet won't move either so we

10 omniverse Lloyd and now I will try
the<00:03:39.290> sand<00:03:39.769> box<00:03:39.980> in<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.760> Omnitrix<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.720> have<00:03:42.319> an

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
the sand box in the Omnitrix I have an

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.039 
the sand box in the Omnitrix I have an
Omnitrix<00:03:42.739> here<00:03:43.220> so<00:03:43.940> if<00:03:44.090> we<00:03:44.120> move<00:03:44.420> four<00:03:44.780> arms

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
Omnitrix here so if we move four arms

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:51.069 
Omnitrix here so if we move four arms
back<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.670> we<00:03:46.670> activate<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.510> Omnitrix<00:03:49.780> we<00:03:50.780> can

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
back and we activate the Omnitrix we can

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.569 
back and we activate the Omnitrix we can
put<00:03:51.350> this<00:03:51.799> box<00:03:52.569> inside<00:03:53.569> here<00:03:54.019> and<00:03:54.489> let's<00:03:55.489> just

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
put this box inside here and let's just

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:06.370 
put this box inside here and let's just
remind<00:03:55.970> ourselves<00:03:56.150> of<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.870> two<00:03:57.200> voices<00:04:05.380> so

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
remind ourselves of the two voices so

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.800 
remind ourselves of the two voices so
those<00:04:06.560> are<00:04:06.769> the<00:04:06.829> two<00:04:06.980> voices<00:04:07.280> so<00:04:07.730> when<00:04:08.569> I

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
those are the two voices so when I

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.680 
those are the two voices so when I
insert<00:04:09.769> this<00:04:10.040> voice<00:04:10.340> box<00:04:10.669> into<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.209> Omnitrix

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
insert this voice box into the Omnitrix

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.759 
insert this voice box into the Omnitrix
we<00:04:12.260> should<00:04:12.500> get<00:04:12.620> a<00:04:12.950> third<00:04:13.700> voice<00:04:14.620> secret<00:04:15.620> voice

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
we should get a third voice secret voice

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:22.300 
we should get a third voice secret voice
unlock<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:21.049> there<00:04:21.260> is<00:04:21.440> your<00:04:21.650> third<00:04:22.039> voice

and<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:28.000> voice<00:04:28.660> box<00:04:28.960> will<00:04:29.320> come<00:04:29.560> out<00:04:29.710> quite

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
and the voice box will come out quite

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.110 
and the voice box will come out quite
easily

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
easily

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.320 
easily
what<00:04:32.080> with<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.470> first<00:04:32.860> ones<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.730> feedback

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
what with the first ones the feedback

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.960 
what with the first ones the feedback
and<00:04:35.170> the<00:04:35.440> evil<00:04:35.830> figures<00:04:36.160> these<00:04:36.370> boxes<00:04:36.850> were

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
and the evil figures these boxes were

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.760 
and the evil figures these boxes were
very<00:04:37.300> stiff<00:04:37.630> when<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:37.870> put<00:04:38.140> them<00:04:38.260> in<00:04:38.380> there<00:04:38.560> so

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
very stiff when I put them in there so

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.600 
very stiff when I put them in there so
maybe<00:04:39.040> they<00:04:40.000> have<00:04:40.330> recognized<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:41.620> they

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
maybe they have recognized that and they
