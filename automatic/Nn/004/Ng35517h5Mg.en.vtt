okay<00:00:06.170> guys<00:00:06.380> I'm<00:00:06.770> going<00:00:07.130> to<00:00:07.190> explain<00:00:07.430> how<00:00:07.490> I

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
okay guys I'm going to explain how I

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.650 
okay guys I'm going to explain how I
talk<00:00:08.090> to<00:00:08.120> my<00:00:08.270> trunk<00:00:09.760> as<00:00:10.760> you<00:00:11.000> can<00:00:11.150> see<00:00:11.389> right

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
talk to my trunk as you can see right

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.810 
talk to my trunk as you can see right
here<00:00:14.200> what<00:00:15.200> I<00:00:15.230> did<00:00:15.350> was<00:00:15.950> there's<00:00:16.369> two<00:00:16.580> layers

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
here what I did was there's two layers

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.310 
here what I did was there's two layers
of<00:00:16.940> it<00:00:17.210> which<00:00:17.450> you<00:00:17.539> can<00:00:17.660> see<00:00:17.780> the<00:00:17.900> other<00:00:18.050> layer

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
of it which you can see the other layer

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.140 
of it which you can see the other layer
laying<00:00:18.860> up<00:00:19.039> against<00:00:19.280> the<00:00:19.400> wall<00:00:19.550> right<00:00:19.580> there

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
laying up against the wall right there

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.840 
laying up against the wall right there
I<00:00:20.350> cut<00:00:21.350> half<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:22.250> that<00:00:22.550> off<00:00:23.740> so<00:00:24.740> it<00:00:25.520> was<00:00:25.640> like

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
I cut half of that off so it was like

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.470 
I cut half of that off so it was like
about<00:00:26.000> right<00:00:26.630> here<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:27.700> I<00:00:28.700> just<00:00:28.880> cut<00:00:29.180> that

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
about right here and I just cut that

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.100 
about right here and I just cut that
whole<00:00:29.690> first<00:00:29.930> layer<00:00:30.200> off<00:00:30.440> all<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:30.800> way<00:00:30.890> across

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
whole first layer off all the way across

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.889 
whole first layer off all the way across
and<00:00:33.110> then<00:00:33.230> I<00:00:33.530> cut<00:00:33.829> a<00:00:33.860> notch<00:00:34.129> in<00:00:34.730> here<00:00:35.210> which<00:00:35.750> it

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
and then I cut a notch in here which it

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.700 
and then I cut a notch in here which it
folded<00:00:36.260> over<00:00:36.379> on<00:00:36.829> both<00:00:37.010> sides<00:00:37.340> now<00:00:38.560> so<00:00:39.560> it'd<00:00:39.680> be

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
folded over on both sides now so it'd be

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.940 
folded over on both sides now so it'd be
easier<00:00:39.800> to<00:00:40.190> fold<00:00:40.520> I<00:00:40.930> feed<00:00:41.930> it<00:00:41.960> up<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.350> top<00:00:42.590> with

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
easier to fold I feed it up the top with

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.540 
easier to fold I feed it up the top with
the<00:00:43.070> torch<00:00:44.079> which<00:00:45.079> is<00:00:45.260> why<00:00:45.440> most<00:00:45.800> that<00:00:46.280> burn

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
the torch which is why most that burn

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.150 
the torch which is why most that burn
mark<00:00:46.579> is<00:00:47.000> here<00:00:47.440> heated<00:00:48.440> up<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.650> bottom<00:00:48.980> of<00:00:49.040> the

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
mark is here heated up the bottom of the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.010 
mark is here heated up the bottom of the
torch<00:00:49.370> heated<00:00:49.700> at<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:49.880> top<00:00:50.090> again<00:00:50.480> bottom

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
torch heated at the top again bottom

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.840 
torch heated at the top again bottom
again<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.910> then<00:00:52.910> I<00:00:53.030> pushed<00:00:53.540> down<00:00:54.220> so<00:00:55.220> I<00:00:55.250> could

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
again and then I pushed down so I could

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.330 
again and then I pushed down so I could
get<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.210> touch<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:57.440> trunk<00:00:57.739> on<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:57.980> bottom

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
get it to touch the trunk on the bottom

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.530 
get it to touch the trunk on the bottom
side<00:00:58.520> and<00:01:00.250> I<00:01:01.250> kept<00:01:01.489> pushing<00:01:01.700> and<00:01:01.940> pushing<00:01:02.210> so

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
side and I kept pushing and pushing so

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.289 
side and I kept pushing and pushing so
to<00:01:02.600> make<00:01:02.809> it<00:01:02.840> really<00:01:03.320> thin<00:01:03.590> and<00:01:04.280> then<00:01:04.969> I<00:01:05.000> heated

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
to make it really thin and then I heated

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.410 
to make it really thin and then I heated
it<00:01:05.449> up<00:01:05.540> again<00:01:05.899> and<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:07.250> pounded<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.880> top<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.270> it

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
it up again and I pounded the top of it

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.930 
it up again and I pounded the top of it
with<00:01:09.140> two<00:01:09.470> hammers<00:01:09.890> like<00:01:10.070> at<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.460> same<00:01:10.670> time

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
with two hammers like at the same time

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.719 
with two hammers like at the same time
to<00:01:12.729> like<00:01:13.729> send<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.210> out<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:15.020> then<00:01:15.860> I<00:01:16.010> push<00:01:16.370> it<00:01:16.549> I

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
to like send it out and then I push it I

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.360 
to like send it out and then I push it I
heated<00:01:17.120> it<00:01:17.240> up<00:01:17.390> again<00:01:17.720> I<00:01:17.960> pushed<00:01:18.740> it<00:01:18.920> back

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
heated it up again I pushed it back

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.859 
heated it up again I pushed it back
against<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.030> bottom<00:01:20.450> side<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:22.869> then

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
against the bottom side of this and then

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.670 
against the bottom side of this and then
I<00:01:24.850> torched<00:01:25.850> all<00:01:26.180> these<00:01:27.020> holes<00:01:27.260> which<00:01:27.500> was

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
I torched all these holes which was

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.930 
I torched all these holes which was
eight<00:01:27.890> holes<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.549> it<00:01:28.670> for<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:28.970> bolts<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:30.940> put

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
eight holes in it for the bolts and put

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.410 
eight holes in it for the bolts and put
the<00:01:32.060> bolts<00:01:32.330> in<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:33.189> sucked<00:01:34.189> them<00:01:34.400> as<00:01:35.060> tight<00:01:35.299> as

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
the bolts in and sucked them as tight as

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.080 
the bolts in and sucked them as tight as
it<00:01:35.540> would<00:01:35.630> go<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:37.030> on<00:01:38.030> some<00:01:38.270> of<00:01:38.299> these<00:01:38.619> like<00:01:39.619> a

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
it would go and on some of these like a

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.880 
it would go and on some of these like a
smaller<00:01:41.090> boat<00:01:41.360> won't<00:01:41.510> fit<00:01:41.869> wouldn't<00:01:42.380> fit<00:01:42.590> glad

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
smaller boat won't fit wouldn't fit glad

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.370 
smaller boat won't fit wouldn't fit glad
to<00:01:43.010> put<00:01:43.159> a<00:01:43.220> longer<00:01:43.909> bolt<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:45.049> longer

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
to put a longer bolt and that longer

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.460 
to put a longer bolt and that longer
bolt<00:01:45.770> then<00:01:46.130> wasn't<00:01:46.549> threaded<00:01:47.090> all<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.240> way<00:01:47.470> so

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
bolt then wasn't threaded all the way so

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.980 
bolt then wasn't threaded all the way so
like<00:01:49.460> I<00:01:49.670> would<00:01:49.790> tighten<00:01:50.299> it<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.600> then<00:01:50.780> when<00:01:50.960> I

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
like I would tighten it and then when I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.890 
like I would tighten it and then when I
got<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.439> part<00:01:51.650> where<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.830> wasn't<00:01:51.950> threaded

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
got to the part where it wasn't threaded

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.810 
got to the part where it wasn't threaded
it<00:01:53.900> would<00:01:54.020> be<00:01:54.140> sucked<00:01:54.380> down<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.430> I<00:01:55.460> could

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
it would be sucked down so I could

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.550 
it would be sucked down so I could
loosen<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.450> put<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.659> smaller<00:01:56.990> bolt<00:01:57.229> in<00:01:57.380> that

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
loosen it and put a smaller bolt in that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.840 
loosen it and put a smaller bolt in that
was<00:01:57.799> threaded<00:01:58.189> all<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.310> way<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:58.729> then

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
was threaded all the way and then

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.100 
was threaded all the way and then
tighten<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.240> all<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.479> way<00:01:59.600> which<00:01:59.810> was<00:01:59.960> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
tighten it all the way which was the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.499 
tighten it all the way which was the
case<00:02:00.320> for<00:02:01.220> every<00:02:01.549> single<00:02:01.820> bolt<00:02:02.090> on<00:02:02.270> here

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
case for every single bolt on here

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.830 
case for every single bolt on here
except<00:02:02.780> for<00:02:02.960> this<00:02:03.079> one<00:02:04.299> so<00:02:05.299> all<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.720> other

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
except for this one so all the other

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.800 
except for this one so all the other
bolts<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.320> here<00:02:06.619> are<00:02:07.310> smaller<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.119> as<00:02:08.599> tight

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
bolts on here are smaller and as tight

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.770 
bolts on here are smaller and as tight
as<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.079> go<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.319> hold<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.860> trunk<00:02:10.099> down

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.890 

so<00:02:13.590> that's<00:02:13.830> how<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> did<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:15.140> then<00:02:16.140> I

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
so that's how I did that and then I

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.090 
so that's how I did that and then I
torched<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:20.340> holes<00:02:20.550> or<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.150> ready<00:02:21.330> rod<00:02:22.070> but<00:02:23.070> I

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
torched the holes or the ready rod but I

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.300 
torched the holes or the ready rod but I
didn't<00:02:23.430> put<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.090> torque<00:02:24.330> spit<00:02:25.310> well

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
didn't put it in I just torque spit well

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.680 
didn't put it in I just torque spit well
I<00:02:26.340> guess<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.670> did<00:02:26.880> put<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.270> but<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.450> didn't

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
I guess I did put it in but I didn't

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.330 
I guess I did put it in but I didn't
tighten<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.290> set<00:02:28.530> those<00:02:28.740> in<00:02:28.920> there<00:02:29.130> and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
tighten it I set those in there and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.540 
tighten it I set those in there and
those<00:02:29.459> are<00:02:29.670> welded<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.090> frame<00:02:31.250> solid<00:02:32.250> you

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
those are welded to the frame solid you

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.540 
those are welded to the frame solid you
can<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.880> here<00:02:34.490> um<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:37.830> like<00:02:38.280> those<00:02:38.430> were

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
can see here um so I like those were

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.760 
can see here um so I like those were
just<00:02:38.670> sitting<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.150> there<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:40.050> then<00:02:40.230> they<00:02:40.620> go

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
just sitting in there so then they go

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.560 
just sitting in there so then they go
good<00:02:41.070> stay<00:02:41.370> aligned<00:02:41.670> while<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.000> pound<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
good stay aligned while I pound the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.340 
good stay aligned while I pound the
trunk<00:02:42.840> down<00:02:43.490> before<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.550> pound<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.000> down<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.540> tack

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
trunk down before I pound it down I tack

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.430 
trunk down before I pound it down I tack
welded<00:02:46.800> it<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:48.420> wouldn't<00:02:48.600> see<00:02:48.720> tacks<00:02:49.050> going

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
welded it you wouldn't see tacks going

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.199 
welded it you wouldn't see tacks going
around<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.770> whole<00:02:49.950> trunk<00:02:50.250> there<00:02:50.850> all<00:02:51.030> along

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
around the whole trunk there all along

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.230 
around the whole trunk there all along
the<00:02:51.420> top<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.959> I'm<00:02:52.110> both<00:02:52.380> sides<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.920> tongue

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.520 

then<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:56.260> Lord<00:02:57.220> speaker<00:02:57.730> deck<00:02:57.910> with<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:59.110> jack

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
then I Lord speaker deck with a jack

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.870 
then I Lord speaker deck with a jack
from<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.950> car<00:03:02.950> jack<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.550> you<00:03:03.640> would<00:03:03.730> find

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
looks like this which I set the base of

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.430 
looks like this which I set the base of
that<00:03:12.490> which<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.910> that<00:03:13.060> black<00:03:13.270> thing<00:03:13.630> on<00:03:13.900> the

that which is that black thing on the
speaker<00:03:14.920> deck<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.280> then<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.400> hook<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.820> it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
speaker deck and then the hook of it

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.400 
speaker deck and then the hook of it
hooked<00:03:16.420> right<00:03:16.600> here<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.870> where<00:03:16.960> you<00:03:17.080> can<00:03:17.230> see

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
hooked right here to where you can see

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.960 
hooked right here to where you can see
it<00:03:17.530> going<00:03:17.740> up<00:03:17.920> right<00:03:18.160> there<00:03:18.400> that's<00:03:18.700> where<00:03:18.880> the

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
it going up right there that's where the

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.390 
it going up right there that's where the
hook<00:03:19.150> was<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.290> just<00:03:20.470> crank<00:03:20.680> up<00:03:20.860> on<00:03:21.070> it<00:03:21.250> and

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
hook was and you just crank up on it and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.950 
hook was and you just crank up on it and
it<00:03:21.490> lowers<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.940> speaker<00:03:22.240> deck<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.600> hires<00:03:22.810> a

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
it lowers the speaker deck and hires a

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.490 
it lowers the speaker deck and hires a
roof

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
roof

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.220 
roof
so<00:03:23.950> you're<00:03:24.070> kind<00:03:24.160> of<00:03:24.250> getting<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.550> 2<00:03:24.760> in<00:03:24.910> 1<00:03:25.230> while

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
so you're kind of getting a 2 in 1 while

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.920 
so you're kind of getting a 2 in 1 while
doing<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:27.040> then<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.700> pounded<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.210> down<00:03:28.390> so

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
doing that and then I pounded it down so

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.010 
doing that and then I pounded it down so
like<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:30.130> would<00:03:30.250> be<00:03:30.280> down<00:03:30.610> a<00:03:30.640> little<00:03:30.730> bit<00:03:31.060> see

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
like it would be down a little bit see

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.900 
like it would be down a little bit see
if<00:03:32.050> you<00:03:32.200> can<00:03:32.350> see<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.740> like<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.400> is<00:03:33.580> on<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
if you can see it like this is on the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.270 
if you can see it like this is on the
trunk<00:03:34.350> itself<00:03:35.350> it's<00:03:35.620> sitting<00:03:35.860> on<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.040> trunk

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
trunk itself it's sitting on the trunk

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.910 
trunk itself it's sitting on the trunk
right<00:03:36.430> now<00:03:36.520> and<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:38.140> can<00:03:38.290> see<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.590> dip<00:03:38.770> in

right now and you can see the dip in

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
right now and you can see the dip in
there<00:03:39.100> it's<00:03:39.940> not<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.120> very<00:03:40.360> deep<00:03:40.660> dip<00:03:41.020> but<00:03:41.940> it's

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
there it's not a very deep dip but it's

where<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.190> lights<00:04:18.400> go<00:04:20.520> so<00:04:21.520> it<00:04:21.670> was<00:04:21.820> lower<00:04:22.030> than

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
where the lights go so it was lower than

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.000 
where the lights go so it was lower than
that

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
that

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.270 
that
so<00:04:24.010> hopefully<00:04:24.660> like<00:04:25.660> hits<00:04:25.990> fold<00:04:26.500> this<00:04:26.770> on<00:04:27.100> top

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
so hopefully like hits fold this on top

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.640 
so hopefully like hits fold this on top
of<00:04:27.490> this<00:04:27.670> before<00:04:28.390> that<00:04:28.570> starts<00:04:28.930> rolling<00:04:29.200> but<00:04:29.590> I

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
of this before that starts rolling but I

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.350 
of this before that starts rolling but I
don't<00:04:29.950> that's<00:04:30.190> what<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.400> that's<00:04:30.910> going<00:04:31.300> to

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
don't that's what I that's going to

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.330 
don't that's what I that's going to
happen<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.880> then<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.150> started<00:04:34.420> creasing<00:04:34.780> it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
happen and then I started creasing it

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.710 
happen and then I started creasing it
which<00:04:36.340> I'm<00:04:36.550> not<00:04:36.700> a<00:04:36.760> very<00:04:36.970> good<00:04:37.090> creaser<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:37.660> I'm

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
which I'm not a very good creaser so I'm

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.140 
which I'm not a very good creaser so I'm
not<00:04:37.840> going<00:04:38.140> to<00:04:38.230> get<00:04:38.380> into<00:04:38.770> talking<00:04:39.760> about<00:04:39.940> how

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
not going to get into talking about how

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.850 
not going to get into talking about how
I<00:04:40.180> did<00:04:40.360> that

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
I did that

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.240 
I did that
I'll<00:04:41.860> just<00:04:42.070> show<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.280> them<00:04:43.770> that's<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.980> side

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
I'll just show you them that's the side

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.950 
I'll just show you them that's the side
it's<00:04:45.520> basically<00:04:45.910> Don<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.420> I<00:04:46.510> are<00:04:46.540> going<00:04:46.840> to

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
it's basically Don and I are going to

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.450 
it's basically Don and I are going to
crease<00:04:47.230> anymore<00:04:47.680> I'm<00:04:47.860> just<00:04:47.950> going<00:04:48.130> to<00:04:48.280> crease

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
crease anymore I'm just going to crease

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.620 
crease anymore I'm just going to crease
the<00:04:48.490> front<00:04:48.850> clip<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.620> pound<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:51.700> door<00:04:51.940> over

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
the front clip and pound the door over

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.430 
the front clip and pound the door over
that's<00:04:53.350> about<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.950> for<00:04:54.190> creasing<00:04:55.290> which<00:04:56.290> I

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
that's about it for creasing which I

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.110 
that's about it for creasing which I
think<00:04:56.650> these<00:04:56.770> impalas<00:04:57.190> are<00:04:57.490> easy<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:57.910> crease

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
think these impalas are easy to crease

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.480 
think these impalas are easy to crease
have<00:04:58.300> only<00:04:58.420> creased<00:04:58.840> three<00:04:59.410> cars<00:04:59.680> but<00:05:00.160> I<00:05:00.190> think

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
have only creased three cars but I think

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.880 
have only creased three cars but I think
the<00:05:00.850> Impala<00:05:01.150> is<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.110> easiest<00:05:02.380> car<00:05:02.590> to<00:05:02.680> crease

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
the Impala is the easiest car to crease

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.920 
the Impala is the easiest car to crease
because<00:05:03.040> they<00:05:03.340> have<00:05:03.580> these<00:05:04.090> body<00:05:04.360> lines<00:05:04.690> and

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
because they have these body lines and

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.230 
because they have these body lines and
I'm<00:05:05.520> going<00:05:06.520> to<00:05:06.580> see<00:05:06.700> if<00:05:06.760> your<00:05:06.850> on<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.030> door

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
I'm going to see if your on the door

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.119 
I'm going to see if your on the door
there's<00:05:08.169> a<00:05:08.260> body<00:05:08.440> line

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:22.209 

the<00:05:13.129> side<00:05:13.400> crease<00:05:14.210> really<00:05:14.419> well<00:05:14.689> I<00:05:14.719> think<00:05:21.219> nice

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
the side crease really well I think nice

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:26.050 
the side crease really well I think nice
and<00:05:22.249> heavy<00:05:22.610> crease<00:05:24.370> through<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.520> top<00:05:25.759> side

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
and heavy crease through the top side

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.610 
and heavy crease through the top side
right<00:05:26.300> here<00:05:26.449> so<00:05:26.689> there's<00:05:26.900> two<00:05:27.020> creases<00:05:27.289> on

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
right here so there's two creases on

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.839 
right here so there's two creases on
both<00:05:28.520> sides<00:05:28.849> of<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.120> back<00:05:29.300> end<00:05:29.509> of<00:05:29.599> the<00:05:29.689> car<00:05:33.849> so

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:34.849 
both sides of the back end of the car so

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.489 
both sides of the back end of the car so
stay<00:05:35.120> tuned<00:05:35.389> for<00:05:35.659> more<00:05:35.810> videos

00:05:36.489 --> 00:05:36.499 
stay tuned for more videos
