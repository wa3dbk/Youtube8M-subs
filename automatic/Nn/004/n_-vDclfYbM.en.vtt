we can say about this proposal is that

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.340 
we can say about this proposal is that
the<00:03:49.040> policy<00:03:49.519> would<00:03:49.730> certainly<00:03:50.239> be<00:03:50.600> good<00:03:50.959> for

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
the policy would certainly be good for

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.770 
the policy would certainly be good for
multinational<00:03:52.010> corporations<00:03:52.700> but<00:03:53.450> certainly

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
multinational corporations but certainly

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.349 
multinational corporations but certainly
may<00:03:54.109> not<00:03:54.470> be<00:03:54.739> good<00:03:54.950> for<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.609> American<00:03:55.910> worker

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
may not be good for the American worker

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.990 
may not be good for the American worker
