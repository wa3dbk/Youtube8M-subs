and<00:00:34.070> crossed<00:00:34.370> out

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:01:01.799 

don't<00:00:48.130> tighten<00:00:48.400> them<00:00:48.580> all<00:00:48.700> the<00:00:48.790> way<00:00:48.910> here

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.810 

so<00:01:02.289> our<00:01:02.440> potential<00:01:02.800> amounts<00:01:03.340> now<00:01:03.489> we<00:01:03.550> can

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
so our potential amounts now we can

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.490 
so our potential amounts now we can
actually<00:01:04.000> put<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.449> chain<00:01:04.659> on<00:01:04.690> we're<00:01:05.409> gonna

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
actually put the chain on we're gonna

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.560 
actually put the chain on we're gonna
chain<00:01:06.040> on<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.400> y-axis<00:01:06.580> I'm<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:07.210> I<00:01:07.240> was<00:01:07.360> putting

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
chain on the y-axis I'm so I was putting

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.680 
chain on the y-axis I'm so I was putting
my<00:01:07.810> bolts<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.380> this<00:01:08.530> slot<00:01:09.190> here<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.729> starting

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
my bolts to this slot here and starting

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.350 
my bolts to this slot here and starting
the<00:01:11.080> lips<00:01:11.740> wind<00:01:12.009> up<00:01:12.190> on<00:01:12.400> the<00:01:12.430> eyeballs<00:01:12.909> so<00:01:13.270> we

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
the lips wind up on the eyeballs so we

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.980 
the lips wind up on the eyeballs so we
can<00:01:13.509> still<00:01:13.750> adjust<00:01:13.840> it<00:01:14.229> back<00:01:14.440> in<00:01:15.210> get<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.240> hose

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
can still adjust it back in get a hose

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.649 
can still adjust it back in get a hose
let's<00:01:17.470> climb<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.700> hose<00:01:18.820> clamp<00:01:19.119> through<00:01:19.450> the

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
let's climb the hose clamp through the

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.960 
let's climb the hose clamp through the
chain<00:01:20.350> chain<00:01:20.860> through<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.250> eyeball<00:01:21.670> then

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
chain chain through the eyeball then

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.620 
chain chain through the eyeball then
you're<00:01:22.149> gonna<00:01:22.270> put<00:01:22.479> it<00:01:22.600> back<00:01:22.630> into<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:24.630> pack

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
you're gonna put it back into the pack

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.900 
you're gonna put it back into the pack
so<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.500> chain<00:01:27.070> one<00:01:27.340> now<00:01:32.549> we're<00:01:33.549> going<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.700> loop

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
so the chain one now we're going to loop

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.990 
so the chain one now we're going to loop
the<00:01:34.119> chain<00:01:34.509> around<00:01:35.380> these<00:01:35.740> parts<00:01:36.460> we're<00:01:36.880> gonna

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
the chain around these parts we're gonna

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.690 
the chain around these parts we're gonna
go<00:01:37.179> over<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.950> idler<00:01:38.950> sprocket<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.550> then

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
go over the idler sprocket and then

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.149 
go over the idler sprocket and then
under<00:01:41.700> okay<00:01:42.700> now<00:01:43.030> I'll<00:01:43.659> take<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:44.050> other<00:01:44.289> bolt

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
under okay now I'll take the other bolt

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.919 
under okay now I'll take the other bolt
put<00:01:45.460> that<00:01:45.550> into<00:01:45.670> this<00:01:45.880> slot<00:01:46.090> it<00:01:46.360> start<00:01:46.750> the

screw<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:30.070> can<00:02:30.190> feel<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.549> with<00:02:30.609> your<00:02:30.790> fingers

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.430 

now<00:02:37.550> let's<00:02:37.730> able<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.060> adjust<00:02:38.390> by<00:02:38.540> itself<00:02:38.840> into

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
now let's able to adjust by itself into

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.759 
now let's able to adjust by itself into
the<00:02:39.530> correct<00:02:40.099> location<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.900> then<00:02:42.110> retighten

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
the correct location and then retighten

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.960 
the correct location and then retighten
the<00:02:43.159> set<00:02:43.819> screws

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.660 

we're<00:02:50.930> going<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.170> use<00:02:51.320> a<00:02:51.650> ratchet<00:02:52.100> just<00:02:52.520> a

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
we're going to use a ratchet just a

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.130 
we're going to use a ratchet just a
little<00:02:52.910> bit<00:02:53.060> not<00:02:53.600> too<00:02:53.870> much

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
little bit not too much

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.220 
little bit not too much
I<00:02:54.350> don't<00:02:54.650> want<00:02:54.770> attention<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.250> to
