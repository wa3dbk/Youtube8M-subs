00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.810
 hello boys because of the multiple 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.150
 queries you send me by private 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.119
 about this console and its sometimes 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.949
 problematic readers I will indicate 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.410
 the steps that I follow for the correct 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.240
 Calibration of your lens a multimeter 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.330
 like this one you can buy it in any 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.920
 Electronic store or Chinese bazaar no 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.370
 we need a professional device 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.750
 Mine are not no big is 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.490
 one of those that I have cost me five 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.370
 euros and the other I think it did not even reach 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.270
 10 good before I get down to 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.519
 work 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.079
 I was warned of a detail the errors 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:40.179
 of reading and those videos that are giving 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.069
 little jumps can also be 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.780
 caused by another very common problem 

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:46.600
 found the old ones subjected to 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.519
 many hours of play some pieces 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.399
 of plastic are worn with the 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.440
 use especially in models like this one that 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.019
 they have the reader very close to the source 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.359
 of power and heat accelerates said 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.280
 wear for this reason in the 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.920
 following reviews are and I place the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.080
 reader in another position this topic what 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.690
 we will try on another occasion sometimes has 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.970
 arrangement but it depends a lot on what 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.920
 handyman and skillful that is everyone 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.070
 one last note remember that this 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.380
 console model sls cph thousand two is 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.450
 say the first European model that 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 it should equal 1001 American and 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.200
 1000 Japanese 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.310
 good, we start with the power of 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:32.259
 laser we just need to remove the six 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.630
 lower screws and then lift 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.630
 the upper case without fear comes out 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.670
 one piece and this is what we have left 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.679
 you have to dismantle anything else we're going to 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.659
 work in this area located at 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.780
 left between the source of 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.149
 feed and the reader to measure the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.429
 current power of the laser we must 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.159
 do it at the point that appears marked 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.590
 in the photograph there will go a cable of 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.869
 multimeter the other we take it to 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.729
 any mass point for example the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.369
 metal plate that covers the circuitry 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.979
 of the console but so that the measurement 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.220
 be correct, you have to do it right 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.650
 when the lens is moving 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.410
 ascending and at what point can we 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.590
 capture the lens by making said 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.200
 movement then just when it closes 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.359
 the lid of the console but of course 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.459
 cover if the console is open 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:27.520
 Well, right there where the 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.190
 arrow there is a little button 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.150
 and tells the console if the lid is 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.850
 open or closed 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.550
 you must keep it pressed during the 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.870
 measurement would not be more than someone 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.420
 He gave us a hand if it's the first time 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.030
 that you do this little thing with touching 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.010
 error the power supply think 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.870
 that the console is on and although 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.110
 he's going to kill us he can give you a scare 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.390
 good big good to mess the value that 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.210
 should give this measurement is about 11,000 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.210
 and volts or a very close value 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.540
 can be 11 with 2 11 with 4 or a little 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.180
 less in my case 10.5 if it is not like that 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.820
 turn off the console and with a small 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.480
 Precision screwdriver rotate very 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.400
 slightly no more than one millimeter 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.380
 left or right the potentiometer that 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.450
 it is marked in the image 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.030
 then repeat the measurement 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.680
 reigniting the console 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.720
 times it takes until you get a 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.720
 figure around 11,000 volts 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.189
 well let's go to the second part of this 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.890
 measurement is simpler and faster this 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.489
 is the point where we should measure equal 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.250
 that before 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.709
 We place one cable here and the other one in 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.989
 the metal sheet the console should be 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.590
 lit and the value that we should 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.049
 get is 1 with 70 volts of not being 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.670
 so it would adjust by turning this 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.340
 potentiometer that I highlight in the 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.129
 next image I turn it jce little by little 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.400
 delicately no more than one millimeter in 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.200
 every attempt and with the console turned off 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.769
 then turn on and measure the 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.769
 times that are needed 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.989
 only the final measurement that remains 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.290
 perform in the same way as the previous 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:19.130
 but with a difference you have to measure 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:22.009
 while we play an album the most 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.810
 simple is to use an audio cd so that 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.910
 the console thinks that the lid is closed 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.740
 and spin the cd 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.500
 be left button pressed 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.229
 teach before you can ask for help or 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.780
 clog such mechanism in the way that 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:39.380
 happen to you I do it covering with paper 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.419
 a stack of the aaa type and placing it 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.310
 just above the care switch 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.650
 because now to access the point of 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.900
 measurement I remind you that it is the same 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.569
 point that in the previous step there is a lot 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.789
 less space 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:54.999
 in the value that we should obtain with the 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:59.129
 console reading a cedÃ© is 180 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:05:03.069
 volts roughly something between 180 and 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:04.689
 185 would be perfect then I would have to 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.300
 go testing how each behaves 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:10.539
 console there will be some consoles that with 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.179
 about 80 volts give it all the first and 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:16.240
 others that will need I do not know one with 82 

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:18.309
 1.83 is to test if the value that 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.309
 we get is not correct the 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:23.229
 potentiometer that we should regulate is the 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:25.209
 that marked in this image not what 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.180
 confuse with step potentiometer 

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:31.149
 previous although the measurement point is 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.639
 the same the potentiometers in each step 

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:36.759
 they are different because nothing boys I hope 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.979
 that this has solved some doubts already 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.499
 you know I'm here if you need 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.129
 help do not hesitate to write until soon 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:44.129
 and play a lot
