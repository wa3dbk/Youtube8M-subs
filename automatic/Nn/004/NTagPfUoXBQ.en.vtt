really<00:01:28.510> it<00:01:29.410> is<00:01:29.530> where<00:01:29.710> my<00:01:29.860> two<00:01:29.920> role<00:01:30.340> models

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
really it is where my two role models

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.260 
really it is where my two role models
growing<00:01:31.120> up<00:01:32.050> in<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.260> game<00:01:32.640> born<00:01:33.640> in<00:01:33.790> Morocco

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
growing up in the game born in Morocco

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.910 
growing up in the game born in Morocco
growing<00:01:34.810> up<00:01:34.930> in<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.170> Congo<00:01:35.620> and<00:01:35.650> then

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
growing up in the Congo and then

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.100 
growing up in the Congo and then
Bordeaux<00:01:36.310> as<00:01:36.760> Renault's<00:01:37.210> early<00:01:37.660> years<00:01:37.930> were

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
Bordeaux as Renault's early years were

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.500 
Bordeaux as Renault's early years were
the<00:01:38.170> perfect<00:01:38.380> preparation<00:01:38.910> for<00:01:39.910> life<00:01:40.090> on<00:01:40.270> tour

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
the perfect preparation for life on tour

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.120 
the perfect preparation for life on tour
I<00:01:41.190> think<00:01:42.190> it<00:01:42.460> was

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
I think it was

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.700 
I think it was
fantastic<00:01:45.130> experience<00:01:45.640> experience

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
fantastic experience experience

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.680 
fantastic experience experience
traveling<00:01:47.710> through<00:01:48.450> almost<00:01:49.450> like<00:01:49.660> a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
traveling through almost like a

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.040 
traveling through almost like a
different<00:01:49.990> country<00:01:50.290> every<00:01:50.500> week

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
different country every week

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.420 
different country every week
so<00:01:53.050> again<00:01:53.380> experiencing<00:01:54.100> different<00:01:54.250> cultures

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
so again experiencing different cultures

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.110 
so again experiencing different cultures
different<00:01:55.180> people<00:01:55.380> languages<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:57.820> it's<00:01:58.000> a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
different people languages for so it's a

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.730 
different people languages for so it's a
unique<00:01:58.660> experience<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.230> I<00:01:59.320> think<00:01:59.530> this<00:01:59.620> is

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
unique experience and I think this is

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.250 
unique experience and I think this is
what<00:01:59.920> with<00:02:00.880> tennis<00:02:01.330> is<00:02:01.450> about<00:02:01.690> when<00:02:01.870> you<00:02:01.960> have

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
what with tennis is about when you have

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.810 
what with tennis is about when you have
a<00:02:02.290> professional<00:02:02.830> career<00:02:03.130> compared<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.670> other

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
a professional career compared to other

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.070 
a professional career compared to other
sports<00:02:04.150> where<00:02:04.390> you're<00:02:04.510> just<00:02:04.660> in<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.900> same

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
sports where you're just in the same

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.140 
sports where you're just in the same
country<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:06.130> Tennessee<00:02:06.640> give<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:07.030> the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
country of Tennessee give you the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.990

opportunity to travel the whole world so

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.210 
opportunity to travel the whole world so
this<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.540> is<00:02:10.600> really<00:02:10.930> like<00:02:11.260> was<00:02:11.830> your<00:02:12.010> job

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.440 
this this is really like was your job
and<00:02:13.170> but<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.230> feel<00:02:14.740> like<00:02:14.950> if<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:16.030> was<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.330> do<00:02:16.420> it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
and but I feel like if I was to do it

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.850 
and but I feel like if I was to do it
again<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.750> would<00:02:16.870> do<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.200> again<00:02:17.380> because<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.800> was

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
again I would do it again because it was
