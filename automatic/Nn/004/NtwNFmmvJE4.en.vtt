00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
inexplicably became a bit of a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.789 
inexplicably became a bit of a
disappointment<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.810> me<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.229> mean<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.500> not

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
disappointment for me I mean I'm not

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.830

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
expecting tons out of him but somehow I

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.210 
expecting tons out of him but somehow I
thought<00:01:40.200> he's<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> robot<00:01:40.560> mode<00:01:40.860> would<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.009> more

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
thought he's a robot mode would be more

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.770 
thought he's a robot mode would be more
fun<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.610> let's<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:42.000> over<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.420> see

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
fun so let's get over there and see

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.859 
fun so let's get over there and see
exactly<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.610> went<00:01:44.850> wrong<00:01:45.060> while

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
exactly what it is that went wrong while

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.230 
exactly what it is that went wrong while

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
like the little cyberverse one and these

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.050 
like the little cyberverse one and these
things<00:01:52.320> are<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.130> much<00:01:53.280> better<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.729> this

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
things are so much better on this

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
and then the dragon heads do that thing

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.650 
and then the dragon heads do that thing
they<00:02:19.810> do<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:22.080> yo<00:02:23.080> its<00:02:23.710> twin<00:02:24.070> strike<00:02:24.450> now<00:02:25.450> this

they do and yo its twin strike now this

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.550 
they do and yo its twin strike now this
guy<00:02:27.030> standing<00:02:28.030> still<00:02:28.390> looks<00:02:28.720> fine<00:02:28.960> he<00:02:29.290> looks<00:02:29.470> a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
out a lot of stuff that was not entirely

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.020 
out a lot of stuff that was not entirely
there<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.990> little<00:02:41.200> twin<00:02:41.410> strike<00:02:41.770> as<00:02:42.760> I

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
there on the little twin strike as I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.699 
there on the little twin strike as I
said<00:02:43.240> before<00:02:43.390> these<00:02:43.780> things<00:02:44.020> look<00:02:44.380> kind<00:02:44.590> of

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
said before these things look kind of

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.280 
said before these things look kind of
like<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:46.120> CAD<00:02:46.330> models<00:02:46.720> were<00:02:46.840> not<00:02:46.959> just

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
like the CAD models were not just

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.960 
like the CAD models were not just
upscaled<00:02:47.650> but<00:02:48.010> they<00:02:48.100> were<00:02:48.190> up<00:02:48.340> scaled<00:02:48.670> and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
upscaled but they were up scaled and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.360 
upscaled but they were up scaled and
then<00:02:49.150> cleaned<00:02:49.780> up<00:02:50.050> for<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.440> larger<00:02:50.860> size<00:02:51.070> they

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
then cleaned up for the larger size they

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.490 
then cleaned up for the larger size they
now<00:02:51.520> occupy<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.720> think<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.110> is<00:02:53.260> what

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
now occupy and I think that is what

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.370 
now occupy and I think that is what
makes<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:54.459> concept<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.239> more<00:02:55.900> palatable

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
makes the concept of this more palatable

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.530 
makes the concept of this more palatable
we're<00:02:56.830> not<00:02:56.950> losing<00:02:57.400> out<00:02:57.820> on<00:02:58.090> potential

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.229 
and if you look at these guys
side-by-side<00:03:09.160> you<00:03:09.340> can<00:03:09.489> see<00:03:09.640> like<00:03:09.940> hey<00:03:10.090> they

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
side-by-side you can see like hey they

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.090 
side-by-side you can see like hey they

swivels they used to be on ball joints
it<00:03:23.530> meant<00:03:23.709> there<00:03:23.830> was<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.950> little<00:03:24.100> bit<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.370> play

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
it meant there was a little bit of play

can kind of mess with them a bit get

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.509 
can kind of mess with them a bit get
them<00:03:28.780> in<00:03:28.989> and<00:03:29.140> out<00:03:29.230> of<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.410> way<00:03:29.560> on<00:03:29.830> this<00:03:30.310> guy

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
them in and out of the way on this guy

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.479 
them in and out of the way on this guy
they<00:03:31.120> are<00:03:31.440> locked<00:03:32.440> in<00:03:32.709> tight<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.370> can

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
they are locked in tight and you can

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.699 
they are locked in tight and you can
only<00:03:33.580> really<00:03:33.790> move<00:03:34.000> them<00:03:34.150> like<00:03:34.360> this<00:03:34.600> or<00:03:34.959> etc

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
only really move them like this or etc

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.220 
only really move them like this or etc
etc<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:36.910> it<00:03:37.030> means<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.299> there's<00:03:37.630> only<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.900> few

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
etc so it means that there's only a few

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.960 
etc so it means that there's only a few
positions<00:03:38.739> for<00:03:38.980> them<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.190> go<00:03:39.340> into<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.730> feel

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
positions for them to go into that feel

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.539 
positions for them to go into that feel
ok<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.870> lot<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.190> positions<00:03:42.190> bring<00:03:42.400> them

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
ok and a lot of positions bring them

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.160 
ok and a lot of positions bring them
very<00:03:42.730> close<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.150> banging<00:03:43.510> into<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:43.780> arms

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
very close to banging into the arms

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.539 
very close to banging into the arms
because<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.920> pose<00:03:45.130> ability<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:45.549> this<00:03:45.700> guy<00:03:46.410> is

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
because the pose ability on this guy is

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.800 
because the pose ability on this guy is
it's<00:03:48.549> using<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.269> lot<00:03:49.299> of<00:03:49.450> transformation

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
it's using a lot of transformation

stance and kept in a solid stance but I

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.350 
stance and kept in a solid stance but I
find<00:04:18.880> he's<00:04:19.450> just<00:04:19.750> so<00:04:20.079> oddly<00:04:21.210> difficult<00:04:22.210> to

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
see this one and I don't really know why

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.680 
see this one and I don't really know why
I<00:04:28.410> think<00:04:29.040> it's<00:04:29.160> because<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:30.060> can't<00:04:30.330> really

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
I think it's because you can't really

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.290 
I think it's because you can't really
