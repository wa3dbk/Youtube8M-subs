00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.630
 the political net podcast to the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.970
 Votes from 18 may 2014 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.470
 Federal Council and parliament want new ones 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.650
 procure fighter aircraft 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.520
 today switzerland has 32 f 18 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.790
 fighter jets and 54 old f5 tiger jets 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.610
 The tiger will be retired and should 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.310
 be replaced by 22 new cribs 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.689
 The federal government wants about three billion 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 spend francs 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.850
 however, the referendum was seized 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.370
 the advocates of the new fighter planes 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.870
 argue that only with new cribs 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.150
 jets the security of switzerland 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.630
 the costs can be guaranteed 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.790
 are wearable for the army 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.650
 continue to lead the Swiss 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.810
 economy in the process of crib buying 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.280
 orders of about two and a half billion 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.440
 would receive francs 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.410
 The suppliers are obliged to do so 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.090
 the security was also a 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.340
 prerequisite for the well-being of 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.739
 population and independence 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.830
 and the neutrality of switzerland too 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.570
 protect 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.760
 Are you of the opinion that the Swiss 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.200
 army to buy new fighter aircraft 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.240
 Do you agree with yes on may 18 ? 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.920
 the opponents of the new acquisition are the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.610
 opinion that the new fighter jets too 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.560
 be expensive 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.560
 also because over the entire operating life 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.909
 cost more than 10 billion francs 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.479
 would arise 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.369
 moreover, the remaining 32 fa 18 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.659
 fighter planes air police 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.000
 requirements met 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.979
 They also argue that it still 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.200
 no copy of the desired flu 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.579
 typs give and the flier thus only on 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.159
 exist in the paper 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.380
 Nevertheless, Switzerland has 40 percent of 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.119
 pay in advance without paying 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.420
 Know if the new cribs ever 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.800
 will fly 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.300
 that was a risk for taxpayers 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.240
 Are you new to buying? 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.470
 fighter planes then lay them on 18 may 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.470
 a no in the urn 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.640
 my workout formation can be found on 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.640
