dollars each and you can put a load of
houses<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.280> quickly<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.179> therefore<00:00:09.929> these

legitimately and then when you want to
put<00:00:18.060> them<00:00:18.180> onto<00:00:18.359> perhaps<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.350> more<00:00:19.529> useful

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279

stopping other people building up so

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.000 
stopping other people building up so
that<00:00:37.230> you've<00:00:37.440> always<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:39.149> lead<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:40.010> the

that you've always got the lead in the

that you've always got the lead in the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
biggest weapon if you like in terms of

biggest weapon if you like in terms of

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the biggest cost to land on you so it's

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.209 
the biggest cost to land on you so it's
about<00:00:48.570> timing<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.440> about<00:00:49.680> trying<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.010> gain

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
about timing it's about trying to gain

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.880 
about timing it's about trying to gain
first<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.059> big<00:00:51.300> weapon<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:52.680> it's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
first with that big weapon and then it's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.389 
first with that big weapon and then it's
trying<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.760> stop<00:00:53.910> other<00:00:54.120> people<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:55.399> it's

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
trying to stop other people get in it's

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.130 
trying to stop other people get in it's
unlikely<00:00:56.940> you're<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.660> able<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.930> do

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
unlikely you're going to be able to do

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.170 
unlikely you're going to be able to do
that<00:00:58.289> alone<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> why<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.399> diplomacy

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
that alone and that is why the diplomacy

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.229 
that alone and that is why the diplomacy
and<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.359> trading<00:01:00.719> skills<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.530> paramount<00:01:02.239> but

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and the trading skills are paramount but

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.620 
and the trading skills are paramount but
walking<00:01:03.750> around<00:01:04.229> still<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.970> 50s<00:01:06.420> down

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
walking around still so the 50s down

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.510 
walking around still so the 50s down
here<00:01:06.900> easy<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.409> build<00:01:07.590> on<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> hundreds<00:01:08.280> are

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
here easy to build on the hundreds are

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.030 
here easy to build on the hundreds are
also<00:01:08.700> relatively<00:01:09.630> easy<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.200> build<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.560> now

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
also relatively easy to build on now

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.380 
also relatively easy to build on now
you'd<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.299> upper<00:01:12.869> row<00:01:13.049> here<00:01:14.210> in<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you'd think the upper row here in the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.940 
you'd think the upper row here in the
British<00:01:15.659> board<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.020> Trafalgar<00:01:16.560> Square<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
British board is Trafalgar Square the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.039 
British board is Trafalgar Square the
red<00:01:17.100> sets<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.790> Piccadilly<00:01:18.090> leading<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
red sets and Piccadilly leading the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.080 
red sets and Piccadilly leading the
yellow<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.950> one<00:01:20.100> hundred<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.460> fifty<00:01:20.939> you'd

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
yellow and one hundred and fifty you'd

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.039 
yellow and one hundred and fifty you'd
think<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.720> isn't<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.350> much<00:01:23.360> harder<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.600> get

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
think that isn't that much harder to get

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
think that isn't that much harder to get
going<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.530> put<00:01:25.740> three<00:01:26.009> houses<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.549> each<00:01:26.700> up

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
going and put three houses on each up

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.179 
going and put three houses on each up
there<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.960> really<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.650> practice

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
there but it really is in practice

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.390 
there but it really is in practice
because<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.420> game<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.560> game<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.070> inertia

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
because this game is a game of inertia

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
because this game is a game of inertia
and<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.840> try<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.880> do<00:01:35.880> enough<00:01:36.380> with

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and you have to try and do enough with

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.109 
and you have to try and do enough with
the<00:01:37.530> cheaper<00:01:38.100> side<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.030> board<00:01:39.470> to<00:01:40.640> pay<00:01:41.640> for

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the cheaper side of the board to pay for

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.230 
the cheaper side of the board to pay for
some<00:01:43.079> think<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.470> bit<00:01:43.680> more<00:01:43.860> exotic<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
some think a bit more exotic up here and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.580 
some think a bit more exotic up here and
down<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:48.799> ie<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.340> would<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:52.020> much<00:01:52.259> more

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
down here so ie I would so much more

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.959 
down here so ie I would so much more
rather<00:01:52.860> build<00:01:53.750> here<00:01:54.750> preferably<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.340> like

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
rather build here preferably here I like

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.740 
rather build here preferably here I like
it<00:01:57.149> down<00:01:57.329> here<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:58.729> try<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> avoid<00:02:00.030> these<00:02:00.420> two

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
it down here I try to avoid these two

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.410 
it down here I try to avoid these two
though<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:02.000> wasn't<00:02:03.000> aware<00:02:03.180> of

okay<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.520> stats<00:02:15.000> might<00:02:15.270> say<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.810> they've

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
okay the stats might say that they've

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.300 
okay the stats might say that they've
relatively<00:02:16.920> popular<00:02:17.460> I<00:02:18.980> don't<00:02:19.980> know<00:02:20.100> how<00:02:20.250> that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
relatively popular I don't know how that

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.130 
relatively popular I don't know how that
is<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.030> don't<00:02:21.240> know<00:02:21.450> how<00:02:21.600> that's<00:02:21.750> true

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
is it I don't know how that's true

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.070 
is it I don't know how that's true
because<00:02:22.830> in<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.640> games<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.270> I've<00:02:25.020> played

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.050 

they<00:02:28.080> rarely<00:02:28.620> win<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.430> game<00:02:29.610> they're<00:02:29.850> so

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
they rarely win the game they're so

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.780 
they rarely win the game they're so
expensive<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:31.170> put<00:02:31.320> money<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:32.640> you're

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
expensive to put money on that you're

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.910 
expensive to put money on that you're
absolutely<00:02:33.120> begging<00:02:33.750> for<00:02:33.990> people<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.440> land<00:02:34.740> on

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
absolutely begging for people to land on

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.010 
absolutely begging for people to land on
you<00:02:35.100> if<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:35.790> your<00:02:36.030> only<00:02:36.180> hope<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.810> game

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
you if that's your only hope in the game

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.940 
you if that's your only hope in the game
very<00:02:37.860> difficult<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.670> win<00:02:38.790> with<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> greens

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
very difficult to win with the greens

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.790 
very difficult to win with the greens
now<00:02:41.030> statistically<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.960> difficult<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.620> win

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
now statistically it's difficult to win

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.890 
now statistically it's difficult to win
with<00:02:44.190> these<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.180> thing<00:02:45.450> about<00:02:45.690> these

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
with these but the thing about these

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.390 
with these but the thing about these
that<00:02:46.200> offsets<00:02:46.770> them<00:02:47.070> slightly<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:49.190> again<00:02:50.190> I

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that offsets them slightly and again I

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.400 
that offsets them slightly and again I
come<00:02:50.640> back<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:53.600> chess<00:02:54.600> analogy<00:02:55.130> where

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
come back to the chess analogy where

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.060 
come back to the chess analogy where
sometimes<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:59.040> worth<00:02:59.190> gambling<00:02:59.520> and<00:03:00.530> if<00:03:01.530> you

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
sometimes it's worth gambling and if you

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.520 
sometimes it's worth gambling and if you
make<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.520> hits<00:03:02.820> it's<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.570> devastating<00:03:04.500> that

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
make the hits it's so devastating that

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.760 
make the hits it's so devastating that
they<00:03:04.890> can't<00:03:05.220> come<00:03:05.459> back<00:03:06.080> in<00:03:07.080> chess<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.470> might

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
they can't come back in chess you might

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.590 
they can't come back in chess you might
call<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.190> gamble<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.820> give<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.060> bit<00:03:09.330> away

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
call that a gamble you give a bit away

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.510 
call that a gamble you give a bit away
in<00:03:09.750> order<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.020> give<00:03:10.530> them<00:03:10.650> an<00:03:10.740> overwhelming

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
in order to give them an overwhelming

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.610 
in order to give them an overwhelming
have<00:03:11.760> an<00:03:11.850> overwhelming<00:03:12.120> attack<00:03:12.780> well<00:03:13.470> your

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
have an overwhelming attack well your

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.750 
have an overwhelming attack well your
attack<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.360> monopoly<00:03:15.830> comes<00:03:16.830> through<00:03:17.190> the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
attack in monopoly comes through the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.310 
attack in monopoly comes through the
amount<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.330> costs<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:19.380> land<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:20.100> your<00:03:20.730> property

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
amount it costs to land on your property

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.420 
amount it costs to land on your property
so<00:03:22.320> why<00:03:23.220> would<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.459> make<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.820> decision<00:03:24.420> on

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
so why would you make that decision on

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.770 
so why would you make that decision on
to<00:03:26.430> properties<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.120> trying<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.450> fish<00:03:27.600> them

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
to properties I'm trying to fish them

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.590 
to properties I'm trying to fish them
out<00:03:27.870> here<00:03:28.140> as<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.380> talk<00:03:28.670> that's<00:03:29.670> our<00:03:30.390> only

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
out here as I talk that's our only

out here as I talk that's our only
landed<00:03:31.080> on<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.260> quarter<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.010> time<00:03:32.870> well

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
landed on a quarter of the time well

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.020 
landed on a quarter of the time well
this<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.320> where<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.590> comes<00:03:34.769> down<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.250> timing<00:03:35.550> I

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
this is where it comes down to timing I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.729 
this is where it comes down to timing I
want<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.720> talk<00:03:36.900> about<00:03:37.050> timing<00:03:37.650> in

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
want to talk about timing in

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.470 
want to talk about timing in
negotiations<00:03:38.610> in<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.030> bit

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
negotiations in a bit

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.180 
negotiations in a bit
but<00:03:39.959> let's<00:03:40.110> just<00:03:40.170> have<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.470> look<00:03:40.620> at<00:03:40.800> these<00:03:40.950> for

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
but let's just have a look at these for

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.970 
but let's just have a look at these for
a<00:03:41.250> second<00:03:43.100> now<00:03:44.420> even<00:03:45.420> with<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.320> two<00:03:46.590> houses

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
a second now even with the two houses

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.860 
a second now even with the two houses
here<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:48.300> 500<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.290> 600<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.130> land<00:03:50.340> on<00:03:50.550> them

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
here it's 500 and 600 to land on them

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.949 
here it's 500 and 600 to land on them
that<00:03:51.870> would<00:03:52.050> be<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.230> total<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.800> investment<00:03:53.640> of

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
that would be a total of investment of

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.180 
that would be a total of investment of
800<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.080> do<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.440> because<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.709> houses<00:03:56.070> are

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
800 to do that because the houses are

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.390 
800 to do that because the houses are
200<00:03:56.730> each<00:03:56.910> that's<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.930> very<00:03:58.110> big<00:03:58.290> investment

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.199 

but<00:04:02.870> in<00:04:03.870> weighing<00:04:04.560> up<00:04:04.830> these<00:04:05.100> decisions<00:04:05.760> you

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
but in weighing up these decisions you

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.060 
but in weighing up these decisions you
want<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.450> have<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.600> look<00:04:06.870> at<00:04:07.019> what<00:04:07.200> is<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.500> devil

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
want to have a look at what is the devil

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.400 
want to have a look at what is the devil
how<00:04:08.250> much<00:04:08.400> devastation<00:04:09.330> can<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.870> cause<00:04:10.110> on

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
how much devastation can you cause on

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.860 
how much devastation can you cause on
that<00:04:10.590> particular<00:04:11.040> opponent<00:04:11.760> or<00:04:11.880> opponents<00:04:12.209> if

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
that particular opponent or opponents if

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.180 
that particular opponent or opponents if
they're<00:04:13.739> coming<00:04:13.980> round<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.489> your<00:04:14.640> property<00:04:16.190> so

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
they're coming round to your property so

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.190 
they're coming round to your property so
that<00:04:18.030> might<00:04:18.239> be<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.570> time<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.840> gamble<00:04:19.530> and

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
that might be the time to gamble and

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.260 
that might be the time to gamble and
that<00:04:22.200> is<00:04:22.350> usually<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.160> time<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.400> try<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:23.970> build

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
that is usually the time I try and build

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.659 
that is usually the time I try and build
in<00:04:24.870> fact<00:04:25.140> it's<00:04:25.350> usually<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.890> time<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.280> try<00:04:26.640> and

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
in fact it's usually the time I try and

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.410 
in fact it's usually the time I try and
all

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
all

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.890 
all
is<00:04:27.660> getting<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.200> set<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:29.330> need<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.510> think<00:04:30.750> about

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
is getting a set you need to think about

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.170 
is getting a set you need to think about
whose<00:04:31.230> turn<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:31.740> is<00:04:31.830> next<00:04:32.250> when<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.970> go<00:04:33.150> to

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
whose turn it is next when you you go to

late left out of that we tend to play
with<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.560> full<00:04:58.770> six<00:04:59.040> player<00:04:59.280> game<00:04:59.520> so<00:05:01.610> this

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
with the full six player game so this

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.760 
with the full six player game so this
basically<00:05:03.120> is<00:05:03.240> talking<00:05:03.480> about<00:05:03.780> four<00:05:04.500> player

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
basically is talking about four player

basically is talking about four player
upwards<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:06.090> ideas<00:05:06.510> I'm<00:05:06.660> giving<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.050> here

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
upwards the ideas I'm giving you here

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.650 
upwards the ideas I'm giving you here
you'd<00:05:08.160> probably<00:05:08.190> want<00:05:08.730> to<00:05:08.760> temper<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.240> for<00:05:09.630> a

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
you'd probably want to temper that for a

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.870 
you'd probably want to temper that for a
two<00:05:09.870> or<00:05:10.050> three<00:05:10.350> player<00:05:10.620> game<00:05:10.860> that's<00:05:11.430> outside

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
two or three player game that's outside

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.520 
two or three player game that's outside
the<00:05:11.940> scope<00:05:12.090> for<00:05:12.480> this<00:05:12.570> particular<00:05:12.870> series

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
the scope for this particular series

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.760 
the scope for this particular series
anyway<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:15.450> you'll<00:05:15.960> find<00:05:16.290> that<00:05:16.410> there's<00:05:16.650> these

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
anyway so you'll find that there's these

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.150 
anyway so you'll find that there's these
max<00:05:17.070> trades<00:05:18.110> so<00:05:19.110> if<00:05:20.030> if<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.300> can<00:05:21.450> see<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:22.470> a

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
max trades so if if you can see that a

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.240 
max trades so if if you can see that a
number<00:05:23.790> of<00:05:23.970> people<00:05:24.120> are<00:05:24.750> I'm<00:05:25.590> just<00:05:25.650> picking<00:05:26.040> on

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
number of people are I'm just picking on

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.980 
number of people are I'm just picking on
something<00:05:26.550> fairly<00:05:26.790> random<00:05:27.210> here<00:05:27.330> yes<00:05:27.750> that

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
something fairly random here yes that

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.690 
something fairly random here yes that
that's<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.320> perfect<00:05:28.740> example<00:05:28.860> down<00:05:29.370> here<00:05:29.580> with

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
that's a perfect example down here with

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.450 
that's a perfect example down here with
the<00:05:29.790> pinks<00:05:30.180> I<00:05:30.330> find<00:05:30.810> me<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:30.960> pace<00:05:31.170> before<00:05:31.470> if

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
the pinks I find me the pace before if

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.770 
the pinks I find me the pace before if
you<00:05:32.550> can<00:05:32.670> see<00:05:32.910> that<00:05:33.090> they're<00:05:33.240> coming<00:05:33.480> round

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
you can see that they're coming round

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.240 
you can see that they're coming round
and<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.260> six<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.740> eight<00:05:35.600> area<00:05:36.600> is<00:05:36.780> here<00:05:37.250> or

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
and the six to eight area is here or

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.020 
and the six to eight area is here or
even<00:05:38.490> maybe<00:05:38.640> that's<00:05:38.880> seven<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.360> eights<00:05:39.480> there

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
even maybe that's seven and eights there

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.870 
even maybe that's seven and eights there
for<00:05:42.110> more<00:05:43.110> than<00:05:43.290> one<00:05:43.440> player<00:05:43.770> you've<00:05:44.640> got

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
for more than one player you've got

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.750 
for more than one player you've got
really<00:05:45.780> great<00:05:45.930> odds<00:05:46.230> then<00:05:46.560> to<00:05:46.860> actually<00:05:47.400> get<00:05:47.730> a

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
really great odds then to actually get a

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.160 
really great odds then to actually get a
killing<00:05:48.210> in<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:50.090> perhaps<00:05:51.090> give<00:05:51.720> yourself

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
killing in and perhaps give yourself

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.150 
killing in and perhaps give yourself
enough<00:05:52.730> wiggle<00:05:53.730> room<00:05:53.940> if<00:05:54.360> you<00:05:54.540> like<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:55.560> go<00:05:55.920> for

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
enough wiggle room if you like to go for

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.270 
enough wiggle room if you like to go for
broke<00:05:56.400> and<00:05:56.670> really<00:05:57.470> punish<00:05:58.470> them<00:05:58.740> when<00:05:59.130> they

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
broke and really punish them when they

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.200 
broke and really punish them when they
land<00:05:59.520> on<00:05:59.730> there<00:06:00.770> the<00:06:01.770> standard<00:06:02.490> theory<00:06:02.940> if<00:06:03.150> you

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
land on there the standard theory if you

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.450 
land on there the standard theory if you
like<00:06:03.600> ghosts<00:06:04.200> that<00:06:04.320> you<00:06:04.500> want<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.860> get<00:06:05.010> up<00:06:05.250> to

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
like ghosts that you want to get up to

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.070 
like ghosts that you want to get up to
the<00:06:05.580> three<00:06:05.850> houses<00:06:06.150> as<00:06:06.510> quick<00:06:06.750> as<00:06:06.900> possible

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
the three houses as quick as possible

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.350 
the three houses as quick as possible
and<00:06:07.500> I<00:06:07.590> should<00:06:07.800> use<00:06:07.980> the<00:06:08.490> light<00:06:08.700> blues<00:06:09.030> as<00:06:09.270> an

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
and I should use the light blues as an

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.350 
and I should use the light blues as an
example<00:06:09.950> here<00:06:13.550> forgive<00:06:14.550> me<00:06:14.670> I'm<00:06:14.730> on<00:06:14.820> a<00:06:14.880> tripod

for<00:06:25.530> you<00:06:25.820> you<00:06:26.820> can<00:06:26.940> see<00:06:27.120> there<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.450> two<00:06:27.630> houses

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
for you you can see there the two houses

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.080 
for you you can see there the two houses
is<00:06:28.530> ninety<00:06:29.010> or<00:06:29.130> hundreds<00:06:29.580> but<00:06:29.760> the<00:06:29.850> three

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
is ninety or hundreds but the three

is ninety or hundreds but the three
houses<00:06:30.600> is<00:06:30.810> wacked<00:06:31.880> three<00:06:32.880> times<00:06:33.180> bigger<00:06:34.160> the

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
as it is between four houses in a hotel

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.689 
as it is between four houses in a hotel
so<00:06:42.259> the<00:06:42.379> standard<00:06:42.769> theory<00:06:42.979> is<00:06:43.129> you<00:06:43.249> got<00:06:43.459> two

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699 
so the standard theory is you got two

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:48.059 
so the standard theory is you got two
three<00:06:44.379> but<00:06:45.379> again<00:06:46.069> that<00:06:46.699> can<00:06:46.969> be<00:06:46.999> tempered<00:06:47.689> by

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:48.069 
three but again that can be tempered by

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:51.459 
three but again that can be tempered by
two<00:06:49.069> things<00:06:49.399> as<00:06:50.269> mentioned<00:06:50.869> before<00:06:51.199> if<00:06:51.319> you

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:51.469 
two things as mentioned before if you

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.259 
two things as mentioned before if you
think<00:06:51.709> well<00:06:52.219> if<00:06:52.279> you<00:06:52.369> can<00:06:52.489> see<00:06:52.729> that<00:06:52.909> a<00:06:52.939> load<00:06:53.149> of

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:53.269 
think well if you can see that a load of

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:54.939 
think well if you can see that a load of
people<00:06:53.539> are<00:06:53.659> coming<00:06:53.959> round<00:06:54.110> you<00:06:54.529> manage<00:06:54.799> to

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:54.949 
people are coming round you manage to

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.779 
people are coming round you manage to
negotiate<00:06:56.829> let's<00:06:57.829> say<00:06:58.099> on<00:06:58.279> the<00:06:58.369> turn<00:06:58.579> before

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
negotiate let's say on the turn before

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.689 
negotiate let's say on the turn before
your<00:06:59.239> turn<00:06:59.509> or<00:06:59.749> on<00:06:59.899> your<00:07:00.079> turn<00:07:00.409> so<00:07:01.369> that<00:07:01.399> you

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:01.699 
your turn or on your turn so that you

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.729 
your turn or on your turn so that you
have<00:07:01.849> very<00:07:02.119> little<00:07:02.329> dodging<00:07:02.929> to<00:07:03.110> do<00:07:03.259> yourself

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:03.739 
have very little dodging to do yourself

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:07.179 
have very little dodging to do yourself
before<00:07:04.399> you<00:07:04.459> can<00:07:04.639> whack<00:07:04.909> on<00:07:05.179> the<00:07:05.209> houses<00:07:06.189> then

00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:07.189 
before you can whack on the houses then

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:11.399 
before you can whack on the houses then
it<00:07:08.089> might<00:07:08.360> be<00:07:08.539> worth<00:07:08.979> going<00:07:09.979> for<00:07:10.249> broke<00:07:10.489> and

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:11.409 
it might be worth going for broke and

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.129 
it might be worth going for broke and
going<00:07:12.409> above<00:07:12.649> the<00:07:12.709> three<00:07:13.069> houses<00:07:13.809> to<00:07:14.809> really

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:15.139 
going above the three houses to really

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:18.939 
going above the three houses to really
to<00:07:15.889> really<00:07:15.999> hurt<00:07:16.999> the<00:07:17.629> other<00:07:17.779> people<00:07:18.199> who<00:07:18.349> who

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:18.949 
to really hurt the other people who who

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:23.049 
to really hurt the other people who who
may<00:07:19.219> well<00:07:19.519> have<00:07:21.369> planned<00:07:22.369> ahead<00:07:22.579> to<00:07:22.879> buy

00:07:23.049 --> 00:07:23.059 
may well have planned ahead to buy

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:25.149 
may well have planned ahead to buy
houses<00:07:23.360> themselves<00:07:23.689> and<00:07:24.319> you<00:07:24.439> will<00:07:24.559> deny<00:07:24.709> them

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:25.159 
houses themselves and you will deny them

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:26.949 
houses themselves and you will deny them
the<00:07:25.309> chance<00:07:25.579> of<00:07:25.819> doing<00:07:25.999> that<00:07:26.149> because<00:07:26.779> they'll

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:26.959 
the chance of doing that because they'll

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:29.139 
the chance of doing that because they'll
have<00:07:27.139> to<00:07:27.289> pay<00:07:27.499> for<00:07:27.800> that<00:07:27.889> out<00:07:28.489> of<00:07:28.699> the<00:07:28.879> money

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:29.149 
have to pay for that out of the money

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:32.199 
have to pay for that out of the money
they<00:07:29.329> held<00:07:29.569> back<00:07:29.659> for<00:07:30.050> that
