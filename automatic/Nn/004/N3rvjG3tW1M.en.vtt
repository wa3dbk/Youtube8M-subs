00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the 310 c e which is an American mega

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.459 
the 310 c e which is an American mega
tart<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> 30<00:00:36.270> tire<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.050> Taylor

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
tart and it's the 30 tire in the Taylor

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.500 
tart and it's the 30 tire in the Taylor
range<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:38.040> feature<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.579> expression<00:00:39.120> system

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
range to feature the expression system

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.830 
range to feature the expression system
which<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.680> transducer<00:00:41.309> inside<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.180> body<00:00:42.390> so

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
which is a transducer inside the body so

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600 
which is a transducer inside the body so
it<00:00:42.899> should<00:00:43.079> sound<00:00:43.230> very<00:00:43.350> different<00:00:43.500> I've<00:00:44.070> not

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it should sound very different I've not

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.850 
it should sound very different I've not
played<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:45.030> three<00:00:45.390> before<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
played all three before like this in a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.799 
played all three before like this in a
row<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.550> I'm<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.390> surprised<00:00:48.660> as

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
row so I'm going to be as surprised as

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.690 
row so I'm going to be as surprised as
you<00:00:48.870> are<00:00:48.989> by<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.289> results<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.280> let's<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.610> see

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.740 
you are by the results so let's just see
what<00:00:50.820> happens

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.320 

okay<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:06.540> here's<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.590> final<00:03:07.799> three<00:03:08.760> excerpts

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
okay so here's the final three excerpts

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.899 
okay so here's the final three excerpts
that<00:03:09.569> I've<00:03:09.629> just<00:03:09.780> played<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:11.099> I've<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.610> made

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
that I've just played and I've just made

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.990 
that I've just played and I've just made
them<00:03:12.090> all<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.299> same<00:03:12.510> volume<00:03:12.900> roughly<00:03:13.739> on<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
them all the same volume roughly on the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.140 
them all the same volume roughly on the
program<00:03:15.450> here<00:03:15.659> and<00:03:16.470> I'm<00:03:16.620> just<00:03:16.650> going<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.220> just

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
program here and I'm just going to just

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.350 
program here and I'm just going to just
just<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.629> it's<00:03:18.840> even<00:03:19.830> more<00:03:19.980> clear<00:03:20.310> I'm<00:03:21.180> going

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
just so it's even more clear I'm going

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.000 
just so it's even more clear I'm going
to<00:03:21.420> play<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.569> quick<00:03:21.780> section<00:03:22.140> from<00:03:22.440> each<00:03:22.620> one

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
to play a quick section from each one

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.819 
to play a quick section from each one
one<00:03:23.730> after<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.180> other<00:03:24.379> and<00:03:25.379> again<00:03:25.440> in<00:03:25.769> the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
one after the other and again in the

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:26.990 
one after the other and again in the
same<00:03:26.010> order<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.430> I'm<00:03:26.489> going<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.640> start<00:03:26.849> with<00:03:26.909> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
same order so I'm going to start with a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:45.000 
same order so I'm going to start with a
px<00:03:27.299> 700

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.360 

okay<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.060> then<00:03:46.840> this<00:03:47.080> is<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.410> tale<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.920> one

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
okay and then this is the tale of one

00:03:48.370 --> 00:04:08.890 
okay and then this is the tale of one
one<00:03:48.760> four<00:03:49.150> see

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:33.650 

okay<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.709> last<00:04:10.740> one<00:04:11.099> is<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:12.739> 3:10<00:04:13.739> c/e

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.860 

you

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.930 

I<00:04:36.930> think<00:04:37.770> it's<00:04:37.950> quite<00:04:38.070> clear<00:04:38.490> there's<00:04:38.700> quite<00:04:38.910> a

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
I think it's quite clear there's quite a

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.880 
I think it's quite clear there's quite a
big<00:04:39.060> difference<00:04:39.450> between<00:04:39.570> each<00:04:40.080> one

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
big difference between each one

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.190 
big difference between each one
I<00:04:40.920> think<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.550> apx<00:04:41.910> 700<00:04:42.510> holds<00:04:42.780> its<00:04:42.930> aren't

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
I think the apx 700 holds its aren't

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.810 
I think the apx 700 holds its aren't
very<00:04:43.350> very<00:04:43.650> well<00:04:43.980> considering<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.610> price

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
very very well considering the price

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.820 
very very well considering the price
point<00:04:45.120> in<00:04:45.240> time<00:04:45.450> a<00:04:45.720> couple<00:04:46.140> of<00:04:46.320> hundred<00:04:46.470> pound

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
point in time a couple of hundred pound

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.040 
point in time a couple of hundred pound
cheaper<00:04:47.310> than<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.700> tail<00:04:48.390> in<00:04:48.690> which<00:04:48.870> you've

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
cheaper than the tail in which you've

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.170 
cheaper than the tail in which you've
got<00:04:49.230> a<00:04:49.290> definite<00:04:49.740> clarity<00:04:50.370> but<00:04:51.030> it's

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
got a definite clarity but it's

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.620 
got a definite clarity but it's
definitely<00:04:51.660> a<00:04:51.690> brighter<00:04:52.170> sound<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:53.610> may<00:04:53.940> well

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
definitely a brighter sound you may well

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.060 
definitely a brighter sound you may well
prefer<00:04:55.140> the<00:04:55.680> mellower<00:04:56.160> sound<00:04:56.250> of<00:04:56.670> the<00:04:56.820> Yamaha

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
prefer the mellower sound of the Yamaha

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.410 
prefer the mellower sound of the Yamaha
obviously<00:04:59.070> you<00:04:59.280> go<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.730> 3:10<00:05:00.240> and

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
obviously you go to the 3:10 and

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.810 
obviously you go to the 3:10 and
Easter's<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.260> tone<00:05:01.560> thing<00:05:01.920> entirely<00:05:02.340> sound

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
Easter's the tone thing entirely sound

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.750 
Easter's the tone thing entirely sound
completely<00:05:04.070> completely<00:05:05.070> different<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:05.640> the

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
completely completely different to the

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.900 
completely completely different to the
previous<00:05:06.240> two<00:05:06.980> it's<00:05:07.980> a<00:05:08.070> lot<00:05:08.220> warmer<00:05:08.490> it's<00:05:08.850> a

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
previous two it's a lot warmer it's a

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.780 
previous two it's a lot warmer it's a
lot<00:05:09.060> richer<00:05:09.510> it's<00:05:09.690> got<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:09.990> clarity<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:10.920> you

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
lot richer it's got the clarity so you

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.180 
lot richer it's got the clarity so you
can<00:05:11.940> definitely<00:05:12.210> start<00:05:12.780> to<00:05:12.960> see<00:05:13.230> where<00:05:13.950> your

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
can definitely start to see where your

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.570 
can definitely start to see where your
money's<00:05:14.460> going<00:05:14.570> with<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:16.410> 310<00:05:16.980> and<00:05:17.220> obviously

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
money's going with the 310 and obviously

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.110 
money's going with the 310 and obviously
with<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:17.910> higher-end<00:05:18.600> tailors
