00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.740
 eat lunch today 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.570
 one of my favorite dishes 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.860
 chicken fricassee the recipe i had 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.050
 Last year already in the recipes 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.789
 set and has now 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.010
 already got quite good ratings 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.020
 why are we doing this today is back 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.670
 a typical practical all-in-one 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.330
 court just when the thermomix 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.239
 and that's why we start right away 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:46.079
 I already prepared my vegetables 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.360
 I live fresh carrots and deep-frozen 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.880
 Of course you can pea a vegetable 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.340
 take with you what you usually want 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.370
 heard the stage pass a pig 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.530
 but i do not like asparagus or at all 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.480
 I do not like performing at all 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.899
 So if you have my recipe video of me 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.920
 wanted to cut short or be silent and you 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.290
 I would disappoint you 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.840
 probably never do it even if I do 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.789
 you still like to save but never 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.160
 shorten 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.670
 that does not fit, at least not with me 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.310
 does not matter so carrots and 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.670
 peas then the recipe I then 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.360
 enrolled 450 grams behind this time 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.920
 more with me here are just under 800 in it 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.490
 So almost twice as much and makes rice 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.860
 her after the rice into the basket 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 Well that's it for now 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.920
 so agree the price and a liter 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.570
 water over the rice so that the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.570
 leave rice nice 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.880
 I want to travel then again through 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.340
 So why have your own ground? 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.209
 Incidentally , laid out with baking paper 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.720
 then you go down to serve 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.680
 so and now the whole 30 minutes on 1 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.680
 and then the mother 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:09.870
 just now the cooling phase his steinmann 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:12.150
 our meat aside and the rice too 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.400
 Incidentally, I have forgotten it over the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.990
 rice and of course a little salt 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.760
 do 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:25.380
 I totally forgot that now 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:31.410
 well go out now the times 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:34.280
 Hospitality and I do by the way 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.120
 the sauce twice the amount 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.430
 because I'm a little bit more this time 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.710
 So I need 80 grams of butter 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.360
 what I write you under it again 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.360
 as the concept has a simple amount 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:52.470
 the mother and the flour are with me 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:04:08.970
 Also 80 grams at the simple amount 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:11.000
 hold only for engraving that 200 degrees level 2 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:25.040
 minutes 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:27.260
 100 degree level and further I have in 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.210
 meanwhile my meat and 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.810
 made my vegetables in the bowl 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:41.900
 now 300 grams even liquid I 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:46.610
 need 600 times look it is not enough 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:49.580
 quite 570 but I put and 30 grams 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:05:00.580
 that fits 100 grams cream me 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:05:05.680
 Of course, the complete then 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.680
 lemon juice 1 teaspoon 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:18.439
 and researcher dresdner So has me 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.370
 yes this is really the best fair the 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:24.469
 it even exists 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:27.430
 the sixth ship so that just as I 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:27.430
 put two pots on it 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:45.289
 and last but not least vegetable broth 23 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:57.319
 against the brazilian baffled cube 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:06:00.400
 Take 5 and then we'll look like that 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.330
 whole is another 300 degrees pieces two 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.029
 I have to have one maybe 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.719
 It takes a bit longer because I have each one 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:07.719
 amount in it 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.259
 and then put off and set up 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.159
 let decorate 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.750
 I also like it 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:43.449
 Rochester sauce sprayed to this point 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:46.199
 incredibly cost here my way I 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:46.199

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:15.819
 which always makes me missing 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:18.339
 Do it slowly and then go 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:20.050
