00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
this so far right first off it's a spray

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.940 
this so far right first off it's a spray
and<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:39.270> spray<00:00:39.540> goes<00:00:39.780> everywhere<00:00:40.410> literally

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and the spray goes everywhere literally

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.680 
and the spray goes everywhere literally
if<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.280> wanted<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:41.910> face<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.420> would<00:00:42.540> just

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
if I wanted it on my face I would just

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.209 
if I wanted it on my face I would just
spray<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.079> my<00:00:43.230> face<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:43.980> spraying

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
spray it on my face but if I'm spraying

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.709 
spray it on my face but if I'm spraying
in<00:00:44.399> my<00:00:44.520> hair<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.760> don't<00:00:45.030> want<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.360> my<00:00:45.510> face

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
in my hair I don't want it on my face

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.979 
in my hair I don't want it on my face
I'm<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.829> that

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
I'm not into that

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.020 
I'm not into that
so<00:00:48.989> that's<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.710> first<00:00:49.920> downes<00:00:50.309> well<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:50.969> not

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
so that's the first downes well it's not

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.619 
so that's the first downes well it's not
really<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> downside<00:00:51.750> but<00:00:52.160> if<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.370> peel<00:00:53.879> this

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629

I<00:02:12.159> was<00:02:13.030> kind<00:02:13.329> of<00:02:13.390> expecting<00:02:13.629> it<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.170> do

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
I was kind of expecting it to do

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.470 
I was kind of expecting it to do
something<00:02:14.829> more<00:02:15.040> than<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:15.609> nothing

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
something more than just nothing

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.270 
something more than just nothing

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
it says disheveled looks were short and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.789 
it says disheveled looks were short and
medium<00:02:18.609> than<00:02:18.849> extreme<00:02:19.719> hold<00:02:20.019> without<00:02:20.499> the

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
medium than extreme hold without the

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.849 
medium than extreme hold without the
crunch<00:02:21.269> if<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.450> wanted<00:02:22.989> extreme<00:02:23.439> hold<00:02:23.650> there's

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
crunch if I wanted extreme hold there's

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.890 
crunch if I wanted extreme hold there's
other<00:02:24.040> stuff<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.549> would<00:02:24.670> use<00:02:24.879> like<00:02:25.629> I

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
that it's really not what I was

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.479 
that it's really not what I was

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
expecting me to it I don't really know

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.770 
expecting me to it I don't really know
why<00:02:42.639> is<00:02:42.700> expecting<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.450> be<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:43.599> was

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
why is expecting it to be I was

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.720 
why is expecting it to be I was
expecting<00:02:44.139> it<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.290> be<00:02:44.349> doing<00:02:45.129> more<00:02:45.280> than<00:02:45.340> this

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
expecting it to be doing more than this

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.179 
expecting it to be doing more than this
literally<00:02:46.389> I<00:02:46.629> put<00:02:47.139> loads<00:02:47.349> in<00:02:47.560> my<00:02:47.680> hair<00:02:47.919> I

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189 
literally I put loads in my hair I

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.009 
literally I put loads in my hair I
worked<00:02:48.489> in<00:02:48.790> when<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.060> was<00:02:49.209> working<00:02:49.599> in<00:02:49.719> I<00:02:49.840> felt

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
worked in when I was working in I felt

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.629 
worked in when I was working in I felt
like<00:02:50.199> I<00:02:50.290> was<00:02:50.379> working<00:02:50.500> out<00:02:50.919> and<00:02:51.099> because<00:02:51.459> it's

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
like I was working out and because it's

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.360 
like I was working out and because it's
a<00:02:51.730> spray<00:02:52.030> it<00:02:52.750> goes<00:02:52.900> everywhere<00:02:53.379> so<00:02:53.949> like<00:02:54.159> half

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
a spray it goes everywhere so like half

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.069 
a spray it goes everywhere so like half
of<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.609> doesn't<00:02:54.790> even<00:02:54.939> go<00:02:55.180> on<00:02:55.359> your<00:02:55.599> hair<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:58.079> at

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
of it doesn't even go on your hair so at

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.720 
of it doesn't even go on your hair so at
the<00:02:59.230> moment<00:02:59.379> I<00:02:59.650> wouldn't<00:02:59.859> recommend<00:03:00.159> this<00:03:00.489> to

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
the moment I wouldn't recommend this to

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.530 
the moment I wouldn't recommend this to
be<00:03:00.819> honest<00:03:01.150> because<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:03.519> really<00:03:04.180> done

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
be honest because it's not really done

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.709 
be honest because it's not really done
much<00:03:04.859> so<00:03:07.319> this<00:03:08.319> was<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.709> first<00:03:08.919> impression<00:03:09.719> so

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
much so this was the first impression so

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.470 
much so this was the first impression so
I<00:03:11.319> might<00:03:11.919> like<00:03:12.219> it<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.579> might<00:03:12.730> begin<00:03:12.939> to<00:03:13.269> like<00:03:13.449> it

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
I might like it I might begin to like it

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.640 
I might like it I might begin to like it
but<00:03:14.290> at<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> moment<00:03:15.120> yeah<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.389> might<00:03:16.989> do

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
but at the moment yeah I might do

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.879 
but at the moment yeah I might do
another<00:03:18.310> video<00:03:19.049> not<00:03:20.049> on<00:03:20.229> this<00:03:20.470> I'm<00:03:20.709> gonna
