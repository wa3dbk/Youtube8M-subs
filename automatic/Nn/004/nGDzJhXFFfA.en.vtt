on the sides of the glass piece here

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.760 
on the sides of the glass piece here
really<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.190> think<00:01:50.460> adds<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.119> lot<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.770> looks

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
really I think adds a lot to it looks

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.859 
really I think adds a lot to it looks
very<00:01:53.009> cool<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.759> opens<00:01:54.030> up<00:01:54.179> like<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.539> and

very cool it opens up like that and
there's<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.560> inside<00:01:55.940> you<00:01:56.940> have<00:01:56.970> a<00:01:57.119> little

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
there's the inside you have a little

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.889 
there's the inside you have a little
sticker<00:01:57.750> piece<00:01:57.959> there<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:59.250> bad

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
sticker piece there not bad

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.210 
sticker piece there not bad
all<00:02:00.899> together<00:02:01.289> I<00:02:01.410> think<00:02:01.560> there<00:02:01.860> are<00:02:01.890> 10

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.270 
all together I think there are 10
stickers<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:02.910> set<00:02:03.179> so<00:02:04.080> maybe<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.590> few<00:02:04.679> too

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280

the side you can fold them up like this

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.440 
the side you can fold them up like this

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
and of course with these you can fold

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.430 
and of course with these you can fold
these<00:02:51.220> out<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:51.730> each<00:02:52.480> one<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:52.780> these<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.200> one

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
these out and each one of these is one

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.320 
these out and each one of these is one
sticker<00:02:53.770> piece<00:02:54.070> kind<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:54.880> looks<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.120> it

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
sticker piece kind of looks like it

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.270 
sticker piece kind of looks like it
would<00:02:55.450> be<00:02:55.480> too<00:02:55.780> but<00:02:56.050> that<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.410> one<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:57.130> goes

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
would be too but that is one that goes

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.960 
would be too but that is one that goes
across<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.910> whole<00:02:57.940> piece<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.980> either<00:03:00.160> four

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
across the whole piece it's either four

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.630 
across the whole piece it's either four
of<00:03:01.180> those<00:03:02.790> there's<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.060> front<00:03:04.390> part<00:03:04.720> there

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
of those there's the front part there

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.810 
of those there's the front part there
and<00:03:06.640> it<00:03:06.970> opens<00:03:07.060> up<00:03:07.420> right<00:03:07.600> here<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:09.130> he<00:03:09.640> also

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
and it opens up right here and he also

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.890 
and it opens up right here and he also
has<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.210> stuffed<00:03:10.960> piece<00:03:11.290> down<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:11.950> front<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.280> him

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
has a stuffed piece down in front of him

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.400 
has a stuffed piece down in front of him
and<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.790> back<00:03:15.970> looks<00:03:16.420> like<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.870> would<00:03:17.050> turn

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
and the back looks like it would turn

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.670 
and the back looks like it would turn
but<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.550> doesn't<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.150> just<00:03:19.810> stays<00:03:20.020> where<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.590> is

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
but it doesn't it just stays where it is

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.740 
but it doesn't it just stays where it is
unless<00:03:21.460> you<00:03:21.640> actually<00:03:21.940> take<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.240> apart<00:03:22.480> which

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
unless you actually take it apart which

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.280 
unless you actually take it apart which
we<00:03:23.080> can<00:03:23.260> but<00:03:23.650> anyway<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:25.300> you<00:03:25.570> do<00:03:25.690> have<00:03:25.870> slick

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
we can but anyway and you do have slick

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.760 
we can but anyway and you do have slick
