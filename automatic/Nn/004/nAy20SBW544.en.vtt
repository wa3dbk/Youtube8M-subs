00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.960 
can see depending on the intensity of
the<00:05:29.980> bruise<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:31.560> you<00:05:32.560> may<00:05:33.100> need<00:05:33.310> to<00:05:33.460> use<00:05:33.490> more

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970

the bruise and you may need to use more
so<00:05:34.720> I've<00:05:35.110> just<00:05:35.140> used<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:36.880> little<00:05:37.810> bit<00:05:37.960> because

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
so I've just used a little bit because

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.840 
so I've just used a little bit because
it<00:05:38.560> I<00:05:38.650> didn't<00:05:38.919> put<00:05:39.100> too<00:05:39.280> much<00:05:39.400> once<00:05:39.640> it<00:05:39.760> was

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
it I didn't put too much once it was

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.790 
it I didn't put too much once it was
quite<00:05:40.030> fine<00:05:40.300> but<00:05:40.900> as<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.140> can<00:05:41.320> see<00:05:41.590> those

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
quite fine but as you can see those

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.900 
quite fine but as you can see those
 closer<00:05:43.890> you<00:05:44.890> can<00:05:45.070> see<00:05:45.430> that<00:05:45.820> that's

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
 closer you can see that that's

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.620 
 closer you can see that that's
disappeared<00:05:46.600> now<00:05:46.780> that<00:05:47.140> bruise<00:05:48.060> this<00:05:49.060> eye<00:05:49.270> and

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
disappeared now that bruise this eye and

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.780 
disappeared now that bruise this eye and
is<00:05:50.200> everything<00:05:51.070> that<00:05:51.220> was<00:05:51.340> there<00:05:51.490> it's<00:05:51.640> all

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
is everything that was there it's all

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.180 
is everything that was there it's all
gone<00:05:51.970> so<00:05:52.750> color<00:05:53.260> correction<00:05:53.770> really<00:05:54.010> works

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
gone so color correction really works

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.880 
gone so color correction really works

use it first always go to color
correction<00:05:59.260> first<00:05:59.650> and<00:05:59.950> then<00:06:00.160> use<00:06:00.630> specialist

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630
