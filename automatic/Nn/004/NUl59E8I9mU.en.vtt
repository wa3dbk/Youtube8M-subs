00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.230 

well<00:00:05.529> I<00:00:05.560> think<00:00:05.740> the<00:00:06.010> the<00:00:06.340> plan<00:00:06.550> was<00:00:06.760> really

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
well I think the the plan was really

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.910 
well I think the the plan was really
clear<00:00:07.840> you<00:00:08.170> know<00:00:08.290> we<00:00:08.440> were<00:00:08.530> going<00:00:08.710> to<00:00:08.770> go<00:00:08.889> to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
clear you know we were going to go to

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.620 
clear you know we were going to go to
Joe<00:00:09.250> McKnight<00:00:09.969> we<00:00:10.389> were<00:00:10.480> going<00:00:10.600> to<00:00:10.660> go<00:00:10.809> to

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
Joe McKnight we were going to go to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.850 
Joe McKnight we were going to go to
Stanley<00:00:13.630> Havili<00:00:13.870> and<00:00:14.410> we're<00:00:14.620> gonna<00:00:14.710> go<00:00:14.800> to

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
Stanley Havili and we're gonna go to

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.230 
Stanley Havili and we're gonna go to
Freddie<00:00:15.070> Davis<00:00:15.250> that<00:00:15.550> was<00:00:15.639> really<00:00:15.910> that<00:00:16.029> what

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
Freddie Davis that was really that what

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.670 
Freddie Davis that was really that what
we<00:00:16.330> thought<00:00:16.540> was<00:00:16.750> the<00:00:16.990> best<00:00:17.020> way<00:00:17.349> to<00:00:17.410> go<00:00:17.590> after

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
we thought was the best way to go after

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.650 
we thought was the best way to go after
these<00:00:17.920> guys<00:00:17.980> and<00:00:18.369> they<00:00:18.759> had<00:00:18.939> so<00:00:19.119> much<00:00:19.240> coverage

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
these guys and they had so much coverage

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.689 
these guys and they had so much coverage
on<00:00:19.869> the<00:00:20.140> wide<00:00:20.290> receivers<00:00:20.770> thought<00:00:21.460> we<00:00:21.550> could

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
on the wide receivers thought we could

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.519 
on the wide receivers thought we could
get<00:00:21.820> him<00:00:21.970> inside<00:00:22.090> and<00:00:22.690> work<00:00:22.840> those<00:00:23.050> guys<00:00:23.289> and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
get him inside and work those guys and

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.830 
get him inside and work those guys and
so<00:00:24.100> as<00:00:24.250> you<00:00:24.369> saw<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.609> plan<00:00:24.880> unfold<00:00:25.300> a<00:00:25.420> really

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
so as you saw the plan unfold a really

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.320 
so as you saw the plan unfold a really
good<00:00:25.990> feature<00:00:26.199> was<00:00:26.439> dancing<00:00:26.949> and<00:00:27.160> I<00:00:27.670> thought

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
good feature was dancing and I thought

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.710 
good feature was dancing and I thought
was<00:00:28.449> great<00:00:28.660> concept<00:00:29.260> by<00:00:29.350> a<00:00:30.000> Sark<00:00:31.000> and<00:00:31.269> gianni

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
was great concept by a Sark and gianni

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.930 
was great concept by a Sark and gianni
mota<00:00:31.960> to<00:00:32.320> understand<00:00:32.949> how<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.129> attack<00:00:33.730> these

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
mota to understand how to attack these

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.060 
mota to understand how to attack these
guys<00:00:34.180> and<00:00:34.629> we<00:00:34.870> really<00:00:35.199> were<00:00:35.320> wrong<00:00:35.559> and<00:00:35.890> there

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
guys and we really were wrong and there

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.010 
guys and we really were wrong and there
was<00:00:36.160> really<00:00:36.340> nothing<00:00:36.519> that<00:00:36.699> stopped<00:00:37.059> her<00:00:37.239> stop

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
was really nothing that stopped her stop

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.810 
was really nothing that stopped her stop
this<00:00:38.230> up<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:38.710> ourselves<00:00:38.829> and<00:00:39.399> a<00:00:39.460> couple<00:00:39.700> of

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
this up it ourselves and a couple of

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.910 
this up it ourselves and a couple of
mistakes<00:00:39.969> during<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.570> game<00:00:40.719> custom<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.440> couple

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
mistakes during the game custom a couple

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.440 
mistakes during the game custom a couple
plays<00:00:42.160> we<00:00:42.280> got<00:00:42.399> backed<00:00:42.610> up<00:00:42.760> in<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:42.940> sequences

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
plays we got backed up in the sequences

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.940 
plays we got backed up in the sequences
you<00:00:43.540> down<00:00:43.690> distance<00:00:44.140> the<00:00:44.230> leading<00:00:44.440> overcoming

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
you down distance the leading overcoming

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.110 
you down distance the leading overcoming
but<00:00:45.070> other<00:00:45.219> than<00:00:45.309> that<00:00:45.399> we<00:00:45.579> were<00:00:45.670> rolling<00:00:45.879> all

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
but other than that we were rolling all

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.600 
but other than that we were rolling all
day<00:00:46.300> it<00:00:46.390> was<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.570> great<00:00:46.780> day<00:00:47.280> well<00:00:48.280> this<00:00:48.430> was

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
day it was a great day well this was

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.450 
day it was a great day well this was
this<00:00:48.820> is<00:00:49.030> our<00:00:49.210> really<00:00:49.840> first<00:00:50.140> attempt<00:00:50.710> I<00:00:50.950> think

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
this is our really first attempt I think

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.340 
this is our really first attempt I think
in<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.760> new<00:00:51.940> age<00:00:52.090> of<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.420> spread<00:00:52.690> offense<00:00:52.719> to

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
in the new age of the spread offense to

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.380 
in the new age of the spread offense to
get<00:00:53.860> after<00:00:54.039> it<00:00:54.219> and<00:00:54.370> I<00:00:54.610> think<00:00:54.670> that<00:00:55.000> Nick<00:00:55.210> and

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
get after it and I think that Nick and

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.630 
get after it and I think that Nick and
the<00:00:55.480> coaches<00:00:55.899> just<00:00:56.590> just<00:00:57.129> came<00:00:57.340> up<00:00:57.489> with<00:00:57.610> a

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
the coaches just just came up with a

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.610 
the coaches just just came up with a
great<00:00:57.910> approach<00:00:58.300> in<00:00:58.629> dealing<00:00:58.690> with<00:00:59.289> it<00:00:59.469> and<00:00:59.559> we

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
great approach in dealing with it and we

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.760 
great approach in dealing with it and we
feel<00:00:59.800> like<00:00:59.829> we<00:01:00.100> we<00:01:00.699> found<00:01:00.969> a<00:01:01.120> way<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:02.140> minimize

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
feel like we we found a way to minimize

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.619 
feel like we we found a way to minimize
the<00:01:03.460> factor<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:03.969> running<00:01:04.210> quarterback

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
the factor of the running quarterback

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.900 
the factor of the running quarterback
and<00:01:04.899> obviously<00:01:05.350> at<00:01:05.619> minus<00:01:05.979> 19<00:01:06.310> yards<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:06.789> we

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
and obviously at minus 19 yards so we

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.090 
and obviously at minus 19 yards so we
got<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:07.570> job<00:01:07.600> done<00:01:07.780> I<00:01:08.170> thought<00:01:08.890> that<00:01:08.950> was

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
got the job done I thought that was

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.670 
got the job done I thought that was
enormous<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:09.939> I<00:01:10.060> think<00:01:10.420> it<00:01:10.540> really<00:01:10.810> because

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
enormous and I think it really because

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.170 
enormous and I think it really because
of<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.830> month<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.369> we<00:01:12.460> had<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:12.880> know<00:01:12.909> we<00:01:13.060> had

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
of the month that we had you know we had

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.820 
of the month that we had you know we had
a<00:01:13.210> long<00:01:13.479> time<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.750> prepare<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.290> we<00:01:14.380> just<00:01:14.590> dug

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
a long time to prepare and we just dug

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.160 
a long time to prepare and we just dug
in<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.159> kept<00:01:15.400> biting<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.630> scratching<00:01:16.720> at<00:01:17.140> the

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
in and kept biting and scratching at the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.109 
in and kept biting and scratching at the
plan<00:01:17.439> and<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:17.830> figured<00:01:18.520> out<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.850> players

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
plan and and figured out the players

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.969 
plan and and figured out the players
were<00:01:19.299> really<00:01:19.479> confident<00:01:19.960> we<00:01:20.350> just<00:01:20.680> busted

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
were really confident we just busted

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.830 
were really confident we just busted
that<00:01:21.280> one<00:01:21.580> run<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.119> know<00:01:22.210> we<00:01:22.299> made<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.479> terrible

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
that one run you know we made a terrible

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.710 
that one run you know we made a terrible

mistake and Keith mrs. that his

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.359 
mistake and Keith mrs. that his
assignment<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.320> tackle<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.740> dive<00:01:26.920> back<00:01:27.189> and

assignment of tackle and dive back and

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.800 
assignment of tackle and dive back and
he<00:01:27.430> goes<00:01:27.460> for<00:01:27.700> 80<00:01:27.939> on<00:01:28.150> this<00:01:28.330> which<00:01:28.479> was<00:01:28.630> in<00:01:28.750> the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
he goes for 80 on this which was in the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.600 
he goes for 80 on this which was in the
shame<00:01:29.049> but<00:01:29.710> other<00:01:29.890> than<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.159> you<00:01:30.490> know<00:01:30.520> I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
shame but other than that you know I

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.310 
shame but other than that you know I
thought<00:01:30.909> we<00:01:31.030> played<00:01:31.060> great<00:01:31.479> football<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:32.290> the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
thought we played great football and the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.870 
thought we played great football and the
kids<00:01:32.590> played<00:01:32.770> so<00:01:33.070> hard<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.520> we<00:01:33.579> were<00:01:33.640> able<00:01:33.729> to

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
kids played so hard and we were able to
