Verizon<00:01:23.359> I<00:01:23.539> have<00:01:23.689> CDMA<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:25.460> CDMA<00:01:26.420> LTE<00:01:26.810> which

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
Verizon I have CDMA and CDMA LTE which

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.069 
Verizon I have CDMA and CDMA LTE which
just<00:01:28.369> clarified<00:01:28.820> this<00:01:29.000> is<00:01:29.179> 3G<00:01:29.359> that's<00:01:30.880> 44<00:01:31.899> 18<00:01:32.899> T

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
just clarified this is 3G that's 44 18 T

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.669 
just clarified this is 3G that's 44 18 T
what<00:01:33.320> it<00:01:33.409> would<00:01:33.499> look<00:01:33.649> like<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:34.130> basically

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
what it would look like is basically

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:42.910 
what it would look like is basically
HSPA+<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:37.600> HSPA+<00:01:38.600> /lt<00:01:39.549> so<00:01:40.549> again<00:01:41.439> slower<00:01:42.439> 4G

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
HSPA+ and HSPA+ /lt so again slower 4G

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.389 
HSPA+ and HSPA+ /lt so again slower 4G
3G<00:01:42.950> vers<00:01:43.759> 4G<00:01:44.740> sprint<00:01:45.740> it'll<00:01:45.950> be<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.130> same

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
3G vers 4G sprint it'll be the same

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:47.260
