00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.890
 createch the hand with you and your 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.890
 creations presents creative teachers 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.480
 today we are going to do something very 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.390
 simple that you many of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.390
 you already know diagnosed and we're going 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.369
 to add that moment so add 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.469
 the one or the other that is not the moment 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.410
 we had worked with her but I 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.559
 I will explain how you can do it here 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.290
 well let's make a picture today 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.690
 what you can use is only the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.489
 can only create three boxes in 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.219
 the box according to the space they are going 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.020
 to occupy in the part today we are going to do 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.920
 one just because they have it that is very very 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.320
 simple you can apply it in de 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.820
 according to the desire of each one 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.869
 ok we are going for example to catch as 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:11.110
 always our our wood of trupÃ¡n 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.590
 or mdf we are going to use color that of being 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.030
 necessary our politicians 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.030
 and our organizing effort 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:29.480
 it can be shiny as always our 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.380
 brushes and folk but this is what if 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.090
 you want to use 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.759
 you already know that they have 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.130
 different colors different types and 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.720
 You can apply it according to the taste of 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.939
 each one very well we continue to ask 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.929
 prepared the wood as always chop it 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.649
 and put it ready to work the 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:56.259
 we can use a textured 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.990
 this user will apply it as I 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.659
 I will explain here or how can 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.959
 appreciate you here if you seek can 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.720
 put masking tape around according 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.819
 the design that you may have sought 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.530
 be a group along can be 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.500
 Vertical lines 1 or 2 according to 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.660
 taste of you 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.480
 if you have a wood that has 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.830
 fantastic metal applications but of 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.770
 otherwise they can create more with the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.900
 aluminum giving us shapes you want 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.900
 and stick a wood 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.110
 we put the most king time and we're going to 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.720
 design according to the space where 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.550
 let's texturize but if you 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.310
 they want I do not have more practice they can 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.200
 trace the drawing with pencil and then with 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.150
 a spatula and its textured start 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.269
 fill in the spaces that are going 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.610
 to work those of when covered the 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:03.760
 contour or if not very very very smoothly 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:07.269
 texturize until you create the drawing that 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.329
 you are looking for me I am going to make you a 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.909
 very personal comment I mix the 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.189
 textured with the filler because I know 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.739
 that this would suit your turn and a 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:21.819
 little bass but if you can not use 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.769
 only cars use the boy then 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.329
 that has dried completely for the 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.480
 they stepped on the masking tape they removed the 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:32.500
 masking tape and then put their acrylic 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.010
 of black color in this case I painted it 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.319
 all black when it has dried 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.880
 completely is when it starts to 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.210
 Apply 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.690
 aluminum 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:49.410
 because some conferences and some 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.640
 triangle type pieces to be able 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.980
 apply and when I finished doing everything 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.620
 this 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.680
 and I started 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.959
 ponciano in this case I trust but 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.970
 what you can not use a sponge and 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.370
 also in the same way consider 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.400
 I cook with a brush from the thick ones 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.310
 start to work it er qualifying 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.910
 doing a graduation of bs by the master 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.489
 because I was lowering the tones until 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.930
 get to almost white and again I started 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.880
 to give him quito 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.580
 when it is dried 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.400
 we are going to use a paint that can be 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.890
 metal to give floors 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.440
 for example in this red case I took my 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:40.010
 red metallic paint and I started to trust 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.350
 very very very spacious 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.080
 not necessarily followed but by giving 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.170
 a few little touches when I dry 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:53.810
 I completely start working with the 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:56.990
 child in this case I'm going to make a 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.330
 recommendation to be the legs that 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.640
 craters are also in this case the 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.770
 pages I recommend you only 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.900
 are used by adults is not 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.000
 recommended for children other than 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.350
 this has a useful protector and that's 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.360
 something that I will give them very personal 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.330
 when removing the cap and I have a lot 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.040
 careful because sometimes it splashes then 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.810
 they can stain the area where they are 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.000
 working 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.760
 and to avoid that it's better to do it in 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.710
 another site and then put line with a 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.740
 soft brush we are going to go 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.580
 trusting as you see here of the colors 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.070
 you are marshall the black the red 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.320
 then the blue and they give it the color that 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.210
 you want 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.950
 Last friends, let's catch if 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:49.220
 they like their today they fight the glue and 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:52.370
 after some lines some arabesques and 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.070
 then they stick the folio or if he does not take his 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.409
 color font and as in this case they design 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:01.629
 the color that you more resources 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.419
 for example here I will show you the pineapple 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:07.629
 we took a chair ended in this case I 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.369
 I put foil in the colors that apply 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.469
 already small that is as always there 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.849
 people that I liked colorful and 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.830
 people who like a little more 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.409
 demure this since it was criterion of 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.019
 each one as you will see friends that is a 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:24.129
 idea that you can do or follow 

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:27.129
 doing the work with us more we 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:36.459
 like when you god through 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:42.099
 see you soon believe that of the 

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:44.789
 hand with you and your master creations 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:44.789
 creative
