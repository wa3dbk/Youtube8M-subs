them that are different and they go

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.230 
them that are different and they go

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
through a bunch of the applications that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.010 
through a bunch of the applications that
are<00:01:09.360> gunk<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.799> crap<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.540> they<00:01:12.540> make

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
application and I already did we're

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.470 
application and I already did we're
going<00:01:50.940> on<00:01:51.620> so<00:01:52.620> this<00:01:53.160> application<00:01:53.940> something

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
going on so this application something

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.330 
going on so this application something
very<00:01:54.840> awesome<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.260> I<00:01:55.290> said<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.190> they

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
very awesome like I said is that they

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.370 
very awesome like I said is that they
only<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> couple<00:01:56.940> of<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.660> good<00:01:57.840> apps<00:01:58.200> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
only have a couple of really good apps a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.850 
only have a couple of really good apps a
day<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:59.820> they<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:01.110> filter<00:02:01.530> through<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
day but they they filter through that

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.190 
day but they they filter through that
clutter<00:02:02.190> but<00:02:02.790> something<00:02:03.420> else<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.720> can<00:02:03.870> do<00:02:04.020> is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
clutter but something else you can do is

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.530 
clutter but something else you can do is
they<00:02:04.560> usually<00:02:04.920> only<00:02:04.950> be<00:02:05.610> really<00:02:06.180> only<00:02:06.300> are<00:02:06.510> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
they usually only be really only are a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.580 
they usually only be really only are a
day<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:08.850> can<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.119> back<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.360> other<00:02:09.660> days<00:02:09.930> so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
day but you can go back to other days so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.050 
day but you can go back to other days so
if<00:02:10.710> we<00:02:10.830> want<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.100> filter<00:02:11.310> through<00:02:11.460> other<00:02:11.820> days

of<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.960> time<00:02:19.140> I've<00:02:19.290> used<00:02:19.440> this<00:02:19.560> application

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
of the time I've used this application

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.740 
of the time I've used this application
all<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> icons<00:02:21.000> show<00:02:21.210> up<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.450> don't<00:02:21.510> know

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
all of the icons show up I don't know

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.200 
all of the icons show up I don't know
why<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.050> not<00:02:22.110> doing<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.640> but<00:02:23.640> here<00:02:24.000> let's

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
why it's not doing it but here let's

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.260 
why it's not doing it but here let's
just<00:02:24.360> click<00:02:24.780> on<00:02:24.930> one<00:02:25.170> day<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:26.120> just<00:02:27.120> for

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
just click on one day and just for

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.510 
just click on one day and just for
example<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.900> see<00:02:28.500> there's<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.920> bunch<00:02:29.400> of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
example like this see there's a bunch of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.750 
example like this see there's a bunch of
other<00:02:29.700> applications<00:02:30.420> like<00:02:30.600> HDR<00:02:31.170> FX<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.920> they

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
other applications like HDR FX and they

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.700 
other applications like HDR FX and they
usually<00:02:32.910> have<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.270> hot<00:02:33.600> icon<00:02:34.110> like<00:02:34.320> we<00:02:34.500> saw

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
usually have a hot icon like we saw

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.890 
usually have a hot icon like we saw
there<00:02:34.950> like<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.850> one<00:02:36.030> that's<00:02:36.210> downloaded<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
there like the one that's downloaded the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.210 
there like the one that's downloaded the
motor<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.290> one<00:02:37.530> they<00:02:37.650> want<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.040> download

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
motor the one they want you to download

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.150 
motor the one they want you to download
I<00:02:38.550> don't<00:02:38.730> know<00:02:38.820> how<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.060> works<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.420> them<00:02:40.160> but

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
I don't know how it works for them but

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.670 
I don't know how it works for them but
the<00:02:41.430> reason<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.850> came<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.420> day<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.900> because

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
the reason I came to this day is because

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.850 
the reason I came to this day is because
they<00:02:44.670> aren't<00:02:45.030> free<00:02:45.540> all<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.050> time<00:02:46.080> they<00:02:46.620> give

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
they aren't free all the time they give

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.410 
they aren't free all the time they give
you<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> deal<00:02:47.400> because<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.300> to

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
you the deal because it's going to

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.930 
you the deal because it's going to
expire<00:02:48.810> eventually<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:50.490> it's<00:02:50.610> up<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
expire eventually and it's up to the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.420 
expire eventually and it's up to the
developer<00:02:51.360> when<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.690> expires<00:02:52.080> but<00:02:52.980> see<00:02:53.190> if<00:02:53.310> I

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
developer when it expires but see if I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.490 
developer when it expires but see if I
go<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.850> one<00:02:54.060> now<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:54.420> 199<00:02:54.989> it's<00:02:55.320> not

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
go to this one now it's 199 it's not

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.979 
go to this one now it's 199 it's not
free<00:02:55.800> anymore<00:02:55.830> how<00:02:56.280> they<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.730> listed

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
free anymore how they have it listed

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.510 
free anymore how they have it listed
same<00:02:57.989> as<00:02:58.260> all<00:02:58.470> these<00:02:58.680> other<00:02:58.860> applications

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
same as all these other applications

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.250 
same as all these other applications
that's<00:02:59.670> what<00:02:59.820> has<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.120> expired<00:03:00.750> tag<00:03:01.080> on

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.770 
that's what has that expired tag on
there<00:03:01.640> but<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.060> another<00:03:03.450> quick

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
there but this is just another quick

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.510 
there but this is just another quick
application<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.830> i<00:03:04.860> wanted<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.310> show<00:03:05.489> you

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
application that i wanted to show you

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.580 
application that i wanted to show you
guys<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:06.060> found<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.630> I've<00:03:07.170> used<00:03:07.380> for

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
guys that I found and I've used for

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.670 
guys that I found and I've used for
quite<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> little<00:03:08.489> bit<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.510> tend<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.320> like<00:03:10.410> it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
quite a little bit and I tend to like it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.320 
quite a little bit and I tend to like it
just<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.130> said<00:03:11.370> because<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.000> quality

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
just like I said because of the quality

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.930 
just like I said because of the quality
and<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:13.080> really<00:03:13.320> does<00:03:13.590> show<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.160> good<00:03:14.520> quality

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
and it really does show you good quality

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.860 
and it really does show you good quality
applications<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:17.370> that's<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.360> sums<00:03:18.690> up

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
applications and that's that sums up

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.440 
applications and that's that sums up
