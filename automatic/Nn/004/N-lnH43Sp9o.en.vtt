very nearly I've become more and more
obsessed<00:03:39.040> with<00:03:39.160> football<00:03:39.459> as<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:41.230> years<00:03:41.500> have

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.420 
obsessed with football as the years have
gone<00:03:41.739> by<00:03:42.360> my<00:03:43.360> cousins<00:03:43.959> they've<00:03:44.380> got<00:03:44.680> children

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
gone by my cousins they've got children

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.580 
gone by my cousins they've got children
and<00:03:45.670> their<00:03:46.330> children<00:03:46.780> who<00:03:46.959> are<00:03:47.080> coming<00:03:47.319> along

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
and their children who are coming along

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.620 
and their children who are coming along
but<00:03:48.099> of<00:03:48.220> course<00:03:48.400> they<00:03:48.580> don't<00:03:48.790> come<00:03:49.150> quite<00:03:49.360> as

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
but of course they don't come quite as

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.270 
but of course they don't come quite as
