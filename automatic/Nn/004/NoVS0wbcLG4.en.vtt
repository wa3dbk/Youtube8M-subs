feels brilliant and it just plays really

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090 
feels brilliant and it just plays really
well<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.570> pretty<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.439> would<00:01:07.650> say<00:01:07.799> it's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
well and it's pretty I would say it's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.429 
well and it's pretty I would say it's
exactly<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:08.670> they<00:01:08.790> were<00:01:08.850> aiming<00:01:09.119> for

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
exactly what they were aiming for

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.960 
exactly what they were aiming for
genuinely<00:01:10.439> feels<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.920> runescape<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
genuinely feels like runescape but the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.640 
genuinely feels like runescape but the
map<00:01:12.090> alone<00:01:12.420> isn't<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:12.990> makes<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.409> server

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
map alone isn't what makes this server

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.920 
map alone isn't what makes this server
brilliant<00:01:14.100> there's<00:01:14.310> also<00:01:14.549> PvP<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.780> walk

the<00:01:19.409> PvP<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.950> surprisingly<00:01:20.430> tactical<00:01:21.060> there's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the PvP is surprisingly tactical there's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.969 
the PvP is surprisingly tactical there's
simple<00:01:21.840> elements<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.350> they've<00:01:22.500> put<00:01:22.770> into

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
simple elements that they've put into

simple elements that they've put into
the<00:01:23.100> arena<00:01:23.340> or<00:01:23.759> there's<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> few<00:01:24.600> houses

the arena or there's a few houses
there's<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.530> hills<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:26.250> basic<00:01:26.700> things

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
there's just hills just basic things

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.090 
there's just hills just basic things
that<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.450> take<00:01:27.689> control<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.200> use<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> your

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.310 
that you can take control of use to your
advantage<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.390> gives<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.810> slight

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
advantage and it just gives it a slight

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.050 
advantage and it just gives it a slight
tactical<00:01:31.799> edge<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.189> makes<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.729> really

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
tactical edge and makes it really really

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.359 
tactical edge and makes it really really
enjoyable<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.710> go<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:34.950> far<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
enjoyable and I would go as far as to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.620 
enjoyable and I would go as far as to
say<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.670> probably<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.360> most

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
say it's probably one of the most

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.990 
say it's probably one of the most
enjoyable<00:01:36.960> PvP<00:01:37.740> servers<00:01:38.130> I've<00:01:38.280> played<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.670> but

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
enjoyable PvP servers I've played on but

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.550 
enjoyable PvP servers I've played on but
to<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.150> able<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.360> compete<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> PvP<00:01:40.380> of

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.310 
to be able to compete in the PvP of
course<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.009> first<00:01:41.220> need<00:01:41.400> your<00:01:41.579> gear<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.320> how

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
course you first need your gear and how

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.870 
course you first need your gear and how
else<00:01:43.470> would<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:43.890> gear<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> mining

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
else would you get gear of the mining

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.789 
else would you get gear of the mining
resources<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.540> making<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.649> in

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
resources and making it as you would in

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
resources and making it as you would in
runescape<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> majority<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> map

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
runescape because a majority of the map

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.810 
runescape because a majority of the map
isn't<00:01:49.170> destructible<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.310> way<00:01:50.430> they've

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
isn't destructible the way they've

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.179 
isn't destructible the way they've

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
implemented skilling in terms of like

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.700 
implemented skilling in terms of like
mining<00:01:53.700> resources<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.659> chopping<00:01:55.560> down<00:01:55.649> trees

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
mining resources and chopping down trees

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.350 
mining resources and chopping down trees
and<00:01:56.040> stuff<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.579> very<00:01:56.850> very<00:01:57.090> very

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
and stuff like that is very very very

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.300 
and stuff like that is very very very
good<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.869> go<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> where<00:01:58.530> you'd<00:01:58.680> expect<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
good if you go to where you'd expect to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.039 
good if you go to where you'd expect to
be<00:01:59.340> able<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> mine<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.060> runescape<00:02:00.240> say<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
be able to mine in runescape say the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.109 
be able to mine in runescape say the
Varick<00:02:01.350> east<00:02:01.649> mine<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.700> will<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:02.880> resources

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
Varick east mine there will be resources

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.880 
Varick east mine there will be resources
that<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.810> mine<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.680> mine

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that you can mine that so you can mine

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.010 
that you can mine that so you can mine
them<00:02:05.040> away<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.729> resources<00:02:06.090> respawn<00:02:06.689> after<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
them away the resources respawn after a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.020 
them away the resources respawn after a
certain<00:02:07.200> amount<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.590> time<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.520> there's<00:02:08.819> enough

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
certain amount of time so there's enough

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.880 
certain amount of time so there's enough
for<00:02:09.179> everyone<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.629> get<00:02:09.869> their<00:02:10.020> gear<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.470> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
for everyone to get their gear and it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.380 
for everyone to get their gear and it
works<00:02:11.099> pretty<00:02:11.400> much<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.209> does<00:02:12.360> in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
works pretty much just like it does in

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.900 
works pretty much just like it does in
runes

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
runes

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.880 
runes
you<00:02:13.540> can<00:02:13.660> also<00:02:13.780> chop<00:02:14.080> down<00:02:14.230> trees<00:02:14.350> pretty<00:02:14.710> much

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
you can also chop down trees pretty much

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.890 
you can also chop down trees pretty much
anywhere<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:15.520> they<00:02:15.940> will<00:02:16.120> respawn<00:02:16.450> as<00:02:16.720> well

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
anywhere and they will respawn as well

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.860 
anywhere and they will respawn as well
as<00:02:17.710> with<00:02:17.920> gathering<00:02:18.280> resources<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.240> furnaces

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
as with gathering resources to furnaces

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.480 
as with gathering resources to furnaces
you<00:02:20.230> will<00:02:20.350> have<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.590> make<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> trip<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.160> where

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
you will have to make a trip to where

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.860 
you will have to make a trip to where
you'd<00:02:21.610> expect<00:02:21.730> them<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.300> be<00:02:22.450> in<00:02:22.540> runescape

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
you'd expect them to be in runescape

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.660 
you'd expect them to be in runescape
this<00:02:23.470> definitely<00:02:23.800> adds<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.070> lot<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.400> server

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
this definitely adds a lot to the server

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.460 
this definitely adds a lot to the server
for<00:02:24.850> me<00:02:25.000> giving<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.450> very<00:02:25.690> very<00:02:25.840> runescape

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
for me giving it a very very runescape

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.260 
for me giving it a very very runescape
feeling<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.220> also<00:02:27.370> adds<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.700> little<00:02:27.820> value

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
feeling and it also adds a little value

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.240 
feeling and it also adds a little value
to<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.540> things<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.930> get<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.620> course<00:02:29.890> running

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
to the things you get of course running

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.520 
to the things you get of course running
around<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.580> world<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:30.910> such<00:02:31.120> an<00:02:31.270> enormous<00:02:32.050> map

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
around the world on such an enormous map

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.110 
around the world on such an enormous map
would<00:02:32.770> take<00:02:32.980> way<00:02:33.400> too<00:02:33.460> long<00:02:33.910> without

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
would take way too long without

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.510 
would take way too long without
teleports<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.350> admins<00:02:35.740> have<00:02:35.860> added<00:02:36.220> walks

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
teleports so the admins have added walks

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.190 
teleports so the admins have added walks
