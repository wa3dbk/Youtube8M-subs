00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
Columbus series is a festa you know I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.859 
Columbus series is a festa you know I
was<00:01:40.789> trying<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.090> figure<00:01:41.179> out<00:01:41.359> by<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.600> position

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
was trying to figure out by the position

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.510 
was trying to figure out by the position
of<00:01:42.079> stereo<00:01:42.409> hey<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.950> only<00:01:43.159> I<00:01:43.189> could<00:01:43.399> really

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
of stereo hey the only I could really

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.490 
of stereo hey the only I could really
see<00:01:43.609> would<00:01:43.909> be<00:01:44.060> like<00:01:44.210> series<00:01:44.780> if<00:01:45.259> that's

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
see would be like series if that's

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.620 
see would be like series if that's
series<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.609> it's<00:01:46.729> much<00:01:47.179> bigger<00:01:47.479> than

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
series and it's much bigger than

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.660 
series and it's much bigger than
advertised<00:01:48.320> it's<00:01:48.859> gotta<00:01:49.070> be<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.219> kepler<00:01:49.609> planet

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670
