building pcs it has a anti-static wrist

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.080 
building pcs it has a anti-static wrist
strap<00:03:03.920> which<00:03:04.920> i<00:03:05.099> didn't<00:03:05.370> use<00:03:05.489> on<00:03:05.609> my<00:03:05.730> old<00:03:05.880> bill

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
strap which i didn't use on my old bill

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.629 
strap which i didn't use on my old bill
but<00:03:06.389> it's<00:03:07.109> on<00:03:07.290> hits<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.889> this<00:03:07.980> bill<00:03:08.220> it's<00:03:08.459> in

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
but it's on hits in this bill it's in

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.569 
but it's on hits in this bill it's in
this<00:03:08.819> toolkit<00:03:09.540> right<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.349> i<00:03:10.650> might<00:03:11.549> as

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
this toolkit right now so i might as

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.690 
this toolkit right now so i might as
well<00:03:11.730> use<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.510> be<00:03:12.630> safe<00:03:12.900> with<00:03:13.560> my<00:03:13.829> new

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
well use it and be safe with my new

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.180 
well use it and be safe with my new
build<00:03:15.349> so<00:03:16.349> that's<00:03:16.709> that<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.940> angle<00:03:19.130> now<00:03:20.130> we

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
build so that's that this angle now we

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.610 
build so that's that this angle now we
have<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.910> motherboard<00:03:21.630> which<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.349> the<00:03:22.470> ace

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620

don't<00:04:13.900> think<00:04:13.989> you<00:04:14.349> can<00:04:14.500> focus<00:04:15.159> there<00:04:15.849> we<00:04:16.000> go<00:04:16.150> FX

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
don't think you can focus there we go FX

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.270 
don't think you can focus there we go FX
AMD<00:04:17.579> six<00:04:18.579> core<00:04:19.229> black<00:04:20.229> edition<00:04:20.530> well<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.160> don't

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
AMD six core black edition well I don't

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.890 
AMD six core black edition well I don't
even<00:04:21.459> know<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.820> score<00:04:22.270> with<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.479> black<00:04:22.660> edition

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
even know the score with a black edition

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.480 
even know the score with a black edition
but<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.560> guess<00:04:23.800> that's<00:04:23.979> good<00:04:24.130> that's<00:04:24.400> good

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
but I guess that's good that's good

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.520 
but I guess that's good that's good
because<00:04:24.789> this<00:04:25.750> car<00:04:26.050> runs<00:04:26.320> at<00:04:27.300> 3.3<00:04:28.300> let<00:04:29.289> me<00:04:29.380> see

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
because this car runs at 3.3 let me see

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.760 
because this car runs at 3.3 let me see
if<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.650> can<00:04:29.770> focus<00:04:34.139> but<00:04:35.139> if<00:04:35.199> you<00:04:35.320> guys<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:35.740> guys

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
if I can focus but if you guys you guys

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.260 
if I can focus but if you guys you guys
can<00:04:36.160> see<00:04:36.190> right<00:04:36.460> there<00:04:36.610> is<00:04:36.699> it's<00:04:36.849> three<00:04:37.060> point

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
can see right there is it's three point

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.730 
can see right there is it's three point
three<00:04:37.650> gigahertz<00:04:38.650> I'm<00:04:39.490> going<00:04:39.669> to<00:04:39.729> try<00:04:39.849> to

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
three gigahertz I'm going to try to

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.600 
three gigahertz I'm going to try to
overclock<00:04:41.740> that<00:04:41.979> too<00:04:42.130> maybe<00:04:42.550> 4<00:04:44.070> 4.1<00:04:45.070> something

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
overclock that too maybe 4 4.1 something

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.089 
overclock that too maybe 4 4.1 something
like<00:04:45.729> that<00:04:45.940> because<00:04:46.599> I<00:04:46.840> have<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.169> cooling

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
like that because I have the cooling

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.439 
like that because I have the cooling
system<00:04:48.130> right<00:04:48.580> there<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:50.110> for<00:04:50.710> my<00:04:50.800> power<00:04:51.039> I

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449
