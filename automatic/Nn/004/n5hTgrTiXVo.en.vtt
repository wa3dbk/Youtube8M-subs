00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.500
 a site to all the kids are rich 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.950
 for last typical Italy and we are here 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.919
 today with this new tournament youtube 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.169
 transfer tournament then practically 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.869
 a little youtuber a little more 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.700
 compared to the other channels he decided to 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.860
 create this tournament 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.829
 the rules can be found now in 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.080
 overlay is nothing like that 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.400
 exceptional is a beautiful tournament I must say 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.540
 because you play with the players of 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.910
 transfer in eight teams ie we are 8 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.310
 youtuber all of us, that is all 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.460
 others that you will see in the screenshots is 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.620
 we practically challenge ourselves and we are divided 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.070
 in two groups 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.400
 pass the first two of the two groups and 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.460
 then you go to play semifinals and 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.310
 finals then it is a very very tournament 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.399
 funny in my opinion because I repeat there 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.050
 are the transfer players like that I know 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.000
 you take a team and bring 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.390
 official purchases 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.720
 what to say each player has a team 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.729
 that is, each youtube has a team and a 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.490
 end is fun because there was the 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.880
