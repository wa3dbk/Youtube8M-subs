00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:09.009
 To ethically justify the human consumption of meat will gladly on the human 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.370
 Referenced dentition. 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.240
 It has to do with several fallacies because something is not automatically ethical 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.640
 right because it has always been that way because it is natural because it is a desirable one 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.830
 Result led or because one can do it. 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.850
 But it is always curious when supposedly "fangs" of the 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.680
 People are spoken and that these are proof that we eat meat 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.680
 should, may, may or must. 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.930
 With fangs, these little tips are meant here: The Dentes canini. 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.989
 These are canines which are present in almost all mammals. Of fangs one speaks 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.040
 only in some predators with a scissor bite that can only be moved up and down. 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 We can move our lower jaw sideways because we have a milling bit. 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.100
 Here's a bit of a gorilla. 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.980
 By the way, in the male the canines are more pronounced. 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.399
 It is believed that these are used for threatening gestures. 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.019
 Gorillas are herbivores. 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.830
 But before anyone argues that gorillas can sometimes eat insects and from it 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.050
 suggests that people should therefore eat cows, pigs and chickens, should be mentioned 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.720
 that the proportion is less than 0.1% of the food and that their supposed fangs 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 do not help to break insects. 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.320
 But as an example one could also cite Geladas. 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.580
 These are pure grass eaters. 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.770
 Here we have a water rotation which of course are pure herbivores. 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.550
 In those, the upper canines are prolonged to torment. 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.640
 A musk deer ... hippo ... 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.030
 Even if we were able to hunt animals with our rather pitiful canines 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.340
 or even if we were by nature pure predators or cannibals, 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.750
 This does not say anything about whether these actions are ethically correct. 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.660
 To justify his actions one can not rely on the consent of any 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.660
 Called body parts. 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.090
 We have to take responsibility for our actions - not our teeth. 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.020
 Also, it is insincere to point out the alleged fangs as justification, 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.539
 but then to use chainsaw, hatchet, knife and stove to work on meat and 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:09.539
 to crush. 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.709
 Unfortunately, the "natural" ancestor of our domesticated domestic cattle has become extinct 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.379
 because I would really like to see someone calling on his natural teeth, 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.469
 naked and without unnatural aids just by means of his fangs trying to get one 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.900
 Catch aurochs, tear and eat raw.
