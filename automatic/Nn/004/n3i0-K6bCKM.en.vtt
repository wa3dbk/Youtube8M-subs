00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
looking on to tier 2.5 gear the tier 2.5

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.800 
looking on to tier 2.5 gear the tier 2.5
gear<00:01:25.740> looks<00:01:26.490> extremely<00:01:26.880> cool<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.630> my

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
gear looks extremely cool and in my

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.780 
gear looks extremely cool and in my
opinion<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.560> some<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.340> has<00:01:29.460> some<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
opinion it is some of the it has some of

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.859 
opinion it is some of the it has some of
the<00:01:29.880> coolest<00:01:30.119> styles<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.619> game<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
the coolest styles in the game and I

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.390 
the coolest styles in the game and I
think<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.290> villain<00:01:34.590> what<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> lot<00:01:35.100> cooler

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
think the villain what is a lot cooler

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.980 
think the villain what is a lot cooler
because<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:36.060> based<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> reverse-flash

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
because it's based on the reverse-flash

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.230 
because it's based on the reverse-flash
whereas<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.979> hero<00:01:38.250> 1<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.579> based<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:39.000> Black

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
whereas the hero 1 is based on Black

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.760 
whereas the hero 1 is based on Black
Lightning<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.530> opinion<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
Lightning just my opinion and it is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
Lightning just my opinion and it is
decent<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.759> find<00:01:45.030> yourself<00:01:45.420> struggling

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
decent if you find yourself struggling

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.870 
decent if you find yourself struggling

at tier 3 content but really not

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.700

necessary for more advanced players in
the<00:01:49.799> game<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:51.000> take<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> look<00:01:51.329> at<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the game if we take a look at the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.499 
the game if we take a look at the
trinket<00:01:52.020> now<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.560> used<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.149> best

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
trinket now this used to be the best

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.289 
trinket now this used to be the best
trinket<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> game<00:01:55.619> guys<00:01:55.950> I'll<00:01:56.939> tell<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
trinket in the game guys I'll tell you

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.569 
trinket in the game guys I'll tell you
why<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.990> looks<00:01:58.469> extremely<00:01:58.860> cool<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.280> guess

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
why so it looks extremely cool I guess

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.609 
why so it looks extremely cool I guess
the<00:01:59.729> idea<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.869> kind<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.409> it's

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
the idea of it is it's kind of like it's

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.280 
the idea of it is it's kind of like it's
a<00:02:01.710> flash<00:02:02.009> ring<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.719> when<00:02:03.719> you're<00:02:03.869> using<00:02:04.079> it

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
a flash ring and when you're using it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.990 
a flash ring and when you're using it
the<00:02:04.439> ideas<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> put<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.340> flash<00:02:05.670> suit

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the ideas you put on this flash suit

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760 
the ideas you put on this flash suit
that<00:02:06.180> still<00:02:06.390> has<00:02:06.509> remnants<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> speed

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
that still has remnants of the speed

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.040 
that still has remnants of the speed
force<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.209> some<00:02:09.360> speed<00:02:09.690> forest

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
precision and might boosts and that's

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.140 
precision and might boosts and that's
kind<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.830> why<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.070> was<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.460> best<00:02:35.700> because<00:02:35.910> it

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
kind of why it was the best because it

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.430 
kind of why it was the best because it
lasted<00:02:36.600> for<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:36.930> long

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440
