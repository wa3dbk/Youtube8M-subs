00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
I have really struggled with creating a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.479 
I have really struggled with creating a
perfect<00:00:33.780> eyeliner<00:00:34.230> effect<00:00:34.739> especially<00:00:35.250> a

smoky<00:00:35.940> eye<00:00:35.969> liner<00:00:36.329> effect<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.380> takes<00:00:37.559> all

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
smoky eye liner effect so this takes all

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.430 
smoky eye liner effect so this takes all
the<00:00:37.920> guesswork<00:00:38.100> out<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.930> as<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.200> see
