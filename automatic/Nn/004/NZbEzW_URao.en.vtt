quick<00:01:15.310> but<00:01:15.460> we<00:01:15.580> could<00:01:15.700> certainly<00:01:15.820> make<00:01:16.149> some

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
quick but we could certainly make some

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.180 
quick but we could certainly make some
modifications<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.289> one<00:01:17.440> do<00:01:17.710> something<00:01:18.070> that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
modifications to one do something that

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.290 
modifications to one do something that
we<00:01:18.250> haven't<00:01:18.280> done<00:01:18.610> in<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.759> past<00:01:18.940> you<00:01:19.270> know
