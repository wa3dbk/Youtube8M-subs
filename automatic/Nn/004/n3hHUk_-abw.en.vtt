00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.589
 he is the smiling face these kind of issues because i am 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.069
 frustrated 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:13.599
 five they have to see from which this day in the match is a 3 0 lead just 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.769
 as with the field football in 0 lead 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.869
 and no I think that is the us 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.210
 roy elgin have disposed of sorry but i am unable to hear that question 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.359
 to answer 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.529
 i did this regions went so fast nivra two weeks later 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.560
 I think it is very crucial 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.890
 but let this soothe a little sleep as a team 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.340
 and not in the piece by the sea 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.590
 maybe there were too many changes with his 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.960
 that can sometimes be beneficial 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.340
 A positive choice also tweeted the rimes to play but you see what it is 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.900
 is 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.120
 in balance, I think on the other hand, it did get early anyway 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.660
 also costs when the base was such but I think every 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.030
 day may be a bit messy 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.280
 we have to 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.330
 yes I think I don't know I get this I have I cooperated by 5 0 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.380
 ahead 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.160
 the fight beforehand 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.990
 in addition the ball 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.289
 goalkeeper ralf van but this was not going to do with heart 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280
 of offense 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.470
 but the evil is actually to advance it 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.540
 Sure Sure but like me then 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.730
 if I do I come in a good chance 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.870
 and I dropped myself but don't fall naked in the brochures 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.320
 years 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.910
 that's why it's not the game image 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.910
 for the churches and then you want to show something 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.570
 But then you just don't have to make it that half that 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.750
 opponent 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.380
 weird but I think that's the problem that it's trying measured from 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.840
 Vliet are actually for the may not have such an action that are fast at six 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.970
 losing matches 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.980
 The same came for watching the special one when you were in the gallery 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.190
 yes that was for me it is very special to 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.380
 if not every day under the watchful eye of me the rvp knew both robin van persie 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.600
 but our way 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.929
 At least I thought he will get another mountain with us 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.969
 There the German band had to see the internet 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.359
 but 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:09.830
 yes i will say we 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.539
 the five were taken 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:13.579
 suspicions against quick step 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.859
 some more work needed 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.149
 one of 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:19.329
 yesterday actually 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.629
 before the match 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.140
 day two years maybe better arranged he has a restraining order or 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.069
 emmen now he has not said for himself that he should come more often 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.790
 consider the further damage great the modest your bond with him 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.060
 their boat 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.060
 sij actually i know him through a good friend of mine ricardo 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.729
 then he had asked me with chip that finds coming in england 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.869
 If we go through which the factory was they search 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.139
 and then there actually started to build a bond then I have 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.659
 yes, against the best rescued code number I made 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.089
 Last year's time would be his year it is a year after he gets a score 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.029
 van asselt 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.949
 and so started a few years just the thriller and drained three times is one 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.599
 theirs 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.890
 yes then no i start it from the past but just robin of persie but not 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.639
 not like now 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.809
 a good tire good tire
