and I noticed a lot of people struggle
here<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.649> they<00:00:34.800> think<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:35.190> completely

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
here because they think it's completely

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.139

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
precious watch and I noticed that when I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.099 
precious watch and I noticed that when I
equip<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.789> them<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.120> whoever<00:01:00.690> ends<00:01:01.020> up

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
writing the chocobo sometimes you know

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.630 
writing the chocobo sometimes you know
another<00:01:03.629> party<00:01:04.409> member<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:04.799> want<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> ride

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
another party member will want to ride

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.289 
another party member will want to ride
but<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.330> keep<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.960> with<00:01:07.049> cloud<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:08.490> equip

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but I just keep it with cloud I equip

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.670 
but I just keep it with cloud I equip
them<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.689> precious<00:01:09.960> watch<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
them with the precious watch and it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.050 
them with the precious watch and it
seems<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.659> it's<00:01:12.659> much<00:01:12.840> more<00:01:13.049> likely<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
seems like it it's much more likely that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.910 
seems like it it's much more likely that
on<00:01:15.060> your<00:01:15.240> winning<00:01:15.420> card<00:01:15.780> it'll<00:01:16.049> choose<00:01:16.530> item

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.890 

shouldn't<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.040> too<00:01:26.250> hard<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.640> win<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.689> race

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
shouldn't be too hard to win the race

00:01:27.900 --> 00:02:01.850 
shouldn't be too hard to win the race
you<00:01:28.290> know<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> decent<00:01:29.549> gold<00:01:29.939> chocobo

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.270 

in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.550> moment<00:02:02.940> of<00:02:03.000> truth

that<00:02:18.230> I'm<00:02:19.230> not<00:02:19.380> biessing<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:22.130> don't<00:02:23.130> really

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
that I'm not biessing I don't really

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.690 
that I'm not biessing I don't really
need<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:25.220> let's<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.310> here

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
need it but let's see here

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.880

materia

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.190 

there's<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.670> precious<00:02:37.090> watch<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.660> wondered

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
there's the precious watch I wondered

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.790 
there's the precious watch I wondered
why<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.410> had<00:02:38.620> zero<00:02:38.650> defense<00:02:39.640> but<00:02:40.570> there's<00:02:41.380> the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
why it had zero defense but there's the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.140 
why it had zero defense but there's the
sneak<00:02:42.040> attack<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:44.310> there's<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.400> magic<00:02:45.820> counter

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
sneak attack and there's a magic counter

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.220 
sneak attack and there's a magic counter
so<00:02:47.280> maybe<00:02:48.280> try<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.270> hopefully<00:02:49.900> it'll<00:02:50.050> work

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
so maybe try it and hopefully it'll work

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.130 
so maybe try it and hopefully it'll work
out<00:02:50.380> for<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:51.240> I'm<00:02:52.240> gonna<00:02:52.330> make<00:02:52.570> more<00:02:52.750> videos
