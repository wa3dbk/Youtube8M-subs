00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
engaging with God during the worship you

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.950 
engaging with God during the worship you
know<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.740> most<00:01:23.009> churches<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.240> scenario<00:01:24.749> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
know for most churches the scenario that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.779 
know for most churches the scenario that
I<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.289> painted<00:01:25.679> if<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.920> actually<00:01:26.069> happened

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
I just painted if that actually happened

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.669 
I just painted if that actually happened
it<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.749> somebody<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.079> switched

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
it would be like somebody just switched

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.270 
it would be like somebody just switched
on<00:01:28.889> the<00:01:29.039> light<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> question<00:01:31.319> then<00:01:31.499> is<00:01:31.530> how

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
on the light so the question then is how

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.950 
on the light so the question then is how
do<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.270> picture<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.929> just

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
do you get to that picture that I just

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
do you get to that picture that I just
painted<00:01:34.439> how<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.649> you<00:01:34.770> make<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.249> scenario<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
painted how do you make that scenario a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.929 
painted how do you make that scenario a
reality<00:01:36.749> in<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:37.109> church<00:01:37.499> worship<00:01:38.490> seminar

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
reality in your church worship seminar

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.120 
reality in your church worship seminar

with Tom Kroy de here's what others have

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.389 
with Tom Kroy de here's what others have
said<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:42.600> seminar<00:01:43.409> does<00:01:43.770> something<00:01:44.189> much

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
said this seminar does something much

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.679 
said this seminar does something much
more<00:01:44.789> than<00:01:45.090> simply<00:01:45.829> teaching<00:01:46.829> technique<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
more than simply teaching technique it

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.530 
more than simply teaching technique it
goes<00:01:48.929> back<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.799> heart<00:01:50.249> of<00:01:50.490> worship

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
goes back to the heart of worship

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.950 
goes back to the heart of worship
why<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.680> worship<00:01:53.270> something<00:01:54.270> every<00:01:54.510> Christian

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
why we worship something every Christian

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.590 
why we worship something every Christian
