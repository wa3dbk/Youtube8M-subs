00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
massive jaws calm look a question I get

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.060 
massive jaws calm look a question I get
all<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.449> time<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.960> what's<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.680> difference

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
all the time is what's the difference

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.040 
all the time is what's the difference
between<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.430> fat<00:00:20.730> burner<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.840> fat

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
between a fat burner and a fat

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.720 
between a fat burner and a fat
metabolizer<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.220> know<00:00:23.310> what<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.550> they<00:00:23.609> do

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
metabolizer you know what do they do

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.130 
metabolizer you know what do they do
what's<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.180> difference<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.630> between<00:00:24.750> them

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
what's the difference is between them

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.470 
what's the difference is between them
should<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.740> be<00:00:25.859> taking<00:00:26.039> them<00:00:26.340> together<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
should you be taking them together so to

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.700 
should you be taking them together so to
address<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.990> question<00:00:28.199> we're<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
address this question we're going to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.589 
address this question we're going to
firstly<00:00:29.070> look<00:00:29.220> at<00:00:29.340> fat<00:00:29.519> burners<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.119> exactly

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
firstly look at fat burners and exactly

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
firstly look at fat burners and exactly
what<00:00:30.869> they<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.080> we're<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> look<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.250> fat

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
what they do we're going to look at fat

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.040 
what they do we're going to look at fat
and<00:00:32.610> tabulae<00:00:32.969> tzer's<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and tabulae tzer's and what they do and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.110 
and tabulae tzer's and what they do and
importantly<00:00:35.010> what<00:00:35.520> happens<00:00:35.910> when<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
importantly what happens when you

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.569 
importantly what happens when you
combine<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.809> two<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.380> create<00:00:37.559> an<00:00:37.980> ultimate

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
combine the two to create an ultimate

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.540 
combine the two to create an ultimate
fat-burning<00:00:39.000> stat<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.230> firstly<00:00:40.770> fat<00:00:41.129> burners

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
fat-burning stat so firstly fat burners

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.340 
fat-burning stat so firstly fat burners
look<00:00:42.120> now<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.450> fat<00:00:42.660> burners<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.110> going<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
look now what fat burners are going to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.840 
look now what fat burners are going to
do<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.649> they're<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.040> increase<00:00:44.489> what<00:00:44.730> we

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
do is they're going to increase what we

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.150 
do is they're going to increase what we
call<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.570> metabolic<00:00:45.899> rate<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
call your metabolic rate which is the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.560 
call your metabolic rate which is the
amount<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> calories<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.210> you're<00:00:48.539> burning

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
amount of calories that you're burning

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.170 
amount of calories that you're burning
during<00:00:49.410> exercise<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.489> amount<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.789> calories

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
during exercise the amount of calories

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.310 
during exercise the amount of calories
that<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.449> burn<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.840> throughout<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> day

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
that you burn it throughout the day

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.319 
that you burn it throughout the day
we're<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> push<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.579> metabolic<00:00:54.149> rate

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
we're going to push this metabolic rate

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.060 
we're going to push this metabolic rate
up<00:00:54.510> which<00:00:55.170> means<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.770> amount<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
up which means you the amount of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.560 
up which means you the amount of
calories<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.699> burn<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.390> call

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
calories that you burn or what we call

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.900 
calories that you burn or what we call
your<00:00:57.690> calorie<00:00:58.140> expenditure<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:59.100> also<00:00:59.699> going

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
your calorie expenditure is also going

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.090 
your calorie expenditure is also going
to<00:01:00.030> go<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.079> your<00:01:01.199> calorie<00:01:01.500> expenditures

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
to go up so if your calorie expenditures

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.910 
to go up so if your calorie expenditures
gone<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.090> calorie<00:01:03.420> intake<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:04.199> eat

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
gone up and your calorie intake I eat

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
gone up and your calorie intake I eat
the<00:01:05.070> foods<00:01:05.309> you're<00:01:05.489> eating<00:01:05.850> stay<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> same<00:01:06.750> or

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the foods you're eating stay the same or

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
the foods you're eating stay the same or
even<00:01:07.020> decrease<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> find

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
even decrease you're going to find

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.980 
even decrease you're going to find
yourself<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.360> call<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> calorie

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
yourself in what we call a calorie

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.830 
yourself in what we call a calorie
deficit<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.189> calorie<00:01:11.520> deficit<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> where<00:01:12.720> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
deficit the calorie deficit is where you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.590 
deficit the calorie deficit is where you
start<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> experience<00:01:13.619> weight<00:01:13.979> loss<00:01:14.600> that's

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
start to experience weight loss that's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.899 
start to experience weight loss that's
what<00:01:15.780> fat<00:01:15.960> burners<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:17.159> one<00:01:17.460> thing<00:01:17.700> with

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
what fat burners do the one thing with

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.730 
what fat burners do the one thing with
fat<00:01:18.150> burners<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.840> if<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.259> was<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.500> use<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
fat burners is if I was to use the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.070 
fat burners is if I was to use the
analogy<00:01:19.950> if<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.790> light<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.210> fire<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
analogy if I was to light a fire in the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.380 
analogy if I was to light a fire in the
shelving<00:01:22.500> behind<00:01:22.920> me<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.610> fire<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.150> just

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
shelving behind me that fire is not just

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.760 
shelving behind me that fire is not just
going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.600> go<00:01:24.689> after<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.110> protein<00:01:25.560> powder

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
going to go after the protein powder

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.230 
going to go after the protein powder
it's<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.610> after<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.030> whole

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
it's going to go after the whole

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.780 
it's going to go after the whole
shelving<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.960> burn<00:01:28.170> everything<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.579> fat

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
shelving and burn everything up the fat

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
shelving and burn everything up the fat
burners<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> very<00:01:30.509> similar<00:01:30.900> thing<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.650> you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
burners do a very similar thing when you

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.039 
burners do a very similar thing when you
use<00:01:31.979> them<00:01:32.189> by<00:01:32.310> themselves<00:01:33.000> inside<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.810> body

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
use them by themselves inside your body

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.410 
use them by themselves inside your body
they<00:01:34.560> don't<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:35.159> go<00:01:35.430> after<00:01:35.820> body<00:01:36.030> fat<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
they don't just go after body fat and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.149 
they don't just go after body fat and
burn<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.079> energy<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.530> get<00:01:37.650> your<00:01:37.829> calorie

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
burn that for energy to get your calorie

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.490 
burn that for energy to get your calorie
expenditure<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.939> they<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.570> after<00:01:39.900> everything

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
expenditure up they go after everything

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
expenditure up they go after everything
so<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> go<00:01:41.460> after<00:01:41.610> muscle<00:01:42.150> tissue

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
so it's going to go after muscle tissue

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.749 
so it's going to go after muscle tissue
it's<00:01:42.840> gonna<00:01:43.049> go<00:01:43.229> after<00:01:43.380> glycogen<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.579> gonna

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it's gonna go after glycogen it's gonna

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.280

genetically store body fat can take that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.770 
genetically store body fat can take that

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
body fat and transport that body fat

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.140 
body fat and transport that body fat
into<00:02:21.290> muscle<00:02:21.319> cells<00:02:21.890> into<00:02:22.550> what<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:22.819> call<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
into muscle cells into what we call the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.120 
into muscle cells into what we call the
mitochondria<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.020> your<00:02:24.230> muscle<00:02:24.560> cells<00:02:24.830> and

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
mitochondria of your muscle cells and

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.160 
mitochondria of your muscle cells and
that's<00:02:25.670> where<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.120> body<00:02:26.360> fat<00:02:26.630> gets<00:02:26.840> burnt

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
that's where that body fat gets burnt

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.620 
that's where that body fat gets burnt
for<00:02:27.410> energy<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.580> we<00:02:28.670> go<00:02:28.760> back<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.239> analogy

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
for energy so we go back to the analogy

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.570 
for energy so we go back to the analogy
of<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.989> fire<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> shelving<00:02:31.010> behind<00:02:31.400> me

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
of the fire and the shelving behind me

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.460 
of the fire and the shelving behind me
imagine<00:02:32.390> you've<00:02:32.510> got<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:32.840> fire<00:02:33.170> right

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
imagine you've got this fire right

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.140 
imagine you've got this fire right
that's<00:02:33.620> firing<00:02:33.890> your<00:02:34.100> body<00:02:34.310> burning<00:02:34.700> up<00:02:34.970> all

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
that's firing your body burning up all

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.790 
that's firing your body burning up all
these<00:02:35.300> calories<00:02:35.630> pushing<00:02:36.350> your<00:02:36.470> calorie

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
these calories pushing your calorie

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.100 
these calories pushing your calorie
expenditure<00:02:36.950> up<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.060> then<00:02:38.660> you've<00:02:38.780> got<00:02:38.959> these

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
expenditure up and then you've got these

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.620 
expenditure up and then you've got these
these<00:02:39.350> fat<00:02:39.650> metabolizers<00:02:40.459> gone<00:02:40.640> here<00:02:40.940> take

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
these fat metabolizers gone here take

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.570 
these fat metabolizers gone here take
this<00:02:41.810> take<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:42.230> stored<00:02:42.769> body<00:02:43.010> fat<00:02:43.160> for

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
this take this stored body fat for

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.150 
this take this stored body fat for
energy<00:02:43.670> use<00:02:44.180> this<00:02:44.390> as<00:02:44.630> fuel<00:02:44.959> leave<00:02:45.530> my<00:02:45.769> muscle

energy use this as fuel leave my muscle

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.040 
energy use this as fuel leave my muscle
tissue<00:02:46.340> alone<00:02:46.790> leave<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.300> glycogen<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.229 
tissue alone leave the glycogen the
carbohydrates<00:02:48.739> alone<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.670> burn<00:02:49.880> up<00:02:50.060> as

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
carbohydrates alone and just burn up as

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.540 
carbohydrates alone and just burn up as
much<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.480> this<00:02:50.720> body<00:02:51.019> fat<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.560> want<00:02:51.800> that's

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
much of this body fat as you want that's

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.420 
much of this body fat as you want that's
the<00:02:52.819> ideal<00:02:53.300> situation<00:02:53.330> for<00:02:54.319> fat<00:02:54.500> loss<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:55.370> you

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
the ideal situation for fat loss so you

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.370 
the ideal situation for fat loss so you
take<00:02:55.700> your<00:02:55.730> fat<00:02:56.030> burner<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.810> take<00:02:57.050> your<00:02:57.200> fat

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
take your fat burner you take your fat

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.380 
take your fat burner you take your fat
metabolizer<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.400> best<00:02:58.700> thing<00:02:58.940> is<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.120> take

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
metabolizer the best thing is to take

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.390 
metabolizer the best thing is to take
them<00:02:59.600> in<00:02:59.720> conjunction<00:02:59.930> with<00:03:00.380> each<00:03:00.530> other<00:03:00.830> and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
them in conjunction with each other and

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.009 
them in conjunction with each other and
then<00:03:01.610> not<00:03:01.790> only<00:03:01.819> do<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.269> get<00:03:02.390> an<00:03:02.510> increase<00:03:02.870> in

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
then not only do you get an increase in

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.540 
then not only do you get an increase in
calorie<00:03:03.380> expenditure<00:03:03.530> an<00:03:04.100> increase<00:03:04.400> in

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
calorie expenditure an increase in

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.000 
calorie expenditure an increase in
weight<00:03:04.790> loss<00:03:05.000> but<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.720> higher<00:03:06.050> proportion<00:03:06.620> of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
weight loss but a higher proportion of

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.710 
weight loss but a higher proportion of
that<00:03:07.069> calorie<00:03:07.610> expenditure<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.510> weight

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
that calorie expenditure and that weight

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.039 
that calorie expenditure and that weight
loss<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:09.170> gonna<00:03:09.620> come<00:03:09.920> from<00:03:09.950> stored<00:03:10.400> body<00:03:10.610> fat

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
loss is gonna come from stored body fat

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.330 
loss is gonna come from stored body fat
so<00:03:12.049> that's<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.380> answer<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.980> question

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
so that's the answer to the question

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.430 
so that's the answer to the question
about<00:03:13.610> what<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.850> difference<00:03:14.329> is<00:03:14.450> between<00:03:14.600> fat

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
about what the difference is between fat

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.350 
about what the difference is between fat
burners<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.070> fat<00:03:16.250> metabolizers<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.209> whether

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
burners and fat metabolizers and whether

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.940 
burners and fat metabolizers and whether
you<00:03:17.480> should<00:03:17.540> take<00:03:17.660> them<00:03:17.959> together<00:03:18.140> if<00:03:18.829> you've

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
you should take them together if you've

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.220 
you should take them together if you've
got<00:03:19.100> any<00:03:19.280> questions<00:03:19.489> for<00:03:19.910> MJ<00:03:20.209> Q&amp;A<00:03:20.660> hit<00:03:20.959> us<00:03:21.079> up
