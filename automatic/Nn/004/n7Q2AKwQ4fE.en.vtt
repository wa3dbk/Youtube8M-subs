does<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:33.420> we<00:02:33.630> take<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.020> third<00:02:34.709> one<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
does and then we take the third one and

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.070 
does and then we take the third one and
we<00:02:36.810> plug<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:38.150> once<00:02:39.150> all<00:02:39.360> three<00:02:39.600> are<00:02:39.810> plugged

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
we plug it in once all three are plugged

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.630 
we plug it in once all three are plugged
in<00:02:42.470> eventually<00:02:43.940> I'll<00:02:44.940> take<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.640> heat

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
in eventually I'll take this is a heat

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.030 
in eventually I'll take this is a heat
sensor<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.239> comes<00:02:48.720> with<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.050> lipo<00:02:50.010> charger

hopefully<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.460> could<00:03:17.610> see<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.270> I'm<00:03:18.450> not

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
hopefully you could see this I'm not

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.350 
hopefully you could see this I'm not
sure<00:03:18.630> if<00:03:19.020> you<00:03:19.140> can<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.880> I'm<00:03:21.840> going<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:23.360> change

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
sure if you can so I'm going to change

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:34.040

they've just been ganged together and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.320 
they've just been ganged together and
the<00:04:03.240> other<00:04:04.050> cord<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.440> plugs<00:04:04.500> in<00:04:04.890> here<00:04:05.330> goes

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
the other cord that plugs in here goes

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.660 
the other cord that plugs in here goes
to<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.600> charger<00:04:07.110> that's<00:04:07.920> just<00:04:08.190> put<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.550> this

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
to the charger that's just put in this

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.120 
to the charger that's just put in this
room<00:04:08.940> 3<00:04:09.180> cell<00:04:09.420> port<00:04:09.720> as<00:04:09.870> well<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.260> this<00:04:10.380> acts<00:04:10.650> as

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
room 3 cell port as well so this acts as

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.510

then<00:05:00.960> we<00:05:01.080> go<00:05:01.200> back<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.530> this<00:05:01.650> screen<00:05:01.860> here<00:05:02.400> and

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
then we go back to this screen here and

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.310 
then we go back to this screen here and
now<00:05:02.760> you<00:05:02.820> can<00:05:02.940> see<00:05:03.360> that<00:05:03.540> this<00:05:03.630> is<00:05:03.810> monitoring

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
now you can see that this is monitoring

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.940 
now you can see that this is monitoring
and<00:05:04.560> first<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.919> all<00:05:04.980> you<00:05:05.040> notice<00:05:05.430> up<00:05:05.610> there

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
and first of all you notice up there

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.670 
and first of all you notice up there
it's<00:05:07.950> showing<00:05:08.750> three<00:05:09.750> point<00:05:10.020> seven<00:05:10.260> three

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
it's showing three point seven three

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.320 
it's showing three point seven three
three<00:05:10.710> point<00:05:11.340> eight<00:05:11.460> one<00:05:11.669> and<00:05:11.940> three<00:05:12.090> point

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
three point eight one and three point

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.510 
three point eight one and three point
nine<00:05:12.390> zero<00:05:12.540> that's<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.320> voltage<00:05:13.980> of<00:05:14.340> these

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
nine zero that's the voltage of these

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.100 
nine zero that's the voltage of these
three<00:05:14.820> different<00:05:15.000> cells<00:05:15.480> that<00:05:15.660> are<00:05:15.810> sitting

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
three different cells that are sitting

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.670 
three different cells that are sitting
here

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
here

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.719 
here
and<00:05:17.060> then<00:05:18.060> this<00:05:18.180> monitor<00:05:18.720> here<00:05:19.340> you<00:05:20.340> can<00:05:20.520> see

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
and then this monitor here you can see

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.870 
and then this monitor here you can see
that<00:05:20.940> on<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.630> chart<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:24.180> top<00:05:24.419> is<00:05:24.690> the

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
that on the chart the top is the

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.719 
that on the chart the top is the
capacity<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.479> it's<00:05:27.750> slowly<00:05:27.990> going<00:05:28.259> up<00:05:28.729> the

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
capacity and it's slowly going up the

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.240 
capacity and it's slowly going up the
voltage<00:05:30.240> which<00:05:31.080> is<00:05:31.259> slowly<00:05:31.530> going<00:05:31.770> up<00:05:31.979> but<00:05:32.160> it

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
voltage which is slowly going up but it

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.640 
voltage which is slowly going up but it
takes<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.580> while<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:34.020> next<00:05:34.229> one<00:05:34.440> is<00:05:34.560> the

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
bottom one is the current that's the

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.020 
bottom one is the current that's the
charging<00:05:40.380> current<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.949> that'll<00:05:41.310> once<00:05:41.880> it

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
charging current and that'll once it

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.300 
charging current and that'll once it
reaches<00:05:42.419> 4.2<00:05:43.080> volts<00:05:43.110> on<00:05:43.500> each<00:05:43.620> cell<00:05:43.949> that'll

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
reaches 4.2 volts on each cell that'll

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.680 
reaches 4.2 volts on each cell that'll
start<00:05:44.490> dropping<00:05:45.090> and<00:05:45.240> dropping<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:45.660> dropping

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
start dropping and dropping and dropping

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.110 
start dropping and dropping and dropping
until<00:05:46.080> it<00:05:46.259> gets<00:05:46.410> down<00:05:46.530> low<00:05:46.770> enough<00:05:46.830> that

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
until it gets down low enough that

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.570 
until it gets down low enough that
Paulson<00:05:48.120> you<00:05:48.300> know<00:05:48.389> hear<00:05:48.750> a<00:05:49.400> squealing<00:05:50.400> beep

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
Paulson you know hear a squealing beep

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.600 
Paulson you know hear a squealing beep
beep<00:05:50.820> beep<00:05:51.090> from<00:05:51.740> this<00:05:52.740> little<00:05:53.010> guy<00:05:53.130> and<00:05:53.490> that

beep beep from this little guy and that

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.090 
beep beep from this little guy and that
means<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:53.940> charge<00:05:54.210> is<00:05:54.389> complete<00:05:54.750> now<00:05:55.650> just<00:05:55.919> to

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
means the charge is complete now just to

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.550 
means the charge is complete now just to
reiterate<00:05:56.340> what<00:05:56.820> this<00:05:57.030> is<00:05:57.240> this<00:05:57.449> is<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.630> 12-volt

on<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.710> front<00:06:01.979> that<00:06:02.900> adapts<00:06:03.900> nicely<00:06:04.410> to<00:06:04.650> this

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
on the front that adapts nicely to this

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.120 
on the front that adapts nicely to this
charger<00:06:06.780> you<00:06:06.870> see<00:06:07.080> this<00:06:07.260> charger<00:06:07.650> came<00:06:07.860> with<00:06:08.099> a

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
charger you see this charger came with a

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.250 
charger you see this charger came with a
court<00:06:08.550> on<00:06:08.849> it<00:06:09.000> that<00:06:09.150> has<00:06:09.300> banana<00:06:09.660> plugs<00:06:09.990> and

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
court on it that has banana plugs and

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.310 
court on it that has banana plugs and
you<00:06:10.889> can<00:06:11.039> actually<00:06:11.250> use<00:06:11.729> clip<00:06:12.240> clip<00:06:12.780> like<00:06:12.990> this

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
you can actually use clip clip like this

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.230 
you can actually use clip clip like this
but<00:06:13.650> then<00:06:13.800> the<00:06:14.130> plug<00:06:14.340> would<00:06:14.460> plug<00:06:14.699> in<00:06:14.820> here<00:06:15.060> and

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
but then the plug would plug in here and

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.230 
but then the plug would plug in here and
then<00:06:15.599> it<00:06:15.630> can<00:06:15.870> click<00:06:16.110> or<00:06:16.889> clip<00:06:17.400> onto<00:06:17.699> a<00:06:17.729> battery

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
then it can click or clip onto a battery

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.990 
then it can click or clip onto a battery
but<00:06:19.050> since<00:06:19.289> I<00:06:19.440> have<00:06:19.710> this<00:06:20.250> charging<00:06:20.699> in<00:06:20.910> the

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
but since I have this charging in the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.480 
but since I have this charging in the
house<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:21.510> I<00:06:22.050> have<00:06:22.229> a<00:06:22.260> 12<00:06:22.590> volt<00:06:22.650> power<00:06:23.010> supply

house and I have a 12 volt power supply

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.820 
house and I have a 12 volt power supply
I<00:06:23.849> do<00:06:24.270> it<00:06:24.479> this<00:06:24.599> way<00:06:24.660> with<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.229> banana<00:06:25.530> plugs

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
I do it this way with the banana plugs

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.070 
I do it this way with the banana plugs
and<00:06:26.610> there's<00:06:27.090> other<00:06:27.270> adapters<00:06:27.840> for<00:06:27.870> different

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
and there's other adapters for different

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.020 
and there's other adapters for different
types<00:06:28.530> of<00:06:28.740> cables<00:06:29.130> I<00:06:29.220> use<00:06:29.400> this<00:06:29.580> one<00:06:29.760> quite<00:06:30.000> a

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
types of cables I use this one quite a

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.600 
types of cables I use this one quite a
bit<00:06:30.210> because<00:06:30.360> I<00:06:30.630> have<00:06:30.660> the<00:06:30.870> WellCare<00:06:31.229> up

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
bit because I have the WellCare up

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.219 
bit because I have the WellCare up
helicopters<00:06:32.610> and<00:06:33.330> I'm<00:06:33.419> also<00:06:33.539> using<00:06:33.750> this<00:06:34.020> type

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
helicopters and I'm also using this type

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.790 
helicopters and I'm also using this type
of<00:06:34.349> connector<00:06:34.740> for<00:06:34.919> my<00:06:35.070> glider<00:06:36.199> it's<00:06:37.199> not<00:06:37.409> it's

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
of connector for my glider it's not it's

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.560 
of connector for my glider it's not it's
a<00:06:37.919> type<00:06:38.130> of<00:06:38.159> banana<00:06:38.400> plug<00:06:38.880> that<00:06:39.060> well<00:06:39.270> carrier

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
a type of banana plug that well carrier

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.570 
a type of banana plug that well carrier
uses<00:06:39.900> very<00:06:40.110> nice<00:06:40.289> I<00:06:40.500> like<00:06:40.680> it<00:06:40.710> it's<00:06:41.070> a<00:06:41.250> bit<00:06:41.400> hard

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
uses very nice I like it it's a bit hard

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.490 
uses very nice I like it it's a bit hard
to<00:06:41.639> solder<00:06:41.970> one<00:06:42.180> up<00:06:42.360> they're<00:06:43.050> tricky<00:06:43.409> without

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
to solder one up they're tricky without

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.040 
to solder one up they're tricky without
getting<00:06:43.889> so<00:06:44.010> either<00:06:44.099> on<00:06:44.310> the<00:06:44.400> outside<00:06:45.050> and

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
getting so either on the outside and

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.360 
getting so either on the outside and
you'll<00:06:46.229> see<00:06:46.409> that<00:06:46.530> one<00:06:46.680> slightly<00:06:47.010> smaller

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
you'll see that one slightly smaller

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.589 
you'll see that one slightly smaller
than<00:06:47.460> the<00:06:47.550> other<00:06:47.729> and<00:06:47.970> then<00:06:48.090> there's<00:06:48.300> a<00:06:48.360> male

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
than the other and then there's a male

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.170 
than the other and then there's a male
inside<00:06:48.990> in<00:06:49.199> the<00:06:49.289> female<00:06:49.620> very<00:06:50.610> well<00:06:50.820> protected

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
inside in the female very well protected

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.490 
inside in the female very well protected
so<00:06:51.479> they<00:06:51.510> can't<00:06:51.780> short<00:06:52.050> out

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
so they can't short out

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.120 
so they can't short out
when<00:06:52.949> you<00:06:53.039> plug<00:06:53.220> into<00:06:53.400> another<00:06:53.760> one<00:06:55.130> and

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
when you plug into another one and

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.950 
when you plug into another one and
that's<00:06:56.310> about<00:06:56.490> it<00:06:56.610> so<00:06:57.150> now<00:06:57.300> this<00:06:57.510> will<00:06:57.720> charge

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
that's about it so now this will charge

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.450 
that's about it so now this will charge
away<00:06:58.169> for<00:06:58.590> probably<00:06:58.889> about<00:06:59.010> an<00:06:59.220> hour<00:07:00.229> at

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
away for probably about an hour at

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.249 
away for probably about an hour at
900<00:07:01.819> million<00:07:02.030> it'll<00:07:02.479> take<00:07:02.660> a<00:07:02.690> while<00:07:02.870> but<00:07:03.169> I

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.259 
900 million it'll take a while but I

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.860 
900 million it'll take a while but I
like<00:07:03.440> to<00:07:03.590> take<00:07:04.430> it<00:07:04.580> easy<00:07:04.759> on<00:07:04.970> the<00:07:05.090> charge<00:07:05.389> some

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
like to take it easy on the charge some

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.330 
like to take it easy on the charge some
people<00:07:06.080> like<00:07:06.229> to<00:07:06.259> go<00:07:06.470> stronger<00:07:06.830> and<00:07:07.130> get<00:07:07.250> it

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:07.340 
people like to go stronger and get it

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.580 
people like to go stronger and get it
done<00:07:07.460> quicker<00:07:07.910> but<00:07:08.150> I<00:07:08.360> like<00:07:09.080> to<00:07:09.199> give<00:07:09.319> it<00:07:09.410> up<00:07:09.470> at

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
done quicker but I like to give it up at

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.450 
done quicker but I like to give it up at
the<00:07:09.650> time<00:07:09.860> and<00:07:10.250> once<00:07:10.430> they're<00:07:10.610> done<00:07:12.280> they<00:07:13.280> go

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
the time and once they're done they go

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.219 
the time and once they're done they go

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:15.229 
into this little helicopter and it flies

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:17.920 
into this little helicopter and it flies
everywhere<00:07:15.650> I<00:07:15.800> want<00:07:15.979> it<00:07:16.130> to<00:07:16.220> fly<00:07:16.780> except<00:07:17.780> when

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
everywhere I want it to fly except when

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.400 
everywhere I want it to fly except when
it<00:07:18.050> doesn't<00:07:18.080> and<00:07:18.620> crashes<00:07:19.039> and<00:07:19.849> that's<00:07:20.060> it

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410
