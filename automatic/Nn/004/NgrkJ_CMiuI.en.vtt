iPad air in the kotiga case does fit in

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.170 
iPad air in the kotiga case does fit in
there<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.320> was<00:01:40.500> able<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.920> zip<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> up<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
there and I was able to zip it up and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.910 
there and I was able to zip it up and
and<00:01:42.990> also<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:45.619> MacBook<00:01:46.619> Pro

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
and also this is just the MacBook Pro

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.850 
and also this is just the MacBook Pro
from<00:01:48.259> 2012<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:51.020> it'll<00:01:52.020> zip<00:01:52.229> all<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.470> way<00:01:52.590> up

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
from 2012 and it'll zip all the way up

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
from 2012 and it'll zip all the way up
with<00:01:53.100> both<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.909> those<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.530> case

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
with both of those in there in the case

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.050 
with both of those in there in the case
so<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.869> thought<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.680> could<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.890> helpful<00:01:59.640> for

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so I thought that could be helpful for

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.469 
so I thought that could be helpful for
somebody<00:02:00.600> there<00:02:01.469> who<00:02:02.340> also<00:02:02.579> came<00:02:02.909> these<00:02:03.149> three

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
somebody there who also came these three

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.370 
somebody there who also came these three
dividers<00:02:04.369> as<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.579> said<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.000> felt<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.630> on

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
dividers as I said this is felt and on

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.460 
dividers as I said this is felt and on
the<00:02:07.530> inside<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.539> see

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
the inside here if you can see

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.880 
the inside here if you can see
well<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:12.460> guess<00:02:12.880> he<00:02:13.030> can't<00:02:13.240> see<00:02:13.420> but<00:02:13.690> it's<00:02:14.500> felt

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
well I guess he can't see but it's felt

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.010 
well I guess he can't see but it's felt
as<00:02:15.130> well<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.850> so<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.420> adjust<00:02:16.810> these

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
as well and so you can adjust these

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.910 
as well and so you can adjust these
dividers<00:02:17.440> as<00:02:18.300> three<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.450> them<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.770> can

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
dividers as three of them and you can

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.310 
dividers as three of them and you can
adjust<00:02:21.040> them<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.760> fit<00:02:22.300> whatever<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:23.050> need

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
adjust them to fit whatever you need

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.630 
adjust them to fit whatever you need
over<00:02:24.130> here<00:02:24.460> on<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.760> side<00:02:24.940> there's<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.630> pocket

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
over here on the side there's a pocket

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.300 
over here on the side there's a pocket
for<00:02:27.640> your<00:02:27.880> pens<00:02:28.240> or<00:02:28.720> any<00:02:29.290> other<00:02:29.530> little<00:02:29.950> small

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
for your pens or any other little small

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.970 
for your pens or any other little small
items<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.030> need<00:02:31.180> like<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.980> and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
items that you need like that and and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.980 
items that you need like that and and
then<00:02:33.130> on<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.490> side<00:02:33.730> there's<00:02:33.970> another<00:02:34.330> pocket

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
then on this side there's another pocket

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.540 
then on this side there's another pocket
that<00:02:35.440> seems<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.920> be<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.070> little<00:02:36.370> bit<00:02:36.610> tighter

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
that seems to be a little bit tighter

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.360 
that seems to be a little bit tighter
and<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:39.820> therefore<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.270> little<00:02:40.570> bit<00:02:40.690> smaller

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
and so therefore a little bit smaller

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.660 
and so therefore a little bit smaller
the<00:02:42.760> corner<00:02:43.630> or<00:02:43.870> these<00:02:44.170> these<00:02:44.650> sides<00:02:45.010> are

the corner or these these sides are

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.250 
the corner or these these sides are
rigid<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:47.440> does<00:02:47.740> stand<00:02:48.160> without<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:49.260> which

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
rigid and it does stand without a which

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.530 
rigid and it does stand without a which
is<00:02:50.470> which<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.130> whole<00:02:51.430> concept<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.300> this

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
is which is the whole concept of this

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.100 
is which is the whole concept of this
bag<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:53.530> made<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.190> stand<00:02:54.490> without<00:02:55.110> without

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
flopping and stuff like that so it's

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.380 
flopping and stuff like that so it's
rigid<00:02:58.570> on<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.990> side<00:02:59.230> it's<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.580> gray<00:03:01.360> color

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
rigid on the side it's this gray color

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.560 
rigid on the side it's this gray color
