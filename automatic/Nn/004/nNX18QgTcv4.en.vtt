00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
further ado let's start off with the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.530 
further ado let's start off with the
soul<00:00:10.800> your<00:00:11.580> soul<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.120> was<00:00:12.240> pretty<00:00:12.420> good

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
soul your soul it was pretty good

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.360 
soul your soul it was pretty good
traction<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.710> can<00:00:13.830> see<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.070> attraction

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
traction you can see the attraction

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.700 
traction you can see the attraction
lines<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> circles<00:00:15.750> right<00:00:16.440> there<00:00:16.619> that

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
lines here the circles right there that

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.189 
lines here the circles right there that
gives<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.980> pretty<00:00:17.190> good<00:00:17.340> traction<00:00:17.580> when<00:00:17.940> you're

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
gives a pretty good traction when you're

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.660 
gives a pretty good traction when you're
if<00:00:19.199> you're<00:00:19.680> whatever<00:00:20.070> kind<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.430> player<00:00:20.640> for

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
if you're whatever kind of player for

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.859 
if you're whatever kind of player for
example<00:00:21.270> if<00:00:21.390> you're<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.570> point<00:00:21.930> guard<00:00:22.140> or<00:00:22.699> a

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
example if you're a point guard or a

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.089 
example if you're a point guard or a
power<00:00:24.869> forward<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.380> Center<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.890> when<00:00:26.010> you

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
power forward or Center like when you

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.470 
power forward or Center like when you
have<00:00:26.189> sharp<00:00:26.460> stops<00:00:26.789> has<00:00:27.090> pretty<00:00:27.330> good

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
have sharp stops has pretty good

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.560 
have sharp stops has pretty good
fraction<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:28.109> good<00:00:28.439> grip<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.920> floor<00:00:29.250> and

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
fraction a good grip on the floor and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.160 
fraction a good grip on the floor and
then<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:31.140> also<00:00:32.030> has<00:00:33.030> these<00:00:33.239> pods<00:00:33.690> here<00:00:34.020> that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
then you also has these pods here that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.010 
then you also has these pods here that
takes<00:00:34.320> taken<00:00:35.010> energy<00:00:35.430> or<00:00:35.660> taken<00:00:36.660> away<00:00:36.809> when

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
takes taken energy or taken away when

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.680 
takes taken energy or taken away when
you<00:00:37.110> jump<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.620> land<00:00:37.879> which<00:00:38.879> plays<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> role

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
you jump up and land which plays a role

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
you jump up and land which plays a role
with<00:00:40.290> looter<00:00:41.100> lon<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.489> midsole<00:00:42.710> awesome

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
with looter lon in the midsole awesome

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.590 
with looter lon in the midsole awesome
outside<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:46.760> talk<00:00:47.760> more<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.180> little<00:00:48.420> on

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
outside and talk more about a little on

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.330 
outside and talk more about a little on
the<00:00:48.629> lunar<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.710> nice<00:00:49.829> material

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
the lunar on is a really nice material

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.049 
the lunar on is a really nice material
it's<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.270> foam<00:00:51.510> material<00:00:51.690> obviously<00:00:52.469> and

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
it's a foam material obviously and

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.270 
it's a foam material obviously and
what's<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> lunar<00:00:54.660> line<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.280> when

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
what's going to lunar line is that when

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.310 
what's going to lunar line is that when
you<00:00:56.370> jump<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.030> you'll<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.840> energy<00:00:58.020> is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you jump up and you'll and the energy is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
you jump up and you'll and the energy is
really<00:00:58.559> absorbed<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.789> throughout<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
really absorbed the like throughout the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.299 
really absorbed the like throughout the
whole<00:01:00.449> lunar<00:01:00.660> 1<00:01:00.870> which<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> whole<00:01:01.859> midsole

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
whole lunar 1 which is the whole midsole

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.759 
whole lunar 1 which is the whole midsole
so<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:02.640> really<00:01:02.879> good<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.320> doesn't<00:01:04.619> feel

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so that's really good so it doesn't feel

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
so that's really good so it doesn't feel
too<00:01:04.949> much<00:01:05.100> weight<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> heel<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:06.090> four<00:01:06.420> foot

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
too much weight on the heel or four foot

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.359 
too much weight on the heel or four foot
or<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.869> mids<00:01:07.260> or<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.799> MIDI<00:01:08.010> area<00:01:08.310> whatever

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
or the mids or the MIDI area whatever

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.649 
or the mids or the MIDI area whatever
and<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.700> also<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:11.939> your<00:01:12.150> carbon<00:01:12.450> fiber

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and you also have your carbon fiber

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.710 
and you also have your carbon fiber
plate<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.229> strength<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.590> stability<00:01:14.720> moving

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
plate for strength and stability moving

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.800 
plate for strength and stability moving
on<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:17.130> mid<00:01:17.909> area<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.780> your

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.200 
on to the mid area here you have your
flower<00:01:19.170> material<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.670> flower<00:01:21.060> is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
flower material and this flower is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.760

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
actually see the wires here and what's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.100 
actually see the wires here and what's
cool<00:01:25.350> about<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.530> floor<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.930> when<00:01:27.930> you
