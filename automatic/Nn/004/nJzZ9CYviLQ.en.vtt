 hello today we are going to make you a nice bed 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.840
 to our doll clawdeen wolf 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.210
 and for this we are going to use a box of 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.730
 cardboard the cardboard box we are going to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.190
 fill using paper bags 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.290
 plastic or newspaper 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.890
 then we are going to close it using 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.890
 glue 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.059
 once we have closed the box then 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.760
 let's measure with a piece of cloth and 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.170
 We are going to cut out the necessary fabric to 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.170
 cover the entire box 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.329
 let's put glue we're going to cover 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.969
 the box and then we're going to put glue 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:19.229
 at the bottom and cover the part 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.229
 below with a ribbon 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.160
 once we have fulfilled around the 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.530
 bed then let's stick the legs 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.230
 of the bed and for the legs I'm 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.600
 using accounts but at home if so 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.990
 they wish they can use cardboard 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.370
 They can use cardboard and they can also 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.370
 use wooden sticks 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.970
 once we have finished pasting the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.730
 little feet on the bed then we go to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.340
 make a pillow 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.510
 I'm doing the pillow using 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.910
 a piece of recycled plastic bag 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.040
 after putting the plastic bag in the 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.070
 piece of cloth and deform the pillow 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.080
 then I will decorate the pillow the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.720
 decoration that I'm going to use is 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.880
 just a piece of cloth the same 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.360
 piece of cloth that I used to form 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.360
 bed 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.870
 and once finished I'm going to paste the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.870
 pillow to the bed and that's it 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.700
 here we can see the bed already finished 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.160
 as well as a carpet that I made 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.420
 using a piece of cloth the same 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.420
 fabric that I used in bed 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.310
