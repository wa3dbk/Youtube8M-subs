00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.609
 in this video tutorial I will show you how 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.000
 change the head gasket of a 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.639
 motorcycle from 125 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.600
 this is the package that we are going to replace 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.600
 for a new one 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.650
 ah 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.720
 once we place the new packaging 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.809
 butt we proceed to assemble the cylinder head 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.480
 and adjust it with their respective nuts 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.260
 remember to adjust the nuts you should 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.260
 make cross 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.129
 we put the complete exhaust pipe and 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.470
 we adjust it with their respective nuts 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.580
 remember to place the exhosto package 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.580
 and adjust it 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.450
 and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.430
 already to finish we put the 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.440
 Muffler better known as pipette 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.200
 it would only be to assemble the tank and the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.900
 chair and enjoy your environment again 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.640
 transport greetings 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.640
