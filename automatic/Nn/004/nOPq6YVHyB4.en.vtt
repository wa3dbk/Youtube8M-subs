 percent 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.139
 so that you can travel safely on snow-covered or icy roads 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.740
 The alliance can return to its traditional one this year 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.059
 winter tire test performed 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.269
 and with 2 of the best-selling sizes 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.829
 for the 2009 season we have winter tires of sizes 185/60 r14 t 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.470
 and still 55 r16 h tested as the years before, we again form points in 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:32.190
 Tire everything up to the slip tire 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.150
 All-season tires I am only for vehicle owners with terms less than 5000 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.819
 kilometers 

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:38.780
 mainly on the two gates 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.810
 we have seen in the last year that all-season tires are increasingly heading 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.070
 Binder continues to develop their weaknesses mainly in summer too 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.590
 hold 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.830
 after 500 kilometers a driving distance 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.800
 more stability driveability 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560
 now on a snow-covered road 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.700
 and also if it works 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.090
 as a dry road, a winter tire must of course also in 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.090
 all 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.230
 the and NYSE had several candidates distinct weaknesses as well 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.230
 Behavior in aquaplaning 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.810
 the wear resistance police and the rolling resistance were recorded 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.500
 Size as directly affect the fuel consumption 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.400
 a measurement of the noise emission rounded out the test drives 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.330
 in the size 205/55 r16 h were particularly recommended by the Continental 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.430
 Winter Contact TS 830

 the Dunlop SP winter sport 3d 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.340
 and the Hankook is priced like 440 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.470
 unfortunately there were three times not recommended and indeed for the case 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.930
 that winter Haug 2 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.430
 the Swiss NGO SW 602 and the core of the Polar Trax 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.130
 of the candidates of the size 185/60 r14 animals received a "special 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.649
 recommended " 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.319
 the peace Stainz emergency route in the Fulda Montero 3 behind 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.829
 the Continental WinterContact ts800 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.879

 the Goodyear UltraGrip 7+ 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.179
 and the Dunlop SP Winter Response 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:34.469
 In this group, there were five times not recommended and indeed in case 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.579
 that astonishment winter-breath branches 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.579
 the em-quali one sees like a 150 Wintec 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.499
 Accordingly, past the goalie Inter 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.919
 the server is the model maintenance 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.189
 under pressure Himalayas like Franz 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.839
 Both tires do not have to be expensive. Also this year we have the top groups 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.919
 Riding again are a bit cheaper 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:58.989
 However, cheap tires filed for years in Ines 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.859
 for those who work to assemble the tires themselves 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.629
 Many modern winter tires have a mileage and during assembly 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.809
 The winter tires should be taken to ensure that the tires 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:12.109
 right direction also vehicle to be mounted otherwise 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.439
 before that, less tires would not work properly
