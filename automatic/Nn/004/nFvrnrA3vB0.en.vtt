00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
want to aim at the second tree where I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.329 
want to aim at the second tree where I
put<00:00:49.890> my<00:00:49.949> crosshair<00:00:50.550> right<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:52.129> that's<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
put my crosshair right there that's the

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.119 
put my crosshair right there that's the
general<00:00:53.670> area<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.359> I<00:00:54.390> am<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.260> 1v1<00:00:55.589> basically

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
general area now I am in a 1v1 basically

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.649 
general area now I am in a 1v1 basically
trying<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.399> show<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.579> tutorial<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> will

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
trying to show this tutorial so I will

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.919 
trying to show this tutorial so I will
miss<00:00:57.929> a<00:00:57.989> couple<00:00:58.350> times<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.539> other<00:01:00.659> than

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929 
miss a couple times so but other than

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.809 
miss a couple times so but other than
that<00:01:01.019> it's<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> general<00:01:01.769> area<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.670> do

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:02.819 
that it's the general area if you do

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.520 
that it's the general area if you do
miss<00:01:03.030> more<00:01:03.269> than<00:01:03.300> twice<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.989> might<00:01:04.199> want<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
miss more than twice you might want to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.899 
miss more than twice you might want to
not<00:01:04.980> try<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.489> they're<00:01:05.760> probably

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
not try it because they're probably

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.990 
not try it because they're probably
already<00:01:06.120> either<00:01:06.390> spawn<00:01:07.460> but<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.820> we'll

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
already either spawn but here we'll

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.640 
already either spawn but here we'll
watch<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.300> kokhim<00:01:12.290> after<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.380> takes<00:01:13.560> this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
watch the kokhim after it takes this

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.730 
watch the kokhim after it takes this
time<00:01:13.920> wait<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.120> I<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:18.200> it<00:01:19.200> basically<00:01:19.350> gets

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
time wait for I so it basically gets

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.390 
time wait for I so it basically gets
them<00:01:19.950> right<00:01:20.130> when<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.400> run<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.970> hill<00:01:22.400> so

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
them right when they run up the hill so

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.610 
them right when they run up the hill so
that's<00:01:23.670> why<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> said<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.240> only<00:01:24.360> shoot<00:01:25.050> too<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
that's why I said you only shoot too and

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.200 
that's why I said you only shoot too and
miss<00:01:25.980> you<00:01:26.250> might<00:01:26.430> know<00:01:26.550> a<00:01:26.580> try<00:01:26.880> because<00:01:26.940> it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
miss you might know a try because it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.250 
miss you might know a try because it
should<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.510> going<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.910> other<00:01:30.000> side<00:01:30.330> now

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
should be going to the other side now

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.350 
should be going to the other side now
you're<00:01:31.830> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> spawn<00:01:32.400> back<00:01:32.580> here<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.300> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
you're going to spawn back here for a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.450 
you're going to spawn back here for a
search<00:01:33.660> and<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.740> want<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> look<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.190> at<00:01:35.310> these

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
search and you want to look up at these

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.420 
search and you want to look up at these
wires<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.210> whereas<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> crosshairs<00:01:37.020> again

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
wires here whereas the crosshairs again

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.830 
wires here whereas the crosshairs again
so<00:01:38.430> when<00:01:38.550> you<00:01:38.640> spawn<00:01:38.850> back<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.210> just<00:01:39.390> barely

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
so when you spawn back there just barely

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.680 
so when you spawn back there just barely
makes<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.260> over<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.130> air<00:01:41.760> conditioner<00:01:42.360> vents

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
makes it over the air conditioner vents

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.690 
makes it over the air conditioner vents
whatever<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.380> aim<00:01:43.710> at<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.980> wires<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
whatever but just aim at the wires and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.900 
whatever but just aim at the wires and
it<00:01:45.450> should<00:01:45.600> drop<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.990> there<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.290> kill<00:01:46.440> them<00:01:46.590> i

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
it should drop in there and kill them i

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.370 
it should drop in there and kill them i
miss<00:01:47.910> a<00:01:47.940> couple<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.390> times<00:01:48.570> again<00:01:49.020> just

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
miss a couple of times again just

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.620 
miss a couple of times again just
because<00:01:49.710> it's<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.980> 1v1<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:51.180> i<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.480> them<00:01:52.100> and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
because it's a 1v1 but i get them and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.270 
because it's a 1v1 but i get them and
most<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.840> these<00:01:54.930> are<00:01:55.230> luck<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:56.100> knowing

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
most of these are luck just knowing

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.210 
most of these are luck just knowing
where<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.640> spots<00:01:56.910> will<00:01:57.120> help<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.360> lot<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:59.010> this

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
where the spots will help a lot and this

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.110 
where the spots will help a lot and this
is<00:01:59.370> why<00:01:59.550> I'm<00:01:59.700> doing<00:01:59.880> it

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.020 

so<00:02:05.120> that's<00:02:05.330> for<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.660> side<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:09.880> most<00:02:10.880> you

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
so that's for that side and most you

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.220 
so that's for that side and most you
guys<00:02:11.210> don't<00:02:11.390> know<00:02:11.540> how<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.690> do<00:02:11.870> half<00:02:11.900> this

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
guys don't know how to do half this

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.350 
guys don't know how to do half this
stuff<00:02:12.410> but<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:13.160> just<00:02:13.700> want<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:13.910> see<00:02:14.030> what<00:02:14.210> kind

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
stuff but I just want to see what kind

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.140 
stuff but I just want to see what kind
of<00:02:14.450> feedback<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.960> get<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.770> on<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.520> tomahawk
