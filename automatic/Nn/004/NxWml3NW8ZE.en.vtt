00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.539
 screw on top 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.090
 So Tip 1 prepares your food so well 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.970
 how it works as often as possible 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.790
 that's the only way you can be sure 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.350
 what's going on in the food I have 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.890
 there everything in it what I wanted with the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.420
 actually have food and if you have 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.790
 buy something ready then you know 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.010
 not what is in it like that together 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 are mixed as dairy is in it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.360
 the meat in it I know 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 make you the stuff yourself then know 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.280
 you know what's inside it has a better one 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.160
 quality it is usually fresher 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:59.250
 rich in nutrients, etc 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:05.430
 prepare our tip 1 food yourself 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.890
 Tip 2 planning ahead is everything when I am 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.590
 for example, I know that next 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.040
 day from morning to evening on the go 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.070
 with uni with strength training in the evening 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.470
 water training then i am the eve 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.880
 my meals cook in the kitchen 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.880
 the rule in front of or walls next to fruit with 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.920
 abuse because if you are not if you 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.670
 that does not do then you are forced 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.420
 somewhere to buy something and be it 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.460
 somehow a supermarket or or now 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.540
 fast food at worst he was 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.100
 burger king turner etc just then have 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.799
 you just a worse nutrition 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.290
 quality worse products just now 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.810
 Planning ahead is all very easy 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.119
 that you can take almost anything 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.210
 which means rice with chicken with 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.390
 broccoli or so easy to cook ahead 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.649
 and so you have a healthy lunch 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.110
 For example, when traveling is then 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.770
 maybe cold but then you get used to it 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.310
 also at it 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.390
 That's why planning in advance is everything 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.940
 Tip 3 is possible and I look 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.940
 I really do not miss one day 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.170
 through the entire range through wants 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.730
 as far as eating is concerned 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.819
 and I do not mean it now 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.310
 ketchup mustard or mayonnaise but me 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.750
 my palette with fruit palette 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.360
 then feed from money to dark 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.760
 Sunday you can go natural 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.670
 wise as wide as possible 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.739
 Micronutrients dimitar diet vitamins 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.540
 Just take minerals and you 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.350
 that there is no effort at all 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.269
 and one is to be healthy is just 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.310
 again here with the two advance planning 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.959
 everything is just maybe there 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.970
 to as many as possible 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.790
 take different things with you for 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.980
 on the way my three tips after 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.989
 which I honor every day so that 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.319
 I do not count on any 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.319
 finished or finished things or almost 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.790
 food products must fall back and that 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.230
 I do not need much time at all 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.359
 stand every other evening of the kitchen 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.690
 then cooks me fat for two days 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:22.920
 and that will not be bad 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:27.030
 that you can pick up and stay that way 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.680
 you canloch healthy and eat lÃ¤ndlichen 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.230
 Of course people could do it all 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.910
 easy to implement try it a try 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.430
 really is simple but effective 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.010
 and that was it from me we see each other 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.010
 again next video remains fit
