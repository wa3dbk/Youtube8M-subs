this<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.790> unique<00:02:54.450> one<00:02:54.690> oh<00:02:54.959> whoops

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950

this is the unique one oh whoops
alright<00:02:56.820> so<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.270> he<00:02:57.560> he<00:02:58.560> really<00:02:58.830> does<00:02:59.040> some

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
shots there you won't know what hit you

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:23.110 
shots there you won't know what hit you
alright<00:03:07.920> we're<00:03:08.040> gonna<00:03:08.130> use<00:03:08.400> his<00:03:08.549> super<00:03:08.880> now

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.250 

all<00:03:24.120> right<00:03:24.270> we're<00:03:24.450> just<00:03:24.480> going<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.870> go<00:03:24.990> into

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
all right we're just going to go into

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.260 
all right we're just going to go into
battle<00:03:25.560> another<00:03:25.980> time<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.400> to<00:03:26.790> look<00:03:26.940> at<00:03:27.120> his

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
battle another time just to look at his

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.720 
battle another time just to look at his
skills<00:03:27.570> once<00:03:27.960> more<00:03:28.410> but<00:03:29.010> that's<00:03:29.220> pretty<00:03:29.430> much

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
skills once more but that's pretty much

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.520 
skills once more but that's pretty much
it<00:03:30.030> those<00:03:30.210> are<00:03:30.360> his<00:03:30.570> special<00:03:31.080> attack<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.500> think

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
it those are his special attack I think

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.370 
it those are his special attack I think
his<00:03:31.830> second<00:03:32.310> attack<00:03:32.810> should<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:33.900> been<00:03:34.020> a<00:03:34.050> two

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
his second attack should have been a two

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.260 
his second attack should have been a two
series<00:03:34.920> attack<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.430> would<00:03:35.580> be<00:03:35.730> cool<00:03:36.000> but

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
series attack that would be cool but

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.150 
series attack that would be cool but
apparently<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:36.990> only<00:03:37.140> one<00:03:37.440> he<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.770> think<00:03:38.040> he

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
apparently is only one he I think he

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.390 
apparently is only one he I think he
shoot<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.640> arrow<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.690> one<00:03:39.870> arrow<00:03:40.140> we<00:03:41.010> already

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
shoot to arrow but one arrow we already

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.470 
shoot to arrow but one arrow we already
killed<00:03:41.640> our<00:03:41.910> opponent<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.880> second<00:03:45.300> arrow

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
killed our opponent so the second arrow

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:57.650 
killed our opponent so the second arrow
didn't<00:03:45.930> land<00:03:56.060> all<00:03:57.060> right<00:03:57.210> we're<00:03:57.330> gonna<00:03:57.420> use
