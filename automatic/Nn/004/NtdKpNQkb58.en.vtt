00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.979
 hi i am lucero marquez i have 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.680
 visual disability she was going to me 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:10.980
 dog via and this is the second time that 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.110
 we went to a branch of biscuits 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.839
 Obregon where we are denied entry 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.390
 the last time it was the branch of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.269
 buenavista and after an altercation with 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.269
 very strong of words with one of the 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.730
 managers allowed me to enter the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.099
 really quite unpleasant and this is 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.990
 the second time we come now 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.920
 We are in very close Molière 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.320
 Poxcous axxion and climbing the stairs 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.340
 one of the servers told us literally 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.430
 that could not happen with my animal we had 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.100
 to give explanations and another one of the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.670
 good managers a person in charge we 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.160
 let it happen I think it 's a very situation 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.230
 unfortunate that today in a 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.480
 franchise as important as biscuits 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.500
 Obregon does not have a policy 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.140
 corporate where 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.330
 and establish free access in writing 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.060
 to guide dogs and equal treatment 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.120
 people with disabilities any 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.090
 it is very important to remember that 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.400
 the guide dogs are considered as 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.360
 work tools for us and 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.250
 anywhere to any 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.470
 establishment where we are 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.380
 dogs already have to have free 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.950
 access that is stipulated in the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.040
 Article 58 and Article 7 of 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.120
 prophecy and also in the law of 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.480
 in the law of establishments 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.020
 merchant and in the federal district 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.270
 then unfortunate that a chain as 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.760
 important do not abide by the laws that the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.440
 they govern according to the city where 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.600
 is and in the country where it is 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.130
 you can not tell us about the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.210
 importance that they can exceed with a 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.830
 dog and abantia you said it 's a 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.950
 instrument of work but in this case 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.170
 is to acquire a good consume enter 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.820
 a service people with 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.010
 disability are also clients you think 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.280
 that from the perspective of the 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.110
 businesses are seen as customers 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.270
 there are definitely many shops 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.570
 especially in food establishments 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.480
 we do not see ourselves as clients I have the 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.910
 feeling for the situations that have 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.530
 happened in many places because when 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.630
 we finally enter some 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.700
 establishment is making us an 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.350
 please when we really are 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.840
 who pay for a service that is 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.820
 eat then 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.060
 yes I think that equality is needed and a 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.310
 fair treatment for the same as with 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.020
 all the people we too 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.960
 we are clients because we also pay 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.090
 for a service and in the same way we are 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.770
 must deal with guide dog or 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.890
 we can not take our eyes off 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.840
 and leave them out a dog who is the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.730
 eyes for a blind your guide dog you 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.690
 mark where you feel a guide dog you 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.910
 help 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.330
 if you have to climb stairs to a 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.980
 person with motor disability does not 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.450
 remove the wheelchair to be able to 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.370
 entering a restaurant is illogical 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.800
 that they tell us that we can not 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.720
 go with the dogs since you would wait 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.670
 of sight on humans you're already 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.310
 through dotcom disability in the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.660
 twitter already talking to people 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.100
 what would you expect from this company 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.470
 of food line I would wait for 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.200
 part of bisquets obregón and one no longer 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.690
 an apology because apologies give you in 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.080
 Everywhere I demand and I hope is 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.200
 a corporate policy where 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.410
 stipulated in writing where they have 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.240
 a regulation that establishes and 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.780
 specify that dogs are no longer 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:44.720
 pets and that they have free access together 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.300
 with their masters the truth that I thank 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.640
 much to disability dotcom all to 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.100
 disability and all the people who 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.170
 they have tweeted and retweeted all this 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.750
 because for us it is very important 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.050
 there are blind people who are so 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.730
 accustomed to being discriminated against 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.340
 all they do is take their things and 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.040
 turn around I honestly I'm not 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.500
 willing to have it happen again in 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.870
 no establishment I will look for 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.000
 forever 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.010
 to assert my rights and those of my 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.859
 colleagues because it's not possible that in 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.600
 21st century where fashion is the 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.100
 equality of the rights of the people 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.060
 do not do these things, this is not 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.090
 possible 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.450
 thank you very much thank you very much 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.790
 thanks to disability and to all people 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.650
 that has helped us with this with this 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.310
 project and with this public and 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.310
 citizen
