design<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:45.729> football<00:01:46.119> I<00:01:46.149> took<00:01:46.360> aerodynamics

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
design this football I took aerodynamics

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.780 
design this football I took aerodynamics
classes<00:01:47.619> got<00:01:47.829> this<00:01:47.979> football<00:01:48.399> on<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.579> wind

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
classes got this football on a wind

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.990 
classes got this football on a wind
tunnel<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.840> faster<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.439> ball<00:01:50.619> spins<00:01:51.340> the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
tunnel the faster the ball spins the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.819 
tunnel the faster the ball spins the
more<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.450> air<00:01:52.630> adheres<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.259> surface<00:01:53.439> of

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
more the air adheres to the surface of

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.980 
more the air adheres to the surface of
the<00:01:53.950> ball<00:01:54.159> it's<00:01:55.060> just<00:01:55.270> like<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.420> bullet<00:01:55.780> going

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
the ball it's just like a bullet going

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.660 
the ball it's just like a bullet going
through<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.350> air<00:01:56.469> it's<00:01:56.649> spinning<00:01:57.070> fast<00:01:57.369> and

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
through the air it's spinning fast and

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.810 
through the air it's spinning fast and
that<00:01:58.210> cuts<00:01:58.509> down<00:01:58.689> on<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:59.049> drag<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.759> you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
that cuts down on the drag and so you

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.490 
that cuts down on the drag and so you
get<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.240> better<00:02:01.450> velocity<00:02:01.659> I<00:02:02.020> knew<00:02:02.259> when<00:02:02.409> I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
get the better velocity I knew when I

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.539 
get the better velocity I knew when I
was<00:02:02.530> playing<00:02:02.799> if<00:02:03.009> I<00:02:03.070> want<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.340> throw<00:02:03.520> a

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
was playing if I want to throw a

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.999 
was playing if I want to throw a
comeback<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.299> concentrate<00:02:05.170> on<00:02:05.200> snapping<00:02:05.890> my

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
comeback I concentrate on snapping my

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.380 
comeback I concentrate on snapping my
fingers<00:02:06.039> down<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:06.670> thought<00:02:06.969> it<00:02:07.030> was<00:02:07.119> due<00:02:07.240> to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
fingers down I thought it was due to

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.749 
fingers down I thought it was due to
initial<00:02:07.840> velocity<00:02:08.530> but<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.070> has<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.250> lot<00:02:09.490> to<00:02:09.520> do

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
initial velocity but it has a lot to do

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.360 
initial velocity but it has a lot to do
also<00:02:10.000> with<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:11.080> aerodynamics<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.130> ball

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370

now if you look at the bottom football

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.730 
now if you look at the bottom football
and<00:03:08.300> think<00:03:08.570> of<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.720> company<00:03:08.990> like<00:03:09.110> indeed<00:03:09.470> as<00:03:09.620> a

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
and think of a company like indeed as a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.820 
and think of a company like indeed as a
14<00:03:10.130> billion<00:03:10.370> dollar<00:03:10.670> company<00:03:11.290> they<00:03:12.290> selected

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
bond in 2006 to make the football so we

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.040 
bond in 2006 to make the football so we
make<00:03:16.040> our<00:03:16.280> football<00:03:16.610> but<00:03:17.150> indeed<00:03:17.480> his<00:03:17.600> logo<00:03:17.900> on
