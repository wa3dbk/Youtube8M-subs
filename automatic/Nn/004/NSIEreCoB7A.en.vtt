you<00:01:32.410> do<00:01:32.890> get<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.100> harder<00:01:33.430> shot<00:01:33.490> with<00:01:33.940> a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
you do get a harder shot with a

you do get a harder shot with a
one-piece<00:01:34.810> stick<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.410> like<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.310> bottom<00:01:36.700> heavy

I<00:01:38.160> guess<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.310> weight<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.760> wooden

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
I guess the weight of the wooden

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.370 
I guess the weight of the wooden
wouldn't<00:01:40.600> blade<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.960> gives<00:01:41.140> that<00:01:41.350> extra

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
wouldn't blade it gives that extra

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.180 
wouldn't blade it gives that extra
weight<00:01:42.370> down<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:43.620> you<00:01:44.620> know<00:01:44.680> it<00:01:44.800> feels<00:01:45.010> better

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
weight down and you know it feels better

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.540 
weight down and you know it feels better

piece<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.160> comes<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.550> same<00:02:03.790> way<00:02:04.120> I<00:02:04.360> guess

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
piece it comes the same way I guess

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.270 
piece it comes the same way I guess
that's<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.500> nice<00:02:05.650> thing<00:02:05.890> what<00:02:06.040> happened

that's a the nice thing what happened
one<00:02:06.490> piece<00:02:06.700> but<00:02:06.940> for<00:02:07.630> me<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:08.080> personal

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
one piece but for me it's a personal

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.910 
one piece but for me it's a personal
preference<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.100> curving<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.000> myself<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.800> I

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
preference of curving it myself and so I

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.610 
preference of curving it myself and so I
like<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.370> heat<00:02:12.580> up<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:13.260> get<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.320> under<00:02:14.440> our

that's<00:04:57.870> where<00:04:58.170> like<00:04:58.350> in<00:04:58.920> hola

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
that's where like in hola

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.780 
that's where like in hola
put<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:00.920> in<00:05:01.010> an<00:05:01.100> ice<00:05:01.220> bucket<00:05:03.430> put<00:05:04.430> it<00:05:04.550> on<00:05:04.610> ice

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
put it in an ice bucket put it on ice
