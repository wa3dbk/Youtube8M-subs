keep twisting it until the twist gets

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.270 
keep twisting it until the twist gets
really<00:00:45.090> tiny<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.860> after<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
twisted you're just gonna start rolling

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.529 
twisted you're just gonna start rolling
it<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.730> this<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:53.460> after<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.910> all<00:00:54.030> rolled

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it like this and after it's all rolled

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.590 
it like this and after it's all rolled
you're<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> start<00:00:55.620> squishing<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.600> until

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
you're going to start squishing it until

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.590 
you're going to start squishing it until
it<00:00:57.780> kind<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.289> turns<00:00:58.559> into<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.859> cylinder<00:00:59.600> that's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it kind of turns into a cylinder that's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.770 
it kind of turns into a cylinder that's
annoying<00:01:01.579> now<00:01:02.579> I've<00:01:02.730> sort<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.149> rolled<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.600> into

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
annoying now I've sort of rolled it into

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.800 
annoying now I've sort of rolled it into
a<00:01:03.930> cylinder<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.619> I'm<00:01:05.549> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.150> flatten<00:01:06.540> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
a cylinder and I'm going to flatten it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.260 
a cylinder and I'm going to flatten it
to<00:01:07.110> make<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.010> width<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> height<00:01:08.880> of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
to make it the width or the height of

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.620 
to make it the width or the height of
the<00:01:10.229> beads<00:01:10.439> right<00:01:10.590> here<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.909> now<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.060> flattened

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the beads right here so now I flattened

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.600 
the beads right here so now I flattened
it<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.080> width<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.409> want<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.950> I'm<00:01:14.400> just

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
around the edges and kind of smooth them

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.760 
around the edges and kind of smooth them
so<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.979> they're<00:01:35.159> not<00:01:35.189> very<00:01:35.579> harsh<00:01:36.500> now<00:01:37.500> I'm

so that they're not very harsh now I'm
just<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.310> poke<00:01:38.700> holes<00:01:39.060> all<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.390> way

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
just going to poke holes all the way

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.160 
just going to poke holes all the way
through<00:01:39.900> them<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.070> pin<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.899> just<00:01:42.899> sort<00:01:43.110> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
through them with a pin and just sort of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.660 
through them with a pin and just sort of
wiggle<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.649> around<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> hole<00:01:45.180> isn't

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
wiggle it around so that the hole isn't

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.450 
wiggle it around so that the hole isn't
terribly<00:01:47.670> tiny<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.829> that's<00:01:49.829> all<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.280> they

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
terribly tiny and that's all now they

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.850 
terribly tiny and that's all now they
all<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.880> holes<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.659> I'm<00:01:52.229> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> bake

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
all have holes and I'm going to bake

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.590 
all have holes and I'm going to bake
them<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.280> glaze<00:01:53.579> them<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.090> think<00:01:54.149> I'm

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
them and glaze them and I think I'm

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.649 
them and glaze them and I think I'm
going<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.799> make<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.610> bunch<00:01:56.850> more<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.210> then<00:01:57.509> make

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
going to make a bunch more and then make

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.230 
going to make a bunch more and then make
them<00:01:57.840> into<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.290> bracelet<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.250> think<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.149> would

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
them into a bracelet I think that would

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910 
them into a bracelet I think that would
be<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.719> cute<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.170> kind<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.380> reminds<00:02:01.740> me<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
be really cute it kind of reminds me of

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.249 
be really cute it kind of reminds me of
The<00:02:02.070> Flintstones<00:02:02.250> though<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.329> we'll<00:02:03.930> see

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
The Flintstones though so we'll see

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.469 
The Flintstones though so we'll see
maybe<00:02:04.770> earrings<00:02:05.219> or<00:02:05.430> something<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:06.240> yeah<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
maybe earrings or something but yeah I
