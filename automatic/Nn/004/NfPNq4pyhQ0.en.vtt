is an itemization passive that grants as

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.380 
is an itemization passive that grants as
here<00:03:11.360> 2%<00:03:12.110> attack<00:03:12.530> speed<00:03:12.860> for<00:03:13.070> every<00:03:13.580> 1%<00:03:13.790> of

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
here 2% attack speed for every 1% of

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.240 
here 2% attack speed for every 1% of
cooldown<00:03:14.750> reduction<00:03:15.020> he<00:03:15.320> has<00:03:15.500> now<00:03:15.860> as<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.100> can

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
cooldown reduction he has now as you can

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.759 
cooldown reduction he has now as you can
see<00:03:16.459> here<00:03:16.670> in<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:16.910> example<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.930> actually<00:03:18.590> is

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
see here in this example it actually is

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.740 
see here in this example it actually is
more<00:03:18.800> worth<00:03:19.310> for<00:03:19.610> me<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.940> buy<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.150> cooldown

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
more worth for me to buy the cooldown

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.170 
more worth for me to buy the cooldown
boots<00:03:21.080> than<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.370> buy<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.580> surgeries

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
boots than it is to buy the surgeries

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.270 
boots than it is to buy the surgeries
for<00:03:23.450> attack<00:03:23.750> speed<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.290> obviously<00:03:24.620> this<00:03:24.830> is<00:03:24.890> a

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
for attack speed so obviously this is a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.070 
for attack speed so obviously this is a
very<00:03:25.580> significant<00:03:26.269> positive<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:26.930> gonna

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
very significant positive that is gonna

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.810 
very significant positive that is gonna
change<00:03:27.350> how<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.739> build<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.190> champion<00:03:28.640> and

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
change how you build this champion and

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.130 
change how you build this champion and
you<00:03:28.970> do<00:03:29.090> want<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.330> lot<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:29.600> attack<00:03:29.810> speed<00:03:29.930> in

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
you do want a lot of attack speed in

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.840 
you do want a lot of attack speed in
there<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.500> this<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.830> a<00:03:30.860> good<00:03:31.070> thing<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.489> second
