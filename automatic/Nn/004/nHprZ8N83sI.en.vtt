right now another thing that makes him

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.330 
right now another thing that makes him
so<00:02:37.910> damn<00:02:38.210> great<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.660> this<00:02:38.950> he<00:02:39.950> has<00:02:40.070> high

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340

attacking<00:02:41.000> work<00:02:41.210> rate<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:42.080> medium

attacking work rate in a medium

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.830 
attacking work rate in a medium
defensive<00:02:43.670> workrate<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.360> think<00:02:44.660> that's

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
defensive workrate and I think that's

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.740 
defensive workrate and I think that's
the<00:02:44.959> perfect<00:02:45.380> work<00:02:45.890> rates<00:02:46.220> for<00:02:46.880> striker<00:02:47.300> I<00:02:47.480> he

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
the perfect work rates for striker I he

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.080 
the perfect work rates for striker I he
