00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.530
 It is a theme of serialization of this month, but it is good 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.470
 I made a speaker This is yeah 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.500
 Of pick that be if Yosuke that is attached to the Appendix 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:26.090
 For example, it is an appendix of the August issue even if it is an appendix. 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:33.170
 Though it is a full-range unit of the Buju 50 mm caliber that is attached there 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:35.600
 It is very easy to use when we experiment variously with that speaker Patricks recently 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.200
 Because there is 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.690
 Well Kichitto one 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.070
 Side car box also 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.380
 Make 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:52.460
 I think it looks like 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:56.030
 This is the theme I think about how I can make it by hand 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.650
 In fact, even though I'm with a front back to the rice wine 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.650
 The part of this box is 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:12.190
 We prepare approximately 600 yen as block good person 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.010
 But it was a box which in this prepared in that the completed 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.360
 flower 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.460
 Compose and configure task Taurus 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.820
 Such that 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.240
 We happened Uni 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.050
 Just this because what you say is size 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.020
 That appendix 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:36.310
 It is almost the same as the small speaker depression but there is a lot of snow 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:42.560
 If you fit that person is ok 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:46.610
 The fact that even though I know about two of the three minutes it from there is Ryouku snow 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.820
 This is because there is a volume of 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.270
 Well try to make a sealed type 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.870
 This is 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.050
 If you do two things that one will be completed 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.310
 Put a lip on 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.110
 And secure it with the rear near Well screwed 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.740
 Though 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.740
 It's a closed structure , so that's that 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:20.920
 After all it is this round hole unit installation of the baffle and then it is like this. 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.180
 A hole Terminal 4 mounting 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.290
 Process 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.200
 Because you have to 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.239
 That's how it is 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.319
 It still takes time, but it is inevitable that this has nails in Tokyu Hands 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.390
 I went 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.390
 In cut but I'm such when you were this 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:50.430
 If there is an afternoon post-finishing laminated lumber saying Labound, it's a baseball mm thick 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.239
 Because it is easy to do it 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.239
 And we have bitter 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.110
 In finishing materials that say that are the scale cuisine 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.440
 It is quite beautiful because it is finished 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.430
 It will be done 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.209
 I think I want you to try it by all means 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.130
 Say it is inside is in a shake this bankruptcy 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:17.000
 As a sound absorbing material or heat insulating material 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.000
 To go with very that sn is but one that is sold 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.050
 I'm effective in Kedomo I'm certain this two types 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.720
 road 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:32.280
 It is a type that say it is cheaper This Now Hall b 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.850
 60% of the rules 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.440
 Polyester is 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.440
 40% included 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.410
 It is basic medicine 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.180
 I used that 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.650
 This is positive 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:51.980
 I think it would be better if there were some cars when using in a low-minute maker 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.750
 Whittier, let alone been looking for these things 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.110
 Saute it with that screw 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.990
 It is better to a little lift second to 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.320
 That little head is also small 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.710
 I use something like this because it is effective 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.230
 This is already 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.730
 Of floor of house or apartment 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.930
 What a subject 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.959
 Say so 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.959
 Well and in it was what has become in such a such a structure 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:30.020
 A lot of mare suitable 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.860
 And we can adjust this come-mer which had since come with fixed but had such 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.600
 U 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.639
 this 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.050
 A little on the cabinet 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:41.780
 Because there is no match because the size does not match, without the votive 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:46.440
 I would like to fix it directly 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.409
 Say I think the wind Then Well since you will in such a form and 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.660
 Also Oite meeting of the desk 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.529
 I guess it's easy to use 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.909
 think 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:59.490
 To by such as chasing or how to make Well the Kansei 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.210
 The taste better 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.510
 I want to report 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.660
 I think the 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:10.580
 I would like to make it again from now on 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:15.400
 If it is good if you can refer to people 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.400
 4 can be cheap with love 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.199
 more than I thought 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.040
 It finished beautifully 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:31.169
 Well this is the terminal used the one on hand so look for it yourself 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.260
 In the case of those parts 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.150
 It will become less 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.200
 is not it 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.200
 Yes it is more than
