into the bridle and then back to the
trot<00:02:37.709> maybe<00:02:37.950> I'll<00:02:38.100> try<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.310> lengthen<00:02:38.520> this

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
trot maybe I'll try to lengthen this

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.030 
trot maybe I'll try to lengthen this
trot<00:02:39.060> right<00:02:39.300> here<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:40.560> he's<00:02:40.739> doing<00:02:41.010> pretty

there<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.790> nowhere<00:02:45.090> try<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.390> again<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.840> you

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
there the nowhere try it again and you

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.630 
there the nowhere try it again and you
know<00:02:46.440> firstly<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.950> canter<00:02:47.220> doesn't<00:02:47.519> really

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
know firstly the canter doesn't really

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.610 
know firstly the canter doesn't really
bug<00:02:47.850> me<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:48.360> he<00:02:48.510> just<00:02:48.540> made<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> mistake<00:02:48.959> and

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.350 
him and we're going to do it three times
and<00:03:16.319> if<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:16.920> would<00:03:17.070> severe<00:03:17.370> against<00:03:20.360> Ares

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
and if you would severe against Ares

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.180 
and if you would severe against Ares
going<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.780> come<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.320> halt<00:03:22.530> again<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:23.040> come

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
going to come to a halt again and come

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.190 
going to come to a halt again and come
into<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.519> bit<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.180> first<00:03:24.450> time<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.959> got

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
into the bit so the first time I got

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.140 
into the bit so the first time I got
lucky<00:03:25.590> on<00:03:25.620> getting<00:03:26.040> it<00:03:26.130> again<00:03:26.370> second<00:03:27.120> time

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
lucky on getting it again second time

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.240 
lucky on getting it again second time
was<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.420> coincidence<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.560> third<00:03:28.769> time<00:03:28.980> he<00:03:29.100> does

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
was a coincidence the third time he does

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.009 
was a coincidence the third time he does
it<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> row<00:03:29.760> he's<00:03:30.299> starting<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.630> understand

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
it in a row he's starting to understand

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.420 
it in a row he's starting to understand
what<00:03:31.170> I'm<00:03:31.290> asking<00:03:31.350> them<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.829> do<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.980> then

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
what I'm asking them to do and then

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.910 
what I'm asking them to do and then
we're<00:03:35.579> going<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.730> try<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.239> again<00:03:36.329> here<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.829> he

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
we're going to try it again here and he

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
we're going to try it again here and he
does<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:39.480> great<00:03:40.110> job<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:41.220> then<00:03:41.549> let<00:03:41.790> me<00:03:41.850> go

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
does it and great job and then let me go

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.280 
does it and great job and then let me go
for<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.269> I'm<00:03:42.390> gonna<00:03:42.540> let<00:03:42.690> him<00:03:42.780> stretch<00:03:43.019> down

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
for it I'm gonna let him stretch down

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.229 
for it I'm gonna let him stretch down
into<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.650> bed<00:03:43.859> and<00:03:44.160> that's<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.880> end<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.090> this

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
into the bed and that's the end of this

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.729 
into the bed and that's the end of this
lesson<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.930> lesson<00:03:45.989> probably<00:03:46.560> took<00:03:46.680> me

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
lesson this lesson probably took me

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.550 
lesson this lesson probably took me
about<00:03:46.920> an<00:03:47.700> hour<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:47.970> do<00:03:48.239> but<00:03:48.840> he<00:03:48.959> finally<00:03:49.320> came

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
about an hour to do but he finally came

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.269 
about an hour to do but he finally came
out<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:49.950> it's<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.250> good<00:03:50.430> job<00:03:50.640> on<00:03:50.820> his<00:03:50.970> part
