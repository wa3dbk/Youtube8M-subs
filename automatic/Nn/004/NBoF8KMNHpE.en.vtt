00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.000
 we are in the second edition of expo of 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.430
 ccoo exposes with brings us a listing 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.649
 wide range of providers and data for 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.779
 interior design landscaping architecture and 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.849
 construction join me to see the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.360
 already armed spaces and be inspired to 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.360
 its decorations 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.140
 this space has been designed by the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.420
 architect receives the cigar and has 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.040
 called in the bargaining room I 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.480
 it seems very interesting to rescue as 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.550
 she has lost the fear of color 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.500
 black and this myth that we have that the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.500
 eros shrinks the spaces 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.470
 this is the designed baby bedroom 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.480
 for the link to marquina and what else 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.700
 it draws attention and it seems more very 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.470
 functional is the amount of shelves 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.850
 and shelves that she has installed 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.850
 around the whole crib 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.780
 we are in the suites of the young couple 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.090
 of the architects carolina and andrea 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.950
 and it's a fairly large space where 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.540
 It has achieved distribution 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.560
 different groups quite spaces 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.560
 useful for a couple 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.250
 we are in the executive suite 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.480
 designed by Carlos and Mario first 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.700
 do not call my attention in this space 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.200
 especially in the bedroom area is 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.660
 the amount of mirrors you find in 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.020
 the furniture when a mirror is worked 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.150
 in a traditional way as a panel generates 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.310
 an important depth but when 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.080
 you work in this way applied to the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:05.770
 furniture what generates is a kind of 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:07.990
 brightness and an elegant feeling we are 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.700
 in the vintage lounge of mónica vélez 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.000
 although it's called vintage I think it's been 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.920
 managed to use different styles and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.720
 Also retrieve furniture from different 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.430
 times so everything conjugates 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.760
 pretty good with the classic style of 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.760
 home 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.530
 At some point we have talked about 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.630
 several ideas to recycle furniture and 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.160
 decoration accessories and here I 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.790
 I found a lot of options that 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.790
 I want to show you 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.310
 we are in the juvenile bedroom hi tec 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.590
 and what I want to highlight from this space 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.200
 is the use of textures and different 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.130
 materials that finally create everything 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.130
 this industrial style 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.120
 we are on the terrace they have designed 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.000
 march and lisette and has worked 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.070
 basically a wooden deck throughout 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.020
 of the garden generating three super spaces 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.530
 within all outer space 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.630
 we have a kind of room a dining room and 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.500
 to an area with a chifflone ​​that could 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.500
 result of reading
