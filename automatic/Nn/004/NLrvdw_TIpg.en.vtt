00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:30.140

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:48.350
 red back of love love love love 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:50.480
 love love love love love country welcome 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.190
 show people to a new video today 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.050
 I give you the modification with the name 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.300
 flender fashion and it is not just any 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.740
 but the job of parents for parents 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.180
 He does not know yet, he really does 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.890
 the best motto it is really very 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.670
 Kulant developer just look 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.229
 microphone over with him so yes this one 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.000
 mod fucks you two new items are closed 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.550
 these two here this page detector 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.840
 and this book on notes with it can 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.190
 you do not right-click or something 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.750
 that no idea works 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.890
 somehow not I think that's unnecessary 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.420
 never noticed that you can 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.920
 not affected but the page 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.200
 Detector could use forces and also one 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.240
 so give me the crafting recipe 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.190
 place glass panes here redstone 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.950
 iron and in the middle of an ender pearl 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.299
 so then you can see below page 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.229
 remaining and that would be the classics 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.090
 countries from the forest know knows that 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.159
 yes, that's because you have eight pages 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.020
 has to collect and that indicates when 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.650
 certain radius is then flashing 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.119
 red on 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.000
 and the closer you get it faster 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.830
 and if you stand in front of it then 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.070
 lights that continuously threaten yes 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.750
 very cool and you can the countries and 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.640
 So also in the normal world use 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.680
 when it gets dark that country comes 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.180
 but also only in survival mode in 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.619
 the survival mode time or become you 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.390
 placed around you so zettl 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.909
 but that's somehow that's it 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.679
 somehow like that in the world because I am 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.000
 It's just shit because of it 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.280
 also in the description in the download 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.130
 link to a map does one go 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.239
 then a chest gets a torch but 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.400
 I'll take the page now 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.420
 detector with which sometimes spins with the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.690
 You have to start a subway train 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.430
 waiting 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.120
 the same reason brings already looks 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.470
 the look already makes a side 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.020
 make left click and collected on 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.450
 that's really nice and if you are 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.590
 now thinks that countries more is even 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.020
 not scary in minecraft blablabla 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.080
 So people are the bad thing is easy 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.730
 always the music and a professional 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.650
 extends the worse the so 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.150
 One does not have fear directly even if one 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.210
 says one is afraid what I always to 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.810
 make an example but it is still very 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:06.070
 very cool 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:07.330
 I have to look there is always something there 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.980
 he already said a few times that 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:16.990
 I think you always have the best map 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:24.820
 reboot Harry harry the side 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:28.030
 its always a funny we do not care 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.290
 times continue to talk long will I trust 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.989
 Actually, the drivers are always the same 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.080
 so go here through the forest 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.080
 go 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.410
 sixx pages mining 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.110
 where must his be 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.910
 page defective shows us something on each 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.380
 before I go here before he is here now 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.730
 Thus, as I get into my pants 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.500
 Shit , I would say 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.940
 we'll see you on the desktop right away 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.440
 again you can now countries if yes 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.660
 see yourself or it in the beginning 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.830
 seen for example about say 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.900
 right here we will be back on the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.160
 desktop installations of the mod you 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.540
 really only needs the two 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.190
 files here is the markets again 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.750
 I also uploaded again and 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.850
 how did these two things go to the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.050
 place yourself and the minecraft for it 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.989
 the litter goes the link I like you 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.239
 The description sentences simply lower 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.160
 If necessary, click &amp; buy all three 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.200
 things on download approach only at the 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.370
 upper legs so afterwards you can 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.470
 easy to start and he the window 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.570
 run and there you have appdata percent 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.000
 percent and press ok then go 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.110
 the point is minecraft folder and 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.800
 make a right click on yours 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.180
 open minecraft with winrar archive as 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.960
 of course, the first would, as always, the 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.270
 search words and delete them 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.860
 then we go to the minecraft forge 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.150
 take all files there too demeter in 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.970
 front and just pull over 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.660
 press ok we can both again 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.670
 shut down 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.530
 then you start minecraft the best 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.150
 once or created mods folder 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.340
 manually I would rather minecraft 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.970
 even start then you're also whether with 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.410
 the forge everything is otherwise 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.050
 mds write everything small goes in there 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.270
 and just see the countries zip file 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.830
 and then if you still have the map 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.300
 you wanted to install then you go into the 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:17.080
 saves folder so goes into the here 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.060
 Icelandic so in the zib is still here 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.150
 new items, which he simply delete the folder 13 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.400
 so I just mean in and the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.050
 folder over done it's all her 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.940
 can gamble in normal countries 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.120
 minecraft as I did that 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.670

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.290
 watch as if confused 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.210
