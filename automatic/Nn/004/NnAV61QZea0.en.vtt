00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.940
 hello everybody I want to introduce to 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.250
 you a very cheerful nail decoration 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.940
 we will use here three types of 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.330
 poisons alias fourth type of varnish is Ã© 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.010
 the white turquoise blue and the little flowers 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.840
 blue this declaration of union will leave 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.780
 You're even more beautiful. 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.100
 good first I went here and I like 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.910
 to leave me 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.610
 already the first hand on the nail is the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.710
 porcelain color varnish that I most like 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.590
 always say you can you do not have 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:07.180
 this varnish color can use either a base 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.360
 or you do not have on base you can leave 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.320
 even in the color of the nail a little French is and 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 after I passed the porcelain there 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.820
 white blue ride and then made the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.430
 Well baby, let's go step by step. 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.200
 step to teach you is a decoration of 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.180
 middle level 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.040
 but I'll teach you a word 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.729
 to know very easy 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.880
 Let's start here I'll start here. 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.220
 with the brush because I do not want it 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.830
 get off the nail 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:44.530
 but you can even start with 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:47.430
 one with own varnish brush just for me 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.430
 make the measurement 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.330
 let's go and here 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.400
 blue is a very beautiful case 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.520
 if you do not have your turquoise 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.500
 can be another south not always 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.270
 Do you have the nail decoration? 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.280
 to be with the same club with colors 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.680
 that we teach of course has to be 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.560
 something similar so as not to be 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.060
 much outside there are also decorations that 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:29.080
 We can use other things and stay 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:31.630
 I closed easily spent just go 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.260
 only give one hand to make the collection 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.250
 I like them to be really right. 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:43.060
 Are you at home waiting to dry? 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:45.820
 experience falls pass two hands to see 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.880
 in these to stay well defined pretty beautiful 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.880
 now it's gone blank 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:03.680
 Um here you have to meet with the 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.680
 surprise 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:20.770
 show here 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:24.360
 The dirty hot one gets now that I go 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:30.040
 take a little blue from our blue 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.540
 to make the flower is 6 little flower not 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.680
 it's an entire flower 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.590
 first I will always do the middle of the 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.480
 flower 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.330
 I leave here woman in red white and 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.450
 White 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.450
 come on 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.250
 that way she's on her side 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.550
 You see I did not do well in the middle, right? 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.680
 sometimes here the camera is hungry 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.520
 filming ownership and sometimes not 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:17.840
 I can not see well and now we're going here. 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:23.240
 picking up the blue with the brush can be a 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.960
 brush 00 and also very firm too 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.960
 thick 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:45.010
 I'll come here because you're better than 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:45.010
 the other then one in the middle 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:56.590
 are three petals and she stands aside 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.590
 on the left side very happy 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.940
 live bright color I'll give another one 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.940
 touch up here 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.690
 see and now what is missing from these 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.419
 scratchs 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.300
 the black risk 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.780
 We have to do it very calmly because 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.180
 otherwise everything will be over and you lose a job 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.550
 What are you trying to do? 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.669
 so it's priceless I hope to stay 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.250
 red 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.740
 it is a work of patience to the people or 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.669
 not here it's beautiful but it has to have 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.669
 patience do 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.030
 with you always that this one is not 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.150
 the most appropriate brush would be your 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.530
 potential but I like to do it 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.930
 so because I know that not everyone 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.759
 at home that longer brush 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.580
 for you to see that it is possible 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:10.810
 do with others in heaven and if they think about it 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:14.350
 it was not so thin so they can see 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.000
 see I cut his hair for some 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.280
 Stay tuned. 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.560
 so sometimes we also have to learn 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:26.860
 some tricks because not always 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.970
 always we have the material in own home 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.960
 It's to make us nail decoration. 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:50.289
 but if we are creative 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:56.349
 We get there and here to finish. 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:57.639
 Let's spend this day will stay still. 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.849
 more beautiful 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:04.020
 to finish this is ready 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:04.020
 it's already dry 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:13.630
 Look, I hope you liked it. 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:16.210
