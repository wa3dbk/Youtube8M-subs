00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.549 

some<00:00:08.849> people<00:00:09.179> think<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.900> ligature<00:00:10.200> makes

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
some people think that a ligature makes

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.169 
some people think that a ligature makes
a<00:00:10.679> difference<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> sound<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.700> saxophone

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
a difference to the sound of a saxophone

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.839 
a difference to the sound of a saxophone
and<00:00:12.480> some<00:00:12.809> don't<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.349> believe<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.580> if<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
and some don't I believe that if the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.820 
and some don't I believe that if the
ligature<00:00:15.269> read<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.839> mouthpiece<00:00:16.289> aren't

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
ligature read and mouthpiece aren't

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.950 
ligature read and mouthpiece aren't
damaged<00:00:17.220> or<00:00:17.430> distorted<00:00:18.000> then<00:00:18.359> all<00:00:18.570> ligature

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
damaged or distorted then all ligature

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.450 
damaged or distorted then all ligature
should<00:00:19.289> sound<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> same<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.160> other<00:00:20.250> words

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
should sound the same in other words

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.820 
should sound the same in other words
you're<00:00:21.000> getting<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.600> optimal<00:00:22.080> sound<00:00:22.350> out<00:00:22.769> of

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
you're getting the optimal sound out of

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.250 
you're getting the optimal sound out of
the<00:00:23.010> instrument<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:27.109> depending<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the instrument but depending on the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.140 
the instrument but depending on the
state<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.590> your<00:00:28.830> Reed<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.250> male<00:00:29.429> piece<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.970> is

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
state of your Reed and male piece it is

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.030 
state of your Reed and male piece it is
possible<00:00:30.660> for<00:00:31.080> different<00:00:31.380> ligatures<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
possible for different ligatures to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.030 
possible for different ligatures to
cause<00:00:32.250> different<00:00:32.669> sounds<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.930> let's<00:00:34.680> look<00:00:34.890> at

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
cause different sounds so let's look at

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.010 
cause different sounds so let's look at
how<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.309> might<00:00:35.550> be

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.330 

here<00:00:41.020> we<00:00:41.230> can<00:00:41.350> see<00:00:41.560> a<00:00:41.590> cross-section<00:00:42.220> of<00:00:42.250> a

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
here we can see a cross-section of a

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.330 
here we can see a cross-section of a
mouth<00:00:42.550> piece<00:00:42.760> with<00:00:43.180> a<00:00:43.210> nice<00:00:43.450> flat<00:00:43.780> table<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
mouth piece with a nice flat table the

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.520 
mouth piece with a nice flat table the
read<00:00:45.580> is<00:00:45.820> that<00:00:45.880> walk<00:00:46.180> to<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.450> swollen<00:00:46.720> at<00:00:46.960> all<00:00:47.140> so

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
read is that walk to a swollen at all so

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.170 
read is that walk to a swollen at all so
there's<00:00:47.740> a<00:00:47.800> good<00:00:47.950> seal<00:00:48.220> between<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.700> read<00:00:48.970> and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
there's a good seal between the read and

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.180 
there's a good seal between the read and
the<00:00:49.450> table<00:00:49.810> of<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.960> mouthpiece<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.860> as<00:00:54.040> you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
the table of the mouthpiece and as you

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.310 
the table of the mouthpiece and as you
can<00:00:54.340> see<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.730> ligature<00:00:55.120> fits<00:00:55.630> the<00:00:55.810> contour<00:00:56.230> of

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
can see the ligature fits the contour of

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.030 
can see the ligature fits the contour of
the<00:00:56.440> read<00:00:56.590> nicely<00:00:58.110> but<00:00:59.110> let's<00:00:59.380> look<00:00:59.680> at<00:00:59.890> what

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
the read nicely but let's look at what

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.860 
the read nicely but let's look at what
happens<00:01:00.370> if<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.820> mouthpiece<00:01:01.270> table<00:01:01.720> is

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
happens if the mouthpiece table is

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.360 
happens if the mouthpiece table is
actually<00:01:02.500> concave<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.530> can<00:01:05.680> see<00:01:05.890> we<00:01:06.220> no

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
actually concave as you can see we no

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.070 
actually concave as you can see we no
longer<00:01:06.400> have<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.030> seal<00:01:07.270> between<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.870> Reed

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
longer have the seal between the Reed

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.280 
longer have the seal between the Reed
and<00:01:08.260> the<00:01:08.500> mouthpiece<00:01:08.530> table<00:01:09.900> let's<00:01:10.900> see<00:01:11.110> what

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
and the mouthpiece table let's see what

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.170 
and the mouthpiece table let's see what
happens<00:01:11.650> if<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.070> ligature<00:01:12.490> applies<00:01:12.850> pressure

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
happens if the ligature applies pressure

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.600 
happens if the ligature applies pressure
at<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:13.630> sides<00:01:13.920> well<00:01:14.920> it<00:01:15.310> doesn't<00:01:15.490> actually

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
at the sides well it doesn't actually

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.719 
at the sides well it doesn't actually
help<00:01:15.910> at<00:01:16.119> all<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:17.619> now<00:01:17.770> suppose<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.340> ligature

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
help at all but now suppose the ligature

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.969 
help at all but now suppose the ligature
pressure<00:01:19.000> is<00:01:19.540> in<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.900> center<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:20.740> can

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
pressure is in the center this can

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.370 
pressure is in the center this can
actually<00:01:21.310> help<00:01:21.520> by<00:01:22.090> pushing<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.630> read<00:01:22.810> into

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
actually help by pushing the read into

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.260 
actually help by pushing the read into
the<00:01:23.500> concave<00:01:23.920> table<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.490> creating<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.210> seal

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the concave table and creating the seal

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.359 
the concave table and creating the seal
okay<00:01:28.270> but<00:01:28.810> what<00:01:28.930> if<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.110> table<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.590> flat<00:01:29.830> and

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
okay but what if the table is flat and

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.060 
okay but what if the table is flat and
the<00:01:30.520> reed<00:01:30.729> is<00:01:30.910> swollen<00:01:31.560> ideally<00:01:32.560> you'd<00:01:32.860> work

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
the reed is swollen ideally you'd work

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.440 
the reed is swollen ideally you'd work
on<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.340> reed<00:01:33.490> as<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:33.759> showed<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.000> in<00:01:34.360> the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
on the reed as I showed you in the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.870 
on the reed as I showed you in the
previous<00:01:34.570> tutorial<00:01:35.380> however<00:01:35.770> let's<00:01:36.400> see<00:01:36.640> how

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
previous tutorial however let's see how

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.840 
previous tutorial however let's see how
the<00:01:36.940> ligature<00:01:37.450> affects<00:01:37.900> this<00:01:38.140> situation<00:01:38.850> well

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
the ligature affects this situation well

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.870 
the ligature affects this situation well
a<00:01:40.030> ligature<00:01:40.509> that<00:01:40.570> applies<00:01:40.990> even<00:01:41.290> pressure

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
a ligature that applies even pressure

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.680 
a ligature that applies even pressure
doesn't<00:01:42.880> seem<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.210> help<00:01:43.330> at<00:01:43.509> all

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
doesn't seem to help at all

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.300 
doesn't seem to help at all
and<00:01:46.690> this<00:01:46.840> time<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.560> ligature<00:01:47.950> applying

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
and this time the ligature applying

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.160 
and this time the ligature applying
pressure<00:01:48.550> to<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.910> center<00:01:49.330> doesn't<00:01:50.020> help

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
pressure to the center doesn't help

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.340 
pressure to the center doesn't help
either

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.080 

but<00:01:53.350> with<00:01:53.500> pressure<00:01:53.740> from<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.130> edges<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.910> can

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
but with pressure from the edges you can

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.880 
but with pressure from the edges you can
see<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.509> ligature<00:01:55.869> can<00:01:56.020> push<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.380> reed<00:01:56.590> down

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
see the ligature can push the reed down

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.230 
see the ligature can push the reed down
to<00:01:57.310> form<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:57.700> nice<00:01:57.850> seal<00:01:58.179> with<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.450> mouthpiece

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.520 

so<00:02:06.240> next<00:02:06.420> time<00:02:06.690> you're<00:02:06.900> trying<00:02:07.110> out<00:02:07.350> an

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so next time you're trying out an

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.710 
so next time you're trying out an
expensive<00:02:08.130> ligature<00:02:08.550> try<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.090> work<00:02:09.330> out<00:02:09.570> if

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
expensive ligature try to work out if

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.540 
expensive ligature try to work out if
it's<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.290> better<00:02:10.619> sounding<00:02:11.100> ligature

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
it's really a better sounding ligature

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.820 
it's really a better sounding ligature
or<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.240> just<00:02:12.270> addressing<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.080> symptoms<00:02:13.350> of

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
or is it just addressing the symptoms of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.460 
or is it just addressing the symptoms of
a<00:02:13.980> read<00:02:14.220> or<00:02:14.430> mouthpiece<00:02:14.910> problem<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.900> ideally

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
a read or mouthpiece problem and ideally
