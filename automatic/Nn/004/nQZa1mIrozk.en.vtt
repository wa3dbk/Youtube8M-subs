00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:11.400
 Today I want to talk to you on the news 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:13.500
 today of the new global digital currency 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.379
 some of you have asked me what 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.779
 I think that somewhat the euro as the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.570
 dollar like other currencies go to 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.380
 disappear the process is going to be long 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.869
 but the goal is this first of all 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.420
 what governments will do to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.260
 from those who direct in the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.449
 shadow then the different countries what 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.000
 they are going to do is that all the currency that 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.150
 is in circulation is going to be converted 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.720
 in digital currency you have already seen 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.430
 that until now we have 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.129
 money or we carry money in your pocket 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.339
 and apart we carry our cards 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.589
 I debit our credit cards that 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.960
 is what happens when we pay with a 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.989
 credit card or a card 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 I automatically debit the same system 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.530
 know where we have been that we have 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.409
 bought that we have consumed and everything 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.940
 what we have done because we have 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.510
 paid all the money 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.580
 and plastic money that was called 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.870
 well now as you have already 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.600
 see in different media 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.310
 and possibly you use it there's a lot 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.550
 people who start paying with their 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.800
 mobile phone the mobile phone is 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.840
 associated with your bank account and no longer 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.720
 plastic card is needed but to 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.180
 from a code a pin code can 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.550
 make your payments what does this do 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.310
 what this does is that there's also 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:46.270
 a control of everything we do everything 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.480
 what we consume and everything we live 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.510
 in our day to day, there is a 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.420
 problem that is the money that we carry 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.070
 in your pocket the money in cash 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.400
 governments are already talking about it being a 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.770
 unnecessary expense that the possibility of 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.530
 that we take the money for issues of 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.170
 security is a high level that money 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.100
 of paper spoils but what they 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.500
 they want to hide us 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.960
 is that what they want is to know what 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.800
 what citizens do 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.920
 it's not hard to think that if I have a 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.090
 let's put 10 dollars or 10 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.850
 euros nobody knows what I do if I 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.270
 I drink a beer if I buy a 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.850
 particular publication nobody knows the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.890
 same system does not know so there is 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.990
 a series of money that is the money that 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.050
 We carry cash when we pay in 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.860
 metallic that they do not know what 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.130
 do their citizens with that money if 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.640
 the money everything digital would know the 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.120
 likes the whims the vices and the 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.280
 trends of all citizens of the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.770
 world 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.750
 this is what they want to have a control 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.780
 absolute would also be a way to 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.080
 avoid therefore the exchange of money by 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.030
 black work or work of this from I you 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.130
 So I do this little work or I make you 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.760
 this and in return 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.950
 I give x money I sell do not know one 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.990
 computer a bicycle whatever and there 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.860
 that exchange of money for some 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.290
 esp object that with legal money but that 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.990
 the same system can not feed 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.300
 in addition there is one thing clear the money that 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.150
 We carry in our pockets, let's say I 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.870
 I'm for a week with ten euros 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.220
 or ten dollars in your pocket those ten 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:46.060
 dollars or 10 euros are not working 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.030
 within the system, that is, if I 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.770
 I have everything in digital although I do not use 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.560
 those 10 dollars or 10 euros 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.660
 and that money is used to make 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.940
 purchases of shares for sales 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.670
 bank exchanges gun purchases 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.210
 or whatever it is but instead it's in 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.930
 my pocket not the idea is to create a 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.550
 unique digital currency where everything is 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.830
 digital therefore everything we do 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.280
 spend very controlled everything will be 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.770
 absolute control but to get to that 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.200
 single currency would first have to fall what 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.910
 that the dollar would be the euro and all that 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.520
 there are many who say that it is already 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.550
 talking about the fall of the markets of 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.530
 dollar currency but I'm not 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.460
 supporter of that I think they're going to be 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.680
 much smarter I think that first they go 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.590
 to make citizens use their 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.180
 mobiles then maybe the whole chip 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.850
 a series of payments that all the money 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.950
 it becomes increasingly more digital and 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.580
 when the money is already completely 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.880
 digital or quasi digital a coin 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.600
 with a certain value that is so 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.730
 it will be the single currency 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.020
 what is clear is that everyone 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.450
 those that you have asked me about 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.790
 the issue of whether the cash 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.800
 it's going to disappear it 's clear that it's going to 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.930
 disappear and everything will be digital 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.500
 because they want to know what we do with 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.680
 each of the coins we carry in 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.270
 our pocket also if it is not in 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.380
 our pocket but it is in the 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.180
 system 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.890
 those same currencies that are our 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.680
 as the money we can have in the 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.960
 bank with that money now that you have it 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.050
 kept in the bank is not really 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.330
 in the bank but you are buying 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.690
 merchandise is buying weapons is 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.310
 making transactions and is doing 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.100
 speculation and that's what they want that 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.350
 our cash ball 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.900
 system to have us very very 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.200
 controlled who has told us about 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.270
