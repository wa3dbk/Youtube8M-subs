know I think rubbed a lot of people the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.420 
know I think rubbed a lot of people the
wrong<00:02:54.320> way<00:02:54.940> but<00:02:56.440> who<00:02:57.440> knows<00:02:57.650> what's<00:02:58.220> going<00:02:58.370> to

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
wrong way but who knows what's going to

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.800 
wrong way but who knows what's going to
happen<00:02:58.700> from<00:02:58.850> here<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.180> next<00:02:59.270> couple<00:02:59.570> of<00:02:59.660> days

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
happen from here the next couple of days

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.290 
happen from here the next couple of days
are<00:03:00.230> going<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.710> be<00:03:00.770> really<00:03:01.070> really<00:03:01.100> big<00:03:01.490> but<00:03:01.820> I

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
are going to be really really big but I

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.390 
are going to be really really big but I
think<00:03:02.840> it's<00:03:02.960> gonna<00:03:03.050> be<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.230> big<00:03:03.470> blow<00:03:03.740> for<00:03:03.980> us<00:03:04.100> to
