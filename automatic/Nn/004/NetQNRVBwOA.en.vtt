00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
would talk a little bit about importing

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.900 
would talk a little bit about importing
in<00:00:09.450> Illustrator<00:00:10.110> files<00:00:10.550> because<00:00:11.550> it's<00:00:11.730> come

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
in Illustrator files because it's come

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.709 
in Illustrator files because it's come
up<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.150> little<00:00:12.240> bit<00:00:12.450> on<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.630> forms<00:00:12.929> recently<00:00:13.440> so

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
up a little bit on the forms recently so

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.240 
up a little bit on the forms recently so
let's<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.960> go<00:00:16.109> ahead<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.350> do<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.680> an<00:00:16.859> anime

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
let's just go ahead and do this an anime

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.630 
let's just go ahead and do this an anime
pro<00:00:17.609> but<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> same<00:00:18.810> thing<00:00:19.050> would<00:00:19.260> apply

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
pro but the same thing would apply

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.080 
pro but the same thing would apply
whether<00:00:20.640> you're<00:00:21.420> using<00:00:21.960> anime<00:00:22.859> Pro<00:00:23.160> animate

whether you're using anime Pro animate
or<00:00:24.420> harmony<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:26.390> let's<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.689> get<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> scene

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
or harmony so let's just get a scene

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.849 
or harmony so let's just get a scene
file<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.720> now<00:00:30.720> one<00:00:31.560> thing<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
file going in here and now one thing to

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.760 
file going in here and now one thing to
be<00:00:31.980> aware<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.520> you're<00:00:32.640> importing<00:00:33.149> in

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
be aware of when you're importing in

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.290 
be aware of when you're importing in
Illustrator<00:00:34.770> Swift<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:36.059> PDF<00:00:36.600> files<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.380> that

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
Illustrator Swift or PDF files is that

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.360 
Illustrator Swift or PDF files is that
they<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.809> not<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.290> same<00:00:40.530> as<00:00:40.829> importing<00:00:41.280> an

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
they are not the same as importing an

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.549 
they are not the same as importing an
image<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.879> when<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.180> import<00:00:42.540> an<00:00:42.690> image<00:00:42.809> it

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
image in when you import an image it

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.670 
image in when you import an image it
comes<00:00:44.070> directly<00:00:44.820> into<00:00:45.090> your<00:00:45.420> scene<00:00:46.020> into<00:00:46.559> your

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
comes directly into your scene into your

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.420 
comes directly into your scene into your
timeline<00:00:47.809> now<00:00:48.809> when<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.200> import<00:00:49.649> instead<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
timeline now when you import instead and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.639 
timeline now when you import instead and
when<00:00:50.520> you're<00:00:50.670> importing<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.449> swift<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.230> PDF

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
when you're importing in a swift a PDF

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.569 
when you're importing in a swift a PDF
or<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:54.379> illustrator<00:00:55.379> file<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.340> actually

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
or a illustrator file what it actually

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.150 
or a illustrator file what it actually
does<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.629> creates<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.469> template<00:00:58.949> out<00:00:59.129> of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
does is it creates a template out of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.459 
does is it creates a template out of
that<00:00:59.370> file<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.910> can't<00:01:00.629> bring<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> directly

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that file it can't bring it directly

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.349 
that file it can't bring it directly
into<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> scene<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.550> got<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.969> bring<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> in

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
into the scene it's got to bring it in

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.500 
into the scene it's got to bring it in
stand<00:01:03.629> into<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:04.290> library<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:06.210> why

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
stand into your library so that's why

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.320 
stand into your library so that's why
when<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> go<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> file<00:01:07.409> import<00:01:08.030> you'll<00:01:09.030> see

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
when you go to file import you'll see

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.120 
when you go to file import you'll see
that<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.900> grayed<00:01:10.170> out<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.680> because<00:01:10.890> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that it's grayed out here because it

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.789 
that it's grayed out here because it
says<00:01:11.340> Swift<00:01:12.090> illustrator<00:01:12.570> files<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.229> library

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
says Swift illustrator files to library

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.830 
says Swift illustrator files to library
it's<00:01:14.520> got<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> put<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> library<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it's got to put it in the library it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.330 
it's got to put it in the library it
can't<00:01:16.170> bring<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:16.650> into<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> scene

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
can't bring it right into the scene

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.060 
can't bring it right into the scene
directly<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.890> want

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
directly so because of that if we want

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
directly so because of that if we want
to<00:01:20.100> import<00:01:20.430> illustrator<00:01:21.000> files<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:22.259> we

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
to import illustrator files in then we

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070 
to import illustrator files in then we
can<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.799> here<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.340> our<00:01:23.729> library<00:01:24.030> let<00:01:24.869> me<00:01:24.930> get

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
can do it here in our library let me get

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840 
can do it here in our library let me get
the<00:01:25.170> right<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.470> modify<00:01:25.650> my<00:01:25.890> library<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.759> I'll

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the right to modify my library and I'll

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.550 
the right to modify my library and I'll
also<00:01:27.030> create<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.479> new<00:01:27.630> folder<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.439> so

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
also create a new folder in here just so

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.730 
also create a new folder in here just so
that<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.540> one<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.900> use<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.320> show

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that we have one that I can use to show

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.480 
that we have one that I can use to show
this<00:01:31.920> off<00:01:32.130> here

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this off here

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.899 
this off here
now<00:01:33.240> let's<00:01:33.990> maybe<00:01:34.560> even<00:01:34.979> rename<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
now let's maybe even rename this and

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.090 
now let's maybe even rename this and
let's<00:01:36.060> trader<00:01:36.920> test<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.079> when<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.799> have

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
let's trader test and then when you have

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.460 
let's trader test and then when you have
the<00:01:41.340> library<00:01:41.610> folder<00:01:42.240> selected<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the library folder selected that you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.920 
the library folder selected that you
want<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> import<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.189> into<00:01:44.280> now<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
want to import it into now if you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.920 
want to import it into now if you
absolutely<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:47.250> select<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.759> again<00:01:47.790> now<00:01:48.450> if

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
absolutely just select that again now if

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.080 
absolutely just select that again now if
you<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> file<00:01:49.829> import<00:01:50.100> you'll<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:50.939> no

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
you go to file import you'll see it's no

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.819 
you go to file import you'll see it's no
longer<00:01:51.119> grayed<00:01:51.659> out<00:01:51.689> because<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.350> knows<00:01:52.560> where

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
longer grayed out because it knows where

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
longer grayed out because it knows where
you<00:01:52.920> want<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> put<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.570> that's<00:01:54.720> what<00:01:54.810> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you want to put it so that's what you

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:54.379 
recovery pallet here from Illustrator

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.350 
recovery pallet here from Illustrator
now<00:05:54.620> with<00:05:54.889> the<00:05:55.189> new<00:05:55.370> colors<00:05:55.699> loaded<00:05:56.060> in<00:05:56.149> there

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
now with the new colors loaded in there

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.499 
now with the new colors loaded in there
so<00:05:56.659> if<00:05:56.899> you<00:05:57.740> need<00:05:58.189> to<00:05:58.219> go<00:05:58.399> back<00:05:58.610> and<00:05:58.879> adjust<00:05:59.120> a

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
so if you need to go back and adjust a

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.079 
so if you need to go back and adjust a
color<00:05:59.750> on<00:05:59.990> there<00:06:00.229> then<00:06:00.620> it's<00:06:01.490> going<00:06:01.699> to<00:06:01.759> dress

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.089 
color on there then it's going to dress

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:03.610 
color on there then it's going to dress
it<00:06:02.270> in<00:06:02.360> your<00:06:02.509> scene<00:06:02.750> file<00:06:02.960> as<00:06:03.080> well<00:06:03.289> it<00:06:03.439> looks

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
it in your scene file as well it looks

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.079 
it in your scene file as well it looks
like<00:06:03.770> I<00:06:03.800> maybe<00:06:04.039> I'm<00:06:04.159> not<00:06:04.279> using<00:06:04.520> that<00:06:04.729> color<00:06:04.909> so

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:05.089 
like I maybe I'm not using that color so

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:06.670 
like I maybe I'm not using that color so
let's<00:06:05.240> choose<00:06:05.449> the<00:06:05.569> red<00:06:05.750> one<00:06:05.960> here<00:06:06.259> there<00:06:06.589> we

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
let's choose the red one here there we

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.079 
let's choose the red one here there we
go

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089 
go

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.990 
go
so<00:06:08.620> I<00:06:09.620> mean<00:06:09.919> that's<00:06:10.129> the<00:06:10.250> basics<00:06:10.610> of<00:06:10.759> working

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
so I mean that's the basics of working

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.059 
so I mean that's the basics of working
with<00:06:11.300> Illustrator<00:06:11.839> files<00:06:12.110> you<00:06:12.740> can<00:06:12.860> either

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 
with Illustrator files you can either

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:16.540 
with Illustrator files you can either
import<00:06:13.430> them<00:06:13.849> in<00:06:14.060> as<00:06:14.240> flat<00:06:14.659> images<00:06:15.550> directly

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
import them in as flat images directly

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.399 
import them in as flat images directly
into<00:06:16.759> your<00:06:16.819> library<00:06:17.240> or<00:06:17.479> you<00:06:17.960> can<00:06:18.080> use<00:06:18.259> the

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
into your library or you can use the

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.079 
into your library or you can use the
script<00:06:18.770> run<00:06:19.129> the<00:06:19.279> script<00:06:19.610> and<00:06:19.819> then<00:06:19.969> you'll

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:20.089 
script run the script and then you'll

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:22.540 
script run the script and then you'll
have<00:06:20.240> to<00:06:20.389> open<00:06:20.569> library<00:06:21.289> to<00:06:21.889> find<00:06:22.099> the<00:06:22.339> place

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
have to open library to find the place

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.519 
have to open library to find the place
where<00:06:22.759> you<00:06:22.849> save<00:06:23.060> your<00:06:23.270> files<00:06:23.479> there<00:06:23.839> but<00:06:24.409> this

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:24.529 
where you save your files there but this

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:25.990 
where you save your files there but this
is<00:06:24.680> pretty<00:06:24.889> handy<00:06:25.069> to<00:06:25.310> have<00:06:25.399> in<00:06:25.580> here<00:06:25.819> because

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
is pretty handy to have in here because

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.369 
is pretty handy to have in here because
then<00:06:26.270> you've<00:06:26.389> got<00:06:26.599> your<00:06:26.750> illustrator<00:06:27.110> files

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:27.379 
then you've got your illustrator files

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:29.439 
then you've got your illustrator files
all<00:06:27.680> laid<00:06:28.159> out<00:06:28.189> in<00:06:28.339> one<00:06:28.639> directory<00:06:28.789> so<00:06:29.330> it's

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:29.449 
all laid out in one directory so it's

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.240 
all laid out in one directory so it's
actually<00:06:29.750> very<00:06:29.870> convenient<00:06:30.529> to<00:06:30.710> have<00:06:30.889> them<00:06:31.099> in

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
actually very convenient to have them in

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.760 
actually very convenient to have them in
the<00:06:31.370> open<00:06:31.639> library<00:06:31.819> section<00:06:32.649> because<00:06:33.649> you

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
the open library section because you

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.499 
the open library section because you
don't<00:06:33.919> have<00:06:34.099> to<00:06:34.250> import<00:06:34.610> them<00:06:34.819> separately

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
don't have to import them separately

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.290 
don't have to import them separately
into<00:06:35.719> each<00:06:36.219> file<00:06:37.219> or<00:06:37.490> scene<00:06:37.729> file<00:06:37.969> that<00:06:38.180> you're

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
into each file or scene file that you're

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.269 
into each file or scene file that you're
going<00:06:38.479> to<00:06:38.509> use

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:39.279 
going to use

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:42.269 
going to use
so<00:06:40.269> just<00:06:40.479> one<00:06:40.629> last<00:06:40.809> point<00:06:41.169> to<00:06:41.229> mention<00:06:42.159> before

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:42.279 
so just one last point to mention before

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:44.039 
so just one last point to mention before
we<00:06:42.519> leave<00:06:42.849> the<00:06:43.029> subject<00:06:43.059> of<00:06:43.539> Illustrator

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:44.049 
we leave the subject of Illustrator

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:46.559 
we leave the subject of Illustrator
files<00:06:44.409> is<00:06:44.739> when<00:06:45.489> you're<00:06:45.609> saving<00:06:45.909> these<00:06:46.269> files

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:46.569 
files is when you're saving these files

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:49.079 
files is when you're saving these files
out<00:06:46.869> you<00:06:47.289> need<00:06:47.469> to<00:06:47.619> save<00:06:47.889> them<00:06:48.099> out<00:06:48.279> in<00:06:48.549> the

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:49.089 
out you need to save them out in the

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:51.749 
out you need to save them out in the
legacy<00:06:49.569> format<00:06:50.049> so<00:06:50.859> that<00:06:51.039> it<00:06:51.129> saved<00:06:51.369> out<00:06:51.579> as

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 
legacy format so that it saved out as

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.779 
legacy format so that it saved out as
one<00:06:52.149> of<00:06:52.179> the<00:06:52.299> older<00:06:52.629> formats<00:06:53.309> because<00:06:54.309> of<00:06:54.669> the

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:54.789 
one of the older formats because of the

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.409 
one of the older formats because of the
fact<00:06:55.029> that<00:06:55.179> some<00:06:55.689> of<00:06:55.809> the<00:06:55.899> newer<00:06:56.819> CS<00:06:57.819> file

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
fact that some of the newer CS file

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.309 
fact that some of the newer CS file
formats<00:06:59.259> are<00:06:59.819> supporting<00:07:00.819> new<00:07:01.509> things<00:07:01.899> that

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 
formats are supporting new things that

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.899 
formats are supporting new things that
we<00:07:02.649> can't<00:07:03.099> support<00:07:03.309> in<00:07:03.819> this<00:07:04.319> version<00:07:05.319> so<00:07:05.909> you

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:06.909 
we can't support in this version so you

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:08.309 
we can't support in this version so you
know<00:07:07.029> anything<00:07:07.329> that<00:07:07.479> has<00:07:07.719> complicated

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 
know anything that has complicated

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.169 
know anything that has complicated
effects<00:07:08.739> blurs<00:07:09.159> gradients<00:07:09.699> that<00:07:09.729> sort<00:07:10.089> of

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:10.179 
effects blurs gradients that sort of

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:11.819 
effects blurs gradients that sort of
thing<00:07:10.359> will<00:07:10.629> not<00:07:10.809> be<00:07:10.959> able<00:07:11.109> to<00:07:11.199> be<00:07:11.289> imported<00:07:11.709> in

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:11.829 
thing will not be able to be imported in

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:14.219 
thing will not be able to be imported in
so<00:07:12.129> when<00:07:12.849> you're<00:07:12.999> saving<00:07:13.269> it<00:07:13.509> out<00:07:13.659> save<00:07:13.989> it<00:07:14.139> out

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:14.229 
so when you're saving it out save it out

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:15.989 
so when you're saving it out save it out
as<00:07:14.289> a<00:07:14.409> legacy<00:07:14.799> format<00:07:15.339> and<00:07:15.549> make<00:07:15.759> sure<00:07:15.909> you

00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:15.999 
as a legacy format and make sure you

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:18.600 
as a legacy format and make sure you
check<00:07:16.360> the<00:07:16.569> option<00:07:17.009> to<00:07:18.009> make<00:07:18.159> it<00:07:18.279> PDF

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
check the option to make it PDF

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.869 
check the option to make it PDF
compatible<00:07:19.239> and<00:07:19.799> that<00:07:20.799> should<00:07:21.099> allow<00:07:21.339> you<00:07:21.549> to

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 
compatible and that should allow you to

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:24.569 
compatible and that should allow you to
import<00:07:22.449> those<00:07:22.629> files<00:07:22.989> in<00:07:23.229> here<00:07:23.409> and<00:07:23.619> if<00:07:24.489> you
