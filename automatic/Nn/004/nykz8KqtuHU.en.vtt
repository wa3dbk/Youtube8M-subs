00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
like a bug in the game is it's not that

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.479 
like a bug in the game is it's not that
simple<00:03:19.900> you<00:03:20.110> don't<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.769> don't<00:03:20.920> just<00:03:21.100> change<00:03:21.160> a

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
simple you don't you don't just change a

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.820 
simple you don't you don't just change a
number<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.480> just<00:03:22.750> it's<00:03:22.959> fixed<00:03:23.680> like

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
number and it just it's fixed like

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.620 
number and it just it's fixed like
sometimes<00:03:24.040> when<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.670> fix<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.030> thing<00:03:25.209> it

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
sometimes when you fix the thing it

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.660 
sometimes when you fix the thing it
might<00:03:25.870> create<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.290> new<00:03:26.620> glitch<00:03:26.890> or<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.370> couple

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
might create a new glitch or a couple

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.160 
might create a new glitch or a couple
new<00:03:27.880> glitches<00:03:28.209> when<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.510> have<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.750> fix<00:03:28.900> those

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
new glitches when you have to fix those

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.410 
new glitches when you have to fix those
or<00:03:29.860> sometimes<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.519> glitch<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:31.000> properly

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
or sometimes the glitch is not properly

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.539 
or sometimes the glitch is not properly
fixed<00:03:31.720> here<00:03:32.080> you<00:03:32.260> can<00:03:32.410> still<00:03:32.620> get<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.459> a

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
fixed here you can still get it in a

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.940 
fixed here you can still get it in a
different<00:03:33.730> way<00:03:33.910> so<00:03:34.060> sometimes<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.260> takes<00:03:35.410> like

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
different way so sometimes it takes like

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.070 
different way so sometimes it takes like
weeks<00:03:36.250> or<00:03:36.489> months<00:03:36.790> just<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.209> fix<00:03:37.450> one<00:03:37.690> thing<00:03:37.720> so

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
weeks or months just to fix one thing so

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.990 
weeks or months just to fix one thing so
it's<00:03:38.230> not<00:03:38.440> just<00:03:38.500> like<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:38.950> simple<00:03:39.370> process

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
it's not just like a simple process

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.180 
it's not just like a simple process
where<00:03:40.390> you're<00:03:40.660> like<00:03:40.810> okay<00:03:41.200> change<00:03:41.769> that<00:03:41.980> and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
where you're like okay change that and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.550 
where you're like okay change that and
it's<00:03:42.670> done<00:03:43.000> yeah<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:44.019> doesn't<00:03:44.200> work<00:03:44.410> like<00:03:44.500> that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
it's done yeah it doesn't work like that

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.330 
it's done yeah it doesn't work like that
so<00:03:45.600> fixing<00:03:46.600> game<00:03:46.810> or<00:03:47.110> making<00:03:47.530> game<00:03:47.799> perfect<00:03:48.220> is

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
so fixing game or making game perfect is

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.009 
so fixing game or making game perfect is
completely<00:03:48.850> impossible<00:03:48.940> while<00:03:49.480> fixing<00:03:49.750> games

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
completely impossible while fixing games

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.750 
completely impossible while fixing games
not<00:03:50.260> impossible<00:03:50.530> but<00:03:50.799> making<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.370> completely

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
not impossible but making it completely

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.280 
not impossible but making it completely
perfect<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.239> impossible<00:03:52.600> but<00:03:52.989> anyways

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
perfect it is impossible but anyways

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.500 
perfect it is impossible but anyways
