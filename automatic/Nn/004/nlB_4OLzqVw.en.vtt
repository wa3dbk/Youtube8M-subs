00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
decided to buy one for me but after a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.709 
decided to buy one for me but after a
year<00:00:44.809> I<00:00:45.020> went<00:00:45.379> on<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.649> other<00:00:45.770> things<00:00:46.539> it<00:00:47.539> had

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
year I went on to other things it had

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.970 
year I went on to other things it had
been<00:00:47.899> 40<00:00:48.590> years<00:00:48.620> since<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.820> rode<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.420> last<00:00:50.629> time

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
so it took almost a year to get myself

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.209 
so it took almost a year to get myself
into<00:00:53.930> good<00:00:54.289> enough<00:00:54.469> condition<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.949> where<00:00:55.190> I

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
into good enough condition to where I

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:56.680 
into good enough condition to where I
could<00:00:55.309> ride<00:00:55.640> for<00:00:55.879> reasonable<00:00:56.270> distance

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
could ride for reasonable distance

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.410 
could ride for reasonable distance
