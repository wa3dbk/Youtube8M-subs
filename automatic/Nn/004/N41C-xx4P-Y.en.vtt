00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.730
 be sporting in being miranda 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.270
 ah 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.980
 and in the world of rhythmic gymnastics 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.600
 six girls who make up the team 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.700
 vita flumen club competition 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.210
 will receive the visit of the champion of 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.279
 world of 1998 paula uribe who developed 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.560
 a master class because look is a club 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.820
 that has just been mounted does well 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.050
 in summer the base that I have seen is very 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.640
 good girls have very good 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.290
 conditions and they really want to 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.540
 learn the work they are doing 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.090
 the coaches is good because the 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.670
 girls to the minimum that you give them a 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.170
 directrix of a stretch of a jump 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.180
 they follow you to the first one that means 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.450
 that the work they are doing 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.160
 daily is good and I think there is 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.440
 that having patience just started 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.610
 because in three hours you can not 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.380
 explain everything that is the world of 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.079
 gymnastics we will have done a warm-up 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.020
 specific rhythmic gymnastics with a lot 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.879
 Footwork knees and hip 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.070
 so that girls placement 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.330
 postural that they have be correct we 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.420
 we see for a long time in correcting 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.190
 shoulders neck basic things that at 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.810
 final come from the ballet world of the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.600
 dance 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.420
 of classical ballet has given us a lot 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.470
 we have done stretches of time 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.240
 spagat so girls have a lot 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.670
 flexibility because it is one of the bases 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.110
 very important in rhythmic gymnastics and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.539
 we have done a little bit of technique 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.970
 body rhythmic gymnastics has 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.820
 certain obligations right now are the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.960
 balances jumps and rotations 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.899
 we have all done a little bit of everything 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.000
 a few little jumps 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.520
 balances a few rotations the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.869
 girls have responded perfectly 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.110
 then the work more or less has 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.640
 given the corporal we have done everything 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.810
 the technique of the apparatus would be lacking but 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.909
 Well then they have taught me their 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.590
 exercises and we have corrected what 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.709
 that has given us time if you have thought 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.220
 make another class on another scheduled date 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:02.310
 once a little more advanced 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.860
 I already know maite and moment they take a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.349
 little vita fumen sports club 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.630
 that when they want I come and they gave them a 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.489
 hand what yes it is a bit difficult to 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.959
 combine and carry a club in 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.260
 vitoria I'm training every day 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.060
 but whenever there is a party 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.709
 a day that we do not understand there if I 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.239
 they invite and I'm happy to come 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.430
 been a luxury that you can come up 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.370
 Miranda have participated with the selection 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.829
 Spanish in world championships that 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.260
 remember a little bit of that stage in 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.000
 the most professional field because in the 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.590
 professional field is a little what you 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.379
 commented at the end you remember what 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.110
 good the good things are the compaÃ±eras that you 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.329
 you have from those times the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.299
 results trips you've made 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.640
 8 hours 10 hours of training 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.459
 daily you remember the anecdotes you 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.150
 you remember the fun of the end you've 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.069
 been 34 years dedicated completely to 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.069
 the rhythmic gymnastics but you are dedicated 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.840
 completely to your passion then all 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.349
 the memories for me are good and not 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.000
 only one medal in a world cup that 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.739
 you're wearing a world medal but at 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.810
 end people do not remember you 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.819
 because she has been world champion 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.139
 they remember you because a lot has happened 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.450
 hours 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.519
 We have been partners 24 hours a day 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.079
 then it is what you take the friendship 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.580
 but I guess you're going to remember 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.040
 seville for 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.800
 life man seville of a color 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.960
 special for us brought us a 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.390
 world silver and a gold in the finals 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.440
 then of course we are not going to 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.090
 forget is never a memory that with 15 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.130
 years will be on the top of the podium 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.780
 it is very important 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.910
 now the national team is again 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.970
 up the team coach 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.960
 national was my partner in the 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.460
 world championship and has managed to 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.780
 your girls climb again to the highest 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.580
 of the podium then 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.410
 you have to keep working you have to continue 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.870
 working from small clubs like 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.500
 habitat flumen club small as os 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.750
 we're in vitoria and that's where 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.730
 the girls come out who then go to the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.140
 worldwide then you have to work with 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.060
 them with a lot of affection with a lot 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.709
 patience and with a lot of dedication since 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.410
 that are tiny they go little by little 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.569
 learning each modality in different 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.980
 that has rhythmic gymnastics not the 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.359
 rings and so on etcetera 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.430
 yes at the end 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.199
 the devices are a little marked by the 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.680
 regulations that the federation puts you 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.680
 then as a child, they tend to use more 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.300
 the ball the rope and the hoop and then 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.979
 when the clubs are getting older 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.479
 the tape nevertheless yes that is 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.979
 important that since very little 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.770
 have contact with the five devices 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.139
 of gymnastics even to play 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.300
 break them throw them into the air they do what 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.009
 that is but that they have contact and that 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.110
 get familiar with those devices for 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.710
 that when they are older it does not cost them 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.750
 so much 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.910
 adapt to them the russians you see 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.950
 online videos and from 4 years 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.360
 they're with the tape that looks like they're 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.940
 doing a western loop but good 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.820
 they are working in the end they are doing 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.560
 that the body is familiar to you 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.360
 you see the girls ready to 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.550
 face some competition already in the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.300
 competitive field itself 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:13.200
 well these girls have good things and 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.690
 many advantages in the end is a group more 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.730
 well reduced not because the club is 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.710
 small but because every coach 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.930
 works with a few girls each time 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.810
 then that it greatly facilitates 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.240
 learning for me the work that they have 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.260
 fact from September until now that 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.790
 we are in january 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.770
 It's great then they have two left 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.970
 months to start the championships 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.340
 I think they will be perfectly 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.870
 prepared now they are with the assembly of 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.520
 the exercises 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.710
 we are reviewing a little and marta 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.110
 done a great job so 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.390
 just repeat and repeat and repeat 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.860
 until the ball falls down the 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.720
 music has to be animated has to 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.720
 be fun you have to call 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.249
 public if only the music bores for 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.859
 the people who are watching it 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:57.749
 that is scoring if you clear if 

00:05:55.859 --> 00:05:59.429
 nasty ear input can 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:02.669
 be ahead of you the world champion 

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:04.289
 that in the end you look at it as an obligation 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.169
 Judge looks at him for obligation instead if 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.089
 has a dynamic music that goes with 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.879
 the steps of the gymnast who goes with the 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:13.469
 everything goes a little bit more 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.809
 and they look at you with better eyes 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.309
 paula that has been a pleasure thank you for 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:19.259
 have come to Miranda and even a 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:21.869
 next time agreement I hope that 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.369
 be thank you very soon and nothing more here 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:25.799
 the last hour of the information 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:28.049

00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:32.809
 tomorrow we will return with more sport in the 

00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:32.809
 tuning your 90.5 here in laser
