00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
this and then you can do it like that

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
this and then you can do it like that
and<00:01:06.570> there's<00:01:07.020> another<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.380> that's<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and there's another one that's like a I

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.510 
and there's another one that's like a I
think<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> 3x3<00:01:09.180> square<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:10.590> it's

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
think it's like a 3x3 square and it's

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.030 
think it's like a 3x3 square and it's
it's<00:01:12.240> really<00:01:12.390> simple<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.799> just

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it's really simple but it's it just

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490 
it's really simple but it's it just
changes<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.549> everything<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
changes up everything and it's got the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.830 
changes up everything and it's got the
like<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> honeycomb<00:01:17.460> ask<00:01:17.820> type<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.509> time

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
like the honeycomb ask type of time

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
like the honeycomb ask type of time
right<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.680> course<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.340> does<00:01:20.490> your

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
right here of course it's does your

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.429 
right here of course it's does your
stats<00:01:20.850> bar<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.330> your<00:01:22.110> wife<00:01:22.259> on

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.390 
stats bar up here and your wife on
either<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:22.740> I'm<00:01:22.830> sure<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> could<00:01:23.220> change

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
either but I'm sure you could change

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
either but I'm sure you could change
that<00:01:23.670> only<00:01:24.600> thing<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> doesn't<00:01:24.990> really<00:01:25.170> have

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that only thing it doesn't really have

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.410 
that only thing it doesn't really have
that<00:01:25.830> honeycomb<00:01:26.400> has<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> notification

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that honeycomb has is the notification

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.210 
that honeycomb has is the notification
system<00:01:27.570> where<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.869> tap<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.979> mean
