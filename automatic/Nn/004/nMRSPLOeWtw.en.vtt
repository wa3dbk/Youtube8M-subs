this<00:00:01.350> video<00:00:01.709> will<00:00:01.979> provide<00:00:02.129> you<00:00:02.370> with<00:00:02.610> a

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
this video will provide you with a

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.350 
this video will provide you with a
couple<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.620> ideas<00:00:04.920> or<00:00:05.790> ways<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.620> attach<00:00:07.620> a

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
couple of ideas or ways to attach a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.129 
couple of ideas or ways to attach a
riser<00:00:09.410> to<00:00:10.410> an<00:00:10.590> open<00:00:11.070> marble<00:00:11.969> stairway<00:00:12.660> and

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
riser to an open marble stairway and

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.870 
riser to an open marble stairway and
obviously<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.500> difficult<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.279> can't<00:00:17.640> just

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
obviously it's difficult you can't just

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.900 
obviously it's difficult you can't just
nail<00:00:18.720> like<00:00:19.050> would<00:00:19.380> another<00:00:20.010> piece<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.520> wood<00:00:20.699> to

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
nail like would another piece of wood to

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.480 
nail like would another piece of wood to
it<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.180> close<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.630> off<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.369> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
it and close it off this is going to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.660 
it and close it off this is going to
require<00:00:24.019> some<00:00:25.130> ingenuity<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.279> hopefully

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
require some ingenuity and hopefully

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.000 
require some ingenuity and hopefully
these<00:00:26.910> ideas<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> provide<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.680> in

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
these ideas that I provide you with in

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.100 
these ideas that I provide you with in
this<00:00:29.279> video<00:00:29.609> will<00:00:29.939> spur<00:00:30.539> more<00:00:30.900> ideas<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:32.809> ya<00:00:33.840> so

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
this video will spur more ideas to ya so

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.720 
this video will spur more ideas to ya so
that<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.559> help<00:00:34.739> help<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.100> figure<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.579> out

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that you can help help you figure it out

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.889 
that you can help help you figure it out
so<00:00:35.969> here's<00:00:36.180> basically<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:37.050> method<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.489> can

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
so here's basically one method you can

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.150 
so here's basically one method you can
cut<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.170> board<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:42.230> install<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.620> between

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
cut a board and install it but between

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.819 
cut a board and install it but between
the<00:00:44.700> risers<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.390> thickness<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.200> will<00:00:46.410> leave<00:00:46.620> up

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the risers the thickness I will leave up

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.060 
the risers the thickness I will leave up
to<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.000> actually<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.780> use

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
to you you can actually just use

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.630 
to you you can actually just use
silicone<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:51.020> put<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.199> bead<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.500> silicone<00:00:52.920> on

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
silicone and put a bead of silicone on

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.479 
silicone and put a bead of silicone on
each<00:00:54.059> side<00:00:54.420> if<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.079> wanted<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.980> again

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
each side if you wanted to and again

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.700 
each side if you wanted to and again
this<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.969> might<00:00:57.329> not<00:00:57.510> look<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.899> best<00:00:58.140> so

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this this might not look the best so

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.080 
this this might not look the best so
this<00:00:59.010> isn't<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.730> I'm<00:00:59.850> going<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
this isn't one that I'm going to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.030 
this isn't one that I'm going to
recommend<00:01:00.809> 100%<00:01:03.140> I'm<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> thicker

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
recommend 100% I'm going with a thicker

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
recommend 100% I'm going with a thicker
board<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.580> putting<00:01:05.790> some<00:01:06.000> silicone<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.720> there

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
board and putting some silicone in there

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.450 
board and putting some silicone in there
unless<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.409> figure<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.799> way<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.040> hide

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
unless you can figure out a way to hide

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.550 
unless you can figure out a way to hide
it<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.090> if<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:09.720> grate<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it and if you can then grate and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.230 
it and if you can then grate and
silicone<00:01:11.070> let's<00:01:11.280> not<00:01:11.460> forget<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> lot<00:01:12.090> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
silicone let's not forget a lot of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.140 
silicone let's not forget a lot of
marble<00:01:12.799> installers<00:01:13.799> use<00:01:14.250> different

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
marble installers use different

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
marble installers use different
adhesives<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.290> I'm<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.650> recommending<00:01:17.040> that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
adhesives and I'm not recommending that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.289 
adhesives and I'm not recommending that
you<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.450> use<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> silicone<00:01:19.700> based<00:01:20.700> product

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you have to use a silicone based product

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.170 
you have to use a silicone based product
and<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.380> would<00:01:22.560> definitely<00:01:23.490> check<00:01:23.790> with<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and I would definitely check with the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.990 
and I would definitely check with the
marble<00:01:24.979> manufacturer<00:01:25.979> before<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.640> use<00:01:26.970> any

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
marble manufacturer before you use any

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060 
marble manufacturer before you use any
types<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.720> adhesives<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.470> make<00:01:28.650> sure<00:01:28.829> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
types of adhesives to make sure that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.090 
types of adhesives to make sure that
they<00:01:29.280> don't<00:01:29.490> bleed<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.450> ruin<00:01:30.869> your<00:01:31.100> marble

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
they don't bleed and ruin your marble

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.380 
they don't bleed and ruin your marble
let's<00:01:32.400> start<00:01:32.729> there

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
let's start there

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.530 
let's start there
and<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.500> not<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.250> recommendation<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
and I do not have a recommendation for a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.249 
and I do not have a recommendation for a
specific<00:01:36.990> product<00:01:38.210> so<00:01:39.210> again<00:01:40.079> I'm<00:01:40.229> just

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
specific product so again I'm just

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.469 
specific product so again I'm just
throwing<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.890> some<00:01:41.100> suggestions<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:42.150> there

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
throwing out some suggestions out there

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.880 
throwing out some suggestions out there
I<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.869> never<00:01:43.380> done<00:01:43.950> something<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.890> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
I have never done something like this I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.480 
I have never done something like this I
think<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.909> last<00:01:48.619> example<00:01:49.619> might<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.070> your

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
think the last example might be your

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.050 
think the last example might be your
best<00:01:50.700> bet<00:01:51.590> here's<00:01:52.590> another<00:01:52.740> way<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.670> can

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
best bet here's another way you can

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.800 
best bet here's another way you can
actually<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.509> with<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.689> thinner<00:01:55.110> board<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.810> use

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
actually go with a thinner board and use

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.990 
actually go with a thinner board and use
cove<00:01:58.439> molding<00:01:59.159> half<00:02:00.000> round<00:02:00.530> quarter<00:02:01.530> round

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
cove molding half round quarter round

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.020 
cove molding half round quarter round
molding<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.860> basically<00:02:04.860> seal<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.820> on

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
molding and then basically seal it on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.789 
molding and then basically seal it on
each<00:02:06.299> end<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.750> again<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.170> would<00:02:07.380> require

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
each end and again this would require

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.720 
each end and again this would require
some<00:02:08.280> type<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:09.500> sealant<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.250> something

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
some type of sealant to do something

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.500 
some type of sealant to do something
like<00:02:11.879> this

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
like this

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.500 
like this
and<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.650> see<00:02:13.860> there's<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.459> four<00:02:15.000> pieces<00:02:15.239> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and you can see there's a four pieces of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.420 
and you can see there's a four pieces of
cord<00:02:15.720> around<00:02:15.840> two<00:02:16.349> at<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.620> bottom<00:02:16.950> two<00:02:17.159> at<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
cord around two at the bottom two at the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.580 
cord around two at the bottom two at the
top<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:18.150> keep<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.650> riser<00:02:20.390> from<00:02:21.390> moving<00:02:21.989> and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
top to keep the riser from moving and

top to keep the riser from moving and
here's<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.099> close-up<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:24.540> next<00:02:24.810> picture<00:02:25.110> will

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
here's a close-up the next picture will

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.369 
here's a close-up the next picture will
provide<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.709> with<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> close-up<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.810> again

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
provide you with the close-up and again

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.140 
provide you with the close-up and again
and<00:02:28.620> these<00:02:28.709> are<00:02:28.860> these<00:02:29.099> are<00:02:29.129> just<00:02:29.400> ideas<00:02:29.579> just

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
and these are these are just ideas just

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.610 
and these are these are just ideas just
kind<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.450> throwing<00:02:30.720> them<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:31.049> there<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.349> can

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
kind of throwing them out there you can

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.979 
kind of throwing them out there you can
see<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.370> would<00:02:32.489> have<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.819> somehow<00:02:33.090> use<00:02:33.780> an

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
see and you would have to somehow use an

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.369 
see and you would have to somehow use an
adhesive<00:02:34.879> that<00:02:35.879> would<00:02:36.360> work<00:02:36.540> on<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> marble

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
adhesive that would work on the marble

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.240 
adhesive that would work on the marble
for<00:02:37.680> something<00:02:38.159> like<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:41.659> and<00:02:42.659> here's<00:02:42.989> a

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
for something like this and here's a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.339 
for something like this and here's a
here's<00:02:44.250> my<00:02:44.459> final<00:02:45.060> solution<00:02:45.299> here<00:02:46.109> which

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
here's my final solution here which

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.240 
here's my final solution here which
might<00:02:46.799> actually<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.879> best<00:02:48.150> one<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.859> it

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
might actually be the best one and it

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.740 
might actually be the best one and it
would<00:02:50.370> be<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.670> one<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> would<00:02:51.299> probably

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
would be the one that I would probably

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.780 
would be the one that I would probably
recommend<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.159> would<00:02:53.280> basically<00:02:53.489> be

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
recommend and that would basically be

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.039 
recommend and that would basically be
cutting<00:02:54.359> a<00:02:54.690> board<00:02:55.340> to<00:02:56.340> go<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.540> back<00:02:57.780> it

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
cutting a board to go on the back it

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.830 
cutting a board to go on the back it
would<00:02:58.170> attach<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:59.010> back<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.329> treads

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
would attach to the back of the treads

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.009 
would attach to the back of the treads
and<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:02.700> would<00:03:02.849> just<00:03:02.879> simply<00:03:03.209> drill<00:03:03.629> as<00:03:03.780> many

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
and you would just simply drill as many

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.890 
and you would just simply drill as many
holes<00:03:04.319> as<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.769> felt<00:03:05.099> necessary<00:03:05.540> into<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
holes as you felt necessary into the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.729 
holes as you felt necessary into the
back<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.799> marble<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:09.409> then<00:03:10.409> use

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
back of the marble and then use

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.809 
back of the marble and then use
anchoring<00:03:11.579> screws<00:03:11.790> or<00:03:12.389> epoxies<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.920> fasten

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
anchoring screws or epoxies to fasten

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.689 
anchoring screws or epoxies to fasten
the<00:03:15.030> wood<00:03:15.870> riser<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:17.780> back<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.199> tread

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
the wood riser to the back of the tread

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.309 
the wood riser to the back of the tread
what<00:03:20.699> I<00:03:20.730> would<00:03:20.940> suggest<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.569> a<00:03:21.629> situation<00:03:22.290> like

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
what I would suggest in a situation like

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.030 
what I would suggest in a situation like
this<00:03:22.500> would<00:03:22.980> be<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.220> make<00:03:23.579> one<00:03:23.970> pattern<00:03:25.040> with

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
this would be to make one pattern with

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.949 
this would be to make one pattern with
your<00:03:26.310> holes<00:03:26.579> in<00:03:26.879> it<00:03:27.739> then<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.010> could<00:03:29.959> place

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
your holes in it then you could place

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.729 
your holes in it then you could place
the<00:03:31.440> pattern<00:03:31.769> on<00:03:32.250> each<00:03:33.290> individual<00:03:34.290> tread

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
the pattern on each individual tread

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.640 
the pattern on each individual tread
mark<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.000> holes<00:03:36.269> so<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:37.169> can<00:03:37.379> drill

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
mark the holes so that you can drill

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.800 
mark the holes so that you can drill
them<00:03:37.919> and<00:03:38.280> then<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.299> course<00:03:39.329> you<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:39.690> always

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
them and then of course you can always

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.979 
them and then of course you can always
use<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.199> pattern<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.709> cut<00:03:40.980> out<00:03:41.250> your<00:03:41.989> risers

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
use the pattern to cut out your risers

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.500 
use the pattern to cut out your risers
too<00:03:43.650> but<00:03:43.949> I<00:03:43.980> would<00:03:44.220> suggest<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.879> pattern<00:03:45.269> seems

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
too but I would suggest a pattern seems

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.960 
too but I would suggest a pattern seems
to<00:03:45.690> be<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.959> best<00:03:46.199> way<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:47.400> something<00:03:47.609> like

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
to be the best way for something like

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.960 
to be the best way for something like
this<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:49.650> know<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.250> again<00:03:50.549> with<00:03:50.730> something

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
this you know and again with something

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.939 
this you know and again with something
like<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.540> might<00:03:52.019> not<00:03:52.290> have<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.709> worry

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
like this you might not have to worry

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.879 
like this you might not have to worry
about<00:03:53.870> this<00:03:54.870> like<00:03:55.079> this<00:03:55.319> method<00:03:55.530> right<00:03:55.829> here

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
about this like this method right here

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.830 
about this like this method right here
seems<00:03:56.370> like<00:03:56.519> it's<00:03:56.699> going<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.000> require<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.480> few

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
seems like it's going to require a few

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.490 
seems like it's going to require a few
more<00:03:58.049> tools<00:03:58.609> but<00:03:59.609> it<00:04:00.269> probably<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:01.139> in<00:04:01.379> the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
more tools but it probably is in in the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.030 
more tools but it probably is in in the
long<00:04:01.739> run<00:04:02.040> will<00:04:02.790> provide<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.269> with<00:04:03.299> a<00:04:03.480> better

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
long run will provide you with a better

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.610 
long run will provide you with a better
product<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.730> don't<00:04:06.659> think<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.470> would

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
product and I don't think you would

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.159 
product and I don't think you would
actually<00:04:07.799> need<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.639> attach<00:04:09.030> anything<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.810> the

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
actually need to attach anything to the

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:15.140 
actually need to attach anything to the
top<00:04:11.299> just<00:04:12.299> make<00:04:12.510> sure<00:04:12.780> that<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:13.409> riser<00:04:13.790> cut<00:04:14.790> is

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
top just make sure that the riser cut is

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.500 
top just make sure that the riser cut is
straight<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:16.229> looks<00:04:16.769> nice<00:04:17.039> but<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.269> would

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
straight and looks nice but I would

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.569 
straight and looks nice but I would
imagine<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:19.109> screws<00:04:19.470> attached<00:04:19.949> to<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.400> back

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
imagine the screws attached to the back

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.730 
imagine the screws attached to the back
of<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.209> risers<00:04:21.750> would<00:04:21.989> be<00:04:22.139> enough<00:04:22.409> to<00:04:22.530> hold

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
of the risers would be enough to hold

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.740 
of the risers would be enough to hold
this<00:04:23.070> in<00:04:23.340> place

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
this in place

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.320 
this in place
and<00:04:24.840> shouldn't<00:04:25.470> be<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.680> problem<00:04:26.160> but<00:04:26.310> if<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:26.880> is

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
and shouldn't be a problem but if it is

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.260 
and shouldn't be a problem but if it is
a<00:04:27.630> problem<00:04:28.290> then<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.650> could<00:04:28.920> always<00:04:29.270> attach

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
a problem then you could always attach

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.190 
a problem then you could always attach
the<00:04:30.930> trim<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:32.610> cord<00:04:32.880> around<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.630> top<00:04:33.840> in

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
the trim the cord around to the top in

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.670 
the trim the cord around to the top in
the<00:04:34.320> previous<00:04:34.770> illustrations<00:04:35.730> or<00:04:36.410> drill<00:04:37.410> some

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
the previous illustrations or drill some

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.330 
the previous illustrations or drill some
more<00:04:37.710> holes<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.670> use<00:04:39.440> metal<00:04:40.440> used<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.220> get

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340
