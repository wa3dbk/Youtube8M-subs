00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
a little bit about the game I think game

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.130 
a little bit about the game I think game
it's<00:00:19.619> very<00:00:19.859> good<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:21.330> guns<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.810> very<00:00:21.840> well

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
it's very good the guns are very well

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.939 
it's very good the guns are very well
made<00:00:23.240> zombies<00:00:24.240> are<00:00:24.810> very<00:00:25.019> well<00:00:25.260> made<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
made zombies are very well made the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.070 
made zombies are very well made the
graphics<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.490> very<00:00:26.519> good<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> game<00:00:27.900> is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
graphics are very good but the game is

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.880 
graphics are very good but the game is
very<00:00:28.170> laggy<00:00:29.119> it<00:00:30.119> crashes<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> lot<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.679> some

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
very laggy it crashes a lot and for some

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.209 
very laggy it crashes a lot and for some
reason<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.279> cannot<00:00:32.640> play<00:00:32.910> online<00:00:33.120> multiplayer

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
reason I cannot play online multiplayer

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
reason I cannot play online multiplayer
the<00:00:35.219> voice<00:00:35.399> chat<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.940> probably<00:00:36.390> really<00:00:36.660> fun

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
the voice chat is probably really fun

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.810 
the voice chat is probably really fun
but<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.770> really<00:00:38.070> would<00:00:38.219> not<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.610> able<00:00:38.760> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
but I really would not be able to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.049 
but I really would not be able to
experience<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:41.399> cliff<00:00:41.579> provide<00:00:41.879> has

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
experience that the cliff provide has

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.119 
experience that the cliff provide has

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
overall I give this game a three out of

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.410 
overall I give this game a three out of
five<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.780> lags<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.410> crashes<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.039> much

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
five because it lags and crashes so much

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.930 
five because it lags and crashes so much
