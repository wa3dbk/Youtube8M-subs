little confusing but the way the authors
designed<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.100> means<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.430> actually<00:00:35.579> incredibly

designed it means is actually incredibly
simple<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:37.320> might<00:00:37.440> add<00:00:37.590> several<00:00:37.860> new<00:00:38.129> types

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340

can also add a type of salt to imbue
with<00:00:45.000> an<00:00:45.120> element<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.350> create<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.620> base

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
with an element so you can create a base

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.889

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
lightning which of course gives

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.319 
lightning which of course gives
increased<00:00:50.489> damage<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.059> use<00:00:51.149> the
