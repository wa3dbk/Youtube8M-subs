00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.040
 What's the matter with the one I 'm bringing you? 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.059
 better classes to search and destroy 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.740
 are the best classes for mlg lvp 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.509
 you can also apply them to league mode and 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.510
 in this case we are in the second 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.370
 episode of the competitive guide no and 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.920
 here we have classes more or less 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.290
 half made that as you will see 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.060
 the advantages are never changed since they are 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.010
 the best and the best we can 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.560
 apply as you know I always do the 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.010
 first 12 months 2nd you are and the class 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.949
 special so to speak for this good 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.820
 we start with smn the best we can 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:44.789
 I recommend for any map and all the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.649
 20 we put the smn that in this case 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.079
 It is the second forever or whether we 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.000
 because it is very lethal and especially if 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.100
 you have the cost in the equipment that exploits 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 with this that you do not see you put and I am 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.879
 this will be the kind of rush that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.129
 basically what we want to do with 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.989
 this class is to reach a goal 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.149
 quickly but clearly we have to russia 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.060
 of a team and you will also have a 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.429
 class to grip the rush that I already 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.190
 I will teach good classes just change 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:13.950
 what I do is this is the defense for 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.520
 defend with the smg that you can also 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.200
 defend the accessories as you can see 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.560
 we change them since they are the most lethal 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.690
 for the weapon I've always said and what 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.530
 I will say these are the best there is the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.210
 hilt in this to the bread yes that makes and 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.460
 here what I do is put the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.830
 exo muffler and I put the two in 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.960
 texas for yes I think they are planting 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.600
 in a bomb has an ace in texas and if 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.700
 He stuck it because I kill him sincerely if 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.860
 the enemy is planting and we do not want 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.200
 get better to be seen in 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.390
 the map we paste a centex and we have 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.610
 an eagle insured and also pretty 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.680
 sneaking up 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.600
 now we would pass with the air class 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.369
 which is the assault rifle which 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.820
 we will use to abuse that if the val 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.160
 27 has hardly recoil and kills very 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.750
 well the bankrupt since they raised it 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.080
 it works better but you can also 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.789
 combine the ims that basically lmr is 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.259
 the same thing just that we change the 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.750
 hilt for a look 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.269
 and here what I do is put the same 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.860
 I basically put on the exo silencer 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.379
 so that when we cross, we are not 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.730
 listen and the hyperactivity sex for 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.340
 get to our goal quickly 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.650
 now we will pass with the class of the network 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.510
 defensive that what we would do is 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.190
 defend with the assault rifle that is 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.040
 the same thing basically we will put the 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.659
 handle the stock and the unsheathed 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.849
 which is what I always put the weapon 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.489
 is in this case these classes are not 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.760
 applicable to take the flag since the 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.860
 hot tip 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.260
 they are the same and so we owe that 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.060
 always changing what we do 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.280
 is to put the muffler exo that 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.140
 we always have to put it on and 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.280
 with this we defend and with these russia 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.860
 we 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.560
 they are very effective classes and they are both 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.800
 weapons that predominates in this game 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.630
 good now it comes in function to what 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.010
 you want is the typical class that gets 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.230
 one with sneijder 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.720
 me in my case I am jerry I put the val 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.130
 27 with the stock and the unsheathed but 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.530
 quiet that you can also do to us 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.300
 one class applicable for all 6 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.050
 months and what we have to do is 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.390
 give us the guarantee 27 or the smg that already 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.190
 I will teach next with the sniper 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.769
 that I honestly the atlas does not tell me 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.600
 I would prefer a walrus and as you know 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.470
 good models are not allowed 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.120
 here comes to like if you like the look 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.860
 of variable zoom put you the but I 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.080
 I sincerely prefer the thermal since 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.840
 highlights enemies in the field of 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.019
 battle of fixed is that half ago 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.330
 were established and further underscoring the 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.040
 Look, it 's true that long, very long 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.519
 distances that is for what is a 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.519
 sniper 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.110
 It screws a lot but we know how to use it 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.580
 well we import quickly into nothing 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.780
 we can become good ones is a 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.270
 scattered here what I do is put myself 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.190
 exo muffler with some in texas 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.680
 basically the same thing is a little more for 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.470
 defend also serves to attack itself 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.390
 and here in this case we change to the 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.430
 overload since we only have one 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.950
 exo attitude and what we want is that we 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.319
 last good this is the class of the r 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.200
 now we are going to apply it to the smc that 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.609
 in this case do not use corrugated the 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.490
 true because the hilt is something 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.440
 quite in that necessary since it is useful 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.140
 and what we do is put him to swim with 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.030
 he unsheathed when having his hands 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.730
 agile we quickly change to 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.680
 smartphone and we can see that we are 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.570
 doing headley chin somewhere and 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.640
 suddenly an enemy we do not do more 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.820
 holding back and we eliminated it 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.590
 quickly with our sms good guys 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.720
 and these are the best classes for 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.820
 seek and destroy are not made by me 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.550
 again again the comments again 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.950
 with berto he showed them to me and I've 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.860
 changed and a little bit taking the 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.319
 methods and so on 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.139
 and remember that these classes are for 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.849
 way league mlg and lvp and maybe in 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.870
 public, it works the same as in 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.189
 public people have to fall loads 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.599
 in fact he was going to say the bombs and 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.849
 these that you can eat you do not carry 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.560
 vest remember that these are the 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.210
 classes for competitive good guys 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.960
 I hope you liked it and in the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.860
 next video I will show you how to play 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.439
 solar 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.439
 in hot point that is a map that 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:26.819
 play enough on the lv pm stop and I'll 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.819
 put me with it now come
