00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 os guitarists and that in the blog of mirko 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.140
 let's open with this very first episode 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.940
 a bit a section dedicated to questions 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.500
 and the answers you often give us 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.500
 under our videos 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.650
 waiting, in short, for the arrival of the 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.480
 niche blog that is a little bit more 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.099
 technician let's say I will try to 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.050
 answer your questions those ones 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.880
 a little bit simpler than now but 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.710
 this what I would like to start immediately with 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.660
 a question a student asked us 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.910
 which you see below 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.619
 valerio turreni who asks us how it is 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.540
 the reg plays 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.120
 upbeat then I would like to do one 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.790
 premise is not written reg crg but yes 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.500
 subscive rega e e if they catch you giovi 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.930
 dog to make a bush like that also because 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.640
 you know they are colored and as you know for 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.100
 understand how reggae music works 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.170
 basically you need to have a minimum 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.239
 basic knowledge base of 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.430
 music at least to know the 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.739
 time the jokes to make it your own 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.020
 simple simple simple so that 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.910
 even someone like me can understand it, let's say 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.799
 that if I beat the four quarters not 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.360
 you have in mind 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 the 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.250
 movement that is between a snap of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.950
 hands and the other is called fourth is a 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.600
 quarter of a bar a joke is formed 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.210
 from four quarters when the time of 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.180
 track is four quarters the time there is 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.979
 in the middle is an eighth ok so the 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.320
 so-called raise the king xvi nun 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.360
 right on the upbeats I know we take a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.190
 piece that was very strong on ours 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.200
 channel that is a must of reggae music 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.940
 or non woman no cry with chords 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.100
 simplified for beginners 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.000
 ignorant like me who are the do 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.650
 greater 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 the G major 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.840
 the minor and the F major 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.909
 with the bars and I recommend we put 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.909
 that the piece should be packed would be like this 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.409
 41 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.280
 4 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:07.090
 3 4 1 2 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.640
 2 3 4 and so on but the king who 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.110
 in fact it is upbeat then upbeat 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.110
 would be practically so 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.819
 ok someone who will say but i don't understand 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.920
 you don't understand the difference 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.739
 simply because there is not one 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.230
 battery or a rhythm that gives you the 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.510
 beat something but I do to make you 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.540
 a little understand the beat try to put us 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.800
 the bottom of the agreement we are making 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.880
 in this case the dott 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.880
 and so it will come 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.659
 as you have heard it is the bass that gives me 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.629
 the attack come across which is the 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:59.739
 particularity that the king who played 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:03.459
 normally with bridge pick up 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.890
 because he has his own bed more like 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.930
 say more acute more grateful you and then it is 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:15.680
 blocked so it is not 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:18.140
 but it will be ok 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.969
 another peculiarity is that if you play it 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.379
 with a band it is a piece lag there can also 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.379
 stand the chitarrina that simply does 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.989
 but if for example you are on the beach and 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.989
 here I refer to this episode 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.310
 or written beach arrests 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.439
 clearly played just so it's a bit 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.180
 ugly because we are alone and must 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.120
 create some atmosphere so you can 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.359
 enrich a little bit like this for 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.359
 make you understand 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.110
 and already so a little richer then if 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.420
 you are a little bit further and you can 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.190
 also put the bass on each change 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.840
 another thing for example that I like 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.670
 do when trying to play music 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.380
 reggae but you know I am the student 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.910
 so in short I try to send you 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.950
 the one on that little bit I learned 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.920
 thanks to nico and playing all the 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.870
 chords of this piece in bars on 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.530
 position of ago so if I do a 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.170
 accord of ago major ok in very first 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.990
 position and then I move for example 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.180
 on the eighth fret I find myself eighth 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.920
 key means by the first finger is ok 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.460
 so here I go to see you immediately 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.270
 the C major 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.090
 then at the third key I find the G major 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.080
 on the fifth key by removing the finger 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.390
 number two 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.670
 I find in the minor 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.020
 and then again in first position I find 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.810
 in F major 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.129
 because I do this because I do it to you 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.129
 listen very easily 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.819
 here doing everything in bars and then 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.460
 going to play chords with 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:17.159
 more acute upper eighths gives more 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.900
 that way dear bathroom to the piece 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:21.180
 and since in short, Jamaica is 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.129
 right in the middle of the Caribbean Sea between 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.000
 cuba santo domingo puerto rico etc. 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.509
 etc 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.300
 gives it a touch even a little cooler and 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.580
 miano pass me the term that it 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.289
