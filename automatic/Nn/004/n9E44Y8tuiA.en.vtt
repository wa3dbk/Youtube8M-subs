00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.470
 hello with you cube tivi this review 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.470
 puzzles brand rip 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.930
 let's start with the coolest is that minx 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:30.580
 version 2 differs from the first only in that 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:33.879
 what's more so straight here 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.890
 geometric faces in the first version not 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:43.300
 such if you remember were rounded 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:47.289
 here they are straight or on the mechanism of this here 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.260
 minx rotates much better than the first 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:54.879
 version as much noticeable that is here 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.539
 no obstacles 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.879
 is spinning a magic now 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.720
 about the task itself 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:08.730
 Well, as you can see there are two puzzles 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:18.130
 face type pentagons which 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:23.380
 rotate at angles so 360 by 5 is 72 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:28.510
 degrees yes well, that is, here to the multiples of 72 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:32.800
 degrees rotate so hexagons 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:36.360
 here at an angle of 60 degrees if you turn 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.670
 then the next faces 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.030
 does not turn because this 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.180
 here is the side it is from the hexagon if 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.040
 her to the pentagon y substitute then nothing 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.000
 will not work out and substitute to 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.700
 the next hexagon how would it 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.170
 three nuance adds puzzle 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.170
 difficulties because 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.930
 if we compare it for example 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.899
 media gaming itself not gaming sidamy faces 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.600
 You could twist that's one angle and any 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.360
 here these need to be twisted by 2 that is 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:22.180
 here this will not work the logic to the books 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:28.790
 megamen xi puzzle interesting 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.590
 complicated the most pleasant impression 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.310
 leaves 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.780
 recommend especially for collectors 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:42.050
 so the next puzzle 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:46.580
 here these two are 2d columns on the plane 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.220
 what's going on here see five 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.430
 laps and 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.680
 every two adjacent circles here 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.680
 intersect here in this 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.900
 They have in common the intersection of well and 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.480
 accordingly this intersection we can 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.750
 cool taught here or here and so 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.590
 the way the puzzle from is mixed then 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.810
 there is this line we threw here 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.500
 we can throw it further or 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.180
 stay somewhere else but 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.180
 these ones by the way 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.730
 elements do not give everything 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.730
 not all positions and are allowed to turn 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:43.579
 look here it can be here 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:46.100
 spin it turns out what happens here 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:50.329
 these two park two pairs of neighboring here 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:57.769
 intersection have and the same can still 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:04:02.299
 intersect here with this see well class 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:05.610
 and here with that is 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.629
 that is, each circle has with four 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.700
 the rest 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.700
 some kind of intersection and 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.880
 In general, the class can all get confused 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:21.509
 magnificently everything can 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.690
 shuffle but the starting position is 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:26.460
 from the central element of the pentagon 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.509
 here it is with five colors 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:34.229
 depart like this crescents colored 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:36.479
 areas here and they need to be collected so in 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.630
 this puzzle is and 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:43.740
 well, this idea has another embodiment here 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:48.169
 just two laps and here they are 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.169
 already exactly yes one intersection area and 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.660
 the original state is here are three green 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.389
 the areas of his 2 red as a flower 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.039
 as portions. 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:09.300
 well this is similar movements all 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:14.720
 get confused somehow so try 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:17.760
 return well here's the starting position 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.919
 so with these it is clear this column 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.909
 Geranium called him a puzzle 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.940
 named geraniums and there is still such 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:31.380
 funny snowflake puzzle I don't think 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.740
 that she is very simple very complicated what 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.500
 on 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.130
 consists of two axes which 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.490
 respect each other are averted yes 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:45.240
 that is, there was an orange opposite 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:49.260
 orange let's combine with green 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.810
 we can twist it turn further 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:58.199
 something else to twist but in general everything 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:06:00.509
 here these elements will get confused and 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.240
 you need to solve the puzzle here to these 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:07.070
 marker to match their respective 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:12.220
 colors and on this side and on this one 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:16.460
 here to achieve such a starting position 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.220
 well with this brand thank you all for 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.220
 attention stay smart and beautiful 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.220
 until
