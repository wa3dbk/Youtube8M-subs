00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.840
 with this boot the font magician 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 will make us dream once more all and for 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.940
 what not to repeat the title of champions 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.940
 of the world 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.910
 I am a boot that for me is a novelty 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.110
 totally different from what to what 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.230
 I had used 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.740
 and good happy about how all the 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.590
 process of the sensations that I have with 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.620
 and from there then try to make 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.410
 be very very good times with them 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.710
 being a different boot, since from the 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.470
 tissue that is that is different than it 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.500
 It molds very well at the foot from the sock 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.180
 what makes you have a little more 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.140
 comfortable the ankle boot the great 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.780
 difference with the previous ones is that it is 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.930
 practically like a glove 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.360
 it's as if it's your skin and in 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.600
 that sense because that innovation I think 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.049
 has been very positive with all 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.940
 innovations or all things 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.940
 Novelties, they have to have a 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.630
 process I've tried it all 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.689
 these months many times 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.360
 as I said totally different 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.780
 the tissue from 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.260
 the sock that is increased but good at 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.380
 final the important thing is that I feel 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.440
 comfortable with her that when it comes to having 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.570
 the touch ball is what 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.270
 it's very very positive because it does 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.930
 still much closer and from 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.900
 hence, 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.510
 as happy as today it is not 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.959
 I think that is important is important 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.000
 that the player feels comfortable that the 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.700
 player then feel at the time of playing 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.129
 that is not aware of the boot 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.620
 but it feels very good when it comes to 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.829
 touch the ball when driving to 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.400
 the time to pass it and in that sense then 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.269
 I think that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.840
 that the improvement or what is sought with that 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.610
 boot is achieved and in fact 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.769
 I am very happy to be able 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.769
 use it and be able to be here today
