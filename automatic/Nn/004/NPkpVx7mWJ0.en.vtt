some<00:01:47.390> sound<00:01:48.020> quality<00:01:48.410> issues<00:01:48.910> but<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:50.120> know<00:01:50.240> I

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
some sound quality issues but you know I

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.460 
some sound quality issues but you know I
think<00:01:50.510> it's<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.750> small<00:01:50.930> price<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.230> pay<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.350> be

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
think it's a small price to pay to be

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.900 
think it's a small price to pay to be
