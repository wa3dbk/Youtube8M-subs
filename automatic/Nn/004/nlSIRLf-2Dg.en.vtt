00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.659 
left bring it over the center get it to
that<00:04:36.300> now<00:04:36.569> over<00:04:37.050> on<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.289> right<00:04:37.559> is<00:04:37.979> gonna

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
that now over on the right is gonna

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.779 
that now over on the right is gonna
bring<00:04:38.939> it<00:04:39.089> over<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:39.389> Center<00:04:40.520> now<00:04:41.520> we're<00:04:41.669> gonna

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
bring it over to Center now we're gonna

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.589 
bring it over to Center now we're gonna
make<00:04:42.029> this<00:04:42.300> cord<00:04:43.219> long<00:04:44.219> enough<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:45.389> it's

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
make this cord long enough that it's

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.969 
make this cord long enough that it's
going<00:04:45.719> to<00:04:45.779> be<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.050> one<00:04:46.710> side<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:48.180> your<00:04:48.509> sling

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
going to be the one side of your sling

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.230 
going to be the one side of your sling
make<00:04:49.979> the<00:04:50.159> braiding<00:04:50.610> go<00:04:50.789> a<00:04:50.819> little<00:04:51.169> easier<00:04:52.169> I

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
make the braiding go a little easier I

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.879 
make the braiding go a little easier I
usually<00:04:54.240> take<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.930> loop<00:04:55.289> and<00:04:55.499> I<00:04:55.559> put<00:04:55.800> it

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
usually take the loop and I put it

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.790 
usually take the loop and I put it
around<00:04:55.979> my<00:04:56.249> the<00:04:56.610> toe<00:04:56.819> of<00:04:56.939> my<00:04:57.089> foot<00:04:57.559> this<00:04:58.559> gives

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
around my the toe of my foot this gives

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.350 
around my the toe of my foot this gives
me<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:58.949> little<00:04:59.189> bit<00:04:59.279> more<00:04:59.490> leverage<00:04:59.729> when<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.210> do

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
me a little bit more leverage when I do

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.809 
me a little bit more leverage when I do
it<00:05:00.629> so<00:05:00.809> that<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.289> can<00:05:01.800> pull<00:05:02.039> it<00:05:02.069> straight<00:05:02.279> and<00:05:02.729> a

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
it so that I can pull it straight and a

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.529 
it so that I can pull it straight and a
little<00:05:03.059> bit<00:05:03.180> tighter<00:05:04.219> all<00:05:05.219> right<00:05:05.399> guys<00:05:05.610> I'm

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
little bit tighter all right guys I'm

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:07.159 
little bit tighter all right guys I'm
done

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
done

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.010 
done
the<00:05:07.319> first<00:05:07.649> length<00:05:08.129> of<00:05:08.430> cordage<00:05:08.909> now<00:05:09.149> I<00:05:09.509> like

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
the first length of cordage now I like

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.010 
the first length of cordage now I like
to<00:05:10.050> use<00:05:10.379> body<00:05:11.099> measurements<00:05:12.029> in<00:05:12.180> order<00:05:12.809> to

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
to use body measurements in order to

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.540 
to use body measurements in order to
figure<00:05:13.349> out<00:05:13.469> the<00:05:13.710> size<00:05:13.919> because<00:05:14.339> if<00:05:14.430> you're

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
figure out the size because if you're

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.950 
figure out the size because if you're
doing<00:05:14.759> this<00:05:14.849> in<00:05:14.999> a<00:05:15.059> primitive<00:05:15.240> situation

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
doing this in a primitive situation

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.209 
doing this in a primitive situation
you're<00:05:16.080> not<00:05:16.110> going<00:05:16.409> to<00:05:16.469> be<00:05:16.559> able<00:05:16.649> to<00:05:16.800> measure

00:05:17.209 --> 00:05:17.219 
you're not going to be able to measure

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.879 
you're not going to be able to measure
so<00:05:17.909> what<00:05:18.419> I<00:05:18.449> usually<00:05:18.689> do<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.199> just<00:05:19.229> take<00:05:19.620> from

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
so what I usually do is I just take from

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.489 
so what I usually do is I just take from
where<00:05:20.129> I<00:05:20.399> can<00:05:20.610> go<00:05:20.699> like<00:05:20.849> this<00:05:21.020> right<00:05:22.020> up<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.349> the

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:22.499 
where I can go like this right up to the

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:26.600 
where I can go like this right up to the
inside<00:05:23.460> of<00:05:23.520> my<00:05:24.089> shorter<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:26.399> is

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
inside of my shorter and that is

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.339 
inside of my shorter and that is
probably<00:05:26.999> about<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.449> right<00:05:27.629> size<00:05:27.930> now<00:05:28.229> I've

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
probably about the right size now I've

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.230 
probably about the right size now I've
measured<00:05:28.499> this<00:05:28.830> before<00:05:29.249> and<00:05:29.520> it's<00:05:29.909> it's

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
measured this before and it's it's

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.139 
measured this before and it's it's
pretty<00:05:30.749> much<00:05:30.990> about<00:05:31.199> two<00:05:31.439> and<00:05:31.589> a<00:05:31.620> half<00:05:31.770> feet

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:32.149 
pretty much about two and a half feet

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:34.699 
pretty much about two and a half feet
but<00:05:33.149> I<00:05:33.330> just<00:05:33.749> want<00:05:33.930> to<00:05:34.020> make<00:05:34.139> sure<00:05:34.169> that<00:05:34.529> I<00:05:34.589> do

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:34.709 
but I just want to make sure that I do

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.949 
but I just want to make sure that I do
it<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:34.919> right<00:05:35.129> distance<00:05:35.339> when<00:05:36.089> you<00:05:36.240> when

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:36.959 
it the right distance when you when

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:39.829 
it the right distance when you when
you're<00:05:37.110> hanging<00:05:37.800> this<00:05:38.159> thing<00:05:38.459> down<00:05:38.759> you<00:05:39.659> want

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:39.839 
you're hanging this thing down you want

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.059 
you're hanging this thing down you want
to<00:05:39.899> make<00:05:40.020> sure<00:05:40.050> that<00:05:40.319> it's<00:05:40.499> not<00:05:40.589> actually

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
to make sure that it's not actually

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.369 
to make sure that it's not actually
going<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.969> touch<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.389> ground<00:05:42.419> and<00:05:42.930> I<00:05:43.139> found

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
going to touch the ground and I found

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.429 
going to touch the ground and I found
this<00:05:43.560> is<00:05:43.680> a<00:05:43.770> really<00:05:44.249> good<00:05:44.430> distance<00:05:44.939> to

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:45.439 
this is a really good distance to

00:05:45.439 --> 00:06:00.279 
this is a really good distance to
measure

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.349 

you
