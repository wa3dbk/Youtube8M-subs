and<00:02:13.720> alleviate<00:02:14.720> any<00:02:14.840> dead<00:02:15.110> spots<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.620> might<00:02:15.800> be

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
and alleviate any dead spots it might be

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.790 
and alleviate any dead spots it might be
back<00:02:16.160> there<00:02:16.840> now<00:02:17.840> as<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.080> can<00:02:18.230> see<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.500> still

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
back there now as you can see I still

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.980 
back there now as you can see I still
have<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.980> little<00:02:19.670> bit<00:02:19.819> of<00:02:19.850> green<00:02:20.240> algae<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
have a little bit of green algae on the

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.800 
have a little bit of green algae on the
corners<00:02:21.470> at<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.650> tank<00:02:22.510> here<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:23.810> here<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:26.540> was

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
corners at a tank here and here so I was

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.480 
corners at a tank here and here so I was
doing<00:02:26.930> some<00:02:27.080> research<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.130> figured

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
doing some research on it and figured

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.830 
doing some research on it and figured
out<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.760> maybe<00:02:28.910> my<00:02:29.120> phosphates<00:02:29.630> were<00:02:29.780> a

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
out that maybe my phosphates were a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.410 
out that maybe my phosphates were a
little<00:02:30.110> high<00:02:30.260> for<00:02:30.319> some<00:02:30.739> reason<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.610> ended

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
little high for some reason so I ended

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.570 
little high for some reason so I ended
up<00:02:32.540> picking<00:02:32.780> up<00:02:36.640> chemi<00:02:37.640> pure<00:02:38.060> elite<00:02:39.580> supposed

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
up picking up chemi pure elite supposed

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.640 
up picking up chemi pure elite supposed
to<00:02:40.670> remove<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.270> phosphates<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.170> silicates

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
to remove the phosphates and silicates

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.670 
to remove the phosphates and silicates
and<00:02:42.920> actually<00:02:43.819> be<00:02:43.970> good<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.260> make<00:02:45.260> better<00:02:45.440> water

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
and actually be good a make better water

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.920 
and actually be good a make better water
quality<00:02:46.070> for<00:02:46.190> your<00:02:46.310> tank<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.239> went<00:02:47.870> ahead

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
quality for your tank so I went ahead

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.610 
quality for your tank so I went ahead
and<00:02:48.080> I<00:02:48.230> got<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:50.660> put<00:02:51.790> one<00:02:52.790> bag<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.660> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
and I got that and I put one bag in the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.120 
and I got that and I put one bag in the
overflow<00:02:55.010> box<00:02:55.610> here<00:02:56.030> sorry<00:02:56.570> about<00:02:56.630> that<00:02:57.130> one

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
overflow box here sorry about that one

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.860 
overflow box here sorry about that one
bag<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.670> overflow<00:02:59.090> box<00:02:59.120> here

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
bag in the overflow box here

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.620 
bag in the overflow box here
one<00:03:00.680> bag<00:03:00.890> treats<00:03:01.310> 40<00:03:01.730> gallons<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.360> this<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.569> a

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
one bag treats 40 gallons so this is a

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.690 
one bag treats 40 gallons so this is a
60<00:03:02.989> gallon<00:03:03.350> tank<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:03.860> I've<00:03:03.980> got<00:03:04.160> one<00:03:04.400> in<00:03:04.610> the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
60 gallon tank so I've got one in the

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.300 
60 gallon tank so I've got one in the
overflow<00:03:05.180> box<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:05.750> we<00:03:05.870> can<00:03:05.900> get<00:03:06.200> all<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.530> water

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
overflow box so we can get all the water

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.750 
overflow box so we can get all the water
coming<00:03:07.640> into<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.230> filter<00:03:09.230> system<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:10.040> then<00:03:10.730> I

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
coming into the filter system and then I

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.180 
coming into the filter system and then I
put<00:03:11.060> one<00:03:11.090> bag<00:03:11.569> down<00:03:11.870> here<00:03:12.290> in<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.560> bottom<00:03:12.950> of

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
put one bag down here in the bottom of

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.390 
put one bag down here in the bottom of
the<00:03:13.250> sump<00:03:13.550> so<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.600> way<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.959> gets<00:03:15.170> hit<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.280> the

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
the sump so that way it gets hit to the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.420 
the sump so that way it gets hit to the
carbon<00:03:16.850> twice<00:03:17.570> before<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.380> hits<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.920> protein

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
carbon twice before it hits the protein

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.880 
carbon twice before it hits the protein
skimmer<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:20.090> then<00:03:20.900> gets<00:03:21.140> pumped<00:03:21.650> back<00:03:21.829> into

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
skimmer and then gets pumped back into

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.390 
skimmer and then gets pumped back into
the<00:03:22.220> tank<00:03:22.660> now<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:24.470> only<00:03:24.560> been<00:03:24.799> 24<00:03:25.220> hours

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
the tank now it's only been 24 hours

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.810 
the tank now it's only been 24 hours
since<00:03:25.820> I<00:03:26.209> added<00:03:26.420> this<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.230> system<00:03:27.790> in<00:03:28.790> that

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
since I added this to the system in that

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.420 
since I added this to the system in that
24<00:03:29.480> hours<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:29.989> have<00:03:30.110> seen<00:03:30.410> better<00:03:31.160> water

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
24 hours I have seen better water

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.460 
24 hours I have seen better water
quality<00:03:31.579> it<00:03:32.480> looks<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:32.780> lot<00:03:32.959> clearer<00:03:33.350> in<00:03:33.709> here

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
quality it looks a lot clearer in here

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.280 
quality it looks a lot clearer in here
the<00:03:36.470> green<00:03:36.829> is<00:03:37.160> slowly<00:03:37.880> seems<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.900> be<00:03:39.019> fading

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
the green is slowly seems to be fading

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.910 
the green is slowly seems to be fading
away<00:03:39.530> when<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:40.400> came<00:03:40.519> out<00:03:40.790> this<00:03:40.910> morning<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.920> had

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
away when I came out this morning I had

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.710 
away when I came out this morning I had
a<00:03:42.950> little<00:03:43.190> bit<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.519> algae<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:43.970> scrape<00:03:44.209> off<00:03:44.450> with

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
a little bit of algae to scrape off with

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.050 
a little bit of algae to scrape off with
the<00:03:44.810> mag<00:03:44.989> float<00:03:45.380> but<00:03:46.160> not<00:03:46.370> as<00:03:46.549> much<00:03:46.730> as<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:47.030> used

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
the mag float but not as much as I used

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.870 
the mag float but not as much as I used
to<00:03:47.359> have<00:03:47.570> so<00:03:48.019> I<00:03:48.320> really<00:03:48.920> think<00:03:49.070> it<00:03:49.250> is<00:03:49.280> helping

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
to have so I really think it is helping

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.140 
to have so I really think it is helping
so<00:03:50.660> I'll<00:03:50.840> keep<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.140> guys<00:03:51.260> updated<00:03:51.560> on<00:03:52.010> that
