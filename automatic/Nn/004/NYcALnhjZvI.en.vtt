okay<00:00:03.600> you've<00:00:03.750> probably<00:00:03.959> been<00:00:04.290> hearing<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.950> lot

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
okay you've probably been hearing a lot

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.460 
okay you've probably been hearing a lot
about<00:00:05.160> over-striding<00:00:06.230> or<00:00:07.230> the

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
about over-striding or the

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.870 
about over-striding or the
recommendation<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.429> should<00:00:08.730> not

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
recommendation that you should not

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.190 
recommendation that you should not
inquiry<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.630> increase<00:00:10.019> your<00:00:10.290> stride<00:00:11.099> length

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
inquiry to increase your stride length

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.480 
inquiry to increase your stride length
they<00:00:13.200> say<00:00:13.440> if<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.710> increase<00:00:14.130> your<00:00:14.280> stride

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
they say if you increase your stride

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.300 
they say if you increase your stride
length<00:00:14.960> you<00:00:15.960> will<00:00:16.139> then<00:00:16.350> be<00:00:16.529> over<00:00:16.830> striding

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
length you will then be over striding

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.250 
length you will then be over striding
and<00:00:17.490> landing<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.150> heel<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.630> that's

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and landing on your heel and that's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.529 
and landing on your heel and that's
going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> create<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.830> lot<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.039> problems<00:00:20.539> well

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
going to create a lot of problems well

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.160 
going to create a lot of problems well
in<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.350> way<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.740> true<00:00:23.130> if<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.600> don't<00:00:24.840> have

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
in a way this is true if you don't have

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.910 
in a way this is true if you don't have
proper<00:00:25.560> running<00:00:25.980> technique<00:00:27.199> this<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.590> key

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
proper running technique this is the key

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.609 
proper running technique this is the key
and<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.539> shame<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:30.869> we're<00:00:31.260> not<00:00:31.380> looking

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and it's a shame that we're not looking

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.430 
and it's a shame that we're not looking
at<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.669> total<00:00:33.000> picture<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.719> running

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
at the total picture of running

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.310 
at the total picture of running
technique<00:00:34.940> we<00:00:35.940> only<00:00:36.090> isolate<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.050> little

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
technique we only isolate one little

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.740 
technique we only isolate one little
aspect<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.040> get<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> misconception<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
aspect of it get a misconception of it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.470 
aspect of it get a misconception of it
develop<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> myth<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:41.760> perpetuate<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
develop a myth and then perpetuate it

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.869 
develop a myth and then perpetuate it
and<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.530> exactly<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.280> we're<00:00:44.430> doing<00:00:44.579> with

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and it's exactly what we're doing with

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.560 
and it's exactly what we're doing with
over-striding

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
over-striding

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.779 
over-striding
I<00:00:46.309> have<00:00:47.309> yet<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> see<00:00:48.440> many<00:00:49.440> people<00:00:49.710> truly<00:00:50.430> over

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
I have yet to see many people truly over

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.930 
I have yet to see many people truly over
stride<00:00:51.350> over<00:00:52.350> stride<00:00:52.760> according<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> his

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
stride over stride according to his

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.900 
stride over stride according to his
definition<00:00:54.440> means<00:00:55.440> taking<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.010> longer<00:00:56.610> than

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
definition means taking a longer than

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
your normal stride most runners don't

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.030 
your normal stride most runners don't
even<00:01:01.289> achieve<00:01:01.739> their<00:01:02.989> let's<00:01:03.989> say<00:01:04.140> normal<00:01:04.710> or

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
even achieve their let's say normal or

even achieve their let's say normal or
optimal<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:06.180> probably<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> better<00:01:06.960> word

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229

here<00:01:07.560> most<00:01:08.549> runners<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:09.060> not<00:01:09.299> achieve<00:01:09.540> their

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
optimal stride and if you want to

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.990 
optimal stride and if you want to
increase<00:01:13.049> speed<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.280> first<00:01:14.670> thing<00:01:14.880> you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
increase speed the first thing you

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.590 
increase speed the first thing you
should<00:01:15.030> do<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.509> increase<00:01:15.960> your<00:01:16.170> stride<00:01:16.590> length

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
should do is increase your stride length

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.679 
should do is increase your stride length
not<00:01:18.600> stride<00:01:18.990> frequency<00:01:19.820> stride<00:01:20.820> frequency<00:01:21.479> is

not stride frequency stride frequency is

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.370 
not stride frequency stride frequency is
much<00:01:22.200> more<00:01:22.500> energy<00:01:23.299> consuming<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.479> much<00:01:25.170> more

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
much more energy consuming and much more

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.899 
much more energy consuming and much more
difficult<00:01:25.619> you're<00:01:26.310> going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> run<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.759> gas

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
difficult you're going to run out of gas

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.249 
difficult you're going to run out of gas
a<00:01:27.390> lot<00:01:27.630> quicker<00:01:28.610> stride<00:01:29.610> length<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.930> main

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
a lot quicker stride length is the main

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
a lot quicker stride length is the main
factor<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:32.430> improve<00:01:32.880> your<00:01:33.180> running<00:01:34.049> speed<00:01:35.119> now

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
factor to improve your running speed now

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.840 
factor to improve your running speed now
how<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:37.079> let<00:01:37.920> me<00:01:38.070> explain

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
how can this be let me explain

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.720 
how can this be let me explain
the<00:01:40.360> first<00:01:40.930> key<00:01:41.380> factor<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:42.010> that<00:01:42.250> knee<00:01:42.430> drive

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
the first key factor is that knee drive

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.230 
the first key factor is that knee drive
you<00:01:43.600> want<00:01:43.720> to<00:01:43.840> drive<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.350> thigh<00:01:44.590> forward

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you want to drive that thigh forward

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.610 
you want to drive that thigh forward
after<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.330> push<00:01:46.510> off<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:46.960> drive<00:01:47.260> the<00:01:47.440> thigh

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
after the push off you drive the thigh

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.830 
after the push off you drive the thigh
forward<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.730> more<00:01:48.910> forcefully<00:01:49.480> you<00:01:49.630> drive

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
forward the more forcefully you drive

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.720 
forward the more forcefully you drive
the<00:01:50.020> thigh<00:01:50.200> forward<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:51.220> more<00:01:51.430> forward

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
the thigh forward the more forward

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.910 
the thigh forward the more forward
momentum<00:01:51.940> you're<00:01:52.420> creating<00:01:52.930> and<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.680> more

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
momentum you're creating and the more

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.240 
momentum you're creating and the more
you<00:01:54.820> can<00:01:55.030> reach<00:01:55.390> forward<00:01:55.870> so<00:01:56.680> after<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.070> thigh

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
you can reach forward so after the thigh

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.900 
you can reach forward so after the thigh
comes<00:01:57.520> forward<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:58.090> swing<00:01:58.810> out<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.200> shin<00:01:59.470> and

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
comes forward you swing out the shin and

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.370 
comes forward you swing out the shin and
then<00:02:00.910> and<00:02:01.270> this<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.600> most<00:02:01.900> important

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
then and this is the most important

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.640 
then and this is the most important
factor<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:04.000> you<00:02:04.030> bring<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.630> leg<00:02:04.870> back<00:02:05.320> and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
factor then you bring the leg back and

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.480 
factor then you bring the leg back and
down<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:07.030> contact<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.780> ground<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:09.280> don't

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
down to contact the ground you don't

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
down to contact the ground you don't
swing<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:09.940> leg<00:02:10.330> out<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.840> leave<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:11.560> there

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
swing the leg out and leave it there

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.170 
swing the leg out and leave it there
this<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.780> improper<00:02:14.170> technique<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.910> course

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
this is improper technique and of course

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.880 
this is improper technique and of course
you<00:02:16.360> will<00:02:16.570> land<00:02:16.780> on<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.050> heel<00:02:17.380> when<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.709> do

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
you will land on the heel when you do
