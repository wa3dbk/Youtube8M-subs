flip it around just give you guys
another<00:05:13.180> angle<00:05:13.600> of<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.780> card

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
another angle of the card

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.410 
another angle of the card
in<00:05:14.350> fact<00:05:15.280> I'll<00:05:15.430> try<00:05:15.580> to<00:05:15.640> angle<00:05:15.940> just<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.090> little

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
in fact I'll try to angle just a little

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.420 
in fact I'll try to angle just a little
bit<00:05:16.540> more<00:05:16.750> here<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.140> you<00:05:17.560> guys<00:05:17.680> can<00:05:17.890> see<00:05:18.040> inside

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
bit more here so you guys can see inside

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.710 
bit more here so you guys can see inside
the<00:05:18.610> car<00:05:18.790> for<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.090> Camry<00:05:19.390> and<00:05:19.450> get<00:05:19.570> a<00:05:19.600> good

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
the car for the Camry and get a good

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.210 
the car for the Camry and get a good
shot<00:05:19.960> of<00:05:19.990> that<00:05:22.590> will<00:05:23.590> flip<00:05:23.800> it<00:05:23.920> around<00:05:24.010> the

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
shot of that will flip it around the

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.000 
shot of that will flip it around the
side<00:05:24.400> over<00:05:24.580> here<00:05:25.380> I'll<00:05:26.380> spin<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.620> angle

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
side over here I'll spin the angle

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.650 
side over here I'll spin the angle
around<00:05:27.100> so<00:05:27.790> you<00:05:27.850> guys<00:05:27.970> get<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.210> better<00:05:28.330> look<00:05:28.570> at

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
around so you guys get a better look at

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.530 
around so you guys get a better look at
that<00:05:28.690> so<00:05:29.650> first<00:05:30.160> off<00:05:30.340> I'm<00:05:31.030> gonna<00:05:31.150> spin<00:05:31.510> it

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
that so first off I'm gonna spin it

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.060 
that so first off I'm gonna spin it
around<00:05:31.690> one<00:05:31.900> more<00:05:31.930> time<00:05:32.080> all<00:05:32.650> these<00:05:32.740> different

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
around one more time all these different

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.370 
around one more time all these different
angles<00:05:33.340> but<00:05:33.430> let's<00:05:33.580> look<00:05:33.730> at<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.940> back<00:05:34.090> so<00:05:34.630> one

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
angles but let's look at the back so one

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.990 
angles but let's look at the back so one
thing<00:05:35.590> I<00:05:35.680> really<00:05:35.980> like<00:05:36.130> about<00:05:36.160> this<00:05:36.520> card<00:05:36.820> I

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
thing I really like about this card I

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.370 
thing I really like about this card I
know<00:05:37.060> all<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:37.390> you<00:05:37.570> guys<00:05:37.720> are<00:05:37.930> going<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.170> agree

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
know all of you guys are going to agree

know all of you guys are going to agree
having<00:05:39.310> the<00:05:39.430> PCB<00:05:40.030> completely<00:05:40.720> covered<00:05:41.110> I

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
having the PCB completely covered I

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.010 
having the PCB completely covered I
think<00:05:41.950> is<00:05:42.280> awesome<00:05:42.520> that<00:05:43.390> means<00:05:43.570> I<00:05:43.660> can<00:05:43.810> set

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
think is awesome that means I can set

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.390 
think is awesome that means I can set
the<00:05:44.140> car<00:05:44.320> down<00:05:44.350> and<00:05:44.800> have<00:05:44.890> to<00:05:44.980> worry<00:05:45.130> about<00:05:45.190> any

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
the car down and have to worry about any

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.980 
the car down and have to worry about any
my<00:05:45.520> electronical<00:05:46.060> components<00:05:46.480> getting<00:05:46.690> broke

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
my electronical components getting broke

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.490 
my electronical components getting broke
because<00:05:47.170> they're<00:05:47.380> all<00:05:47.560> covered<00:05:48.010> by<00:05:48.040> a<00:05:48.490> shield

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
because they're all covered by a shield

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.930 
because they're all covered by a shield
so<00:05:50.500> up<00:05:50.860> here<00:05:51.070> on<00:05:51.160> top<00:05:51.190> we're<00:05:51.550> gonna<00:05:51.670> go<00:05:51.820> over

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
are the two crossfire fingers and then

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.040 
are the two crossfire fingers and then
right<00:05:57.670> underneath<00:05:57.910> here<00:05:58.270> is<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.870> boost

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
right underneath here is the boost

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.650 
right underneath here is the boost
button<00:05:59.140> it's<00:05:59.740> a<00:05:59.770> little<00:05:59.980> bit<00:06:00.070> hard<00:06:00.250> to<00:06:00.280> see<00:06:00.340> but
