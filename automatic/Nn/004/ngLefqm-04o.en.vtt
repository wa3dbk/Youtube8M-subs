00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 I greet everyone on electric video channel 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.379
 self info 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.859
 in this video we will talk about how 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:10.370
 externally distinguish 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.440
 protective devices off uzo diff 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.450
 automatic a constructively difavtomat 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.820
 includes self and protective devices 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.029
 shutdown and circuit breaker 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.519
 that is, it performs protection functions against 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.279
 short circuit currents and overloads and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.109
 as a function of pattern leakage protection 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.750
 let's consider the main 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.610
 characteristics of ouzo and automatic 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.110
 circuit breaker 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.170
 main characteristics of the device 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.480
 protective shutdown is set 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 leakage flow so-called 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.800
 pattern sensitivity and rated current 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.079
 that is, the maximum current at which already 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.550
 remains operable ie it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.539
 the mechanism is operational 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.730
 and will not fail in the figure on the left in 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.969
 red rectangle combined as 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.260
 since those are the main characteristics that 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.040
 indicated on the front of the case 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.100
 pattern of the main characteristics 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.450
 circuit breaker is it 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 rated current which is indicated 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.100
 number on its front and time 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.650
 such characteristic which 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.310
 denoted by the letter of our example 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.200
 in the picture to the right, this is b16 automatic 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.030
 switch with and time 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.240
 electromagnetic characteristic 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.369
 release b with rated current at 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.759
 16 amps you to the setting of the heat 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.400
 16 amp trip is logical 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.290
 assume that since the design 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.659
 Difficult and includes devices 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.670
 safety shutdown and automatic 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.340
 the switch then respectively 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.590
 pattern specifications and specifications 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.740
 circuit breakers should also 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.299
 be indicated on the front panel 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.430
 differential machine so it is 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.100
 front panel shows time 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.049
 such characteristic is the nominal which 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.340
 characterize the characteristic 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.140
 electromagnetic triggering 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.320
 release and heat setting 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.590
 releaser of this example c25 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.179
 and module sensitivity 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.650
 differential protection our example 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.900
 three hundredths amps or 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.450
 chain milliamps if we now see 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.370
 to the front panel of the protective device 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.989
 shutdown then we see what's on it 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.870
 indicates its main characteristics 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.900
 i.e. this sensitivity is 300 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.150
 milliampere and nominal 25 amperes per 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.459
 front panel difavtomat a right 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.439
 we see that besides his nominal 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.780
 current also indicates the time is 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.010
 the characteristic that is indicated the letter 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.530
 denoting 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.079
 type of time such a characteristic 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.849
 the sensitivity is also indicated below. 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.609
 differential protection module 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.549
 so we see that the main thing 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:50.590
 the difference in appearance of the device 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.260
 protective disconnect from difavtomat a 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.870
 is that on the front 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.180
 Diftautomat a marking is indicated 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.459
 time are the characteristics in the form 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.459
 latin letter that is if you see 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.980
 that the front panel indicates the letter 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.920
 before nominal therefore before you 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.139
 Emergency circuit breakers if you see that bukovki 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.569
 No , only nominal and 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.489
 modulus sensitivity hold it 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.560
 mean before you ordinary 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.569
 residual current devices ie 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.419
 the difference is in stock 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.519
 letters that indicate the type of time are 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:27.129
 characteristics in this way 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.290
 appearance is easy to distinguish the pattern from 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.449
 differential machine if video 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.669
