00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.650 
reviews of it I'd like to share as well
but<00:00:23.130> first<00:00:23.310> off<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.789> want<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> show<00:00:24.090> how<00:00:24.240> compact

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
but first off I want to show how compact

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.769 
but first off I want to show how compact
it<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.350> way<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.740> blue<00:00:25.890> legs<00:00:26.099> fold<00:00:26.400> up

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
it is with the way the blue legs fold up

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.099 
it is with the way the blue legs fold up
and<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:27.960> very<00:00:28.170> easy<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.769> get<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.820> set<00:00:30.060> up<00:00:30.109> it's

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
and it's very easy to get it set up it's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.060 
and it's very easy to get it set up it's
got<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.289> really<00:00:31.470> nice<00:00:32.120> clicking<00:00:33.739> here<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.920> just

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
got a really nice clicking here it just

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.910 
got a really nice clicking here it just
moves<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:36.079> really<00:00:37.079> easy<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
moves in out really easy I like it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.250 
moves in out really easy I like it
because<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.219> doesn't<00:00:38.370> have<00:00:38.550> Springs<00:00:39.120> lots<00:00:40.110> of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
because it doesn't have Springs lots of

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.709 
because it doesn't have Springs lots of
tripods<00:00:40.879> they<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.000> lots<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.360> moving<00:00:42.600> parts

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
tripods they have lots of moving parts

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.660 
tripods they have lots of moving parts
that<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.170> more<00:00:43.320> potential<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.489> things

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that have more potential to and things

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.360 
that have more potential to and things
go<00:00:44.820> wrong<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.840> one<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.260> simple<00:00:46.559> has

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
go wrong so this one very simple has

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.709 
go wrong so this one very simple has
multiple<00:00:48.980> places<00:00:49.980> there<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.760> catch<00:00:50.940> so

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
multiple places there for it to catch so

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.920 
multiple places there for it to catch so
you<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.870> set<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.289> different<00:00:52.320> angles<00:00:53.930> but

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you can set up at different angles but

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
you can set up at different angles but
the<00:00:54.989> main<00:00:55.260> thing<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.559> wanted<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.010> show<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the main thing I wanted to show was the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.229 
the main thing I wanted to show was the
load<00:00:57.510> capacity<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.710> here<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.579> my<00:00:59.910> full

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
load capacity so here I have my full

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.460 
load capacity so here I have my full
frame<00:01:00.449> camera<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.280> 70<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.579> 200<00:01:02.989> lens<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
frame camera with a 70 to 200 lens and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
frame camera with a 70 to 200 lens and
as<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.040> know<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.339> pretty<00:01:05.549> heavy<00:01:05.729> also

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
as you know it's pretty heavy also

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.300 
as you know it's pretty heavy also
pretty<00:01:06.930> sizable<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.560> wondered<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:08.100> this

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
pretty sizable and I wondered if this

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.590 
pretty sizable and I wondered if this
tripod<00:01:08.850> was<00:01:09.060> able<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.360> support<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:11.210> they<00:01:12.210> list

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
tripod was able to support it they list

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.390 
tripod was able to support it they list
I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.409> 17<00:01:13.890> pounds<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:16.400> capacity

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I think it's like 17 pounds of capacity

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.580 
I think it's like 17 pounds of capacity
for<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.700> tripod<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.840> again<00:01:19.110> when<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.409> have

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
for this tripod but again when you have

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.380 
for this tripod but again when you have
expensive<00:01:20.159> gear<00:01:20.460> you're<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.030> sure<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.330> you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
expensive gear you're not sure if you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.030 
expensive gear you're not sure if you
want<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.570> trust<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.680> wanted<00:01:22.890> to

want to trust that so I just wanted to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.130 
want to trust that so I just wanted to
show<00:01:23.189> everyone<00:01:23.689> how<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.070> holds<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:27.110> it's<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
quick-release place slides in very

quite a bit of torque and I get a little
bit<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.780> movement<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.640> in<00:01:54.049> regular<00:01:55.049> use

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
bit of movement but in regular use

when's the lens creeping forward I've

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.200 
when's the lens creeping forward I've
had<00:02:00.479> tripods<00:02:00.929> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> past<00:02:01.939> they<00:02:02.939> have<00:02:03.060> had

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819 
had tripods in the past they have had
problems<00:02:03.539> that<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:03.929> I<00:02:04.049> set<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.409> camera<00:02:04.799> up

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
problems that as I set the camera up

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.180 
problems that as I set the camera up
like<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:06.030> will<00:02:06.179> actually<00:02:06.740> tilt<00:02:07.740> forward

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
like this it will actually tilt forward

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.949 
like this it will actually tilt forward
due<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.849> weight<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.420> loosening<00:02:09.840> it

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
due to the weight here I'm loosening it

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.050 
due to the weight here I'm loosening it
up<00:02:11.090> see<00:02:12.709> there<00:02:13.709> we<00:02:13.830> are<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.700> will<00:02:14.819> kind<00:02:14.940> of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
up see there we are and it will kind of

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.180 
up see there we are and it will kind of
creep<00:02:15.269> forward<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:16.010> throughout<00:02:17.010> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
creep forward like this throughout the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.400 
creep forward like this throughout the
shoot<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:18.269> this<00:02:18.420> one<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.780> completely<00:02:19.170> solid

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
shoot but this one is completely solid

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.740 
shoot but this one is completely solid
you<00:02:19.650> have<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.830> make<00:02:19.980> sure<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.160> put<00:02:21.150> down<00:02:21.360> all

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
you have to make sure to put down all

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.030 
you have to make sure to put down all
the<00:02:22.489> knobs<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:24.230> it's<00:02:25.230> completely<00:02:25.799> stable

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
the knobs and it's completely stable

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.990 
the knobs and it's completely stable
front<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.610> back<00:02:26.790> side<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.299> side<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.400> really

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
front to back side to side so I really

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.740 
front to back side to side so I really
enjoyed<00:02:30.329> that<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:31.620> very<00:02:32.610> sturdy<00:02:33.030> for<00:02:33.540> its

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
enjoyed that it's very sturdy for its

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.910 
enjoyed that it's very sturdy for its
weight<00:02:34.049> and<00:02:34.380> size<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:36.120> other<00:02:36.239> feature<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:37.290> I

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
weight and size the other feature that I

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.150 
weight and size the other feature that I
like<00:02:38.130> quite<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> bit<00:02:38.519> will<00:02:38.790> set<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.090> down<00:02:40.160> and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
like quite a bit will set this down and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.039 
like quite a bit will set this down and
actually<00:02:41.519> why<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:41.849> went<00:02:42.060> with<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.360> model<00:02:42.810> over

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
actually why I went with this model over

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.890 
actually why I went with this model over
the<00:02:43.319> smaller<00:02:43.620> one<00:02:43.970> was<00:02:44.970> for<00:02:45.269> its<00:02:45.390> ability<00:02:45.599> to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
the smaller one was for its ability to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.960 
the smaller one was for its ability to
turn<00:02:46.079> into<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.349> monopod<00:02:46.829> so<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.549> just<00:02:47.760> take

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
turn into a monopod so you just take

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.849 
turn into a monopod so you just take
this<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:49.639> screw<00:02:50.639> that<00:02:50.850> end<00:02:51.090> piece<00:02:51.269> off<00:02:53.569> and

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
this and screw that end piece off and

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.099 
this and screw that end piece off and
you<00:02:55.859> pull<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.190> through<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.489> top<00:02:56.989> then<00:02:57.989> you

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
you pull that through the top then you

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.460 
you pull that through the top then you
take<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.680> leg<00:02:59.100> with<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.489> pad<00:02:59.760> on<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:01.049> just

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
take the leg with the pad on it and just

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.849 
take the leg with the pad on it and just
unscrew<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:03.810> comes<00:03:04.019> off<00:03:04.170> very<00:03:04.200> smoothly

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
unscrew it that comes off very smoothly

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.240 
unscrew it that comes off very smoothly
and<00:03:05.310> see<00:03:06.299> there<00:03:06.510> just<00:03:06.900> detaches<00:03:07.410> from<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.620> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
and see there just detaches from the the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:16.670 
and see there just detaches from the the
rest<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.670> legs<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:13.170> then<00:03:15.470> attach<00:03:16.470> it

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
rest of the legs and then attach it

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.259 
rest of the legs and then attach it
there<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.280> how<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.430> usually<00:03:20.700> use<00:03:21.090> it

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
there and this is how I usually use it

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.190 
there and this is how I usually use it
with<00:03:22.230> my<00:03:22.440> 70<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.130> 200<00:03:23.569> that's<00:03:24.569> not<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> lens<00:03:25.019> I'm

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
with my 70 to 200 that's not a lens I'm

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.670 
with my 70 to 200 that's not a lens I'm
doing<00:03:25.579> many<00:03:26.579> of<00:03:26.670> my<00:03:26.940> landscapes<00:03:27.480> with<00:03:27.720> and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
doing many of my landscapes with and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.559 
doing many of my landscapes with and
that<00:03:28.889> was<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.250> show<00:03:29.280> how<00:03:29.700> stable<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.420> was

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
that was just to show how stable it was

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.930 
that was just to show how stable it was
but<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.560> great<00:03:31.829> for<00:03:32.069> when<00:03:32.160> I'm<00:03:32.280> doing

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
but this is great for when I'm doing

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.349 
but this is great for when I'm doing
sporting<00:03:33.810> events<00:03:34.200> has<00:03:34.920> plenty<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.310> height<00:03:35.579> I'm

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
sporting events has plenty of height I'm

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.770 
sporting events has plenty of height I'm
about<00:03:36.750> 510<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:38.190> can<00:03:38.340> see<00:03:38.519> it's<00:03:39.299> not<00:03:39.510> even

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
about 510 and you can see it's not even

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.710 
about 510 and you can see it's not even
fully<00:03:40.560> extended<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.459> that's<00:03:41.700> great<00:03:42.510> height

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
fully extended and that's great height

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.309 
fully extended and that's great height
for<00:03:42.989> me

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
for me

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.159 
for me
you<00:03:43.950> can<00:03:44.130> go<00:03:44.310> even<00:03:44.760> further<00:03:45.239> for<00:03:45.780> those<00:03:45.870> of<00:03:46.049> you

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
you can go even further for those of you

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.220 
you can go even further for those of you
who<00:03:46.290> are<00:03:46.349> taller<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.519> that's<00:03:47.880> probably<00:03:48.389> much

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
who are taller and that's probably much

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.800 
who are taller and that's probably much
higher<00:03:49.260> than<00:03:49.650> what<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.769> would<00:03:49.889> want<00:03:50.099> to<00:03:50.220> be<00:03:50.340> at

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
higher than what I would want to be at

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.160 
higher than what I would want to be at
so<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.900> could<00:03:52.169> probably<00:03:52.319> even<00:03:53.250> maybe<00:03:53.579> six

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
so you could probably even maybe six

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.569 
so you could probably even maybe six
three<00:03:55.170> or<00:03:55.349> four<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.829> not<00:03:55.950> even<00:03:56.159> have<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.370> bend

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
three or four and not even have to bend

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.960 
three or four and not even have to bend
over<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:56.939> part

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
over that part

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.320 
over that part
and<00:03:58.060> then<00:03:58.750> very<00:03:59.080> quick<00:03:59.350> to<00:03:59.770> put<00:03:59.920> away<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:01.150> very

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
and then very quick to put away so very

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.820 
and then very quick to put away so very
solid<00:04:01.630> tripod<00:04:02.020> the<00:04:02.290> other<00:04:02.410> thing<00:04:02.560> I<00:04:02.650> like

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
solid tripod the other thing I like

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.380 
solid tripod the other thing I like
about<00:04:02.860> it<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.400> has<00:04:03.640> nothing<00:04:03.880> to<00:04:04.090> do<00:04:04.240> with

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
about it and this has nothing to do with

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.990 
about it and this has nothing to do with
its<00:04:04.600> performance<00:04:05.200> but<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.460> can<00:04:06.670> see<00:04:06.820> I<00:04:06.850> got

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
its performance but you can see I got

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.700 
its performance but you can see I got
the<00:04:07.180> gold<00:04:07.390> version<00:04:07.780> here<00:04:07.990> and<00:04:08.440> it's<00:04:08.590> actually

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
the gold version here and it's actually

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.750 
the gold version here and it's actually
even<00:04:09.340> almost<00:04:09.520> a<00:04:10.710> rose<00:04:11.710> gold<00:04:12.040> when<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:12.520> see<00:04:12.670> it

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
even almost a rose gold when you see it

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.910 
even almost a rose gold when you see it
in<00:04:12.850> person<00:04:13.050> which<00:04:14.050> I've<00:04:14.440> gotten<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:14.740> lot<00:04:14.860> of

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
in person which I've gotten a lot of

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.590

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
here you can see I have the spike part

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.909 
here you can see I have the spike part
attached<00:05:00.640> on<00:05:01.140> most<00:05:02.140> tripods<00:05:02.620> you<00:05:02.770> can

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
attached on most tripods you can

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.760 
attached on most tripods you can
actually<00:05:03.040> just<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:04.750> rubber<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.560> spike

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
actually just the rubber and the spike

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.590 
actually just the rubber and the spike
can<00:05:05.980> be<00:05:06.070> on<00:05:06.190> at<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.370> same<00:05:06.400> time<00:05:06.580> this<00:05:07.419> one

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
can be on at the same time this one

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.240 
can be on at the same time this one
though<00:05:07.750> it's<00:05:07.930> it's<00:05:08.140> separate<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.890> then<00:05:09.040> you

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
though it's it's separate and then you

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.030 
though it's it's separate and then you
can<00:05:09.640> attach<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.090> rubber<00:05:10.240> end<00:05:10.590> so<00:05:11.590> I<00:05:11.650> find<00:05:11.890> that

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
can attach the rubber end so I find that

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.180 
can attach the rubber end so I find that
kind<00:05:12.280> of<00:05:12.460> hard<00:05:12.730> when<00:05:13.210> I'm<00:05:13.950> needing<00:05:14.950> to<00:05:15.070> switch

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
kind of hard when I'm needing to switch

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.250 
kind of hard when I'm needing to switch
it<00:05:15.430> quickly<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:16.210> have<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.480> carry<00:05:16.750> around<00:05:16.900> the

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
it quickly to have to carry around the

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.760 
it quickly to have to carry around the
extra<00:05:18.600> pieces<00:05:19.600> to<00:05:19.990> turn<00:05:20.260> that<00:05:20.440> to<00:05:20.740> the

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
extra pieces to turn that to the

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.590 
extra pieces to turn that to the
rubberized<00:05:21.220> or<00:05:21.790> vice<00:05:22.000> versa

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
rubberized or vice versa

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.240 
rubberized or vice versa
it's<00:05:23.230> just<00:05:23.350> a<00:05:23.410> little<00:05:23.590> inconvenient<00:05:24.100> seems

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
it's just a little inconvenient seems

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.100 
it's just a little inconvenient seems
that<00:05:24.340> could<00:05:24.490> be<00:05:24.580> easy<00:05:24.760> to<00:05:25.000> build<00:05:25.240> in<00:05:25.419> like<00:05:25.840> most

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
that could be easy to build in like most

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.020 
that could be easy to build in like most
tripods<00:05:26.500> do<00:05:26.650> whereas<00:05:27.280> actually<00:05:27.430> covering<00:05:27.940> the

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
tripods do whereas actually covering the

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.340 
tripods do whereas actually covering the
spike<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.390> you<00:05:28.450> can<00:05:28.600> just<00:05:28.780> unscrew<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:29.169> to

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
spike and you can just unscrew it to

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.430 
spike and you can just unscrew it to
hide<00:05:29.530> or<00:05:29.830> expose<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:30.669> spike<00:05:30.940> and<00:05:31.440> however

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
though most the time like I said I'm

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.370 
though most the time like I said I'm
using<00:05:33.940> it<00:05:34.180> for<00:05:34.330> sports<00:05:34.570> like<00:05:34.780> soccer<00:05:34.960> games

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
indoors on a wood floor I'll switch it

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.370 
indoors on a wood floor I'll switch it
out<00:05:41.169> to<00:05:41.320> the<00:05:41.500> two<00:05:41.890> rubber<00:05:42.630> besides<00:05:43.630> that<00:05:43.870> it's

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
out to the two rubber besides that it's

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.900 
out to the two rubber besides that it's
really<00:05:44.620> nice<00:05:44.740> you<00:05:44.800> can<00:05:45.070> see<00:05:45.280> the<00:05:45.400> controls<00:05:45.760> up

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
really nice you can see the controls up

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.380 
really nice you can see the controls up
close<00:05:46.150> here<00:05:47.550> they<00:05:48.550> have<00:05:48.730> two<00:05:48.970> different<00:05:49.150> ones

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
close here they have two different ones

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.060 
close here they have two different ones
that<00:05:49.630> affect<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:50.470> ball<00:05:51.310> head<00:05:51.520> and<00:05:52.560> I<00:05:53.560> may<00:05:54.010> be

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
that affect the ball head and I may be

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.000 
that affect the ball head and I may be
getting<00:05:54.280> a<00:05:54.490> mixed<00:05:54.760> up<00:05:54.850> but<00:05:54.940> I<00:05:55.000> believe<00:05:55.390> that

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
getting a mixed up but I believe that

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.420 
getting a mixed up but I believe that
this<00:05:57.010> one<00:05:57.220> is<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.490> main<00:05:57.930> tension<00:05:58.930> and<00:05:59.340> so<00:06:00.340> you

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
this one is the main tension and so you

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.550 
this one is the main tension and so you
can<00:06:00.730> choose<00:06:01.030> what<00:06:01.600> degree<00:06:01.750> you<00:06:02.110> want<00:06:02.260> movement

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
can choose what degree you want movement

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.890 
can choose what degree you want movement
and<00:06:03.130> then<00:06:03.400> this<00:06:03.490> is<00:06:03.669> the<00:06:03.790> secondary<00:06:04.300> here<00:06:04.660> and

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
and then this is the secondary here and

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.870 
and then this is the secondary here and
they<00:06:04.960> have<00:06:05.080> the<00:06:05.230> numbers<00:06:05.560> on<00:06:05.710> the<00:06:05.830> dial<00:06:06.039> so<00:06:06.370> you

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
they have the numbers on the dial so you

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.000 
they have the numbers on the dial so you
can<00:06:07.030> choose<00:06:07.330> how<00:06:07.930> tight<00:06:08.350> you<00:06:08.530> want<00:06:08.740> it<00:06:08.800> to<00:06:08.919> be

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
can choose how tight you want it to be

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.310 
can choose how tight you want it to be
and<00:06:09.130> how<00:06:09.250> much<00:06:09.430> movement<00:06:09.940> and<00:06:10.330> that<00:06:10.990> may<00:06:11.140> help

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
and how much movement and that may help

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.670 
and how much movement and that may help
in<00:06:11.500> a

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
in a

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.140 
in a
panting<00:06:12.039> situation<00:06:12.639> if<00:06:12.729> you're<00:06:12.850> using<00:06:12.970> all

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
panting situation if you're using all

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.659 
panting situation if you're using all
three<00:06:13.360> legs<00:06:13.539> and<00:06:13.750> want<00:06:13.960> to<00:06:14.130> follow<00:06:15.130> movement

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
three legs and want to follow movement

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:16.800 
three legs and want to follow movement
now<00:06:15.759> and<00:06:15.880> they<00:06:15.940> help<00:06:16.150> I've<00:06:16.300> personally<00:06:16.570> never

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
now and they help I've personally never

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:17.520 
now and they help I've personally never
used<00:06:17.169> it

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
used it

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.890 
used it
I<00:06:18.000> usually<00:06:19.000> just<00:06:19.180> tighten<00:06:19.509> both<00:06:19.630> of<00:06:19.660> them<00:06:19.810> down

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
I usually just tighten both of them down

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.689 
I usually just tighten both of them down
once<00:06:20.289> I<00:06:20.380> get<00:06:20.530> the<00:06:20.680> frame<00:06:20.919> that<00:06:21.100> I<00:06:21.160> want<00:06:21.430> and

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
once I get the frame that I want and

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.600 
once I get the frame that I want and
then<00:06:22.530> I'll<00:06:23.530> just<00:06:23.740> use<00:06:23.830> this<00:06:24.100> one<00:06:24.310> here<00:06:24.430> which

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
then I'll just use this one here which

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.430 
then I'll just use this one here which
controls<00:06:24.880> the<00:06:25.150> pan<00:06:25.389> you<00:06:26.050> can<00:06:26.139> see<00:06:26.289> it's<00:06:26.410> very

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
controls the pan you can see it's very

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.340 
controls the pan you can see it's very
smooth<00:06:26.949> I<00:06:27.310> wouldn't<00:06:27.699> say<00:06:27.820> it's<00:06:28.139> smooth<00:06:29.139> enough

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
smooth I wouldn't say it's smooth enough

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.340 
smooth I wouldn't say it's smooth enough
for<00:06:29.590> video<00:06:29.860> in<00:06:30.699> most<00:06:31.330> cases<00:06:31.630> I<00:06:31.810> mean<00:06:32.080> it's

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
for video in most cases I mean it's

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.879 
for video in most cases I mean it's
pretty<00:06:32.500> fluid<00:06:33.150> but<00:06:34.150> it's<00:06:34.509> definitely<00:06:35.050> not<00:06:35.830> a

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
pretty fluid but it's definitely not a

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:36.719 
pretty fluid but it's definitely not a
fluid<00:06:36.460> head

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
fluid head

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.719 
fluid head
I<00:06:36.940> wouldn't<00:06:37.389> say<00:06:38.340> compared<00:06:39.340> to<00:06:39.400> the<00:06:39.460> ones<00:06:39.580> that

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
I wouldn't say compared to the ones that

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.730 
I wouldn't say compared to the ones that
I've<00:06:39.820> used<00:06:40.060> but<00:06:40.479> you<00:06:40.930> probably<00:06:41.320> could<00:06:41.560> get

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
I've used but you probably could get

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.350 
I've used but you probably could get
away<00:06:41.800> with<00:06:41.979> it<00:06:42.070> if<00:06:42.220> you<00:06:42.340> were<00:06:42.550> doing<00:06:42.910> it<00:06:43.150> for<00:06:43.180> a

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
away with it if you were doing it for a

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.210 
away with it if you were doing it for a
panning<00:06:43.810> on<00:06:43.930> video<00:06:44.229> but<00:06:44.500> not<00:06:44.710> but<00:06:44.949> tilt

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
panning on video but not but tilt

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.850 
panning on video but not but tilt
definitely<00:06:45.699> just<00:06:45.880> cuz<00:06:46.030> this<00:06:46.120> is<00:06:46.300> a<00:06:46.330> photo

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
definitely just cuz this is a photo

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.570 
definitely just cuz this is a photo
tripod<00:06:47.860> if<00:06:48.280> you<00:06:48.580> were<00:06:48.669> trying<00:06:48.910> to<00:06:48.970> get<00:06:50.370> up<00:06:51.370> and

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
tripod if you were trying to get up and

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.730 
tripod if you were trying to get up and
down<00:06:51.699> tilt<00:06:52.060> it's<00:06:52.750> not<00:06:52.990> smooth<00:06:53.320> enough<00:06:53.440> for

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
down tilt it's not smooth enough for

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.950 
down tilt it's not smooth enough for
that<00:06:53.860> but<00:06:54.699> hopefully<00:06:54.940> that<00:06:55.060> helps<00:06:55.360> I<00:06:55.630> would

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
that but hopefully that helps I would

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.110 
that but hopefully that helps I would
definitely<00:06:56.349> recommend<00:06:56.979> this<00:06:57.400> tripod<00:06:57.880> it's

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
definitely recommend this tripod it's

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.850 
definitely recommend this tripod it's
