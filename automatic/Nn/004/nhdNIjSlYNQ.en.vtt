00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.740
 then to which human species to 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.920
 belong the tourville bones 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.990
 we first have a chronological context 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.939
 which allows us to assume that we 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.950
 are rather in the presence of members of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.470
 the Neanderthal lineage we have a 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.419
 geographical context that also plead 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.550
 for this hypothesis we are in 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.110
 Africa we would not even talk about a line 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.610
 Neanderthal because we write 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.440
 Neanderthalian so never colonized 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.059
 Africa the origin of the lineage of a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.800
 green aliens and how she evolved 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.989
 it's a question that's always very 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 debated the Neanderthal lineage 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.000
 seems to be born in europe maybe for 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.940
 reasons for particular evolution 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.070
 Following an isolation of Europe 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.570
 close to there are less than 450 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.530
 million for the oldest fossil that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.019
 it is related to this line is 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.299
 maybe more according to the data of the 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.909
 palaeogenetic and then she goes 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.280
 disappear around dia - 30 to - 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.950
 40 thousand years one of the peculiarities of 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.689
 the humerus of tourville concerns this 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.450
 region if we have an insertion 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.290
 particular muscle called 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.710
 which serves the deltoid muscle and there 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.939
 ensures this area there a ridge that is 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.270
 very easy to see who is here gold at 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.200
 the actual men we know that 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.170
 this ridge is found rather 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.000
 frequently in older individuals 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.909
 so there are different types of causes 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.390
 that can explain the presence of a 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.090
 such a ridge 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.570
 so in the case of tourville with the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.270
 co authors 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.450
 we decided to assume that it was a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.399
 repeated movement that moves away and the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.420
 lax arm of the body and that allowed 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.340
 this arm to expand 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.539
 after you can assume no matter 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.880
 what movement even to serve you 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.330
 a striker to cut flint 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.100
 to launch something that expresses 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.649
 which allowed the expression of this ridge 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.470
 because at the top of the ridge 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.940
 we have pathological involvement that could 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.580
 to be recognized who stands very 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.769
 precisely here and there we know that this 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.290
 pathological athens is the consequence 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.480
 of a ligamentous tearing of a 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.190
 trauma that makes that at some point the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.980
 muscle was overworked and the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.360
 ligament ripped out of his area 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.180
 insertion on the water which created 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.880
 this area that's called an identity 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.780
 the oati and so there is a small 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.340
 trauma that explains that we have this 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.780
 relief at the top of this ridge so we 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.489
 may think that this is actually the 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.010
 repetitiveness of a movement that 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.340
 would explain the presence of 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.340
 this deals
