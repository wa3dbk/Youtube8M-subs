00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
looking to get the trainer working

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.450 
looking to get the trainer working
because<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.260> probably<00:01:07.409> doesn't<00:01:07.890> work<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the reason being behind that is

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.370 
the reason being behind that is
basically<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.189> Steam<00:01:17.460> version<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:19.049> GTA

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
we go all the way down to steam open up

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.889 
we go all the way down to steam open up
steam<00:01:54.390> will<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:54.899> steam<00:01:55.200> apps<00:01:55.439> common<00:01:56.899> grand

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
steam will go steam apps common grand

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.230 
steam will go steam apps common grand
theft<00:01:58.049> auto<00:01:58.229> 5<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.579> we'll<00:01:59.939> just<00:01:59.969> go

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
theft auto 5 and just we'll just go

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.899 
theft auto 5 and just we'll just go
select<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.070> takes<00:02:02.070> care<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:03.350> now

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
select and that takes care of that now

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.270 
select and that takes care of that now
essentially<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.360> will<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:07.530> will<00:02:07.680> open<00:02:07.950> up

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
essentially this will this will open up

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.919 
essentially this will this will open up
I<00:02:08.520> believe<00:02:08.729> after<00:02:09.209> we<00:02:09.660> select<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
I believe after we select the

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.970 
I believe after we select the
yes<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.420> we<00:02:13.750> don't<00:02:13.930> want<00:02:14.079> to<00:02:14.170> open<00:02:14.379> well<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.739> mean

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
yes so we don't want to open well I mean

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.319 
yes so we don't want to open well I mean
yours<00:02:15.370> will<00:02:15.549> open<00:02:15.849> fine

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
yours will open fine

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.750 
yours will open fine
yours<00:02:16.629> will<00:02:16.840> open<00:02:17.110> up<00:02:17.260> but<00:02:18.099> me<00:02:18.549> personally

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
yours will open up but me personally

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.699 
yours will open up but me personally
since<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.420> purpose<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:19.930> video<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.470> don't

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
since the purpose of this video I don't

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.550 
since the purpose of this video I don't
want<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.040> open<00:02:21.189> so<00:02:22.019> once<00:02:23.019> you<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.349> those

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
want it to open so once you have those

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.880 
want it to open so once you have those
files<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.640> next<00:02:24.970> step<00:02:25.180> would<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.420> here<00:02:25.989> too<00:02:27.840> so

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
files the next step would be here too so

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.580 
files the next step would be here too so
actually<00:02:29.890> first<00:02:30.900> there's<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.989> couple<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.349> links

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
actually first there's a couple of links

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.920 
actually first there's a couple of links
in<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.769> description<00:02:33.310> below<00:02:33.659> you'll<00:02:34.659> take<00:02:34.900> a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
in the description below you'll take a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.780 
in the description below you'll take a
look<00:02:35.170> at<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.349> there's<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.560> zipped<00:02:35.859> file<00:02:36.129> they'll

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
look at it there's a zipped file they'll

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.720 
look at it there's a zipped file they'll
contain<00:02:37.329> two<00:02:37.599> files<00:02:37.900> here<00:02:38.409> and<00:02:38.530> those<00:02:39.459> two

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
contain two files here and those two

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.080 
contain two files here and those two
files<00:02:40.000> would<00:02:40.329> be<00:02:40.540> these<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.519> components<00:02:42.519> JSON

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
files would be these the components JSON

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.289 
files would be these the components JSON
and<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.389> GML<00:02:43.810> hacks<00:02:44.109> ASI<00:02:44.879> so<00:02:45.879> we're<00:02:46.120> going<00:02:46.209> to

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
and the GML hacks ASI so we're going to

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.500 
and the GML hacks ASI so we're going to
go<00:02:46.389> back<00:02:46.629> into<00:02:46.900> our<00:02:47.049> 5m<00:02:47.500> multiplayer<00:02:48.510> so

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
go back into our 5m multiplayer so

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.629 
go back into our 5m multiplayer so
create<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.349> plugins<00:02:50.829> folder<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.370> create

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
create this plugins folder so create

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.119 
create this plugins folder so create
plugins<00:02:52.060> you've<00:02:52.659> got<00:02:52.840> lower<00:02:53.470> case<00:02:53.739> plugins

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
plugins you've got lower case plugins

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.179 
plugins you've got lower case plugins
folder<00:02:54.540> now<00:02:55.540> we're<00:02:55.720> going<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.900> take<00:02:56.109> that<00:02:56.319> GML

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
folder now we're going to take that GML

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.490 
folder now we're going to take that GML
hacks<00:02:57.459> ASI<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:59.230> we're<00:02:59.379> going<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.590> copy<00:02:59.799> it<00:03:00.069> and

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
hacks ASI and we're going to copy it and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.229 
hacks ASI and we're going to copy it and
we're<00:03:02.500> going<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.650> paste<00:03:02.889> it<00:03:03.129> in<00:03:03.250> there<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:04.120> now

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
we're going to paste it in there so now

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.819 
we're going to paste it in there so now
that's<00:03:04.420> basically<00:03:04.900> telling<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.409> game<00:03:05.590> that's

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
that's basically telling the game that's

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.369 
that's basically telling the game that's
the<00:03:06.040> trainer<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.239> it's<00:03:07.329> a<00:03:07.450> plug-in<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.200> it

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
the trainer and it's a plug-in so it

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.140 
the trainer and it's a plug-in so it
wants<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.769> run<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.129> so<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.730> will<00:03:09.849> run<00:03:10.030> the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
wants to run that so that will run the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.890 
wants to run that so that will run the
trainer<00:03:10.420> now<00:03:11.319> this<00:03:11.680> components<00:03:12.340> file<00:03:12.900> notice

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
trainer now this components file notice

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.780 
trainer now this components file notice
how<00:03:14.139> you<00:03:14.200> have<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.590> components<00:03:15.129> file<00:03:15.280> already

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
how you have a components file already

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.180 
how you have a components file already
this<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.930> modified<00:03:17.440> components<00:03:18.040> file

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
this is a modified components file

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.890 
this is a modified components file
essentially<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:18.879> telling<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.299> game<00:03:19.449> to<00:03:19.690> use

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
essentially it's telling the game to use

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.839 
essentially it's telling the game to use
that<00:03:20.169> trainer<00:03:20.500> if<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:21.160> components<00:03:21.730> while

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
that trainer if this components while

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.520 
that trainer if this components while
wasn't<00:03:22.209> modified<00:03:22.599> then<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.139> trainer

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
wasn't modified then the trainer

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.650 
wasn't modified then the trainer
wouldn't<00:03:24.010> work<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:25.030> game<00:03:25.180> just<00:03:25.419> wouldn't

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
wouldn't work the game just wouldn't

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.369 
wouldn't work the game just wouldn't
know<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:25.810> was<00:03:25.930> there<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:27.810> we'll<00:03:28.810> go<00:03:28.900> copy<00:03:29.139> and

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
know I was there so we'll go copy and

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.319 
know I was there so we'll go copy and
replace<00:03:29.440> because<00:03:30.370> we<00:03:30.609> want<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.849> replace<00:03:31.120> it

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
replace because we want to replace it

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.740 
replace because we want to replace it
right<00:03:31.419> so<00:03:32.290> that's<00:03:32.409> done<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:34.030> once<00:03:34.449> you've<00:03:34.629> done

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
right so that's done so once you've done

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.569 
right so that's done so once you've done
all<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:34.959> everything's<00:03:35.829> done<00:03:36.010> we've<00:03:36.250> got<00:03:36.430> the

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
all that everything's done we've got the

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.099 
all that everything's done we've got the
plugins<00:03:36.970> folder<00:03:37.060> we've<00:03:37.480> got<00:03:37.659> the<00:03:37.780> components

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
plugins folder we've got the components

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.849 
plugins folder we've got the components
replaced<00:03:38.739> everything's<00:03:39.280> here<00:03:39.780> now<00:03:40.859> hopefully

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
replaced everything's here now hopefully

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.830 
replaced everything's here now hopefully
by<00:03:42.129> that<00:03:42.159> point<00:03:42.549> you<00:03:42.729> have<00:03:42.909> this<00:03:43.150> patch<00:03:43.479> file

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
by that point you have this patch file

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
you've made that back up you'll go to

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.410 
you've made that back up you'll go to
your<00:04:33.340> zip<00:04:33.640> file<00:04:33.850> that<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:34.090> downloaded

your zip file that you downloaded
earlier<00:04:34.630> from<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.110> mega<00:04:35.290> link<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.740> you're

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
earlier from the mega link and you're

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.420 
earlier from the mega link and you're
going<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.460> take<00:04:36.670> this<00:04:36.880> GTA<00:04:37.270> 5<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:38.020> you<00:04:38.770> go<00:04:38.890> BAM

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
going to take this GTA 5 and you go BAM

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.480 
going to take this GTA 5 and you go BAM
it's<00:04:40.270> going<00:04:40.390> to<00:04:40.480> ask<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.690> to<00:04:40.780> replace<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.490> so

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
it's going to ask you to replace it so

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.360 
it's going to ask you to replace it so
move<00:04:43.420> and<00:04:43.570> replace<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.620> now<00:04:44.770> we've<00:04:45.010> replaced

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
move and replace so now we've replaced

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.590 
move and replace so now we've replaced
that<00:04:46.740> so<00:04:47.740> essentially<00:04:48.400> now<00:04:48.910> that's<00:04:49.210> replaced

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
that so essentially now that's replaced

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.290 
that so essentially now that's replaced
with<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.900> retail<00:04:50.290> version<00:04:50.500> of<00:04:50.860> GTA<00:04:51.640> 5<00:04:52.090> which

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
with the retail version of GTA 5 which

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.480 
with the retail version of GTA 5 which
is<00:04:52.420> compatible<00:04:52.810> with<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.320> trainer<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:53.980> the

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
is compatible with the trainer and the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.350 
is compatible with the trainer and the
next<00:04:54.760> step<00:04:54.940> is<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.300> go<00:04:55.420> update<00:04:55.930> and<00:04:56.970> also<00:04:57.970> take

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
next step is to go update and also take

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.360 
next step is to go update and also take
this<00:04:58.540> update<00:04:58.900> folder<00:04:59.170> or<00:04:59.740> this<00:04:59.890> update<00:05:00.160> file

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
this update folder or this update file

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.910 
this update folder or this update file
and<00:05:00.640> throw<00:05:01.120> her<00:05:01.240> in<00:05:01.270> there<00:05:01.600> and<00:05:02.530> wait<00:05:02.710> for<00:05:02.740> it

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
and throw her in there and wait for it

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.260 
and throw her in there and wait for it
to<00:05:03.010> be<00:05:03.130> done<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:04.740> once<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.860> do<00:05:06.010> that<00:05:06.040> now<00:05:07.000> I'm

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
to be done and once you do that now I'm

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.700 
to be done and once you do that now I'm
not<00:05:07.420> gonna<00:05:07.510> replace<00:05:07.840> mine<00:05:08.080> just<00:05:08.380> because<00:05:08.680> I

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
not gonna replace mine just because I

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.080 
not gonna replace mine just because I
have<00:05:08.920> already<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.520> it's<00:05:09.730> just<00:05:09.880> kind<00:05:10.030> of

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
have already and it's just kind of

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.060 
have already and it's just kind of
pointless<00:05:10.330> so<00:05:10.660> your<00:05:11.440> version<00:05:11.650> is<00:05:11.920> now

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
pointless so your version is now

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.940 
pointless so your version is now
compatible<00:05:12.400> with<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.810> 5em<00:05:14.350> with<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.650> trainer

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
compatible with the 5em with the trainer

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.190 
compatible with the 5em with the trainer
so<00:05:15.430> essentially<00:05:16.090> that's<00:05:16.300> how<00:05:16.540> that<00:05:16.600> works

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
so essentially that's how that works

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.320 
so essentially that's how that works
um<00:05:17.740> it<00:05:17.980> took<00:05:18.250> me<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.460> little<00:05:18.700> bit<00:05:18.850> to<00:05:19.000> get<00:05:19.120> that

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
um it took me a little bit to get that

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.000 
um it took me a little bit to get that
working<00:05:19.540> so<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.050> know<00:05:20.380> what<00:05:20.740> this<00:05:20.860> will

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
working so I know what this will

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.470 
working so I know what this will
