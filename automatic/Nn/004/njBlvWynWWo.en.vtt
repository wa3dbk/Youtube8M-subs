small ball jokes right now it's just

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.380 
small ball jokes right now it's just
it's<00:00:49.890> my<00:00:50.039> OE<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.610> he<00:00:50.760> magnetized<00:00:51.210> them

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it's my OE you know he magnetized them

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
it's my OE you know he magnetized them
and<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:51.750> they<00:00:51.780> stick<00:00:52.199> around<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> pivot<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and if they stick around the pivot and

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.150 
and if they stick around the pivot and
then<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.460> non<00:00:54.149> magnetized<00:00:54.719> titanium<00:00:55.379> he

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
then with the non magnetized titanium he

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340 
then with the non magnetized titanium he
is<00:00:56.219> able<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.300> move<00:00:57.480> them<00:00:57.690> around<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.230> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
is able to move them around and this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.889 
is able to move them around and this
segment<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> easy<00:00:59.789> part<00:01:00.030> doing<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
segment this is the easy part doing it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.900 
segment this is the easy part doing it
on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> other<00:01:01.320> side<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:02.550> when<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.820> gets

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
on the other side that's when it gets

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.479 
on the other side that's when it gets
tricky<00:01:03.530> this<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.680> tricky<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.280> don't<00:01:05.430> know

that's<00:02:19.790> crazy<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.630> think<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.349> guy<00:02:21.500> who<00:02:21.560> made<00:02:21.680> a

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
that's crazy I think the guy who made a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.490 
that's crazy I think the guy who made a
knife<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.550> just<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:23.420> like<00:02:23.690> proof<00:02:24.349> of

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
knife just it just just like proof of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.229 
knife just it just just like proof of
concept<00:02:25.010> that<00:02:25.130> yes<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.520> can<00:02:25.730> put<00:02:26.030> something

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
concept that yes you can put something

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.240 
concept that yes you can put something
together<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:27.230> well<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.620> was<00:02:27.800> wondering<00:02:27.920> why

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
together like well I was wondering why

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.130 
together like well I was wondering why
this<00:02:28.310> knife<00:02:28.670> was<00:02:28.849> so<00:02:29.030> expensive<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.750> i<00:02:29.870> think

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
this knife was so expensive and i think

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.660 
this knife was so expensive and i think
this<00:02:30.349> is<00:02:30.410> interesting<00:02:31.069> like<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.310> mean<00:02:31.550> it's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
this is interesting like I mean it's

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.930 
this is interesting like I mean it's
quite<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:31.970> feat<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:33.489> yeah<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.519> think<00:02:34.730> it

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
quite the feat of the yeah I think it

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.520 
quite the feat of the yeah I think it
just<00:02:35.090> like<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.330> challenge<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.930> know<00:02:35.989> can<00:02:36.470> I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
just like a challenge you know can I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.120 
just like a challenge you know can I
make<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:37.069> KD<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.819> so<00:02:38.090> small<00:02:38.769> it<00:02:39.769> can't<00:02:40.010> be

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
make I KD is so small it can't be

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.860 
make I KD is so small it can't be
anything<00:02:40.370> else<00:02:41.860> that's<00:02:42.860> insane<00:02:43.370> I<00:02:43.690> think<00:02:44.690> one

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
anything else that's insane I think one

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.190 
anything else that's insane I think one
more<00:02:45.080> real<00:02:49.330> we're<00:02:50.330> just<00:02:50.750> getting<00:02:51.049> on<00:02:51.170> the
