00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.980 
impact I don't know if you guys have
been<00:06:53.370> watching<00:06:53.520> reaction<00:06:54.210> after<00:06:54.450> the<00:06:54.540> show<00:06:54.750> I

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
been watching reaction after the show I

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.930 
been watching reaction after the show I
watched<00:06:55.410> it<00:06:55.560> again<00:06:55.710> not<00:06:56.520> as<00:06:56.640> good<00:06:56.820> as<00:06:56.910> the

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
watched it again not as good as the

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.120 
watched it again not as good as the
episode<00:06:57.360> last<00:06:57.570> week<00:06:57.780> probably<00:06:58.770> because

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.130 
episode last week probably because

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.970 
episode last week probably because
impact<00:06:59.730> was<00:06:59.880> not<00:07:00.000> as<00:07:00.120> good<00:07:00.180> as<00:07:00.360> last<00:07:00.540> week<00:07:00.980> and

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
impact was not as good as last week and

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.620 
impact was not as good as last week and
that's<00:07:02.160> where<00:07:02.460> most<00:07:02.790> of<00:07:02.940> the<00:07:03.000> material<00:07:03.540> is

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
that's where most of the material is

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.500 
that's where most of the material is
coming<00:07:03.900> from<00:07:04.250> but<00:07:05.250> still<00:07:05.670> I<00:07:05.910> would<00:07:06.090> check<00:07:06.330> this

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
coming from but still I would check this

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.910 
coming from but still I would check this
show<00:07:06.720> out<00:07:06.750> if<00:07:07.020> you<00:07:07.110> haven't<00:07:07.290> seen<00:07:07.560> it<00:07:07.620> because

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920 
show out if you haven't seen it because

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.500 
show out if you haven't seen it because
I<00:07:07.950> think<00:07:08.130> they've<00:07:08.490> stumbled<00:07:08.730> onto<00:07:09.030> a<00:07:09.120> way<00:07:09.360> of

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
I think they've stumbled onto a way of

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.420 
I think they've stumbled onto a way of
presenting<00:07:09.840> this<00:07:10.080> stuff<00:07:10.380> that<00:07:10.650> is<00:07:10.800> really

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
presenting this stuff that is really

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.340 
presenting this stuff that is really
unique<00:07:11.790> and<00:07:12.060> actually<00:07:12.420> pretty<00:07:12.600> compelling<00:07:13.050> I

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.350 
unique and actually pretty compelling I

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.870 
unique and actually pretty compelling I
mean<00:07:13.620> hell<00:07:13.770> I'd<00:07:13.950> say<00:07:14.130> the<00:07:14.250> reaction<00:07:14.790> is

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 
mean hell I'd say the reaction is

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.280 
mean hell I'd say the reaction is
probably<00:07:15.240> doing<00:07:15.480> a<00:07:15.540> better<00:07:15.690> job<00:07:15.810> of<00:07:16.020> selling

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.290 
probably doing a better job of selling

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.870 
probably doing a better job of selling
