00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.389 
road and you know make it disappear and
I<00:02:06.840> think<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.229> fact<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.649> happening<00:02:08.190> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
I think the fact that it's happening so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.669 
I think the fact that it's happening so
openly<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.060> under<00:02:09.300> their<00:02:09.420> nose<00:02:09.660> that's<00:02:10.440> what

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
openly and under their nose that's what

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.620 
openly and under their nose that's what
distinguishes<00:02:11.180> Japan<00:02:12.180> from<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
distinguishes Japan from the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.990 
distinguishes Japan from the
rest<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> world<00:02:13.170> not<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.410> fact<00:02:13.710> that

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
rest of the world not the fact that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.700 
rest of the world not the fact that
Japan<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.030> alone<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.500> sexualizing<00:02:16.500> young

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
Japan is alone in sexualizing young

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.820 
Japan is alone in sexualizing young
women<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.220> happens<00:02:17.550> everywhere
