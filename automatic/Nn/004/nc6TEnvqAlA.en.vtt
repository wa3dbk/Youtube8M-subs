00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
got a product this is not even i think

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.550 
got a product this is not even i think
that<00:00:29.300> there's<00:00:30.300> not<00:00:30.480> even<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.720> competitor<00:00:31.230> okay

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that you can see that it become stringy

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
that you can see that it become stringy
and<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.960> becomes<00:00:37.230> very<00:00:37.320> gooey<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.129> it's

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
extremely hard to wash out of a tire

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.729 
extremely hard to wash out of a tire
these<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:42.960> other<00:00:43.230> products<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.649> are

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
these are some other products that are

these are some other products that are
out<00:00:43.770> there<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.809> that's<00:00:45.809> why<00:00:46.110> this

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
out there and that's why this

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
out there and that's why this
demonstration<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> extremely<00:00:47.879> important<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
demonstration is extremely important to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.950 
demonstration is extremely important to
show<00:00:49.039> to<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.070> customers<00:00:50.700> enter<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.750> tire

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
show to the customers enter the tire

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.450 
show to the customers enter the tire
ideals<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:52.800> happens<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.280> when

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
ideals because what happens is that when

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.750 
ideals because what happens is that when
the<00:00:53.699> customer<00:00:54.149> says<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:55.280> sire<00:00:56.280> line<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.640> my

tires the tire dealer may not know what
is<00:00:59.789> dealing<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.510> he's<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> say<00:01:01.469> I'm

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.859 
the tires but i'm going to show you
something<00:01:05.100> okay<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> product<00:01:06.750> goes

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
something okay when the product goes

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.940 
something okay when the product goes
inside<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> casing<00:01:08.150> it<00:01:09.150> goes<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> stays

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
inside the casing it goes in and stays

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.279 
inside the casing it goes in and stays
in<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.189> place

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:23.669 

as<00:01:17.289> a<00:01:17.320> tire<00:01:17.939> moves<00:01:18.939> around<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:22.590> product<00:01:23.590> will

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
as a tire moves around the product will

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.109 
as a tire moves around the product will
start<00:01:23.979> coding<00:01:24.750> very<00:01:25.750> slowly<00:01:26.700> now<00:01:27.700> when<00:01:27.880> I<00:01:27.939> say

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
start coding very slowly now when I say

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.029 
start coding very slowly now when I say
very<00:01:28.329> slowly<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:28.929> is<00:01:29.109> for<00:01:29.319> the<00:01:29.350> high-speed

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
very slowly this is for the high-speed

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.490 
very slowly this is for the high-speed
truck<00:01:30.429> tires<00:01:30.729> okay<00:01:31.119> because<00:01:31.479> it's<00:01:32.229> not<00:01:32.439> going

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
truck tires okay because it's not going

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.910 
truck tires okay because it's not going
to<00:01:32.740> create<00:01:33.159> any<00:01:33.340> wheel<00:01:33.640> balancing<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.439> that's

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
to create any wheel balancing and that's

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.630 
to create any wheel balancing and that's
why<00:01:38.729> once<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.880> goats<00:01:40.119> like<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:42.520> basically

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
why once it goats like that it basically

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.370 
why once it goats like that it basically
forms<00:01:43.329> an<00:01:43.450> equilibrium<00:01:43.869> okay<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:44.890> you've<00:01:45.039> got

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
forms an equilibrium okay and you've got

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.559 
forms an equilibrium okay and you've got
that's<00:01:47.380> what<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.679> have<00:01:47.859> now<00:01:48.099> by<00:01:49.030> showing<00:01:49.299> this

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
that's what you have now by showing this

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.209 
that's what you have now by showing this
or<00:01:49.780> gate<00:01:49.899> stays<00:01:50.200> like<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:50.469> but<00:01:50.829> in<00:01:50.950> real<00:01:51.159> life

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
or gate stays like that but in real life

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:52.589 
or gate stays like that but in real life
what's<00:01:51.640> going<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.849> happen<00:01:52.119> is<00:01:52.239> that<00:01:52.360> when<00:01:52.569> the

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
what's going to happen is that when the

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:55.889 
what's going to happen is that when the
where<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.110> product<00:01:53.439> heats<00:01:53.619> up<00:01:54.450> when<00:01:55.450> it<00:01:55.750> dies

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
where the product heats up when it dies

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.539 
where the product heats up when it dies
are<00:01:56.110> rolling<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.860> are<00:01:57.039> going<00:01:57.219> to<00:01:57.340> get<00:01:57.489> a

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
are rolling you are going to get a

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.789 
are rolling you are going to get a
little<00:01:57.879> bit<00:01:58.119> of<00:01:58.149> drift<00:01:58.539> when<00:01:59.229> it's<00:01:59.379> like<00:01:59.530> that

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
little bit of drift when it's like that

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.389 
little bit of drift when it's like that
okay<00:02:00.429> but<00:02:00.879> doesn't<00:02:01.119> cool<00:02:01.869> down<00:02:01.950> no<00:02:02.950> very

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
okay but doesn't cool down no very

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.990 
okay but doesn't cool down no very
importantly<00:02:03.939> does<00:02:04.179> not<00:02:04.420> cool<00:02:04.810> down<00:02:05.579> right

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.790 

another<00:02:10.720> thing<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.260> very<00:02:11.500> important<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.070> that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
another thing is very important is that

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.840 
another thing is very important is that
something<00:02:14.800> that<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.980> tire<00:02:15.220> dealers<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:15.730> to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
something that the tire dealers have to

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.010 
something that the tire dealers have to
know<00:02:17.460> we<00:02:18.460> can<00:02:18.640> seal<00:02:18.850> up<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.090> half<00:02:19.270> an<00:02:19.420> inch<00:02:19.570> in

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
know we can seal up to half an inch in

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.860 
know we can seal up to half an inch in
some<00:02:20.320> cases<00:02:20.560> we<00:02:20.830> sell<00:02:21.100> up<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.280> two<00:02:21.490> inches<00:02:21.870> it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
some cases we sell up to two inches it

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.160 
some cases we sell up to two inches it
