00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.700
 25 years ago karine and phoenix have 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.490
 found their little corner of paradise 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.440
 far north of their home in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.230
 the southwestern tip of the aude towards 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.730
 the ariege is the trap of the micro region 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.189
 where we easily go from small-valley 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.470
 intimate at the top of twelve hill for 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.920
 discover the sumptuous landscape of the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.920
 Pyrenees chain 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.460
 the bosc farm is an operation of 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.950
 65 hectares dedicated to sheep farming 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.030
 with a herd of 350 dairy ewes 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.030
 Lacaune 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.949
 there the little ones stay at the marrow with their 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.739
 mother since until the end of November 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.329
 and after we'll swallow them it's true and 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.470
 the females of this lot age but guard 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.180
 for herd renewal 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.100
 the product of the milking is shipped in 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.280
 internal or cheese making 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.659
 Roquefort but not only a few 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.280
 years after their arrival 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.950
 karin and felix decided to 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.539
 diversify rather than launch 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.550
 classically in the production of 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.950
 farmhouse cheeses they decided 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.690
 to innovate by creating an ice cream at 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.149
 sheep milk 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.190
 the idea that sprang up in the spring of 1995 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.380
 and who has since gone a long way 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.390
 after some trial and error success 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.550
 soon became a brand is born 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.780
 audio line is today on the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.670
 sixty thousand liters of milk products 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.170
 annually about a third is 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.399
 dedicated to the manufacture of ice cream 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.470
 farmer then a nurse so 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.830
 it's an ice cream as the name says 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.670
 fabre is made on the farm with the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.670
 milk produced on the farm is on 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.380
 So instead it means that we have a 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.979
 laboratory to standards and that is done 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.539
 in the mail of the here so that the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.460
 sheep produce good milk must 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.610
 to be well fed in the spring 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.090
 and in summer it grazes in the meadows 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.920
 from October to March 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.470
 the animals are fed in sheepfold 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.170
 with alfalfa hay clover or 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.080
 grasses produced on the farm on a 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.580
 third of the surface he has 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.110
 Felix also grows wheat and 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.000
 barley which is then traded to the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.360
 cooperative against food for the 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.700
 herd 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.810
 the farm is thus practically autonomous 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.940
 for food in 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.200
 conducting its operations FÃ©lix 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.120
 distinguished by the practice of a 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.010
 cultural technique that preserves 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.769
 Soils and minimizes the weight of inputs 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.170
 knows now since 1995 that I 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.080
 practice the technique of direct seeding 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.750
 so I plow more and I sow 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.600
 directly with a specialized seeder 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.850
 all the big ones whether it's cereals 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.970
 on hbo forage even sovereign see 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.340
 why not corn and this is a technique 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.980
 so I go back to the floor 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.739
 keeps all that is wrong 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.700
 ground ie earthworms on 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:10.490
 also develops since arabic etc 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:15.550
 the predator of slug predators and 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:18.270
 all this at the same time it allows to 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.740
 to raise the soil organic matter 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.650
 so make savings eventually 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.750
 of fertilizer and of course saving of 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.370
 diesel since 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.580
 we go once in the fields to 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.710
 place three or four times this of his 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.120
 side and felix cultivates efficiency in 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.130
 his way of producing 100 is from 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.330
 preserve the environment 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.010
 karine tuil approach just as 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.290
 demanding in the manufacture of these 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.490
 farm ice cream 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.350
 first worked with milk 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.920
 fresh will represent everything supreme 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.570
 compared to industrial ice cream already 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.310
 against had had the end costs we see 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.660
 already the difference then with the milk of 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.920
 sheep is a little different because 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.530
 that we end up with products that 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.480
 are very anxious 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.810
 that's how I said earlier in 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.360
 does the fat but comes from 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.040
 milk we do not have to add 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.500
 dairy butter or a lot of cream 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.380
 to reach this rate of 8% of material 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.220
 fat and so after we have products 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.100
 who knows a lot of curiosity and 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.730
 is very digestible too and brooke who 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.880
 brings a lot of vitamin c relay that 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.650
 is very very good for health 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.270
 Ice making begins with the 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.640
 preparation of a milk-based mix 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.740
 fresh sugar a little milk in 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.800
 powder and a small amount of cream 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.080
 and possibly egg yolk on 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.660
 pasteurized mixture then cooled and 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.340
 allowed to rest for several hours 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.380
 it is the ripening phase that allows 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.170
 the development of flavors and so 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.790
 ice cream texture 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.040
 the addition of perfume can be done before 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.230
 pasteurization before the passage 1 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.800
 turbine or during the extraction 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.800
 we will talk about marble age 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.390
 the next step is the mixer icing 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.430
 sink into a turbine that goes from 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.620
 brew the cool that the swelling 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.020
 the abundance and the percentage 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.060
 incorporated areas of the loaves for 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.010
 homemade ice cream or farmer's rate 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.950
 of expansion remain low in order to 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.540
 to showcase the arts or the 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.060
 conditioning is noticeable from 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:26.060
 three quarters of a liter or in 2005 for the 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:28.490
 restoration for the fruit scent of 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.560
 wood the red fruit preparation is 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.070
 added to the ice cream and mix 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.070
 manually 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.440
 then the ice creams are stored in 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.920
 freezing chamber where they go 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.870
 harden the ice at the inrs proposes 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.730
 an impressive lineup of starters 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.440
 varieties not less than thirty five 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.750
 fragrances are currently available 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.510
 we always have the classic armani 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.190
 caramel chocolate but also 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.380
 people are trying to get out a little 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.870
 little of the beaten track and so we have 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.900
 violet ice cream with a petal of 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.960
 pink we have the girl honey nuts 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.120
 we put the pyrenees 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.669
 caramel with fleur de sel from gruissan 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.800
 also here it is as well as 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.930
 I said earlier to work 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.310
 with local producers and 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.699
 work with the products of our 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.699
 department 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.759
 no talking to that 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.759
 it's good 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.240
 m 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:44.479
 it feels good or fruit is there 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.160
 every day the ice singularity 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.710
 of the anthem is indisputable it is 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.030
 no wonder they seduce as much 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.590
 if you leave the ice cream is not tasted 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.240
 and still we are in markets and 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.860
 fairs of the region their 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.740
 marketing ceases to 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.870
 diversify and multiply store of 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.389
 local products delicatessen 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:05.060
 supermarkets and of course the 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.979
 gourmet restaurants and if 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:09.130
 adventure or line was just 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.130
 to start 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.910
