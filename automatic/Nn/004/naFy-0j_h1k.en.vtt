00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.920
 hello good afternoon welcome to 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.580
 videoblog of the actor we are going to represent 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.570
 what happens when someone mistakenly 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.460
 throw a cup of coffee on a laptop 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.180
 as you can see 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.860
 the liquid spills all over 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.010
 top of the keyboard and the automatic 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.060
 our inertia says you have to clean it and 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.480
 grab a cloth and try to clean 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.480
 keyboard 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.160
 and then logically if the keyboard because 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.100
 was cleaned in a certain way or part of the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.550
 team that we add the coffee and was 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.630
 totally clean as you can see 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.280
 but in reality the damage is internal 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.410
 here the first thing you should do is never 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.850
 turn on the equipment and bring it with 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.590
 us to perform a service of 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.480
 professional cleaning called lapse 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.950
 clean plus 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.600
 and that's going to help the team last 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.290
 working 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.700
 again a little more time 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.700
 let's remove the keyboard 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.750
 as you can see the keyboard is 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.270
 dripping into the coffee these 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.740
 occur from within the team through 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.510
 bottom part is totally spilled 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.760
 here in the part where the button is 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.160
 ignition is also spilled and almost 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.479
 always believe that with the pure 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.530
 spill of liquid that was made in the 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.750
 top and clean it of the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.790
 solution really is not the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.380
 liquids go under the keyboard and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.290
 they damage with electronic plugs so 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.150
 We recommend not turning it on 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.150
 additional to it is very important 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.740
 do not give it back to the team 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.619
 to avoid 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.360
 that the liquid runs off stays 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.310
 sitting as it is in this here now 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.349
 very important to remove the battery from 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.660
 immediate way to disconnect it from the 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.900
 light we are going to disarm the team by the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.360
 part of below to see how 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.890
 possibly I'm staying 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.480
 a second also here our 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.980
 I will disarm the team 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.640
 this keyboard has already been 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.640
 useless 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.150
 in fact as the most common mistake that 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.300
 commits all the people is to 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.910
 to happen that they want 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.980
 turn on the computer to see if they work 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.650
 or turn on or as you can see here 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.940
 Well, the equipment is totally wet 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.740
 on the bottom and done is 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.620
 wet also in the part of the base 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.610
 as you can see the spill of 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.790
 liquid is quite is quite severe and 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.770
 this is due to a coffee that is 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.780
 threw on as you can see it's wet 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.960
 in many parts the system of 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.960
 ventilation 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:24.159
 units and rom the part of the speakers and 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.239
 so all the team companies by 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.189
 that is very important when they are 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.780
 spill a liquid in automatic coronal 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.030
 upton we are going to perform a service that 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.579
 it's called the upstream plus and that 's going to 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.650
 help prevent the equipment from getting damaged 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.390
 seven of deterioration I do not know here not the 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.819
 we play and we wet a laptop does not 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.680
 worry the act did not work the 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.250
 mother card but everything else if 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.819
 It worked and remember if you got wet 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.060
 remove the battery 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.620
 turn it around and run upton to 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.510
 perform a service called lapse 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.189
 that even and remember the apps kings 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.189
 plus only in laptops
