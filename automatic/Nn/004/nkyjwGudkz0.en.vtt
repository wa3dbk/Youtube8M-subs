00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:27.099
 beauty talks or has more here 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:30.759
 a video and movie page 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.089
 I do not know what game I'm going to play and in the title 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:39.250
 I also do not need to talk 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:42.519
 so I'm going to talk about the series here in 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.290
 which is that it was main series of the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:50.769
 channel and the staff was into it quite 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.330
 apparently metal but it is the following is 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.360
 huh 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.330
 to realize what I can not test there 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.420
 a while ago nÃ© 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:07.630
 I'm not going to do the tests we have. 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.859
 personal and still asking to do test 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:16.750
 of such a game but I will not continue to 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:21.880
 but because it's good because I think I 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.999
 I already did a fucking game test and it gives 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.929
 fine as well for you and then compare 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:33.399
 I do not know if it will reduce if the game goes or not 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:38.319
 turn type you go there in the video the need 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:42.490
 for example to reveal well to perceive 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:47.649
 so then how I perceive it is better or 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.570
 worse in case to rotate or will not rotate 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.080
 depending on 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:02:01.810
 the race how will i know if my pc 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:05.229
 it's better to be you can in a video and tv 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:10.300
 net you go in a thread of game that is 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.430
 we tested the pc of the bo car ran and how 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:18.040
 It is born that runs your run better than 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.150
 face guy there in the video the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.630
 bc 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.010
 so I realized worse, huh? 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.290
 You can also search for 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:39.930
 too lazy to search the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:43.750
 the guy goes there and asks if it's 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.500
 k there are questions in wheel with some game 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.430
 his plate there I do there in the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.480
 youtube 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.860
 do what you should be doing 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:03.570
 youtube with the name of the plate there and here 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:06.430
 A video of her, I can see that she can handle it. 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:14.700
 that's what I tell others 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:14.700
 You guys think I know all the research and 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:26.590
 also in one I also have no other 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:37.110
 which makes testing time right class 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:40.959
 now zeca and gt 9800 only search the 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.590
 What do you think about boe? It might take a while. 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.590
 more agile 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:52.959
 I think it's the end of the series of games in 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:58.780
 that will be done is until today is so but neither 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:01.190
 I'll go over he will not turn and ask 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.040
 excuses to those who 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.850
 has signed up and in the channel because of 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.860
 series of games intercepted but I do not 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.730
 I'm going to continue 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:17.269
 and I was not even in the 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.680
 my pc even though I already knew not 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.330
 It was going to be good. 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:26.170
 any game and I've lost hope in a 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:31.760
 good time 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:34.660
 well, that's it, that's what it said and even the 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.660
 near 21 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.789
 ae
