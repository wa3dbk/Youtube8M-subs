00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.629 
some armor and this was kind of a mess
up<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.599> mine<00:00:09.929> just<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.889> get<00:00:11.070> into<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.360> I

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
up of mine just to get into it and I

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.980 
up of mine just to get into it and I
didn't<00:00:14.639> realize<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.179> till<00:00:15.360> after<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.750> bought

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
didn't realize this till after I bought

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.349 
didn't realize this till after I bought
it<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.289> kind<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.590> bought<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:18.150> on<00:00:18.330> a

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
it I kind of bought it on a just on a

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
it I kind of bought it on a just on a
little<00:00:18.539> fly-by-night<00:00:19.500> thing<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:21.650> and<00:00:22.650> that

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
little fly-by-night thing and and that

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.710 
little fly-by-night thing and and that
is<00:00:23.990> it's<00:00:24.990> 130<00:00:25.439> seconds<00:00:26.420> which<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.449> more

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
is it's 130 seconds which is more

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.849 
is it's 130 seconds which is more
consistent<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.260> an<00:00:28.500> aircraft<00:00:28.680> scale<00:00:29.340> but

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
consistent with an aircraft scale but

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.280 
consistent with an aircraft scale but
not<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> big<00:00:32.160> deal<00:00:32.510> so<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.750> little<00:00:34.020> bigger

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
not a big deal so it's a little bigger

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.340 
not a big deal so it's a little bigger
than<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.620> rest<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.130> them<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> done

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
than the rest of them but this is done

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.580 
than the rest of them but this is done
by<00:00:37.530> Revell<00:00:37.920> US<00:00:38.520> v<00:00:39.090> m3<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.780> it's<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> medium<00:00:43.290> tank

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
by Revell US v m3 and it's a medium tank

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.950 
by Revell US v m3 and it's a medium tank
and<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:46.730> particular<00:00:47.730> build<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.539> not<00:00:48.719> too

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and this particular build was is not too

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.910 
and this particular build was is not too
difficult<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:50.070> anybody<00:00:51.620> there's<00:00:52.620> very<00:00:52.829> few

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
difficult for anybody there's very few

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.639 
difficult for anybody there's very few
pieces<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:54.829> not<00:00:55.829> very<00:00:56.190> hard<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.760> get<00:00:57.090> over

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
pieces it's not very hard to get over

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.540 
pieces it's not very hard to get over
the<00:00:58.649> hill<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.309> and<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the hill with it and you can but the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.009 
the hill with it and you can but the
nice<00:01:02.699> thing<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.750> mould

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
nice thing is is that the the mould

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.539 
nice thing is is that the the mould
itself<00:01:04.229> has<00:01:04.619> some<00:01:04.799> really<00:01:05.070> really<00:01:05.280> good

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
itself has some really really good

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.910 
itself has some really really good
textures<00:01:06.150> there's<00:01:06.479> very<00:01:07.350> very<00:01:07.650> good

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
textures there's very very good

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.120 
textures there's very very good
definition<00:01:08.479> and<00:01:09.479> lots<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.350> little<00:01:10.560> parts<00:01:10.920> as

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
definition and lots of little parts as

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.429 
definition and lots of little parts as
you<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.460> kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.729> swap<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.510> swap<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:13.140> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you can kind of swap in and swap all it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.910 
you can kind of swap in and swap all it
you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.010> mix<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.400> match<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.689> it's

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
you can mix and match and because it's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.749 
you can mix and match and because it's
1/32<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:19.170> don't<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.430> worry

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
1/32 you don't have to really worry

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.999 
1/32 you don't have to really worry
about<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> swap<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.990> guns<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.830> stuff

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
about when you swap in guns and stuff

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.690 
about when you swap in guns and stuff
that<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.340> from<00:01:23.490> 135th<00:01:24.270> scale<00:01:25.280> one<00:01:26.280> thing<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
that are from 135th scale one thing I

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.810 
that are from 135th scale one thing I
would<00:01:26.939> suggest<00:01:27.710> just<00:01:28.710> out<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> out<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
would suggest just out of the out of the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.420 
would suggest just out of the out of the
box<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> big<00:01:31.470> challenge<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
box and it was a big challenge at that

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.100 
box and it was a big challenge at that
time<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.320> that<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.979> turret<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.450> mg

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
time is that the turret up here the mg

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.679 
time is that the turret up here the mg
the<00:01:38.070> turret<00:01:38.430> gun<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.939> well<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the turret gun as well as the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.300 
the turret gun as well as the
commander's<00:01:40.170> cupola<00:01:40.439> gone<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:42.470> were<00:01:43.470> very

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
commander's cupola gone here were very

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.620 
commander's cupola gone here were very
very<00:01:44.610> poorly<00:01:44.970> molded<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:47.270> consequently<00:01:48.270> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
very poorly molded and consequently I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.139 
very poorly molded and consequently I
tapped<00:01:49.140> them<00:01:49.409> out<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.829> put<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.880> an

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
tapped them out and put in an

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.219 
tapped them out and put in an
aftermarket<00:01:52.110> 30<00:01:52.649> Cal<00:01:52.950> kits<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.540> 135th

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
aftermarket 30 Cal kits for it and 135th

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.249 
aftermarket 30 Cal kits for it and 135th
scale<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.799> they're<00:01:56.640> perforated<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.840> they

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
scale and they're perforated and they

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.830 
scale and they're perforated and they
look<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:58.649> better<00:01:58.890> than<00:01:59.189> just<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.850> wedge<00:02:00.329> thing

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
look much better than just a wedge thing

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.969 
look much better than just a wedge thing
that<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.229> comes<00:02:01.409> out<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.770> mold<00:02:03.979> all

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that just comes out of the mold all

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.139 
that just comes out of the mold all
there's<00:02:05.280> things<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.579> are<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:05.909> nice

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
there's things that are really nice

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.979 
there's things that are really nice
about<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.810> get<00:02:07.049> these<00:02:07.200> canvas<00:02:07.890> tarps

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
about it is you get these canvas tarps

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.730 
about it is you get these canvas tarps
you<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.140> switch<00:02:10.379> them<00:02:10.530> all<00:02:10.679> for<00:02:10.890> canvas

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
you can switch them all for canvas

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.890 
you can switch them all for canvas
that's<00:02:12.340> what<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.610> did<00:02:13.000> even<00:02:13.300> know<00:02:13.570> that<00:02:13.600> the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
that's what I did even know that the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.830 
that's what I did even know that the
mold<00:02:14.140> pieces<00:02:14.650> they<00:02:14.830> gave<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:18.450> are<00:02:19.450> pretty

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
mold pieces they gave you are pretty

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.990 
mold pieces they gave you are pretty
good<00:02:20.020> there<00:02:20.680> they<00:02:21.100> look<00:02:21.280> pretty<00:02:21.550> well<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:21.910> you

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
good there they look pretty well and you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.980 
good there they look pretty well and you
could<00:02:22.120> weather<00:02:22.360> them<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.870> they'll

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
could weather them so that they'll

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.590 
could weather them so that they'll
actually<00:02:23.290> look<00:02:23.560> like<00:02:23.590> canvas<00:02:24.300> really<00:02:25.300> good
