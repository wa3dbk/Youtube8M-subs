00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.309

realized<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.800> it's<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.220> wake-up<00:01:57.429> call<00:01:57.759> and

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
realized that it's a wake-up call and

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.660 
realized that it's a wake-up call and
you<00:01:59.319> know<00:01:59.409> we<00:01:59.530> went<00:01:59.710> out<00:01:59.830> in<00:02:00.039> that<00:02:00.190> dinner<00:02:00.399> and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
you know we went out in that dinner and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.850
