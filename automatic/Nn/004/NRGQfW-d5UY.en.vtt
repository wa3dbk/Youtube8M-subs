00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.410
 good morning from the kitchen and evolutionary today 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.100
 we prepare a raw food recipe la 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.890
 rustic pass at 42 degrees where they will be 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.530
 the protagonists are the tomato sauce not 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.170
 cooked and split but just raw 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.079
 heated to 42 degrees maximum temperature 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.720
 allowed to keep food wine 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.430
 active and really nourishing 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.360
 we immediately see the equipment there 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.690
 you need a mixer or blender a colander 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.480
 or a sieve to filter out any 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.770
 excess liquid a bain-marie set 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.620
 or a common pot with a container 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.680
 adequate is a lid and finally a 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.210
 food thermometer for 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.950
 precisely control the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.110
 temperature that should not be exceeded 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.850
 precisely the 42 degrees 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.359
 as for the ingredients there 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.969
 it takes 8 tomato sauce from 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:13.219
 quality you prefer rounds like i 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.259
 ours that are red or bunch of 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:18.770
 elongated shape such as the 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.700
 super roma sammarzano 80 g of tomatoes 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.859
 dried our qualities are 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.649
 dried sammarzano must be rehydrated 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:30.109
 so this is a soak to remove 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.579
 the impurities and then shufu them we 'll be fine 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.060
 however also under running water 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:38.529
 a few fresh basil leaves a 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.959
 good spoon of dried onion 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:45.679
 rehydrated absolutely optional a 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:47.329
 pinch of chili powder salt 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.450
 integral marine or pink of the Himalayas 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.770
 as much as necessary extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.659
 cold pressed 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.029
 let's go to the preparation we talk about 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:01.549
 mirrors the tomatoes do not deprive us of 

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:05.299
 seeds and mucilage, and even less so 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.390
 pellicina because we prepare a sauce a 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.270
 rustic now let's put these nice tomatoes 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.069
 in the blender container e 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.319
 we add 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.829
 then all the other ingredients 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.099
 then the dried tomatoes e 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:25.120
 rinse well under running water 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:27.129
 here is done is that we immediately buffer as 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.069
 we are doing with kitchen paper 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.129
 we think of tomatoes and off we put them 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.480
 inside some basil leaves the 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:39.969
 salt if you use chili if you want 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.189
 and if you believe a first round of oil 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:44.260
 we put all the ingredients like 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.040
 you have certainly seen the onion that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.760
 we prefer to put whole only at the end 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.760
 let's whisk away 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.319
 this is the same one we got 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:02.980
 we filter it by putting a sieve or the 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.319
 strainer on a container in this way 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.949
 will be much more substantial and less 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.870
 liquid just like a cooked pass 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:14.799
 if you want to enjoy a bit of warmth 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.199
 heat the pass in a bain-marie 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.870
 if you don't use the professional 7 but 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:21.280
 7 as good as ours is for you 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.799
 proceed in this way 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.500
 put four fingers of water in the 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.139
 pot the container containing the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.540
 sauce and the lid I would like arrived on 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.939
 time to add the onion if 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.569
 you want you can blend it together with 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:40.449
 salsa or as you can put it 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.479
 then in such a way that one sees whole in 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:45.790
 sauce the flame set was very 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:48.729
 low especially if you don't have the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.889
 thermometer and watch this 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:54.040
 controlled point and temperature for 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:56.560
 be sure that it does not exceed 42 degrees 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.169
 as we are doing with a 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.449
 very simple kitchen thermometer from 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:05.379
 use a probe that fits 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:08.530
 inside the preparation the temperature 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.750
 as you can see is progressively going up 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.389
 here is the temperature reached 42 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.489
 degrees then we turn off the heat e 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:18.310
 we can pass to the presentation a 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.120
 fluffy second round of oil and some 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.300
 base leaf 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.600
 here is fresh to garnish the past well 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.729
 a sauce is ready at 42 degrees raw 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.190
 that you can use in them 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.160
 identical but that of the kitchen 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.770
 cooked if you use it to dress pasta 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.900
 you can warm up with the pass 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.449
 to the raw pasta they are spaghetti 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.240
 fettuccine linguine fusilli penne 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:47.280
 etc. good food I had lutino a 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.280
 all and the next video recipe
