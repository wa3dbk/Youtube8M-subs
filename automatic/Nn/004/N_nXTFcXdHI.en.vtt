00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:05.859 
hi there alec from vacuumspot here

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.220 
hi there alec from vacuumspot here
having<00:00:06.850> a<00:00:06.939> really<00:00:07.450> super<00:00:07.690> quick<00:00:07.870> look<00:00:08.020> at<00:00:08.170> a

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.230 
having a really super quick look at a

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.580 
having a really super quick look at a
VAX<00:00:08.620> n<00:00:08.889> power<00:00:09.400> head<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:10.809> machine<00:00:11.230> has<00:00:11.410> come

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
VAX n power head this machine has come

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.070 
VAX n power head this machine has come
in<00:00:11.740> for<00:00:11.950> two<00:00:12.070> problems<00:00:12.490> the<00:00:13.030> main<00:00:13.719> one<00:00:13.929> though

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
in for two problems the main one though

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.350 
in for two problems the main one though
the<00:00:14.349> way<00:00:14.469> they<00:00:14.530> look<00:00:14.740> at<00:00:14.830> now<00:00:14.980> is<00:00:15.280> lack<00:00:16.209> of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
the way they look at now is lack of

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.380 
the way they look at now is lack of
suction<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:18.340> machine<00:00:18.730> I'll<00:00:18.880> turn<00:00:19.180> it<00:00:19.270> on

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
suction this machine I'll turn it on

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.330 
suction this machine I'll turn it on
actually<00:00:19.989> not<00:00:20.320> I<00:00:20.470> don't<00:00:20.680> need<00:00:20.890> to<00:00:21.040> I'm<00:00:21.279> telling

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
actually not I don't need to I'm telling

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.420 
actually not I don't need to I'm telling
you<00:00:21.849> the<00:00:22.000> suction<00:00:22.300> is<00:00:22.390> quite<00:00:22.599> like<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:24.279> issue

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
you the suction is quite like the issue

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.569 
you the suction is quite like the issue
heating<00:00:25.500> do<00:00:26.500> it<00:00:26.619> on<00:00:26.680> my<00:00:26.829> camera<00:00:27.130> is<00:00:27.279> give<00:00:27.460> me<00:00:27.550> a

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
heating do it on my camera is give me a

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.230 
heating do it on my camera is give me a
funny<00:00:27.790> move

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.440 

did<00:00:34.240> you<00:00:34.330> feel<00:00:34.510> that<00:00:34.690> that<00:00:35.020> was<00:00:35.110> weak<00:00:36.030> okay<00:00:37.030> so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
did you feel that that was weak okay so

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.020 
did you feel that that was weak okay so
the<00:00:38.170> problem<00:00:38.320> is<00:00:38.680> these<00:00:39.250> don't<00:00:39.550> really<00:00:39.670> have

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
the problem is these don't really have

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.400 
the problem is these don't really have
an<00:00:40.150> obvious<00:00:40.330> filter<00:00:40.900> so<00:00:41.110> if<00:00:41.170> you're<00:00:41.290> not

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
an obvious filter so if you're not

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.780 
an obvious filter so if you're not
looking<00:00:41.500> for<00:00:41.710> it<00:00:41.920> you<00:00:41.950> don't<00:00:42.100> trip<00:00:42.340> across<00:00:42.550> it

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
looking for it you don't trip across it

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.540 
looking for it you don't trip across it
okay<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.960> main<00:00:44.320> filter<00:00:44.800> that's<00:00:45.280> going<00:00:45.490> to

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
okay the main filter that's going to

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.670 
okay the main filter that's going to
cause<00:00:45.730> your<00:00:45.910> problems<00:00:46.270> you<00:00:46.990> give<00:00:47.170> you<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.290> lid<00:00:47.500> a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
cause your problems you give you a lid a

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.360 
cause your problems you give you a lid a
twist<00:00:47.950> and<00:00:48.580> then<00:00:49.420> that<00:00:50.020> Wiggles<00:00:50.380> off<00:00:50.559> and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
twist and then that Wiggles off and

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.710 
twist and then that Wiggles off and
what's<00:00:51.580> going<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:51.820> happen<00:00:52.120> is<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.330> look<00:00:52.510> at<00:00:52.630> it

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
what's going to happen is you look at it

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.840 
what's going to happen is you look at it
and<00:00:52.809> you<00:00:52.870> go<00:00:52.900> off<00:00:53.200> that's<00:00:53.530> not<00:00:53.620> that<00:00:54.220> dirty<00:00:54.520> and

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
and you go off that's not that dirty and

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.410 
and you go off that's not that dirty and
so<00:00:55.360> you<00:00:55.420> sort<00:00:55.750> of<00:00:55.840> leave<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.550> however<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:58.270> airs

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
so you sort of leave it however the airs

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.229 
so you sort of leave it however the airs
coming<00:00:58.630> through<00:00:59.080> from<00:00:59.290> this<00:00:59.620> way<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.220> so<00:01:01.090> the

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
coming through from this way and so the

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.420 
coming through from this way and so the
filter<00:01:01.570> here<00:01:01.900> even<00:01:02.650> though<00:01:02.739> this<00:01:02.920> doesn't

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
filter here even though this doesn't

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.760 
filter here even though this doesn't
look<00:01:03.670> too<00:01:03.879> bad<00:01:04.020> that's<00:01:05.020> not<00:01:05.320> letting<00:01:05.619> air

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
look too bad that's not letting air

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.370 
look too bad that's not letting air
through<00:01:05.950> so<00:01:06.700> what<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.750> need<00:01:07.869> to<00:01:07.930> do<00:01:08.110> is<00:01:08.200> take

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
through so what you need to do is take

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.410 
through so what you need to do is take
that<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.710> sink<00:01:09.040> rinse<00:01:09.610> it<00:01:09.850> rinse<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.270> rinse

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
that to the sink rinse it rinse it rinse

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.480 
that to the sink rinse it rinse it rinse
it<00:01:10.630> rinse<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:10.990> like<00:01:11.380> mash<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:11.890> up<00:01:11.979> like<00:01:12.250> this

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
it rinse it like mash it up like this

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.240 
it rinse it like mash it up like this
until<00:01:13.060> it<00:01:13.210> really<00:01:13.509> runs<00:01:13.869> clean<00:01:14.290> and<00:01:14.530> then

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
until it really runs clean and then

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.359 
until it really runs clean and then
leave<00:01:15.430> it<00:01:15.610> somewhere<00:01:16.290> completely<00:01:17.290> warm<00:01:18.040> to

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
leave it somewhere completely warm to

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.700 
leave it somewhere completely warm to
dry<00:01:18.700> don't<00:01:19.420> sit<00:01:19.660> on<00:01:19.780> my<00:01:19.960> heater<00:01:20.170> because<00:01:20.410> you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
dry don't sit on my heater because you

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.420 
dry don't sit on my heater because you
may<00:01:20.860> melt<00:01:21.100> this<00:01:21.369> rubbery<00:01:22.030> outside<00:01:23.310> leave<00:01:24.310> it

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
may melt this rubbery outside leave it

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.700 
may melt this rubbery outside leave it
outside<00:01:24.580> let<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.210> dry<00:01:25.420> completely<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:26.530> it's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
outside let it dry completely if it's

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.980 
outside let it dry completely if it's
even<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:26.950> slight<00:01:27.369> bit<00:01:27.640> wet<00:01:27.910> it's<00:01:28.570> going<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.840> burn

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
even a slight bit wet it's going to burn

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.090 
even a slight bit wet it's going to burn
your<00:01:29.170> vacuum<00:01:29.470> out<00:01:29.590> because<00:01:29.800> it's<00:01:29.950> going<00:01:29.979> to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
your vacuum out because it's going to

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.120 
your vacuum out because it's going to
suck<00:01:30.310> moisture<00:01:30.790> into<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.060> motor<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.920> is

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
suck moisture into the motor this is

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.639 
suck moisture into the motor this is
actually<00:01:33.520> about<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.729> year<00:01:33.850> old<00:01:34.149> I'm<00:01:34.780> not<00:01:35.350> going

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
actually about a year old I'm not going

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.800 
actually about a year old I'm not going
to<00:01:35.710> wash<00:01:35.830> it<00:01:35.979> now<00:01:36.009> but<00:01:36.790> I<00:01:37.000> would<00:01:37.119> be<00:01:37.360> actually

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
to wash it now but I would be actually

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.169 
to wash it now but I would be actually
swapping<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:38.319> one<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.710> would<00:01:39.220> replace<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.670> but

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
swapping this one I would replace it but

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.350 
swapping this one I would replace it but
up<00:01:40.569> to<00:01:40.780> it<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:42.340> put<00:01:42.580> them<00:01:42.700> back<00:01:42.819> in<00:01:43.000> when<00:01:43.179> it's

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
up to it so I put them back in when it's

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.300 
up to it so I put them back in when it's
clean<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:43.960> dry<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:47.619> like<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:50.250> close<00:01:51.250> that

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
clean and dry in like that close that

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.080 
clean and dry in like that close that
off<00:01:51.670> now<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.390> other<00:01:52.600> filter<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:54.640> is<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.940> one

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
off now the other filter this is the one

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.520 
off now the other filter this is the one
that's<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.390> one<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:55.630> stops<00:01:55.840> crap<00:01:56.229> getting

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
that's the one that stops crap getting

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.169 
that's the one that stops crap getting
into<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.830> motor<00:01:57.009> this<00:01:57.700> is<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:57.970> one<00:01:58.090> that

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
into the motor this is the one that

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.719 
into the motor this is the one that
stops<00:01:58.420> carbon<00:01:58.810> getting<00:01:59.050> out<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.350> moment

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
stops carbon getting out of the moment
