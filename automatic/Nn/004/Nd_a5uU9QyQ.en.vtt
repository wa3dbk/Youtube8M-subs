00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
as you can see the base now has three

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.719 
as you can see the base now has three
white<00:01:12.170> pieces<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.979> now<00:01:13.130> what<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.370> wanna<00:01:13.490> do

white pieces and now what you wanna do
is<00:01:14.030> keep<00:01:14.720> adding<00:01:15.200> pieces<00:01:15.440> on<00:01:16.070> until<00:01:16.550> you<00:01:16.670> have

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
is keep adding pieces on until you have

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:35.110 
is keep adding pieces on until you have
twenty<00:01:17.210> five<00:01:17.360> white<00:01:17.630> pieces<00:01:17.869> for<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.290> base

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:45.150 

you

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
okay so I now have 25 white pieces as

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.140 
okay so I now have 25 white pieces as
the<00:01:48.410> base<00:01:48.620> and<00:01:49.250> what<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:49.520> want<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.700> do<00:01:49.850> now<00:01:50.120> is

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
the base and what you want to do now is

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.050 
the base and what you want to do now is
take<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.960> two<00:01:51.200> NY<00:01:51.650> pieces<00:01:52.100> put<00:01:52.760> them<00:01:52.910> together

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
take the two NY pieces put them together

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:07.279 
take the two NY pieces put them together
and<00:01:53.480> then<00:01:53.630> slide<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.140> green<00:01:54.560> line<00:01:54.740> on<00:01:54.830> top

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.660 

now<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.590> ever<00:02:08.740> base<00:02:09.009> what<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.429> want<00:02:09.580> to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
now that you ever base what you want to

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.490 
now that you ever base what you want to
do<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:09.940> take<00:02:10.179> red<00:02:10.479> pieces<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.080> put<00:02:11.230> them<00:02:11.350> in

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
do is take red pieces and put them in

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.410 
do is take red pieces and put them in
between<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.920> green<00:02:12.100> pieces<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.150> have<00:02:13.270> two

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
between the green pieces so you have two

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.059 
between the green pieces so you have two
layers<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.840> green<00:02:14.020> pieces<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.650> then<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:14.860> want

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
layers of green pieces and then you want

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.030 
layers of green pieces and then you want
two<00:02:15.310> layers<00:02:15.520> of<00:02:15.610> red<00:02:15.850> pieces<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:20.230> far<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.530> added

like<00:02:49.000> stick<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.810> each<00:02:49.930> other<00:02:50.050> but<00:02:50.440> don't<00:02:50.980> put

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
like stick to each other but don't put

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.130 
like stick to each other but don't put
them<00:02:51.220> down<00:02:51.250> gently<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.120> they<00:02:52.450> have<00:02:52.720> enough

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
them down gently so they have enough

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:05.270 
them down gently so they have enough
room<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.709> curl<00:02:54.220> up<00:02:54.370> into<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.730> brown<00:02:55.390> circle

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.080 

I<00:03:06.470> have<00:03:07.470> one<00:03:07.740> layer<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.100> white<00:03:08.340> pieces<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:08.910> now

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
I have one layer of white pieces on now

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.880 
I have one layer of white pieces on now
so<00:03:09.360> what<00:03:09.540> I'm<00:03:09.660> gonna<00:03:09.840> do<00:03:10.080> is<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.290> add<00:03:10.620> two

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
so what I'm gonna do is just add two

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.830 
so what I'm gonna do is just add two
Camero<00:03:13.819> now<00:03:14.819> that<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.150> had<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.360> two<00:03:15.600> white

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
Camero now that you had the two white

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.170 
Camero now that you had the two white
layers<00:03:16.080> on<00:03:16.380> what<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.680> want<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:17.069> is<00:03:17.400> put<00:03:17.880> two

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
layers on what you want to do is put two

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.420 
layers on what you want to do is put two
more<00:03:18.360> red<00:03:18.630> layers<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:21.590> okay<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.650> after<00:03:23.069> you

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
more red layers on okay so after you

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.949 
more red layers on okay so after you
finish<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.880> two<00:03:24.090> red<00:03:24.300> layers<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.720> want<00:03:24.870> to

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
finish the two red layers you want to

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.290 
finish the two red layers you want to
add<00:03:25.050> another<00:03:25.290> two<00:03:25.830> white<00:03:26.040> layers<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:27.000> then

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
add another two white layers on and then

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.500 
add another two white layers on and then
as<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.630> can<00:03:27.720> see<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.830> shape<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.670> very<00:03:30.209> round

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
as you can see the shape is very round

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.199 
as you can see the shape is very round
like<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.840> circle<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.680> then<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.819> want<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.060> make

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
like a circle and then you want to make

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.840 
like a circle and then you want to make
sure<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.900> top<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.220> tilted<00:03:35.220> inward<00:03:35.400> so

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
sure that the top is tilted inward so

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.620 
sure that the top is tilted inward so
the<00:03:36.090> next<00:03:36.330> few<00:03:36.569> pieces<00:03:36.810> will<00:03:37.170> fit<00:03:37.350> on<00:03:37.560> right

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.210 

after<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:43.019> put<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.440> white<00:03:43.560> pieces<00:03:43.860> this

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
after you put on the white pieces this

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.370 
after you put on the white pieces this
is<00:03:44.400> how<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.640> shape<00:03:45.000> should<00:03:45.300> look<00:03:45.480> like<00:03:45.510> then

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
is how the shape should look like then

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.800 
is how the shape should look like then
now<00:03:46.590> we're<00:03:46.830> gonna<00:03:46.920> do<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.459> make<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.940> head<00:03:48.209> so

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
now we're gonna do is make the head so

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.970 
now we're gonna do is make the head so
the<00:03:48.959> first<00:03:49.170> thing<00:03:49.290> we<00:03:49.350> want<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.500> do<00:03:49.650> is<00:03:49.800> make

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
the first thing we want to do is make

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.160 
the first thing we want to do is make
the<00:03:50.100> base<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:51.300> would<00:03:51.450> take<00:03:51.660> some<00:03:52.019> green

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
the base so it would take some green

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.750 
the base so it would take some green
pieces<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:52.800> you<00:03:52.860> want<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.069> put<00:03:53.250> them<00:03:53.430> on<00:03:53.640> the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
pieces and you want to put them on the

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.430 
pieces and you want to put them on the
opposite<00:03:54.239> direction<00:03:54.569> of<00:03:54.870> what<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.290> white

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
opposite direction of what the white

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.199 
opposite direction of what the white
pieces<00:03:55.800> are<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.489> make<00:03:56.640> them<00:03:56.790> face<00:03:57.000> on<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
pieces are and make them face on a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:18.499 
pieces are and make them face on a
ninety<00:03:57.540> degree<00:03:57.660> angle

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.420 

wait<00:04:19.509> so<00:04:19.720> this<00:04:19.959> is<00:04:20.259> probably<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.949> hardest

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
wait so this is probably the hardest

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.070 
wait so this is probably the hardest
part<00:04:21.459> of<00:04:21.669> this<00:04:21.759> tutorial<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.479> this<00:04:22.720> is<00:04:22.900> making

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
part of this tutorial and this is making

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.290 
part of this tutorial and this is making
the<00:04:23.350> head<00:04:23.500> bigger<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.160> we're<00:04:24.850> gonna<00:04:24.970> go<00:04:25.150> from

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
the head bigger and we're gonna go from

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.140 
the head bigger and we're gonna go from
25<00:04:25.840> pieces<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.350> 30<00:04:26.590> pieces<00:04:26.860> so<00:04:27.729> what<00:04:27.940> you<00:04:28.000> want

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
25 pieces to 30 pieces so what you want

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.230 
25 pieces to 30 pieces so what you want
to<00:04:28.240> do<00:04:28.360> is<00:04:28.600> take<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.380> piece<00:04:29.889> and<00:04:30.160> only<00:04:30.669> put<00:04:30.940> one

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
to do is take a piece and only put one

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.390 
to do is take a piece and only put one
site<00:04:31.780> in<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.229> leave<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.470> other<00:04:32.620> side<00:04:32.889> out<00:04:33.130> and

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
site in and leave the other side out and

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.810 
site in and leave the other side out and
then<00:04:34.530> after<00:04:35.530> every<00:04:35.889> six<00:04:36.160> pieces<00:04:36.430> what<00:04:36.759> you

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
then after every six pieces what you

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.300 
then after every six pieces what you
want<00:04:37.060> to<00:04:37.150> do<00:04:37.270> is<00:04:37.479> have<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.870> two<00:04:38.110> ends<00:04:38.650> have

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
want to do is have the two ends have

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.400 
want to do is have the two ends have
only<00:04:39.550> half<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.030> sides<00:04:40.300> in<00:04:40.509> and<00:04:40.750> then<00:04:40.930> after

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
only half the sides in and then after

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.499 
only half the sides in and then after
every<00:04:42.250> six<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.699> want<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:42.910> keep<00:04:43.090> doing<00:04:43.389> that

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
every six you want to keep doing that

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.050 
every six you want to keep doing that
and<00:04:43.810> then<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.410> will<00:04:44.560> find<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.400> will<00:04:45.849> end

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
and then you will find that you will end

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.230 
and then you will find that you will end
up<00:04:46.180> with<00:04:46.330> 30<00:04:46.570> pieces<00:04:47.550> okay<00:04:48.550> so<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:49.060> make<00:04:49.210> it

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
up with 30 pieces okay so to make it

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.999 
up with 30 pieces okay so to make it
easier<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.780> understand<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.560> first<00:04:50.770> piece

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
easier to understand the first piece

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.439 
easier to understand the first piece
you're<00:04:51.190> going<00:04:51.400> we<00:04:51.550> you're<00:04:51.880> only<00:04:52.030> going<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.300> put

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
you're going we you're only going to put

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.460 
you're going we you're only going to put
one<00:04:52.750> side<00:04:53.370> into<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.849> bottom<00:04:55.630> piece<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.199> leave

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
one side into the bottom piece and leave

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.469 
one side into the bottom piece and leave
the<00:04:56.620> other<00:04:56.770> side<00:04:57.070> out<00:04:57.310> and<00:04:57.940> then<00:04:58.060> this<00:04:58.240> will

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
the other side out and then this will

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.960 
the other side out and then this will
just<00:04:58.509> make<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:58.960> bigger<00:04:59.349> on<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.830> outside<00:05:00.280> so

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
just make it bigger on the outside so

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.860 
just make it bigger on the outside so
then<00:05:01.349> for<00:05:02.349> six<00:05:02.680> pieces<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:04.060> first<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:04.690> the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
then for six pieces the first and the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.480 
then for six pieces the first and the
last<00:05:05.130> will<00:05:06.130> only<00:05:06.340> have<00:05:06.610> one<00:05:06.880> side<00:05:07.180> in

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
last will only have one side in

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.840 
last will only have one side in
rest<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.569> pieces<00:05:09.990> will<00:05:10.289> have<00:05:10.680> will<00:05:11.460> be<00:05:11.490> put<00:05:11.759> in

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
rest the pieces will have will be put in

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.939 
rest the pieces will have will be put in
regularly<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.630> then<00:05:13.319> we<00:05:13.470> want<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:13.680> do<00:05:13.800> is

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
regularly and then we want to do is

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.820 
regularly and then we want to do is
count<00:05:14.160> one<00:05:14.490> two<00:05:14.699> three<00:05:14.819> four<00:05:15.419> five<00:05:15.720> six<00:05:16.050> and<00:05:16.440> on

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
count one two three four five six and on

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.040 
count one two three four five six and on
the<00:05:16.889> numbers<00:05:17.280> one<00:05:17.490> incision<00:05:17.849> about<00:05:18.569> half<00:05:18.810> in

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
the numbers one incision about half in

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.839 
the numbers one incision about half in
so<00:05:19.650> that<00:05:19.770> if<00:05:19.860> you<00:05:19.919> count<00:05:20.160> one<00:05:20.340> two<00:05:20.370> three<00:05:20.669> four

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
so that if you count one two three four

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.420 
so that if you count one two three four
five<00:05:21.030> six<00:05:21.240> one<00:05:21.599> two<00:05:22.020> three<00:05:22.259> plastics<00:05:22.800> it'll<00:05:23.340> be

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
five six one two three plastics it'll be

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:59.129 
five six one two three plastics it'll be
easier<00:05:23.819> to<00:05:24.120> finish<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:25.169> pieces

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.080 

as<00:05:59.770> you<00:05:59.889> see<00:06:00.069> from<00:06:00.099> the<00:06:00.370> last<00:06:00.490> piece<00:06:00.819> there<00:06:01.060> was

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
as you see from the last piece there was

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.330 
as you see from the last piece there was
only<00:06:01.300> one<00:06:01.810> part<00:06:02.229> of<00:06:02.409> the<00:06:02.860> bottom<00:06:03.219> layer

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
only one part of the bottom layer

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.339 
only one part of the bottom layer
sticking<00:06:03.759> out<00:06:03.879> so<00:06:04.569> what<00:06:04.689> you're<00:06:04.780> gonna<00:06:04.840> do<00:06:05.110> is

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
sticking out so what you're gonna do is

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:07.529 
sticking out so what you're gonna do is
just<00:06:05.650> put<00:06:05.949> half<00:06:06.249> of<00:06:06.400> a<00:06:06.490> piece<00:06:06.699> in<00:06:06.909> so<00:06:07.240> that

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
just put half of a piece in so that

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.800 
just put half of a piece in so that
would<00:06:07.689> be<00:06:07.810> completed<00:06:08.229> in<00:06:08.409> the<00:06:08.560> circle<00:06:09.810> now

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
would be completed in the circle now

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.360 
would be completed in the circle now
that<00:06:10.990> the<00:06:11.110> hardest<00:06:11.469> part<00:06:11.710> is<00:06:11.770> over<00:06:11.919> what<00:06:12.310> you

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
that the hardest part is over what you

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.580 
that the hardest part is over what you
want<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.610> do<00:06:12.759> is<00:06:12.939> keep<00:06:13.240> adding<00:06:13.749> layers<00:06:13.960> until

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
want to do is keep adding layers until

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.040 
want to do is keep adding layers until
you<00:06:14.770> get<00:06:14.949> eight<00:06:15.189> layers<00:06:15.550> in<00:06:15.849> total<00:06:16.210> and<00:06:16.449> I<00:06:16.870> will

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
you get eight layers in total and I will

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.779 
you get eight layers in total and I will
be<00:06:17.169> back<00:06:17.409> after<00:06:17.680> I<00:06:17.979> finish<00:06:18.039> you<00:06:18.490> should<00:06:18.520> I<00:06:18.729> to

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
be back after I finish you should I to

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.540 
be back after I finish you should I to
show<00:06:19.060> you<00:06:19.090> how<00:06:19.360> it<00:06:19.449> looks<00:06:19.509> like<00:06:20.279> this<00:06:21.279> is<00:06:21.400> how

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
show you how it looks like this is how

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.920 
show you how it looks like this is how
it<00:06:21.580> looks<00:06:21.849> like<00:06:21.939> after<00:06:22.180> I<00:06:22.330> put<00:06:22.509> the<00:06:22.599> second

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
it looks like after I put the second

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.529 
it looks like after I put the second
layer<00:06:22.960> on<00:06:23.080> as<00:06:23.499> you<00:06:23.949> can<00:06:24.099> see<00:06:24.340> it's<00:06:24.580> becoming<00:06:25.330> a

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
layer on as you can see it's becoming a

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.600 
layer on as you can see it's becoming a
little<00:06:25.749> more<00:06:25.900> bigger<00:06:26.259> and<00:06:26.620> it's<00:06:27.129> gonna<00:06:27.279> around

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
little more bigger and it's gonna around

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.700 
little more bigger and it's gonna around
it's<00:06:28.090> gonna<00:06:28.270> turn<00:06:28.509> into<00:06:28.689> a<00:06:28.779> circle<00:06:29.229> soon<00:06:29.439> and

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
it's gonna turn into a circle soon and

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.379 
it's gonna turn into a circle soon and
then<00:06:30.129> I<00:06:30.159> will<00:06:30.400> be<00:06:30.520> back<00:06:30.729> after<00:06:30.939> the<00:06:31.120> third

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
then I will be back after the third

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.619 
then I will be back after the third
layer<00:06:31.569> is<00:06:31.689> done<00:06:32.699> so<00:06:33.699> this<00:06:33.909> is<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.210> third<00:06:34.449> layer

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:34.629 
layer is done so this is the third layer

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:36.869 
layer is done so this is the third layer
that's<00:06:34.900> finished<00:06:35.289> and<00:06:35.500> we<00:06:36.250> want<00:06:36.460> to<00:06:36.520> do<00:06:36.669> is

that's finished and we want to do is
just<00:06:37.060> keep<00:06:37.270> adding<00:06:37.659> layers<00:06:37.840> until<00:06:38.349> you're

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:38.529 
just keep adding layers until you're

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:41.399 
just keep adding layers until you're
satisfied<00:06:38.680> and<00:06:39.689> this<00:06:40.689> is<00:06:40.870> how<00:06:40.990> the<00:06:41.050> fourth

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409 
satisfied and this is how the fourth

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:42.990 
satisfied and this is how the fourth
layer<00:06:41.650> looks<00:06:41.919> like<00:06:42.129> after<00:06:42.430> I<00:06:42.460> finished<00:06:42.819> making
