00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.900
 hello my name is philippe jousse 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.489
 institute paul bocuse ecully 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.110
 we are preparing today a 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.600
 recipe based on crayfish with legs 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.690
 red crayfish swim with citrus 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.600
 cold with coriander to aromatize this 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.610
 dish so the important thing for this dish is 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.010
 of course the crayfish crayfish to 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.860
 red legs are really important 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.050
 for the flavor for the quality of the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.070
 pulpit is of course everything that goes 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.630
 to be small vegetables that will accompany 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.810
 that it must of course be the 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.370
 cooler possible so important it's 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.000
 to have one on a pan like 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.070
 this one I appreciate because the heat 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.140
 is quickly broadcast on all 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.659
 the pan and vegetables need a 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.960
 fast cooking to keep and a 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.439
 color and flavor now we're going 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.880
 check if the swim is good enough 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.880
 infuse citrus level 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 it has a very good taste of citrus we are going 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.790
 now added last of the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.790
 grated ginger 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.390
 then the cats rage cats 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.160
 important operation that must be done 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.380
 obligatorily we will remove the 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.480
 fin which is at the end of the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.420
 queue simply the case is stretched for 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.950
 that intestines can come 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.240
 so when we do this operation there 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.580
 you have to cook crayfish by following 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.590
 swimming to infuse with citrus the 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.959
 zest the ginger 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:19.120
 we spent it now I 'm going in 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:20.260
 preserve a part that I will keep 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.570
 intact 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.730
 the other part of an age I'm going to 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.600
 serve to cook but crayfish we go 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.080
 dive them directly into swimming in 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.080
 boiling 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:50.640
 good after two minutes of 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.640
 ammunition we will remove the crayfish 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:04.900
 well we will just lifted the tail is 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:11.400
 will recover the flesh of the tongs it is necessary 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.400
 simply broken gently 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.600
 so going away now go the 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.840
 last part of this recipe 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.430
 especially where I will be able to use 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.500
 this oklad pan why this 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.060
 jumping because with these polls I 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.770
 can have a much larger container 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.300
 reduced where I can put all the 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.460
 ingredients together where they go 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.650
 really infuse take flavors 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.550
 have exchanges before you can 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.610
 do the training 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.740
 we will simply warm up 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.610
 so that the infusion is done at the level 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.370
 aromas manente setting vegetables - rocket 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.500
 we will put them in the ice must 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.670
 cool them pretty fast and 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.740
 in this ham pan allowed 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.110
 especially to go up very quickly 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.640
 temperature redessan temperature very 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.400
 quickly but especially to have a 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.130
 small capacity for me to have 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:12.470
 all these vegetables infuse with this swim 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:15.080
 I will be able to put some 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.330
 crayfish the different vegetables the 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.910
 different colours 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:23.600
 of course this swim we go there serve with 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:27.220
 the dish we do not put without too much 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.220
 listen to your appetite
