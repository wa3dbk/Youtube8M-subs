00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.669
 hello everyone how are you welcome to 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.280
 this new video if you're new again by 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.919
 here I introduce myself my name is yasmani and 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.680
 Today in this video I'll show you what 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.840
 that I'm going to prepare for dinner and from 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.000
 and I tell you I'm no chef or 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.640
 anything like that at all 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.550
 otherwise I almost never cook with 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.710
 house alone on your special days or days 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.480
 that I have the time to do it and 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.180
 I want to do it almost always 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.980
 dining on the street or things like that but in 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.040
 house not all the time so when 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.739
 I cook I want something to be something easy 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.079
 healthy and something that then that I 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.329
 I enjoyed doing it so that this 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.040
 idea I hope and serve you put it in 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.070
 practice then you tell me how do you 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.680
 we liked let's prepare zucchini with 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.320
 chicken sausage is rich so 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.420
 let's see the ingredients 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.250
 very well these are the ingredients that 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.950
 We will need as we are going to do 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.960
 Zucchini with sausages it is obvious that 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.150
 we're going to need sausages 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.400
 I am using 5 sausages from 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.020
 chicken you can use the ones you most 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.750
 may be turkey may be of 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.280
 pork of whatever you want I prefer 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.800
 those of chicken because the truth is that 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.820
 I can not stand pork meat like that 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.560
 that these are delicious too 3 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.080
 Tomatoes or 3 tomatoes as you know them 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.729
 these three are enough for the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.680
 food that I'm going to prepare and the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.050
 Zucchini of course I'm going to 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.009
 use 2 green zucchini or zucchini 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.930
 as if you know them and two of these 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.000
 yellows that in Spanish I do not know how 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.850
 they call but in English they are called squash 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.240
 I'm going to use these two instead of 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.610
 four zucchini ok and also a 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.530
 paprika of the color that you want me 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.600
 orange because it's the one I have here 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.970
 in my house proposed lizar the green the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.000
 red or yellow these are the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.009
 ingredients the basics so let's 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.580
 cook at once travel ok we're going to 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.220
 cooking girls and I like it 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.280
 with music so in the background I'm 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.580
 listening to the radio I like it 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.740
 hear that there is given one hundred 75 because 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.230
 has romantic music there is a great 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.500
 variety so it's one of my 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.320
 favorite Spanish stations this 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.780
 station is heard in the angels I 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.930
 it seems here in california in the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.180
 frequency 107 5 so while 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.080
 we cut our vegetables we listen 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.080
 music background 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.209
 I do not know you girls but I like it 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.909
 much the music of the eighties and the 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:51.150
 romantic music I feel that music 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.150
 of the 80s if his lyrics made sense 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.550
 our second step is to do the same 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.770
 with sliced sausages 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.550
 little girls very carefully I do not know 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.550
 go cut 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.900
 ok the sausages are already cut 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.200
 now we are going to cook them and follow 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.090
 with this process of preparing dinner 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.060
 perfect now let's put our 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.110
 Casserole to heat and we're going to put a 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.959
 little oil 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.690
 I'm going to use grape oil because 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.220
 It's very healthy and I love it already in 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.280
 another video I will tell you what are the 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.840
 benefits of grape oil for the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.819
 moment you can use any 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.819
 oil that you have in your house ok a 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.390
 little bit nothing and we let it 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.640
 hot a few seconds 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.870
 since the oil is hot then 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.090
 let's put the sausages all ok and 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.459
 we like the medium browning 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.680
 little bit that we do not burn anything more than 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.680
 make themselves like they take little color 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.750
 coffee and you know how girls do not 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.420
 I know how to express myself because I'm not 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.080
 a connoisseur in the kitchen but you 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.820
 they understand me 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.140
 to which I refer that they remain as 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.140
 golden a little 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.439
 in which sausages are worshiped a 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:11.140
 little we are going to grind our 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:13.390
 tomato here in the blender with a 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.909
 little cup of water more or less or whatever 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.009
 necessary at this time you can 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.079
 put salt then put pepper what 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.240
 I do not want to put salt because 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.979
 me and the sausages are very salty and 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.350
 I do not want more salt I do not want more sodium 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.389
 because then our little eyes swell and 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.320
 it's not very good for health ok so 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.320
 let's do it 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.620
 very well it seems that our 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.840
 sausages are ready so now 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.370
 let's go to the next step and the final step 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:53.159
 which is to add the zucchini and the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.300
 pepper that paprika forgiveness that 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:05:01.129
 we cut a little while ago that 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.880
 and we're also going to put the tomatoes 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:08.490
 or ground tomatoes 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:12.720
 and we give it a dita mix 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.700
 and we wait for it to finish cooking 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.710
 in what is finished to know our 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.420
 zucchini with sausages let me you 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.310
 I say that you do not just have to 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.900
 limit these two vegetables that 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.850
 we use you can experience 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.100
 putting more vegetables you can put 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.110
 onion you can put corn on it 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.330
 put lots of vegetables now yes that 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.400
 let your imagination loose and experience 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.860
 it really is a very simple dish 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.290
 that is delicious is healthy for 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.360
 those days that we walk in a hurry or that we 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.040
 the visit arrives like that unexpectedly and that 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.720
 we do not have to do CCOO 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.760
 cook I think most of 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.680
 us in our refrigerator always 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.130
 We have a packet of sausages that 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.450
 they can save us the afternoon of the day or 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.180
 really any time of the day 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.280
 ok so let's see how it goes 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.020

 dish to give it an extra flavor 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.190
 Well, you can add a little bit of 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.560
 fresh cheese this really 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.780
 the difference does not put so much 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.370
 more little than because we are eating 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.290

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.320

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.900
