00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:07.620

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 there are two multimedia systems 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.190
 available in the new period 108 the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.590
 more advanced has a touch screen 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.719
 of 7 inches its operation is 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.910
 correct reacts quickly to the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.669
 pulsations and the menus are easy to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.619
 use the biggest drawback is that 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.720
 If the sun hits directly on the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.350
 screen it is difficult to visualize the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.600
 information 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.760
 next to the screen there are two buttons on the 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.280
 upper is for the volume the 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.010
 bottom has two functions when turning it 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.460
 the radio dial changes when you press it 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.040
 we access the main menu 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.870
 in the configuration section the user 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.120
 can among other things vary the image 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.430
 of presentation for it you have to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.110
 connect a usb memory with images and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.180
 transfer them to the flash memory of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.180
 system let's see an example 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.060
 in the configuration menu there are several 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.189
 sections 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.659
 in the audio settings the user 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.500
 can set the treble sounds 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.539
 medium and serious as well as the balance 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.340
 In addition to these adjustments we can also 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.920
 indicate the connection to use a 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.590
 ipad device the input type of 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.180
 video activate the view of the cover or 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.950
 regulate sound according to speed 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.350
 in the screen settings we can 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.970
 vary the brightness and contrast of both 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.130
 the menus like the image that projects 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.470
 the rear view camera this camera 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.210
 is optional at the level help next to 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.190
 image there are some graphics that do not rotate 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.220
 solidarity with the quality of the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.440
 image in dark places is bad in the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.690
 bluetooth configuration the user 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.490
 can add a new terminal change 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.440
 the configuration of existing ones or 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.729
 delete them other options are change the 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.729
 system name or password 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.180
 regarding the phone configuration 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.070
 there are several sections for example the one 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.620
 allows you to select the tone and volume 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.040
 for receiving calls or messages 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.040
 emails 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.709
 we can also configure aspects 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.800
 related to the agenda how to activate 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.180
 the automatic transfer of contacts 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.860
 the system allows you to choose two options 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.510
 to see a call on the screen 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.110
 incoming can be in screen mode 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.110
 complete 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.020
 or through a drop-down 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.430
 from the main menu there is access to the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.870
 information on average consumption 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.000
 of the vehicle is divided by sections 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.310
 the main characteristic of this 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.230
 multimedia system is the mirror function 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.000
 screen on the screen we see the 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.159
 different menus as they are in the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.409
 mobile phone for this is necessary 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.790
 have a specific hair cable have 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.769
 an application installed in the phone 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.780
 that allows the connection between both and 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.209
 then have certain 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.950
 applications like the coyote browser does not 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.599
 we have been able to test this system because 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.230
 that the press unit did not have 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.450
 none of the necessary cables 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.519
 to synchronize the system with a new 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.200
 mobile phone you have to make a 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.170
 search on the phone and enter the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.819
 pin code that appears on the screen 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.040
 system will show the functions of the 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.140
 phone and will perform the transfer of 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.819
 contacts automatically always 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.849
 that this function is active 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.620
 the phone menu is very simple for 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.439
 look for a contact, we can go through the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.420
 list or look for it by its initial one 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.849
 once selected one is possible to realize 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.010
 a call send a text message or 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.569
 mark as favorites if you were 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.609
 connected with the specific cable 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.489
 we could also send and receive 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.170
 emails the contacts are 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.180
 can add to favorites as we have 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.310

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.680
 multi-tabs screen next to the 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.510
 of favorites is the calls here 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.370

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.530
 date and time another of the tabs 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.389
 serves to make a call by dialing 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.969
 a phone the system shows us that 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.290
 there are matching results 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:09.739
 depending on the phone we can receive 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.239

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.230
