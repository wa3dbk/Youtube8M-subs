00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
was a special edition I don't know I

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.399 
was a special edition I don't know I
don't<00:05:18.120> I<00:05:18.360> think<00:05:18.419> they're<00:05:18.719> still<00:05:18.930> selling<00:05:19.169> it

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409

don't I think they're still selling it
but<00:05:19.560> you<00:05:19.710> probably<00:05:19.919> have<00:05:20.159> to<00:05:20.219> be<00:05:20.310> put<00:05:20.430> on<00:05:20.460> a

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.290 
but you probably have to be put on a
waitlist

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300
