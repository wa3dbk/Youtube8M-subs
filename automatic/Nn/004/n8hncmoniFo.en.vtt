00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
square so if you imagine this is like a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.039 
square so if you imagine this is like a
square<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:25.380> floor<00:01:25.679> is<00:01:25.890> down<00:01:26.100> here

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
square and the floor is down here

his body is about a sort of a square

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.410 
his body is about a sort of a square
shape<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.979> start<00:01:32.250> putting<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.729> his

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
shape so if you start putting in his

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.059 
shape so if you start putting in his
ribcage<00:01:34.250> right<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.789> and<00:01:36.860> then<00:01:37.860> his

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
ribcage right here and then his

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.169 
ribcage right here and then his
shoulders<00:01:38.819> out<00:01:39.179> in<00:01:39.450> front<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.789> his<00:01:41.789> rear<00:01:42.149> end

shoulders out in front and his rear end
back<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.319> and<00:01:43.819> then<00:01:44.819> put<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.179> a<00:01:45.479> circle<00:01:46.049> for

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
back here and then put in a circle for

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.139 
back here and then put in a circle for
whether<00:01:46.349> all<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.619> joints<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:47.159> now<00:01:47.399> horses

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
whether all the joints are now horses

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.580 
whether all the joints are now horses
have<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.569> same<00:01:48.750> joints<00:01:49.080> as<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.349> and<00:01:49.530> I

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
have just the same joints as you and I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260 
have just the same joints as you and I
do<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.490> they're<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.700> slightly<00:01:50.880> different

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
do but they're in slightly different

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.880 
do but they're in slightly different
places<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.810> their<00:01:52.140> bones<00:01:52.380> are<00:01:52.560> all<00:01:52.679> different

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
places and their bones are all different

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.839 
places and their bones are all different
lengths<00:01:53.429> so<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.810> try<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.140> think<00:01:55.259> about

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
lengths so if you try and think about

00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:00.230 
lengths so if you try and think about
this<00:01:56.849> as<00:01:57.119> your<00:01:57.299> arm<00:01:58.429> this<00:01:59.429> is<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.759> elbow

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

we'll put the other leg a bit further

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.710 
we'll put the other leg a bit further
back<00:03:01.069> like<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.310> his<00:03:02.730> head<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.299> sort<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.599> a

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
back like that his head is sort of a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.140 
back like that his head is sort of a
circle<00:03:04.230> up<00:03:04.769> there<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.489> sort<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.819> cone

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
circle up there and a sort of a cone

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.789 
circle up there and a sort of a cone
shape<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.019> usually<00:03:07.139> put<00:03:07.290> another<00:03:07.560> circle

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
shape and I usually put another circle

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.650 
shape and I usually put another circle
at<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.099> bottom<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.609> there<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.269> he's<00:03:09.389> looking

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
at the bottom like there so he's looking

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.330 
at the bottom like there so he's looking
at<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.930> that'll<00:03:10.319> be<00:03:10.410> more<00:03:10.530> fun<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.980> have<00:03:11.220> to

his head like that

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:35.940 
his head like that
now<00:03:16.099> we've<00:03:16.219> got<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.370> basic<00:03:16.760> plan<00:03:17.000> for<00:03:17.329> our<00:03:17.420> horse

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.259 

now<00:03:36.950> we're<00:03:37.099> done<00:03:37.159> with<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:37.430> skeleton<00:03:37.879> we<00:03:38.120> can

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
now we're done with this skeleton we can

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.970 
now we're done with this skeleton we can
put<00:03:38.450> in<00:03:38.569> his<00:03:38.780> surface<00:03:39.140> roughing<00:03:39.739> out<00:03:39.829> his

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
put in his surface roughing out his

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.860 
put in his surface roughing out his
muscles<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:40.700> all<00:03:40.939> the<00:03:41.060> things<00:03:41.239> on<00:03:41.389> top<00:03:41.629> of<00:03:41.689> the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
muscles and all the things on top of the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.819 
muscles and all the things on top of the
skeleton<00:03:42.260> let's<00:03:42.829> start<00:03:43.819> with<00:03:44.329> his<00:03:44.870> back<00:03:45.379> now

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
skeleton let's start with his back now

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.379 
skeleton let's start with his back now
his<00:03:45.980> backbone<00:03:46.219> goes<00:03:46.700> straight<00:03:46.969> through<00:03:47.239> his

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
his backbone goes straight through his

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:48.729 
his backbone goes straight through his
body<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:47.959> that's<00:03:48.139> actually<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.439> really<00:03:48.620> good

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
body and that's actually a really good

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.039 
body and that's actually a really good
line<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.280> use<00:03:50.060> because<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.569> tells<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:50.930> where

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
line to use because it tells you where

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.869 
line to use because it tells you where
the<00:03:51.139> tail<00:03:51.319> comes<00:03:51.620> out<00:03:51.829> it<00:03:52.280> was<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.430> big<00:03:52.609> bump

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
the tail comes out it was a big bump

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.190 
the tail comes out it was a big bump
there<00:03:53.209> it's<00:03:53.480> like<00:03:53.569> a<00:03:53.629> couple<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:53.989> mountains

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
there it's like a couple of mountains

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.690 
there it's like a couple of mountains
like<00:03:57.200> that<00:03:57.439> it's<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.769> shape<00:03:57.950> like<00:03:58.129> that<00:03:58.189> then

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
like that it's a shape like that then

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.100 
like that it's a shape like that then
his<00:03:59.569> neck

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.140 

starts<00:04:02.920> at<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.160> top<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.460> his<00:04:03.580> withers<00:04:03.910> and

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
starts at the top of his withers and

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.200 
starts at the top of his withers and
attaches<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.930> back<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.740> his<00:04:05.920> head<00:04:06.400> like

that<00:04:07.510> in<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.720> nice<00:04:07.900> curve<00:04:08.410> we<00:04:09.340> have<00:04:09.490> to<00:04:09.640> describe

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
that in a nice curve we have to describe

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.390 
that in a nice curve we have to describe
the<00:04:10.390> front<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.840> his<00:04:10.990> shoulder<00:04:11.470> with<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.100> line

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400

the front of his shoulder with a line
that<00:04:12.640> comes<00:04:12.850> down<00:04:13.090> here<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:14.940> in<00:04:15.940> there<00:04:16.180> like

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
that comes down here and in there like

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.860 
that comes down here and in there like
that

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
that

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.940

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
you see his pelvis right here there's

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.220 
you see his pelvis right here there's
like<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.190> little<00:04:21.550> change<00:04:22.240> of<00:04:22.420> direction<00:04:22.540> around

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
like a little change of direction around

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.770 
like a little change of direction around
the<00:04:23.380> end<00:04:23.560> of<00:04:23.770> his<00:04:23.950> pelvis<00:04:24.400> like<00:04:24.670> that<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.270> then

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
the end of his pelvis like that and then

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.060 
the end of his pelvis like that and then
when<00:04:25.870> you're<00:04:25.990> drawing<00:04:26.140> his<00:04:26.380> belly<00:04:26.620> it's<00:04:26.860> good

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
when you're drawing his belly it's good

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.540 
when you're drawing his belly it's good
to<00:04:27.190> try<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.520> point<00:04:28.410> his<00:04:29.410> belly<00:04:29.710> towards<00:04:30.310> that

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
to try and point his belly towards that

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.600 
to try and point his belly towards that
little<00:04:31.030> change<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.930> direction<00:04:32.370> that's<00:04:33.370> where

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
little change of direction that's where

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.960 
little change of direction that's where
that<00:04:34.170> goes<00:04:35.170> to<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:36.130> then<00:04:36.310> we<00:04:36.370> have<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.580> start

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
that goes to and then we have to start

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.320 
that goes to and then we have to start
drawing<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.600> legs<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.770> hard<00:04:39.040> part<00:04:39.400> we've<00:04:40.150> got

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
drawing the legs the hard part we've got

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.240 
drawing the legs the hard part we've got
our<00:04:40.450> joints<00:04:40.900> worked<00:04:41.110> out<00:04:41.350> so<00:04:41.590> we<00:04:41.710> know<00:04:41.860> where

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
our joints worked out so we know where

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.040 
our joints worked out so we know where
everything<00:04:42.640> goes<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.480> we<00:04:43.630> have<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.840> put<00:04:43.990> the

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
everything goes and we have to put the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.570 
everything goes and we have to put the
muscles<00:04:44.380> on<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.590> top<00:04:46.290> he's<00:04:47.290> got<00:04:47.560> nice<00:04:48.250> big

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
muscles on the top he's got nice big

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.210 
muscles on the top he's got nice big
forearms<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.420> an<00:04:50.310> elbow<00:04:51.420> right<00:04:52.420> there<00:04:52.840> and

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
forearms and an elbow right there and

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.040 
forearms and an elbow right there and
then<00:04:54.220> sometimes<00:04:54.670> I<00:04:54.760> put<00:04:54.910> a<00:04:54.940> faint<00:04:55.510> little<00:04:55.810> line

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
then sometimes I put a faint little line

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.610 
then sometimes I put a faint little line
right<00:04:56.490> here<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.900> this<00:04:59.080> forms<00:04:59.350> sort<00:04:59.500> of<00:04:59.560> a

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
right here so this forms sort of a

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.330 
right here so this forms sort of a
triangle<00:05:00.250> really<00:05:00.550> then<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.570> thin<00:05:02.260> parts<00:05:02.950> or

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
triangle really then the thin parts or

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.090 
triangle really then the thin parts or
whether<00:05:03.610> bones<00:05:04.510> are<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.530> thick<00:05:05.710> parts

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
whether bones are and the thick parts

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.450 
whether bones are and the thick parts
where<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.640> joints<00:05:07.000> are<00:05:07.830> so<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:08.920> goes<00:05:09.040> thin

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
where the joints are so it goes thin

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.450 
where the joints are so it goes thin
down<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.180> his<00:05:10.330> fetlocks<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.950> you<00:05:12.160> that<00:05:12.370> would

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
down to his fetlocks and you that would

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.010 
down to his fetlocks and you that would
be<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.670> junction<00:05:13.030> between<00:05:13.150> your<00:05:13.480> finger<00:05:13.990> and

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
be the junction between your finger and

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.590 
be the junction between your finger and
your<00:05:14.440> palm<00:05:14.740> right<00:05:15.190> there<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:16.030> horse's<00:05:16.390> fat

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
your palm right there the horse's fat

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.550 
your palm right there the horse's fat
one<00:05:16.780> and<00:05:16.930> then<00:05:17.440> his<00:05:17.650> hooves<00:05:18.990> which<00:05:19.990> are<00:05:20.260> sort

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
one and then his hooves which are sort

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.510 
one and then his hooves which are sort
of<00:05:20.590> cone-shaped<00:05:21.340> really<00:05:21.900> as<00:05:22.900> one<00:05:23.590> no<00:05:24.220> put<00:05:24.430> the

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
of cone-shaped really as one no put the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.310 
of cone-shaped really as one no put the
other<00:05:24.640> leg<00:05:24.850> in<00:05:25.060> now<00:05:25.570> his<00:05:25.780> leg<00:05:25.960> is<00:05:26.110> further

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
other leg in now his leg is further

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.690 
other leg in now his leg is further
forward<00:05:26.770> than<00:05:26.800> this<00:05:27.040> one<00:05:27.220> so<00:05:27.250> I'm<00:05:27.490> going<00:05:27.640> to

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
forward than this one so I'm going to

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.280 
forward than this one so I'm going to
draw<00:05:28.300> it<00:05:28.390> so<00:05:28.510> you<00:05:28.630> can<00:05:28.780> see<00:05:28.960> his<00:05:29.140> other

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
draw it so you can see his other

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.270 
draw it so you can see his other
shoulder<00:05:29.770> in<00:05:30.000> there<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.680> then<00:05:32.680> his<00:05:32.890> muscles

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
shoulder in there and then his muscles

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.660 
shoulder in there and then his muscles
in<00:05:33.400> between<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:36.250> again

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
in between so again

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.190 
in between so again
thick<00:05:36.880> at<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:38.140> top<00:05:39.390> this<00:05:40.390> joint<00:05:40.780> is<00:05:40.930> actually

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
thick at the top this joint is actually

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.780 
thick at the top this joint is actually
pretty<00:05:41.380> square<00:05:41.920> it's<00:05:42.160> like<00:05:42.250> a<00:05:42.280> little<00:05:42.430> box

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
pretty square it's like a little box

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.970 
pretty square it's like a little box
then<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.540> thin<00:05:44.020> part

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
then the thin part

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.740 
then the thin part
and<00:05:46.160> then<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:46.700> joint<00:05:47.000> at<00:05:47.210> the<00:05:47.240> bottom<00:05:47.600> and

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
and then the joint at the bottom and

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.410 
and then the joint at the bottom and
then<00:05:48.320> we'll<00:05:49.300> pick<00:05:50.300> this<00:05:50.540> hoof<00:05:50.750> off<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.110> ground

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
the bottom and now we have to sort of

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.960 
the bottom and now we have to sort of
square<00:06:02.990> it<00:06:03.170> off<00:06:03.370> make<00:06:04.370> it<00:06:04.400> almost<00:06:04.670> like<00:06:04.850> a

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
square it off make it almost like a

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.260 
square it off make it almost like a
brick<00:06:05.620> so<00:06:06.620> you<00:06:06.680> can<00:06:06.860> see<00:06:07.010> the<00:06:07.130> top<00:06:07.400> of<00:06:07.430> his<00:06:07.610> nose

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
brick so you can see the top of his nose

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.770 
brick so you can see the top of his nose
and<00:06:08.750> that's<00:06:09.680> the<00:06:09.950> top<00:06:10.130> of<00:06:10.160> his<00:06:10.370> eyes<00:06:10.660> what<00:06:11.660> his

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
eyebrows his eyes sit underneath there

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.450 
eyebrows his eyes sit underneath there
like<00:06:14.540> that<00:06:14.810> and<00:06:15.350> then<00:06:15.440> we<00:06:15.560> put<00:06:15.710> in<00:06:15.830> his<00:06:16.010> cheek

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
tubes which have been sort of shaped

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.100 
tubes which have been sort of shaped
into<00:06:46.319> almost<00:06:46.770> like<00:06:46.889> little<00:06:47.069> flower<00:06:47.399> petals

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
into almost like little flower petals

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.040 
into almost like little flower petals
his<00:06:49.110> hair<00:06:49.589> comes<00:06:50.309> down<00:06:50.610> to<00:06:50.849> a<00:06:50.879> point<00:06:51.360> right<00:06:51.809> in

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
his hair comes down to a point right in

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.450 
his hair comes down to a point right in
the<00:06:52.229> middle<00:06:52.680> of<00:06:52.860> his<00:06:53.009> forehead

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
the middle of his forehead

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.689 
the middle of his forehead
right<00:06:53.669> there<00:06:53.909> it<00:06:54.749> comes<00:06:55.020> from<00:06:55.169> his<00:06:55.409> neck<00:06:55.740> down

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 
right there it comes from his neck down

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.510 
right there it comes from his neck down
to<00:06:56.909> a<00:06:56.939> point<00:06:57.300> like<00:06:57.479> that<00:06:58.159> so<00:06:59.159> that's<00:06:59.309> where<00:06:59.459> it

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
to a point like that so that's where it

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.369 
to a point like that so that's where it
grows<00:06:59.759> from<00:07:00.029> so<00:07:00.539> that's<00:07:00.689> where<00:07:00.930> it's<00:07:01.110> starting

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:01.379 
grows from so that's where it's starting

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.889 
grows from so that's where it's starting
so<00:07:01.740> then<00:07:01.919> we<00:07:02.009> can<00:07:02.159> just<00:07:02.599> think<00:07:03.599> we're<00:07:03.749> going<00:07:03.839> to

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:03.899 
so then we can just think we're going to

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:06.019 
so then we can just think we're going to
put<00:07:04.020> the<00:07:04.139> hair<00:07:04.349> out<00:07:04.469> there<00:07:04.680> now<00:07:05.669> we've<00:07:05.789> got<00:07:05.939> the

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:06.029 
put the hair out there now we've got the

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.119 
put the hair out there now we've got the
head<00:07:06.209> we<00:07:06.360> can<00:07:06.509> put<00:07:06.719> in<00:07:06.809> where<00:07:07.139> that<00:07:07.259> neck<00:07:07.649> joins

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:08.129 
head we can put in where that neck joins

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.929 
head we can put in where that neck joins
into<00:07:08.339> his<00:07:10.249> into<00:07:11.249> his<00:07:11.430> head

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:11.939 
into his into his head

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:14.420 
into his into his head
right<00:07:12.809> around<00:07:13.080> there<00:07:13.379> just<00:07:13.409> underneath<00:07:14.099> his

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
right around there just underneath his

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.279 
right around there just underneath his
throat<00:07:14.999> and<00:07:15.270> the<00:07:15.569> other<00:07:15.749> part<00:07:16.020> of<00:07:16.050> the<00:07:16.139> neck

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:16.289 
throat and the other part of the neck

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:18.469 
throat and the other part of the neck
comes<00:07:16.649> in<00:07:16.800> and<00:07:16.949> joins<00:07:17.219> just<00:07:17.550> above<00:07:17.819> his<00:07:18.029> chest

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 
comes in and joins just above his chest

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.679 
comes in and joins just above his chest
right<00:07:18.779> there<00:07:19.729> now<00:07:20.729> let's<00:07:20.909> draw<00:07:21.029> his<00:07:21.149> back<00:07:21.360> legs

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:21.689 
right there now let's draw his back legs

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:24.320 
right there now let's draw his back legs
from<00:07:22.379> the<00:07:22.409> front<00:07:22.800> the<00:07:23.189> muscle<00:07:23.490> comes<00:07:23.729> down<00:07:24.119> to

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.330 
from the front the muscle comes down to

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:32.000 
from the front the muscle comes down to
the<00:07:24.419> knee<00:07:24.689> like<00:07:25.559> that<00:07:27.499> so<00:07:28.499> you<00:07:28.589> got<00:07:28.709> the<00:07:28.800> knee

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.010 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.680 

and<00:07:32.100> then<00:07:32.700> this<00:07:32.820> is<00:07:33.000> his<00:07:33.120> ankle<00:07:34.010> and<00:07:35.540> this<00:07:36.540> is

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:36.690 
and then this is his ankle and this is

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.100 
and then this is his ankle and this is
pretty<00:07:36.900> sort<00:07:37.140> of<00:07:37.230> parallel
