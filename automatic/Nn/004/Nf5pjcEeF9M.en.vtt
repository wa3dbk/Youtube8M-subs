one thing they said come up here and

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.009 
one thing they said come up here and
adjust<00:00:27.689> your<00:00:28.199> open<00:00:28.710> force<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:30.240> actually<00:00:30.660> did

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
adjust your open force so I actually did

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.590 
adjust your open force so I actually did
I<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.740> did<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.610> open<00:00:32.669> force<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.360> was

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
I just did this one to open force it was

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.380 
I just did this one to open force it was
on<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.469> which<00:00:34.890> was<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.210> brittle<00:00:36.210> right

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
on like one which was a brittle right

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.799 
on like one which was a brittle right
there<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.809> don't<00:00:37.200> know<00:00:37.350> how<00:00:40.910> that's<00:00:41.910> that's<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
there I don't know how that's that's a

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.600 
there I don't know how that's that's a
little<00:00:43.020> mr.<00:00:43.230> Tim<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.160> between<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
little mr. Tim I just in between the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.680 
little mr. Tim I just in between the
three<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> five<00:00:45.360> seems<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.960> open<00:00:50.690> he

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
three and the five seems to open he

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.520 
three and the five seems to open he
helps<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.289> lot

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
helps a lot

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.119 
helps a lot
so<00:00:55.530> anyway<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.840> adjusted<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.020> did<00:00:58.649> not<00:00:58.829> mess

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
so anyway I adjusted that did not mess

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.500 
so anyway I adjusted that did not mess
with<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.460> speed<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.739> I<00:01:02.090> think<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.120> has<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
with the speed here I think that has to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.960 
with the speed here I think that has to
do<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.809> how<00:01:04.019> fast<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.589> goes<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.610> how

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
do with how fast it goes but this is how

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
do with how fast it goes but this is how
much<00:01:06.119> force<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.689> puts<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> didn't<00:01:07.860> mess

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
much force it puts on it didn't mess

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.460 
much force it puts on it didn't mess
with<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.280> being<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.960> seems<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.170> working

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
with this being in seems to be working

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
with this being in seems to be working
fine<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.920> went<00:01:11.400> through<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:14.000> wd-40<00:01:15.000> goodreads

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
fine I went through and wd-40 goodreads

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.780 
fine I went through and wd-40 goodreads
all<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.200> whole<00:01:16.500> track<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.220> change

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
all the whole track of change

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.510
