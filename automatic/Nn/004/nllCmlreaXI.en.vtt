00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240 

out<00:00:00.120> of<00:00:00.329> superior<00:00:00.780> economy<00:00:01.199> and<00:00:01.380> now<00:00:01.770> that's

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
out of superior economy and now that's

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.660 
out of superior economy and now that's
not<00:00:02.490> doing<00:00:02.820> anything<00:00:03.000> so<00:00:03.380> you<00:00:04.380> know<00:00:04.670> he's

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
not doing anything so you know he's

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.190 
not doing anything so you know he's
moved<00:00:05.879> his<00:00:06.029> command<00:00:06.330> center<00:00:06.509> out<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.810> his<00:00:06.960> next

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
moved his command center out to his next

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.259 
moved his command center out to his next
base<00:00:07.440> out<00:00:07.980> there<00:00:08.040> but<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.610> think<00:00:08.849> it's<00:00:08.970> too<00:00:09.120> late

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
base out there but I think it's too late

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.089 
base out there but I think it's too late
he<00:00:09.480> has<00:00:09.690> money<00:00:10.080> off<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.469> too<00:00:10.740> long<00:00:10.889> and

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
he has money off it for too long and

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.580 
he has money off it for too long and
yeah<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.389> can<00:00:12.599> see<00:00:12.750> his<00:00:12.870> transferring<00:00:13.320> st<00:00:13.500> be

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
yeah you can see his transferring st be

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.160 
yeah you can see his transferring st be
used<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.980> his<00:00:14.309> third<00:00:14.400> base<00:00:14.910> i'll<00:00:15.809> call<00:00:16.049> it

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
used to the his third base i'll call it

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.680 
used to the his third base i'll call it
his<00:00:16.260> third<00:00:16.470> base<00:00:16.650> even<00:00:16.680> though<00:00:17.390> it's<00:00:18.390> really

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
his third base even though it's really

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.670 
his third base even though it's really
he<00:00:18.810> only<00:00:18.990> has<00:00:19.170> two<00:00:19.350> bases<00:00:19.680> right<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.730> um

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
he only has two bases right now but um

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.720 
he only has two bases right now but um
doesn't<00:00:22.680> really<00:00:22.890> matter<00:00:23.070> because<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
doesn't really matter because in the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970 
doesn't really matter because in the
meantime<00:00:23.960> fire<00:00:24.960> about<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:25.260> has<00:00:25.470> gotten<00:00:25.830> his

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
meantime fire about here has gotten his

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.380 
meantime fire about here has gotten his
second<00:00:26.340> commands<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.670> are<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:26.970> going<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
second commands that are up and going to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.900 
second commands that are up and going to
so<00:00:28.189> they're<00:00:29.189> basically<00:00:29.400> going<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.849> be

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
so they're basically going to be

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.080 
so they're basically going to be
economically<00:00:30.570> even<00:00:30.810> although<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.109> think

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
economically even although I think

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.979 
economically even although I think
Barbara<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.210> might<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.719> bit<00:00:33.899> ahead

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
Barbara here might be a little bit ahead

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.990 
Barbara here might be a little bit ahead
even<00:00:34.290> economically<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.700> he's<00:00:35.850> had

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
even economically just because he's had

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880 
even economically just because he's had
a<00:00:36.059> his<00:00:36.840> commands<00:00:37.200> or<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.440> second<00:00:37.739> McMahon's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
a his commands or a second McMahon's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.990 
a his commands or a second McMahon's
that<00:00:38.190> are<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.700> another<00:00:38.790> time

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
that are up and going for another time

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.970 
that are up and going for another time
and<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.570> there<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> drop<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.500> drop

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
and and there is a drop going in drop

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.850 
and and there is a drop going in drop
going<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.850> GG<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.390> fiber<00:00:43.320> hero<00:00:43.559> sees

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
going in for for GG and fiber hero sees

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.869 
going in for for GG and fiber hero sees
it<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.070> he<00:00:44.219> doesn't<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.640> anything

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it but he doesn't really have anything

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.400 
it but he doesn't really have anything
around<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.360> respond<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> right<00:00:46.079> now<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
around to respond to it right now and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.040 
around to respond to it right now and
it's<00:00:46.829> only<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.190> tank<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.520> oh<00:00:47.670> no<00:00:48.120> he's<00:00:48.420> seized

it's only one tank and oh no he's seized

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.560 
it's only one tank and oh no he's seized
motor<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.500> SCB<00:00:49.980> he's<00:00:50.489> gonna<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.360> show

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
motor at that SCB he's gonna get to show

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.569 
motor at that SCB he's gonna get to show
his<00:00:51.750> own<00:00:51.870> tank<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.530> tank<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.430> other

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
his own tank with one tank and the other

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.680 
his own tank with one tank and the other
tanks<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> drop<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.390> top<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.629> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
tanks are going to drop on top of that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.660 
tanks are going to drop on top of that
second<00:00:54.989> tank<00:00:55.050> easily<00:00:55.710> dealt<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.309> far<00:00:56.340> my

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
second tank easily dealt with so far my

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.310 
second tank easily dealt with so far my
girl<00:00:56.879> although<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:57.270> part<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.140> as<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
girl although I think part of that as a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.770 
girl although I think part of that as a
result<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> fact<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.510> 4g<00:01:00.510> j<00:01:00.539> didn't

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
result of the fact that 4g j didn't

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.510 
result of the fact that 4g j didn't
really<00:01:00.930> micro<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.410> dropped<00:01:01.680> very<00:01:01.890> well<00:01:02.070> the

really micro that dropped very well the

really micro that dropped very well the
Seas<00:01:02.820> moded<00:01:03.180> right<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.510> front<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> SUV

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
Seas moded right in front of the SUV

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.329

really anyway so it looks like an out
fire<00:01:17.790> right<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.000> coming<00:01:18.330> back<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
fire right here coming back here with a

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.440 
fire right here coming back here with a
counter<00:01:19.950> drop<00:01:20.130> dropping<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.180> ridge

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
counter drop dropping on that ridge

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.630 
counter drop dropping on that ridge
above<00:01:21.659> there<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.979> don't<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.340> he's<00:01:23.520> going

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640

above there and I don't think he's going
to<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.820> able<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.270> anything<00:01:24.479> about<00:01:24.630> that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
to be able to do anything about that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
to be able to do anything about that
again<00:01:25.080> same<00:01:25.830> thing<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.220> he<00:01:26.310> tries<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> move<00:01:26.759> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
again same thing if he tries to move in

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.219 
again same thing if he tries to move in
never<00:01:27.090> mind<00:01:27.270> was<00:01:27.479> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> say<00:01:27.900> he<00:01:28.020> can't

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
drop on top of it because the Wraith is

doing that the glass are you to take out

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.550 
doing that the glass are you to take out
the<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.659> he<00:01:33.810> might<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.140> able<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> hold<00:01:34.409> us

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the right so he might be able to hold us

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
the right so he might be able to hold us
off<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.729> meantime<00:01:36.000> things<00:01:36.299> looking

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
off but the meantime things looking

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.550 
off but the meantime things looking
pretty<00:01:36.810> bad<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:38.310> GG<00:01:38.930> yeah<00:01:39.930> he<00:01:40.229> needs<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
pretty bad for for GG yeah he needs to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.340 
pretty bad for for GG yeah he needs to
put<00:01:40.740> something<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.400> too<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.850> spot<00:01:42.720> that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350

here<00:02:54.359> saw<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.720> coming<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.349> fell<00:02:56.010> back<00:02:56.190> there

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
here saw that coming and fell back there

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.160 
here saw that coming and fell back there
and<00:02:56.790> now<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.180> command<00:02:57.510> center<00:02:57.720> isn't<00:02:57.900> even

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
and now that command center isn't even

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.599 
and now that command center isn't even
up<00:02:58.290> yet<00:02:59.689> the<00:03:00.689> SCB<00:03:01.109> has<00:03:01.200> been<00:03:01.349> picked<00:03:01.650> off<00:03:01.799> by<00:03:02.579> a

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
up yet the SCB has been picked off by a

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.020 
up yet the SCB has been picked off by a
fire<00:03:02.939> by<00:03:03.120> hero<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:04.549> looks<00:03:05.549> like<00:03:05.670> fire<00:03:05.879> right

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
fire by hero and looks like fire right

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.309 
fire by hero and looks like fire right
here<00:03:06.120> was<00:03:06.209> setting<00:03:06.450> up<00:03:06.510> for<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:07.049> in<00:03:07.170> case

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
here was setting up for just in case

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.289 
here was setting up for just in case
Virginia<00:03:07.799> tries<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.220> see<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.760> outside<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.209> his

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
Virginia tries to see you outside of his

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.300 
Virginia tries to see you outside of his
basically<00:03:09.720> like<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:10.920> if<00:03:11.040> Virginia

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
basically like that so for if Virginia

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.660 
basically like that so for if Virginia
can<00:03:11.549> get<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.700> good<00:03:11.849> drop<00:03:12.090> off<00:03:12.709> sometime<00:03:13.709> soon<00:03:13.950> he

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
can get a good drop off sometime soon he

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.920 
can get a good drop off sometime soon he
might<00:03:14.819> be<00:03:14.970> able<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.180> effect<00:03:15.389> some<00:03:15.540> damage<00:03:15.840> and

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
might be able to effect some damage and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.020 
might be able to effect some damage and
might<00:03:16.139> be<00:03:16.230> able<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.519> cure<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.549> better<00:03:17.760> economy

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
might be able to cure a better economy

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.509 
might be able to cure a better economy
after<00:03:18.359> all<00:03:18.709> fire<00:03:19.709> right<00:03:19.859> here<00:03:19.889> I'm<00:03:20.099> surprised

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
after all fire right here I'm surprised

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.680 
after all fire right here I'm surprised
that<00:03:20.609> he<00:03:20.730> hasn't<00:03:20.849> gotten<00:03:21.090> another<00:03:21.329> expansion

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
that he hasn't gotten another expansion

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.300 
that he hasn't gotten another expansion
yet<00:03:21.959> using<00:03:22.199> he's<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> better<00:03:22.680> macro<00:03:22.949> player

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
yet using he's a better macro player

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.369 
yet using he's a better macro player
than<00:03:23.519> this<00:03:23.609> and<00:03:23.819> usually<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:24.780> would<00:03:24.900> expect<00:03:25.230> him

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
than this and usually I would expect him

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.270 
than this and usually I would expect him
to<00:03:25.470> be<00:03:25.530> getting<00:03:25.799> another<00:03:25.980> expansion

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
to be getting another expansion

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.009 
to be getting another expansion
especially<00:03:26.910> since<00:03:27.120> for<00:03:27.269> Gigi<00:03:27.599> was<00:03:27.750> planning

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
especially since for Gigi was planning

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.589 
especially since for Gigi was planning
on<00:03:28.049> getting<00:03:28.199> one<00:03:28.379> anyway<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:29.389> drop<00:03:30.389> coming

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
on getting one anyway and a drop coming

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.479 
on getting one anyway and a drop coming
in<00:03:30.750> here<00:03:31.040> neutralizing<00:03:32.040> fire<00:03:32.190> my<00:03:32.310> ears

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
in here neutralizing fire my ears

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.399 
in here neutralizing fire my ears
expansion<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:33.690> he's<00:03:33.870> going<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.109> come<00:03:34.230> and

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
expansion but he's going to come and

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.360 
expansion but he's going to come and
counter<00:03:34.620> drop<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.010> for<00:03:35.459> Gigi<00:03:35.790> actually

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
counter drop and for Gigi actually

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.339 
counter drop and for Gigi actually
dropping<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.609> more<00:03:38.849> forces<00:03:39.419> down<00:03:39.599> there<00:03:39.810> more

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
dropping in more forces down there more

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.809 
dropping in more forces down there more
forces<00:03:40.889> on<00:03:41.010> top<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.310> forces<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.669> were

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
forces on top of forces that were

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.000 
forces on top of forces that were
dropped<00:03:42.030> on<00:03:42.120> his<00:03:42.269> forces<00:03:42.659> try<00:03:43.500> saying<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:43.859> 10

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
dropped on his forces try saying that 10

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.819 
dropped on his forces try saying that 10
times<00:03:44.250> fast<00:03:44.359> and<00:03:45.359> for<00:03:45.780> Gigi<00:03:46.109> actually<00:03:46.500> able<00:03:46.650> to

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
times fast and for Gigi actually able to

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.080 
times fast and for Gigi actually able to
hold<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.310> Ridge<00:03:47.519> but<00:03:47.699> he's<00:03:47.879> going<00:03:48.000> to

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
hold that Ridge but he's going to

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.020 
hold that Ridge but he's going to
actually<00:03:48.359> fall<00:03:48.599> back<00:03:49.040> before<00:03:50.040> an<00:03:50.280> ok<00:03:50.639> your

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
actually fall back before an ok your

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.909 
actually fall back before an ok your
mind<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.510> guess<00:03:51.780> he<00:03:51.930> sent<00:03:52.079> his<00:03:52.229> scvs<00:03:52.500> over<00:03:52.799> there

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
mind I guess he sent his scvs over there

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.009 
mind I guess he sent his scvs over there
to<00:03:53.069> kill<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.400> car<00:03:54.120> right<00:03:54.239> here<00:03:54.269> was<00:03:54.419> se<00:03:54.629> me<00:03:54.780> I

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
to kill that car right here was se me I

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.199 
to kill that car right here was se me I
saw<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:56.040> thought<00:03:56.159> I<00:03:56.340> saw<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.819> wrong<00:03:57.000> color

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
saw it I thought I saw the wrong color

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.360 
saw it I thought I saw the wrong color
so<00:03:57.479> I'm<00:03:57.659> he<00:03:58.290> has<00:03:58.440> completed<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:58.979> expansion

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
so I'm he has completed that expansion

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.250 
so I'm he has completed that expansion
he<00:03:59.909> hasn't<00:04:00.150> been<00:04:00.269> able<00:04:00.359> to<00:04:00.510> transfer<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> CVS

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
he hasn't been able to transfer a CVS

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.379 
he hasn't been able to transfer a CVS
over<00:04:01.409> there<00:04:01.560> yet<00:04:01.709> but<00:04:01.919> if<00:04:02.459> he<00:04:02.669> does<00:04:02.940> it's<00:04:03.209> going

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
over there yet but if he does it's going

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.000 
over there yet but if he does it's going
to<00:04:03.479> be<00:04:03.540> risky<00:04:03.870> because<00:04:03.989> those<00:04:04.290> stds<00:04:04.590> are<00:04:04.889> going

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
to be risky because those stds are going

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.619 
to be risky because those stds are going
to<00:04:05.069> be<00:04:05.129> vulnerable<00:04:05.250> although<00:04:06.090> right<00:04:06.239> now<00:04:06.299> if<00:04:06.510> I

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
to be vulnerable although right now if I

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.119 
to be vulnerable although right now if I
right<00:04:06.810> here<00:04:06.930> oh<00:04:06.959> he<00:04:07.109> doesn't<00:04:07.290> have<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.530> forces

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
right here oh he doesn't have the forces

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.969 
right here oh he doesn't have the forces
right<00:04:08.310> now<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:09.120> really<00:04:09.449> go<00:04:10.229> after<00:04:10.409> that<00:04:10.709> spot

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
right now to really go after that spot

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.050 
right now to really go after that spot
after<00:04:11.190> all<00:04:11.519> and

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
after all and

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.310 
after all and
so<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.230> might<00:04:14.410> not<00:04:14.500> be<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.709> good<00:04:14.830> thing<00:04:14.890> for

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
so that might not be a good thing for

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.870 
so that might not be a good thing for
445<00:04:17.320> out<00:04:17.500> here<00:04:17.650> oh<00:04:17.680> he's<00:04:18.160> not<00:04:18.370> going<00:04:18.519> to<00:04:18.609> get

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
445 out here oh he's not going to get

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.460 
445 out here oh he's not going to get
over<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.180> base<00:04:19.419> i<00:04:19.570> think<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:20.079> if<00:04:20.139> he<00:04:20.230> does

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
over to that base i think and if he does

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.780 
over to that base i think and if he does
decide<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.829> take<00:04:21.010> his<00:04:21.160> forces<00:04:21.519> over<00:04:21.669> there

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
decide to take his forces over there

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.909 
decide to take his forces over there
it's<00:04:21.910> such<00:04:22.060> a<00:04:22.090> low<00:04:22.440> military<00:04:23.440> game<00:04:23.680> right<00:04:23.889> now

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
it's such a low military game right now

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.590 
it's such a low military game right now
that<00:04:25.290> what<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.440> hell<00:04:26.680> so<00:04:27.610> over<00:04:28.330> here<00:04:28.360> was

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
that what the hell so over here was

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.629 
that what the hell so over here was
built<00:04:28.750> another<00:04:29.200> bunker<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:30.190> what<00:04:30.310> his<00:04:30.370> marines

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
built another bunker to what his marines

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.940 
built another bunker to what his marines
in<00:04:30.790> and<00:04:31.120> his<00:04:31.270> tank<00:04:31.510> over<00:04:31.750> there<00:04:31.780> just<00:04:32.560> an<00:04:32.800> even

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
in and his tank over there just an even

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.040 
in and his tank over there just an even
better<00:04:33.310> spot<00:04:33.639> he's<00:04:33.820> put<00:04:34.030> his<00:04:34.150> barracks<00:04:34.480> so<00:04:34.930> I

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
better spot he's put his barracks so I

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.870 
better spot he's put his barracks so I
don't<00:04:35.110> know<00:04:35.260> why<00:04:35.440> for<00:04:35.710> GG<00:04:36.010> isn't<00:04:36.280> just<00:04:36.490> taking

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
don't know why for GG isn't just taking

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.760 
don't know why for GG isn't just taking
that<00:04:37.000> spot<00:04:37.300> out<00:04:37.480> actually<00:04:37.930> he<00:04:38.350> could<00:04:38.530> easily

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
that spot out actually he could easily

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.360 
that spot out actually he could easily
just<00:04:39.220> drop<00:04:39.430> a<00:04:39.460> few<00:04:39.700> forces<00:04:39.970> on<00:04:40.240> there<00:04:40.480> or

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
just drop a few forces on there or

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.650 
just drop a few forces on there or
seized<00:04:42.370> mode<00:04:42.639> or<00:04:42.790> something<00:04:43.030> like<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.180> take

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
seized mode or something like that take

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.570 
seized mode or something like that take
out<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:43.900> tank<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.440> then<00:04:44.650> take<00:04:45.070> out<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.400> and

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
out that tank and then take out that and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.800 
out that tank and then take out that and
they<00:04:45.639> need<00:04:45.790> to<00:04:45.820> have<00:04:45.970> another<00:04:46.060> expansion<00:04:46.510> he

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
they need to have another expansion he

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.940 
they need to have another expansion he
wouldn't<00:04:47.050> have<00:04:47.139> to<00:04:47.229> start<00:04:47.410> building<00:04:47.710> random

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
wouldn't have to start building random

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.670 
wouldn't have to start building random
basis<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.370> all<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> left<00:04:48.790> side<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.030> map<00:04:49.680> so

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
basis of all the left side of the map so

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.890 
basis of all the left side of the map so
I<00:04:51.070> don't<00:04:51.460> know<00:04:51.550> why<00:04:51.669> I<00:04:51.700> guess<00:04:52.419> for<00:04:52.600> Gigi's

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
I don't know why I guess for Gigi's

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.120 
I don't know why I guess for Gigi's
doesn't<00:04:53.290> want<00:04:53.410> to<00:04:53.470> try<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.710> deal<00:04:53.860> with<00:04:54.010> that

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
doesn't want to try and deal with that

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.920 
doesn't want to try and deal with that
but<00:04:54.639> really<00:04:54.940> at<00:04:55.060> this<00:04:55.180> point<00:04:55.300> in<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.630> game<00:04:55.660> it

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
but really at this point in the game it

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.000 
but really at this point in the game it
wouldn't<00:04:56.169> be<00:04:56.229> too<00:04:56.380> difficult<00:04:56.410> for<00:04:56.770> him<00:04:56.950> to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
wouldn't be too difficult for him to

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.260 
wouldn't be too difficult for him to
deal<00:04:57.220> with<00:04:57.370> it<00:04:57.460> so<00:04:57.639> i'm<00:04:57.729> not<00:04:57.850> sure<00:04:58.030> why<00:04:58.150> he's

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
deal with it so i'm not sure why he's

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.000 
deal with it so i'm not sure why he's
not<00:04:58.419> trying<00:04:58.600> to<00:04:58.810> yeah<00:04:59.350> so<00:04:59.560> you'll<00:04:59.680> see<00:04:59.830> fire

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
not trying to yeah so you'll see fire

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.200 
not trying to yeah so you'll see fire
and<00:05:00.130> fire<00:05:00.220> by<00:05:00.400> here<00:05:00.550> it's<00:05:00.669> actually<00:05:00.760> just<00:05:01.030> sent

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210

do<00:05:48.789> a<00:05:48.820> lot<00:05:49.120> of<00:05:49.150> damage<00:05:49.450> this<00:05:49.720> is<00:05:49.810> going<00:05:49.930> to<00:05:49.990> be

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
do a lot of damage this is going to be

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.310 
do a lot of damage this is going to be
really<00:05:50.289> difficult<00:05:50.470> for<00:05:50.889> from<00:05:51.610> for<00:05:52.510> Gigi<00:05:53.110> to

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
really difficult for from for Gigi to

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.540 
really difficult for from for Gigi to
take<00:05:53.650> fire<00:05:53.889> but<00:05:54.039> hero<00:05:54.160> out<00:05:54.340> of<00:05:54.370> this

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
take fire but hero out of this

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.190 
take fire but hero out of this
entrenched<00:05:55.000> position<00:05:55.389> and<00:05:55.570> in<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.080> meantime

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
entrenched position and in the meantime

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.719 
entrenched position and in the meantime
well<00:05:56.889> I<00:05:56.919> thought<00:05:57.220> he<00:05:57.310> was<00:05:57.400> going<00:05:57.520> to<00:05:57.580> do

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
well I thought he was going to do

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:58.860 
well I thought he was going to do
