the two handers here too the big hammer
and<00:06:21.629> then

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
and then

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.259 
and then
can<00:06:23.439> knock<00:06:24.439> everybody<00:06:24.889> down<00:06:25.249> you<00:06:25.909> can<00:06:26.119> do

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:26.269

everyone

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
everyone

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.969 
everyone
so<00:06:31.039> overall<00:06:31.489> the<00:06:32.239> warrior<00:06:32.539> is<00:06:32.689> a<00:06:32.829> it's<00:06:33.829> a<00:06:33.860> lot

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
so overall the warrior is a it's a lot

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:35.889 
so overall the warrior is a it's a lot
of<00:06:34.009> fun<00:06:34.249> pretty<00:06:34.879> simple<00:06:35.179> to<00:06:35.239> play<00:06:35.389> like<00:06:35.569> I<00:06:35.689> said

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:35.899 
of fun pretty simple to play like I said

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:37.539 
of fun pretty simple to play like I said
so<00:06:36.110> I<00:06:36.139> think<00:06:36.289> this<00:06:36.709> would<00:06:36.860> be<00:06:36.949> a<00:06:36.979> good<00:06:37.129> class<00:06:37.369> to

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:37.549 
so I think this would be a good class to

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:38.739 
so I think this would be a good class to
begin<00:06:37.849> with<00:06:37.999> if<00:06:38.149> you're<00:06:38.299> not<00:06:38.449> too<00:06:38.719> familiar

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:38.749 
begin with if you're not too familiar

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:41.979 
begin with if you're not too familiar
with<00:06:39.199> in<00:06:39.409> in<00:06:39.559> those<00:06:40.149> and<00:06:41.149> they<00:06:41.419> have<00:06:41.539> decent

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:41.989 
with in in those and they have decent

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:43.839 
with in in those and they have decent
survivability<00:06:42.499> especially<00:06:43.159> if<00:06:43.249> you<00:06:43.309> take<00:06:43.519> a

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849 
survivability especially if you take a

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.749 
survivability especially if you take a
hammer<00:06:44.269> and<00:06:44.539> a<00:06:44.599> shield<00:06:44.899> and<00:06:45.519> that's<00:06:46.519> probably

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
hammer and a shield and that's probably

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.179 
hammer and a shield and that's probably
I<00:06:47.360> think<00:06:47.899> I<00:06:48.289> really<00:06:48.619> enjoyed<00:06:48.860> playing<00:06:48.889> the

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:49.189 
I think I really enjoyed playing the

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:50.829 
I think I really enjoyed playing the
Mesmer<00:06:49.549> and<00:06:49.699> the<00:06:49.759> necro<00:06:50.119> as<00:06:50.179> well<00:06:50.419> but<00:06:50.749> the

00:06:50.829 --> 00:06:50.839 
Mesmer and the necro as well but the

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.659 
Mesmer and the necro as well but the
warrior<00:06:51.169> is<00:06:51.289> up<00:06:51.439> there<00:06:51.709> it's<00:06:52.099> just<00:06:52.339> a<00:06:52.429> lot<00:06:52.579> of

warrior is up there it's just a lot of

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.850
