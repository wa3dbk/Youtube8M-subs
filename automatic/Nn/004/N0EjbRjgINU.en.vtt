00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.279 
section over in both directions and
continue<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.209> the<00:02:01.330> same<00:02:01.360> type<00:02:01.899> of<00:02:01.959> cutting

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
continue to do the same type of cutting

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.430 
continue to do the same type of cutting
from<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.679> top<00:02:02.920> down<00:02:03.489> to<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.670> bottom<00:02:04.380> okay<00:02:05.380> so

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
from the top down to the bottom okay so

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.870 
from the top down to the bottom okay so
we<00:02:05.770> finished<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.190> back<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.640> now<00:02:06.729> we're

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
we finished the back and now we're

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.660 
we finished the back and now we're
moving<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.239> the<00:02:07.539> front<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:08.050> head<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.670> with

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
moving to the front of the head and with

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.330 
moving to the front of the head and with
him<00:02:09.970> we're<00:02:10.509> actually<00:02:10.720> going<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.080> leave<00:02:11.860> the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
him we're actually going to leave the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.940 
him we're actually going to leave the
front<00:02:12.489> of<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.819> little<00:02:12.940> bit<00:02:13.090> longer<00:02:13.420> so

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
front of this a little bit longer so

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.660 
front of this a little bit longer so
basically<00:02:14.950> I'm<00:02:15.130> just<00:02:15.160> going<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.489> kind<00:02:15.610> of

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
basically I'm just going to kind of

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.180 
basically I'm just going to kind of
clean<00:02:15.849> up<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.090> edges<00:02:16.209> here<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:18.040> we're

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
clean up the edges here and then we're

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.460 
clean up the edges here and then we're
going<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.340> start<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.750> front<00:02:19.930> working

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
going to start in the front working

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.839 
going to start in the front working
around<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.770> perimeter<00:02:21.250> which<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.730> the

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
around the perimeter which is just the

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.400 
around the perimeter which is just the
edges<00:02:22.590> around<00:02:23.590> his<00:02:23.830> face<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:25.110> I'm<00:02:26.110> just<00:02:26.260> gonna

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
edges around his face so I'm just gonna

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.449 
edges around his face so I'm just gonna
take<00:02:26.709> this<00:02:26.950> hair<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:27.910> lightly<00:02:29.459> just

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
take this hair and just lightly just

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.220 
take this hair and just lightly just
trim<00:02:30.849> the<00:02:31.030> edges<00:02:31.209> off<00:02:31.569> we're<00:02:31.870> not<00:02:31.989> going<00:02:32.170> to

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
trim the edges off we're not going to

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.369 
trim the edges off we're not going to
lose<00:02:32.349> too<00:02:32.620> much<00:02:32.739> length<00:02:33.069> there<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.170> hair

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
lose too much length there so the hair

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:36.750 
lose too much length there so the hair
comes<00:02:35.650> down<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:35.950> an<00:02:36.040> angle<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.550> we're<00:02:36.640> just

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
comes down on an angle and we're just

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.470 
comes down on an angle and we're just
going<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:36.970> follow<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.480> angle<00:02:38.580> down<00:02:39.580> his<00:02:40.090> cheek

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
going to follow the angle down his cheek

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.530 
going to follow the angle down his cheek
and<00:02:40.720> around<00:02:41.080> towards<00:02:41.500> his<00:02:41.680> ear<00:02:42.220> with<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.150> same

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
and around towards his ear with the same

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.600 
and around towards his ear with the same
motion<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:44.709> we're<00:02:44.980> just<00:02:45.010> going<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.280> take<00:02:45.459> the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
motion so we're just going to take the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.030 
motion so we're just going to take the
hair<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.120> slowly<00:02:46.709> follow<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:50.349> angle<00:02:50.829> coming

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
hair and slowly follow the angle coming

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.700 
hair and slowly follow the angle coming
down<00:02:51.370> his<00:02:51.670> face

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
down his face

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.410 

and<00:02:53.880> towards<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:56.230> ear<00:02:57.030> ultimately<00:02:58.030> we're

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
and towards the ear ultimately we're

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.740 
and towards the ear ultimately we're
going<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.600> end<00:02:58.810> up<00:02:59.670> behind<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:01.120> ear<00:03:01.300> and

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
going to end up behind the ear and

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.530 
going to end up behind the ear and
that's<00:03:02.260> where<00:03:02.560> we<00:03:02.860> left<00:03:03.490> off<00:03:03.820> with<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:05.620> back

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
that's where we left off with the back

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.890 
that's where we left off with the back
so<00:03:07.540> you're<00:03:07.690> actually<00:03:08.050> going<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.260> be

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
so you're actually going to be

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.370 
so you're actually going to be
connecting<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:12.100> front<00:03:12.430> section<00:03:13.200> with<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
connecting the front section with the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.700 
connecting the front section with the
back<00:03:14.680> section<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:16.350> that's<00:03:17.350> where<00:03:17.590> we<00:03:17.680> left

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
back section and that's where we left

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.790 
back section and that's where we left
off<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:19.630> then<00:03:19.840> just<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.200> soften<00:03:20.470> up<00:03:20.650> these

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
off and then just to soften up these

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.070 
off and then just to soften up these
edges<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.490> just<00:03:21.670> want<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.910> pick<00:03:22.090> up<00:03:22.300> some

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
edges you just want to pick up some

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.140 
edges you just want to pick up some
hairs<00:03:23.470> individually<00:03:24.460> and<00:03:24.670> kind<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:24.940> just

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
hairs individually and kind of just

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.500 
hairs individually and kind of just
slide<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:26.110> razor<00:03:26.760> softly<00:03:27.760> because<00:03:27.970> if<00:03:28.210> you<00:03:28.330> do

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
slide the razor softly because if you do

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.460 
slide the razor softly because if you do
it<00:03:28.600> too<00:03:28.750> hard<00:03:28.990> you're<00:03:29.080> going<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.230> end<00:03:29.380> up

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
it too hard you're going to end up

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.920 
it too hard you're going to end up
taking<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:30.010> whole<00:03:30.190> entire<00:03:30.490> hair<00:03:30.820> ops<00:03:31.060> piece

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
taking the whole entire hair ops piece

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.380 
taking the whole entire hair ops piece
of<00:03:32.110> hair<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.620> just<00:03:32.800> want<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.040> softly<00:03:33.610> run

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
of hair so you just want to softly run

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.720 
of hair so you just want to softly run
your<00:03:34.600> razor<00:03:35.880> along<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.030> edges<00:03:37.570> of<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.730> hair

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
your razor along the edges of the hair

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.690 
your razor along the edges of the hair
and<00:03:40.060> what<00:03:40.210> that<00:03:40.390> does<00:03:40.660> it<00:03:40.840> just<00:03:41.340> softens<00:03:42.340> up

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
and what that does it just softens up

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.160 
and what that does it just softens up
the<00:03:42.760> pieces<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.330> there's<00:03:43.810> a<00:03:43.870> little<00:03:44.050> more

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
the pieces so there's a little more

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.320 
the pieces so there's a little more
movement<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.160> little<00:03:45.430> more<00:03:45.550> texture<00:03:46.150> as

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
movement and a little more texture as

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.110 
movement and a little more texture as
opposed<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.960> being<00:03:47.170> blunt<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.070> heavy<00:03:48.130> so

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
opposed to it being blunt and heavy so

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.880 
opposed to it being blunt and heavy so
we're<00:03:49.360> going<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.510> continue<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:50.050> do<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:50.410> and<00:03:50.830> I

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
we're going to continue to do this and I

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.880 
we're going to continue to do this and I
would<00:03:50.950> say<00:03:51.220> do<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:52.420> about<00:03:52.660> two<00:03:53.350> inches<00:03:53.740> away

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
would say do it to about two inches away

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.140 
would say do it to about two inches away
from<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.190> front<00:03:54.490> you<00:03:54.580> want<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.790> leave<00:03:54.970> the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
from the front you want to leave the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.400 
from the front you want to leave the
front<00:03:55.480> section<00:03:56.020> out<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.590> not<00:03:57.430> cut<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.910> so

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
front section out and not cut it so

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.690 
front section out and not cut it so
using<00:03:59.410> our<00:03:59.530> guide<00:03:59.770> you're<00:04:00.280> just<00:04:00.460> going<00:04:00.640> to

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
using our guide you're just going to

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.630 
using our guide you're just going to
connect<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.780> last<00:04:02.290> section<00:04:02.770> that<00:04:02.800> we<00:04:02.950> cut<00:04:03.220> to

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
connect the last section that we cut to
