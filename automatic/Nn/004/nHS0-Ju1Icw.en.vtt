00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
this is where your 12-string comes alive

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.750 
this is where your 12-string comes alive
the<00:00:47.570> very<00:00:47.810> beginning<00:00:48.350> of<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.620> song

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
the very beginning of the song

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.139 
the very beginning of the song
is<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.570> most<00:00:51.780> obvious<00:00:52.260> instance<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.969> can

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
is the most obvious instance you can

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.700 
is the most obvious instance you can
take<00:00:54.359> the<00:00:54.539> same<00:00:54.780> melody<00:00:55.109> and<00:00:55.289> play<00:00:55.440> down<00:00:55.589> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
take the same melody and play down the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.349 
take the same melody and play down the
sixth<00:00:55.980> string<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.430> linear<00:00:56.640> fashion<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
sixth string in a linear fashion it

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.810 
sixth string in a linear fashion it
would<00:00:57.449> sound<00:00:57.659> like<00:00:57.809> this

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.030 

this<00:01:02.820> way<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.780> play<00:01:04.050> all<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.559> notes<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
this way you play all the notes and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.170 
this way you play all the notes and
they're<00:01:05.129> all<00:01:05.280> ringing<00:01:05.670> throughout<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
they're all ringing throughout the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.260 
they're all ringing throughout the
phrase<00:01:06.450> much<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.990> harp<00:01:07.230> light

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.450 

so<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.990> point<00:01:12.320> of<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.680> mute<00:01:12.860> again<00:01:12.980> is<00:01:13.280> just

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
so the point of the mute again is just

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.430 
so the point of the mute again is just
to<00:01:13.580> lightly<00:01:14.000> touch<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.270> strings<00:01:14.780> from<00:01:15.050> below

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
to lightly touch the strings from below

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.720 
to lightly touch the strings from below
and<00:01:15.800> change<00:01:16.640> this<00:01:16.880> Brad<00:01:18.130> sound<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.400> you<00:01:19.520> hear

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
and change this Brad sound that you hear

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.600 
and change this Brad sound that you hear
that<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.260> it's<00:01:21.260> such<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.560> signature<00:01:22.100> of<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.340> 12

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
that so it's such a signature of the 12

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.250 
that so it's such a signature of the 12
string<00:01:22.760> to<00:01:23.000> a<00:01:23.030> darker<00:01:23.480> tone<00:01:23.660> something<00:01:24.080> like

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
string to a darker tone something like

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.429 
string to a darker tone something like
this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.980 
this
or<00:01:26.369> there's<00:01:26.549> less<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.179> can<00:01:27.299> control<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.929> by

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
or there's less you can control that by

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.980 
or there's less you can control that by
how<00:01:28.350> much<00:01:28.560> foam<00:01:29.249> you<00:01:29.490> use<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.969> how<00:01:30.119> heavily<00:01:30.869> it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
how much foam you use and how heavily it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.969 
how much foam you use and how heavily it
touches<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> strings<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.069> so<00:01:32.249> on<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.500> towards

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
touches the strings and so on so towards

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.380 
touches the strings and so on so towards
the<00:01:35.069> end<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.549> song<00:01:35.759> there's<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> couple<00:01:36.299> new

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the end of the song there's a couple new

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.760 
the end of the song there's a couple new
elements<00:01:36.840> added<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.140> had<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> little
