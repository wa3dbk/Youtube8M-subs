00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
this fan on blowing up through the grid

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.659 
this fan on blowing up through the grid
tie<00:00:31.260> inverter<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.219> fan<00:00:32.460> that's

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
tie inverter because the fan that's

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.810 
tie inverter because the fan that's
built<00:00:32.940> into<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.390> never<00:00:33.630> comes<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.700> either<00:00:35.700> I'm

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
built into it never comes on either I'm

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.590 
built into it never comes on either I'm
not<00:00:35.850> using<00:00:36.180> enough<00:00:36.360> power<00:00:38.120> or<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.300> doesn't

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
not using enough power or it doesn't

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.350 
not using enough power or it doesn't
work<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.079> called<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> company<00:00:40.920> about<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.489> they

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
work I called the company about it they

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.639 
work I called the company about it they
said<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.629> will<00:00:42.780> come<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.350> gets<00:00:43.500> hot

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
said it will come on if it gets hot

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.160 
said it will come on if it gets hot
enough<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.430> seem<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> gain<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> lot<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.899> power

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
enough but I seem to gain a lot of power

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
enough but I seem to gain a lot of power
by<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.649> having<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:46.980> fan<00:00:47.219> balling<00:00:47.730> up

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
by just having this fan balling up

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.979 
by just having this fan balling up
through<00:00:48.059> there<00:00:49.039> right<00:00:50.039> now<00:00:50.190> pushes

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.970 

which<00:01:00.180> isn't<00:01:00.420> too<00:01:00.630> awful<00:01:00.990> bad<00:01:01.200> I'd<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
which isn't too awful bad I'd like to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.890 
which isn't too awful bad I'd like to
get<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.130> little<00:01:02.280> more<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.840> do

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
get a little more out of it but I do

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.670 
get a little more out of it but I do
have<00:01:04.140> another<00:01:04.410> array<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.129> about<00:01:05.370> 400<00:01:06.000> watts

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
have another array of about 400 watts

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.740 
have another array of about 400 watts
that's<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.980> back<00:01:08.160> of<00:01:08.190> my<00:01:08.460> house<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:09.630> the

other side of the house there that
pushes<00:01:12.450> about<00:01:12.660> 150<00:01:13.350> watt<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.800> we<00:01:14.220> run<00:01:14.430> them

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
pushes about 150 watt so we run them

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.130 
pushes about 150 watt so we run them
about<00:01:16.230> 1100<00:01:16.860> 1200<00:01:17.190> watts<00:01:17.660> for<00:01:18.660> probably<00:01:18.930> five

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
about 1100 1200 watts for probably five

a real nice setup just put the plate on
it<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.130> morning<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.940> haven't<00:02:03.240> even<00:02:03.300> headed

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
it this morning so I haven't even headed

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
it this morning so I haven't even headed
out<00:02:03.690> on<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> road<00:02:04.110> yet<00:02:06.890> just<00:02:07.890> figured<00:02:08.160> out

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
out on the road yet just figured out

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.240 
out on the road yet just figured out
sure<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.729> would<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:08.970> guys<00:02:09.920> maybe<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.040> could

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
sure that would you guys maybe I could

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.970 
sure that would you guys maybe I could
save<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.780> little<00:02:12.780> money<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.110> gas<00:02:13.440> by<00:02:13.739> ripping

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
save a little money on gas by ripping

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.449 
save a little money on gas by ripping
around<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.830> I'll<00:02:16.830> probably<00:02:17.040> enter

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
around on this and I'll probably enter

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.449 
around on this and I'll probably enter
it<00:02:17.549> in<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.730> few<00:02:17.910> races<00:02:18.090> too<00:02:18.510> I'm<00:02:18.660> sure<00:02:19.220> but<00:02:20.220> we'll

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
it in a few races too I'm sure but we'll

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.830 
it in a few races too I'm sure but we'll
try<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.700> stay<00:02:20.940> away<00:02:21.090> from<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.420> for<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.660> little

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
try to stay away from that for a little

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.610 
try to stay away from that for a little
while<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.230> she'll<00:02:22.470> stay<00:02:22.680> looking<00:02:23.010> good

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
while so she'll stay looking good

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.310 
while so she'll stay looking good
probably<00:02:25.620> by<00:02:25.739> Monday<00:02:26.130> morning<00:02:27.049> this<00:02:28.049> bike

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
probably by Monday morning this bike

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.960 
probably by Monday morning this bike
will<00:02:28.500> look<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:28.769> it's<00:02:28.980> 20<00:02:29.280> years<00:02:29.310> old<00:02:31.970> but

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
will look like it's 20 years old but

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.259 
will look like it's 20 years old but
