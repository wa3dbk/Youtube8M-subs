fish<00:00:54.399> the<00:00:55.270> experiment<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:56.020> we're

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
fish the experiment that we're

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.930 
fish the experiment that we're
conducting<00:00:56.559> now<00:00:56.949> is<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.489> look<00:00:57.640> at<00:00:57.820> how

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
conducting now is to look at how

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.720 
conducting now is to look at how
different<00:00:58.239> materials<00:00:59.140> remove<00:00:59.829> or<00:01:00.250> absorb

different materials remove or absorb

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.450 
different materials remove or absorb
mucus<00:01:01.300> from<00:01:01.629> fish<00:01:01.930> so<00:01:02.440> we<00:01:02.590> have<00:01:02.739> set<00:01:03.010> up<00:01:03.160> a

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
mucus from fish so we have set up a

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.120 
mucus from fish so we have set up a
mechanism<00:01:03.789> by<00:01:04.270> which<00:01:04.450> we<00:01:04.690> can<00:01:04.900> reproduce<00:01:05.680> the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
mechanism by which we can reproduce the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.640 
mechanism by which we can reproduce the
same<00:01:06.340> conditions<00:01:06.970> each<00:01:07.270> time<00:01:07.630> with<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.230> swatch

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
same conditions each time with a swatch

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.010 
same conditions each time with a swatch
of<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.340> same<00:01:09.550> size<00:01:09.910> and<00:01:09.940> same<00:01:10.420> amount<00:01:10.930> of

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
of the same size and same amount of

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.440 
of the same size and same amount of
pressure<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.620> that<00:01:12.370> is<00:01:12.640> then<00:01:12.820> placed<00:01:13.060> on<00:01:13.300> the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
pressure and that is then placed on the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.180 
pressure and that is then placed on the
fish<00:01:13.660> held<00:01:13.990> there<00:01:14.170> for<00:01:14.350> two<00:01:14.470> seconds<00:01:14.980> and<00:01:15.100> then

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
fish held there for two seconds and then

to<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.960> fish<00:01:23.200> then<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.370> swatch<00:01:24.610> is<00:01:24.790> exposed

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.020 
to the fish then the swatch is exposed
to<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.450> fish<00:01:25.720> we<00:01:26.260> remove<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.830> swatch<00:01:27.130> we<00:01:27.670> dry

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
to the fish we remove the swatch we dry

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.690 
to the fish we remove the swatch we dry
it<00:01:28.090> then<00:01:28.450> for<00:01:28.720> 24<00:01:29.230> hours<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:30.100> then<00:01:30.250> we<00:01:30.400> again

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
it then for 24 hours and then we again

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.850 
it then for 24 hours and then we again
weigh<00:01:30.940> it<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.510> water<00:01:31.870> that's<00:01:32.230> in<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:32.440> mucus

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
weigh it the water that's in the mucus

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.710 
weigh it the water that's in the mucus
has<00:01:33.070> dried<00:01:33.340> off<00:01:33.550> by<00:01:33.820> then<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:34.360> then<00:01:34.510> we're

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
has dried off by then and then we're

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.050 
has dried off by then and then we're
able<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:35.050> determine<00:01:35.500> exactly<00:01:36.280> how<00:01:36.610> much<00:01:36.640> mucus

federal scientists together with the
people<00:01:48.220> of<00:01:48.460> Sims<00:01:48.790> so<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.180> we<00:01:49.270> can<00:01:49.450> test<00:01:49.660> their

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
people of Sims so that we can test their

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.230 
people of Sims so that we can test their
actual<00:01:50.380> ability<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:51.160> to<00:01:51.550> protect<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.030> fish

actual ability to to protect the fish

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.050 
actual ability to to protect the fish
this<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.960> great<00:01:53.290> first<00:01:53.590> step<00:01:53.770> for<00:01:53.950> Simms<00:01:54.460> in

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
this is a great first step for Simms in

healthy<00:02:00.250> fisheries<00:02:00.730> are<00:02:01.060> key<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.200> our<00:02:02.230> success

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
healthy fisheries are key to our success

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.800 
healthy fisheries are key to our success
