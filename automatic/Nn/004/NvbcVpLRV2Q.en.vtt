00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
upper torso which is mostly just a

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.800 
upper torso which is mostly just a
swivel<00:05:44.370> and<00:05:44.520> as<00:05:45.090> well<00:05:45.240> as<00:05:45.270> he<00:05:45.450> does<00:05:45.599> have<00:05:45.750> a

swivel waist which is unnecessary

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.710 
swivel waist which is unnecessary

really can't do much with it because

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.740 
really can't do much with it because
it's<00:05:58.710> standard<00:05:59.160> of<00:05:59.310> course<00:05:59.550> but<00:06:00.030> all<00:06:00.240> dr.<00:06:00.599> doom

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.820 
figures are hindered by this there's
just<00:06:02.669> there's<00:06:03.210> no<00:06:03.510> good<00:06:03.750> way<00:06:03.810> of<00:06:04.050> making<00:06:04.680> him

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
just there's no good way of making him

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.620 
just there's no good way of making him
look<00:06:05.010> good<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.490> to<00:06:05.639> not<00:06:05.880> hinder<00:06:06.479> the

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
look good and to not hinder the

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.390 
look good and to not hinder the
articulation<00:06:07.260> but<00:06:07.650> he<00:06:07.800> still<00:06:08.010> does<00:06:08.220> have<00:06:08.370> a

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
the same type of looks but they're all

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.170 
the same type of looks but they're all
very<00:06:51.950> different<00:06:52.190> in<00:06:52.460> their<00:06:52.550> own<00:06:52.670> way<00:06:52.850> which<00:06:53.060> is

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
very different in their own way which is

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.110 
very different in their own way which is
nice<00:06:53.420> um<00:06:53.780> as<00:06:54.680> far<00:06:55.160> as<00:06:55.280> you<00:06:55.400> know<00:06:55.490> just<00:06:55.730> like<00:06:55.880> the

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
nice um as far as you know just like the

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.320 
nice um as far as you know just like the
overall<00:06:56.240> looks<00:06:56.840> I<00:06:57.140> think<00:06:57.560> that<00:06:57.770> the<00:06:58.330> Marvel

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
overall looks I think that the Marvel

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.420 
overall looks I think that the Marvel
Legends<00:07:00.290> probably<00:07:00.680> looks<00:07:00.830> the<00:07:00.980> best<00:07:01.160> I<00:07:01.400> think

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
Legends probably looks the best I think

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.550 
Legends probably looks the best I think
that<00:07:01.760> he's<00:07:01.940> got<00:07:02.240> the<00:07:02.390> best<00:07:02.540> kind<00:07:02.840> of<00:07:02.930> look<00:07:03.170> as

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 
that he's got the best kind of look as

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.170 
that he's got the best kind of look as
far<00:07:03.770> as<00:07:03.890> capes<00:07:04.160> in<00:07:04.400> the<00:07:04.490> designing<00:07:04.850> on<00:07:05.090> the

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
far as capes in the designing on the

far as capes in the designing on the
capes<00:07:05.420> i<00:07:05.570> think<00:07:05.810> that<00:07:05.900> the<00:07:05.990> marvel<00:07:06.260> universe

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
capes i think that the marvel universe

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.440 
capes i think that the marvel universe
when<00:07:06.680> does<00:07:06.800> a<00:07:06.830> great<00:07:07.100> job<00:07:07.130> so<00:07:07.910> sure<00:07:08.060> that<00:07:08.090> like
