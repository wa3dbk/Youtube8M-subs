augmented<00:00:23.340> reality<00:00:23.369> game<00:00:25.010> so<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.189> wave

looks like at least in the first few
rounds<00:01:24.980> you<00:01:25.910> gonna<00:01:26.030> hit<00:01:26.180> them<00:01:26.300> pretty<00:01:26.330> much

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.490 
rounds you gonna hit them pretty much
anywhere<00:01:28.660> we<00:01:29.660> have<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:29.870> be<00:01:29.960> careful<00:01:30.350> because

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
anywhere we have to be careful because

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.260 
anywhere we have to be careful because
they<00:01:30.830> come<00:01:31.010> up<00:01:31.040> directly<00:01:31.550> behind<00:01:31.730> you<00:01:32.090> too
