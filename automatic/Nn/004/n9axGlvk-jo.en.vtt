in the messy ponytail I just put it in a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.660 
in the messy ponytail I just put it in a
ponytail<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.440> was<00:00:49.530> wet<00:00:49.710> last<00:00:49.920> night<00:00:50.100> you

because<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.480> think<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.750> makes<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.050> cool<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.680> cooler

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
