00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.840
 and as time goes by we 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.450
 we find people who mark us 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.910
 for life and sometimes not 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.380
 we give the value they deserve you do not know 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.789
 value the people you have 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.490
 in front until things get 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.590
 ugly then is when you are aware of 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.740
 what we actually going to lose 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.100
 arms and that explains that it is your expulsion 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.590
 there I live every blow in my life as 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.930
 I say you see that pussy I fall again 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.870
 the light goes out as you watch the days go by 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.780
 and finish in your coffin is my cross is to know 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.760
 Where are you? I see that the passing of 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.800
 days to all the changes wherever 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.370
 made those I could trust 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.930
 Time puts everyone in their place 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.570
 promises and they escape without direction is never going to 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.060
 protect I'm up to the cock to vent 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.730
 penalties and in a side I drink I smoke and I drug 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.220
 always to be able to fly the dreams that 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.370
 forgotten somewhere accept my 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.320
 destiny and live my reality and there are many 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.390
 those that Frank wounded put me are 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.060
 quite the ones that never trusted me 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.710
 meanwhile I followed my life day to 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.500
 day looking for departures 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.869
 ending the prophecy that said that 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.380
 it's not good is the sky would reach all 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.420
 they laughed and thought they were nonsense 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.170
 gossip of anointing Jeremiah that drank 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.659
 and now they all fear at the end of their days 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.240
 the days go by and the 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.119
 hours pass we continue the same tears 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.070
 the laughs promises and lies value what 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.159
 that you have any tea in the end and 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.190
 the days go by if he will never come back 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.740
 the hours pass we follow the same 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.789
 cries the masses with those and lies 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:51.130
 that has the ending and if I have to dream 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.200
 then I dream and I'm going to forget 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.450
 everything to which I put my effort 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.729
 and I forgot the kid that I was before 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.220
 sitting in that park enjoying with 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.380
 what was old life was always 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.270
 for the brave the cowards will speak 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.429
 of what they give and they will lose by mir of 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.590
 front even being referents of the 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.220
 eternal solitude will speak when 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.590
 dead of what was my humility 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.690
 the promises that make you inquire into the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.700
 background of your feelings and then you 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.680
 escape time will be the judge who 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.470
 drag a place to live 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.660
 quiet I do not need your peace value 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.940
 always good every moment I tried 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.430
 decide without hesitation I have to be what I 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.470
 I feel crystalline message my retina 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.750
 is your song the passion brings it the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.170
 wind giving way to emotion and going 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.750
 passing the days and will never return visits 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.630
 they all pass I followed more and more the cries 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.520
 the lists promises and lies value what 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.360
 what it has is because I have at the end my 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.670
 life going on the days without a coin and 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.880
 the hours go by we continue the same in the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.320
 ranges of the masses promises and lies 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.709
 value what you have because the 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.709
 final 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.160
 Y
