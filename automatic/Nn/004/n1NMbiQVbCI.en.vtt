00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
me and then we've got engine hoist which

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.049 
me and then we've got engine hoist which
we<00:00:10.830> actually<00:00:10.950> which<00:00:11.340> featured<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.910> last

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
we actually which featured in the last

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.730 
we actually which featured in the last
series<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.630> have<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.809> take<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.110> engine<00:00:13.380> out<00:00:13.679> of

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
series we have to take the engine out of

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.499 
series we have to take the engine out of
the<00:00:13.889> Lotus<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:14.910> may<00:00:15.030> be<00:00:15.059> doing<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.389> bit<00:00:15.480> more

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
the Lotus and we may be doing a bit more

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.939 
the Lotus and we may be doing a bit more
engine<00:00:15.870> what<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.139> year<00:00:16.320> so<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.590> course<00:00:16.740> again

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
engine what this year so of course again

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:17.960 
engine what this year so of course again
we'll<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.190> using<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.520> even<00:00:17.789> though<00:00:17.850> we've

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
we'll be using that even though we've

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.939 
we'll be using that even though we've
got<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.150> ramp<00:00:18.390> it's<00:00:18.960> often<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.320> helps<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.800> have<00:00:19.859> a

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
got a ramp it's often it helps to have a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.529 
got a ramp it's often it helps to have a
bit<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.130> extra<00:00:20.460> control<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.330> kind<00:00:21.480> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
bit of extra control so we can kind of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.670 
bit of extra control so we can kind of
get<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> engine<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> car<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
get the engine out of the car and the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.470 
get the engine out of the car and the
car<00:00:22.830> out<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> engine<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.939> that's<00:00:24.060> there<00:00:24.300> we

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
car out of the engine so that's there we

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.470 
car out of the engine so that's there we
have<00:00:24.660> our<00:00:24.900> big<00:00:25.500> stack<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.160> 10<00:00:26.760> tools<00:00:27.150> I've<00:00:27.390> got

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
have our big stack of 10 tools I've got

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.790 
have our big stack of 10 tools I've got
two<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.810> these<00:00:27.930> actually<00:00:28.170> one<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.560> them's<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
two of these actually one of them's the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.230 
two of these actually one of them's the
other<00:00:28.980> side<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.340> moment<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.000> I've<00:00:30.090> got<00:00:30.210> all

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
other side at the moment so I've got all

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 
other side at the moment so I've got all
my<00:00:30.330> tools<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.990> nice<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.470> neatly<00:00:31.679> kept<00:00:32.130> don't

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
my tools here nice and neatly kept don't

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.310 
my tools here nice and neatly kept don't
always<00:00:32.969> end<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.210> looking<00:00:33.420> quite<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.020> neat<00:00:34.170> at

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
always end up looking quite this neat at

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
always end up looking quite this neat at
the<00:00:34.410> end<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.680> show<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:34.950> part<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the end of the show but part of the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
the end of the show but part of the
reason<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.730> use<00:00:35.760> these<00:00:36.180> tools<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.630> way<00:00:36.840> is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
reason we use these tools this way is

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.080 
reason we use these tools this way is
because<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.829> course<00:00:37.980> each<00:00:38.219> tool<00:00:38.879> has<00:00:39.059> its

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
because of course each tool has its

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.049 
because of course each tool has its
proper<00:00:39.870> place<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.860> store<00:00:41.100> then<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.940> have

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
proper place to be store then we have

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.299 
proper place to be store then we have
the<00:00:42.180> ramp<00:00:42.420> now<00:00:42.750> here's<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> ramp<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.950> spend<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the ramp now here's the ramp I spend a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.490 
the ramp now here's the ramp I spend a
lot<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.640> time<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.030> seems<00:00:45.289> standing<00:00:46.289> here

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
lot of my time it seems standing here

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
lot of my time it seems standing here
turning<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.399> switch<00:00:47.640> telling<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.570> all<00:00:49.520> very

we<00:01:13.260> use<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.560> bit<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> machinery<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
we use this bit of a machinery here a

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.240 
we use this bit of a machinery here a
bit<00:01:15.270> further<00:01:15.479> back<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:16.229> our<00:01:16.560> tire

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
bit further back we have our tire

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.830 
bit further back we have our tire
changer<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:17.970> as<00:01:18.090> well<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.390> I've<00:01:18.509> been<00:01:18.630> active

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
changer here as well so I've been active

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.359 
changer here as well so I've been active

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that's on top so you could of course it

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.039 
that's on top so you could of course it
shouldn't<00:01:30.240> really<00:01:30.299> tell<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:30.900> the
