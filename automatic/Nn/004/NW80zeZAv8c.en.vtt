00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
plateau it compounds within the vicinity

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.550 
plateau it compounds within the vicinity
so<00:00:20.400> do<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.119> find<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.869> late<00:00:22.050> fees<00:00:22.260> are<00:00:22.529> on
