00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.899
 I would say that we are very satisfied with how the season was born 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.300
 very well suffered in particular week end of this before he had been drinking 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.609
 really great 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:16.319
 Ã©gane flow of public we had if we want to settle the course of the 

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:17.289
 May 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.180
 or starting from the evening opening to say that life has come to you 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.680
 from the analysis of the results until today I would say that we are satisfied 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.730
 even above the forecasts 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.509
 and this year a gardaland has presented its hesitated and is a novelty of 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.429
 produced every year as we traditionally try to 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:41.449
 to present our guests with news so as to allow praise 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.460
 park to always have new ones 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.750
 edigas new experiences this year as everyone knows is called read time 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.540
 and it's 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.170
 a re cinema 3 ooh 4d as they say 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.460
 it's an attraction 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.680
 which is not going to improve the look of the park and above all I would like to emphasize 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.610
 he's done that they designed specifically for this new cinema 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.280
 three bars 4 size a movie 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.200
 is that here I did as you can prayed we wanted to remember 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.260
 stopped 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.810
 and if we want to put it irrelevant we have made a brief description posed for 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.690
 we like to lose people in the in the context 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.760
 of the panorama 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.760
 it was European if we want global amusement parks 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.080
 and as for the future we are preparing the opening will tell him the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.190
 metal is a special opening if we want to define it that way 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.130
 that there is always greater satisfaction every year we have 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.790
 of public increases 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.060
 and this year we have objective goals that are very ambitious for 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.930
 bone but we were confident enough on his photo to achieve these results 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.270
 r8 for a difficult month with regards to weather conditions as 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.650
 it is not uncommon that they can happen 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.190
 and the rains 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.450
 vnc we are in any case that this year too is as it was last hidden 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.400
