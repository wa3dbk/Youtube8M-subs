trying but everybody keeps getting in
the<00:01:03.420> way<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.949> anyway<00:01:05.600> this<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.140> looks

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the way so anyway this one here is looks

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.310 
the way so anyway this one here is looks
like<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> genetic<00:01:08.520> stripe<00:01:08.820> sunfire<00:01:09.450> albino<00:01:09.990> but

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
like a genetic stripe sunfire albino but

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.859 
like a genetic stripe sunfire albino but
we<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> isn't<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.670> must<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
we know it isn't so it must be like a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.030 
we know it isn't so it must be like a
tiger<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> bear<00:01:14.040> striped<00:01:14.909> sunfire<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.920> we

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
tiger a bear striped sunfire and then we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.469 
tiger a bear striped sunfire and then we
