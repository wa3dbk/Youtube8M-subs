00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
I think that's me out so I think it's

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.209 
I think that's me out so I think it's
all<00:00:55.750> plastic<00:00:56.019> with<00:00:56.559> this<00:00:56.710> kind<00:00:56.890> of<00:00:56.949> rubber

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
material which runs the inside so let's

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.810 
material which runs the inside so let's

fairly tight i'd say there's a bit of
little<00:01:17.619> bit<00:01:17.860> of<00:01:18.009> giving<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.460> but<00:01:18.670> i<00:01:18.820> don't

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
little bit of giving it but i don't
