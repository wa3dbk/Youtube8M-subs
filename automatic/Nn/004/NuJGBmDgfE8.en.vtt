00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello every day we study everything 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.280
 hockey publications in the press and blogs and 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.200
 we choose the most interesting in our opinion 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.340
 you are watching continental fiction and with 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.340
 you anastasia fomkina 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.200
 Russian national team in the final match 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.240
 the cup of the first channel gave the Czechs in 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.100
 As a result, Russians with two lesions 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.529
 and one victory and won in Sochi only 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.190
 Andrew Kuznetsov third place in this 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.220
 connection there were some questions a lot of them 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.199
 for example to hockey players why kovalchuk with 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.210
 kind of holds you hu for long 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.809
 season time is exactly a year homemade 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.150
 olympiad 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.190
 why manned world champions 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.379
 threesome of priests tereschenko perezhogin 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.330
 remembered only masterly murder 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.760
 as a stranger and his majority 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.920
 why did the burghers get in front of the cup 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.050
 Channel One is the most serious of February 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.750
 advances as if on purpose appeared in euros 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.850
 round empty and toothless forward where 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.760
 that bear disappeared in which even after 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.170
 disastrous world championship 2013 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.450
 rightly characterized by headquarters as 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.370
 the best defender of them and catches the country to 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.370
 coaches questions no less and 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.900
 specifically and individually 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.610
 Valery Belov, for example, really want 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.799
 ask about the terrible seasonal form 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.020
 Kazan Olympians when the second base 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.000
 moon club ska manages the far 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.590
 from Russian gold interests I am Lanin 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.290
 this can somehow explain 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.730
 Kovalchuk slipping but why ak leopard 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.870
 place forge frames for sochi 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.000
 turns into Madi about Czech talent 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.190
 defeating the hosts managed for the first time in many 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.990
 years win cup first channel 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.120
 and this despite the fact that before the last 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.630
 the day of the tournament they were in the 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.460
 favorable situation for yesterday's Czechs 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.290
 match on all canons should have come out 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.990
 from the match do we have on bending legs 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.270
 because on the eve of the victory after the shootout 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.870
 over the Swedes they returned to the hotel closer 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.660
 by midnight 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.730
 the game with the hosts began at 2 pm 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.800
 only 15 incomplete hours on 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.050
 recovery against the day from the Russians 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.280
 here as they say would not fall asleep on 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.250
 bench 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.330
 history really knows miraculous cases 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.039
 recovery by memory and feat 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.970
 Russian team on silver for her 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.980
 2002 World Championships in Sweden 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.959
 To some extent, the Czechs were not in favor 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.060
 and defeat the Russians in the game with the Finns 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.459
 join in the second game in a row the hosts 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.190
 obviously not going to guests at the beginning of the match 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.689
 it felt to the full 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.430
 Russia did not do everything to remove 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.190
 rival and achieve a comfortable 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.260
 benefits already in the first period 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.450
 in general, played absolutely not turn white 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.040
 grandfathering starting period in the last 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.080
 time is for the Russian team 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.150
 nap time but this time 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.610
 radulov and hurried to break this 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.590
 tradition already in the first minutes of the head 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.020
 Czechs swirled the third link team 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.910
 Russia drink responding to the transfer 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.340
 partner rushed Alexander Burmistrov 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.950
 a moment later, Viktor Tikhonov attacked 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.080
 Artemy Panarin did not stand to the side 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.150
 the guys immediately showed that they are the most 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.130
 young fast and hungry in this 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.170
 composition however score them as 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.340
 representatives of other links result 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.340
 this assault failed 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.890
 Dmitry de rico love shared his 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.280
 impressions from the performance of the team in 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.470
 sochi 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.680
 he had a national team play 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.020
 sense of hopelessness is nothing 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.850
 more symbolic than this picture describing 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.550
 All performance team Russia on 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.670
 home pre- olympic tournament nikulin 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.830
 on your knees Kovalchuk with his head down 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.840
 the reason for that is two hits at once 71 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.940
 numbers in the frame of the gate in one of 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.220
 episodes he got out himself and 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.720
 inversion and charged the crossbar and when 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.820
 Team Russia was necessary 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.270
 to recoup brand wrist throw 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.010
 almost split the barbell the hopelessness with 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.440
 such a feeling caused by the game team 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.120
 Russia in defense and action leader we 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.690
 see off the national team to 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.490
 home olympiad 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.650
 sports.ru after the match with the Czechs exposed 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.240
 Evaluation of the players of the Russian national team the most 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.140
 high score of all honored 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.450
 Alexander Yaryomenko had a good match 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.550
 missed two Spitak pucks on one of 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.560
 them finishing off virtually no chance for 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.380
 goalkeeper but with so many times 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.810
 insured 1 2 pairs of our defense that 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.900
 someone must be put in -1 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.270
 protocol and not say -5 several times 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.400
 left the national team in the game already with the score 12 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.510
 and gave the opportunity to trade the gates of the Czechs 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.110
 but last minute 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.970
 they ride with a difference of two goals 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.720
 that's how Yarjenko himself described 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.160
 national team performances 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.680
 hot on the heels of something deep 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.080
 hard to say but we knocked and 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.870
 really a little and it is impossible not to admit that 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.130
 this problem yes we were masters we 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.140
 brought a strong composition 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.210
 because of this, all rivals tried 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.160
 to play with us against protection must be given away 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.740
 due partner for the national team time from 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.900
 of time they pierced this wall but pucks 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.390
 and the numbers on the scoreboard it unfortunately did not add 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.680
 that’s why the team didn’t do that 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.510
 was required to do 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.150
 win the pre-Olympic stage of euro tour 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.010
 in front of his fan coaching 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.140
 headquarters will surely make of all this 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.910
 certain conclusions hope that before 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.100
 olympiad team will progress 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.350
 and move in the right direction 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.690
 here we take away that modern khaki and 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.440
 are built from defense game in matches such 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.780
 level and 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.410
 ode clogged washers we need to build 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.410
 defense 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.050
 Pavel Lysenko publishes interview Sergei 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.969
 MGIMO and you in which a specialist 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.050
 encourages everyone to part with illusions about 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.830
 that russia 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.930
 favorite of the upcoming Olympiad I another 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.699
 afraid of deep disappointment from 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.189
 hockey players kahill after which we 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.860
 we will gather with stormy in general all infelovtsov 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:44.870
 just because they play overseas 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.509
 not all guys are strong there 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.219
 remember how in the world championships 2013 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.289
 years with the top three kovalchuk and 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:53.839
 Rainbow fell Andrew elbow 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.120
 You can not allow the balls and they skew 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:58.249
 side in hell coaching staff need 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.469
 calmly analyze each player 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:02.960
 and understand what he will do in Sochi 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:04.669
 and all these high rates of bookmakers and 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.919
 words that russia is one of the favorites 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.379
 olympiad is just tinsel 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.870
 part with illusions and remember the words 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:14.240
 Bilyaletdinov the national team is extremely small 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.449
 the choice of world-class players is ours 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.430
 bitter truth 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.270
 Dmitry Ponomarenko does not sprinkle in advance 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.430
 head ash 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.219
 he is somewhere even glad about what happened with 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.899
 national team in Sochi 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.999
 strategically we achieved the main on 

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:31.520
 your home tournament team Russia 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:33.889
 far from favorite and that's great because 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.469
 that we have already been favorites for four years 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.879
 back in vancouver and remember well that 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.919
 ended this rout in 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:41.810
 quarter finals now probably not only 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:44.599
 professionals but also the fans themselves 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.120
 the players understood and what a famous tactic 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:49.430
 Bilyaletdinova will not save us any 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.349
 stars guarantee nothing players 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.939
 Kovalchuk level from our yesterday 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.370
 rivals and not close 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:56.479
 no native walls and stands support 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.209
 victory will not give 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:01.520
 and what will save the feat in the quarter finals 

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:03.979
 semi final and final time 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.240
 wake up sense that we have one way out 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:07.639
 not a game to win 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.889
 and the battle for victory is such a nuance 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:12.189
 just three matches in the main tournament in 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:12.189
 of life 

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:20.030
 our program has come to an end follow 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.979
 hockey and we will follow 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.370
 the news themselves were continental 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:24.940
 reading matter
