Oh

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.740 

this<00:00:15.490> demonstration<00:00:15.970> is<00:00:16.150> going<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.390> be<00:00:16.510> the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
this demonstration is going to be the

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.800 
this demonstration is going to be the
copperplate<00:00:17.260> rainbow<00:00:17.890> torch<00:00:18.280> finish

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
copperplate rainbow torch finish

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.390 
copperplate rainbow torch finish
important<00:00:19.810> to<00:00:19.900> remember<00:00:20.170> that<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.040> rainbow

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
important to remember that the rainbow

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.970 
important to remember that the rainbow
torch<00:00:21.760> only<00:00:22.720> works<00:00:22.960> strictly<00:00:23.320> in<00:00:23.619> conjunction

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
torch only works strictly in conjunction

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.190 
torch only works strictly in conjunction
with<00:00:24.160> the<00:00:24.369> copper<00:00:24.700> plate<00:00:24.970> by<00:00:25.570> itself<00:00:25.960> the

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
with the copper plate by itself the

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.230 
with the copper plate by itself the
rainbow<00:00:26.470> torch<00:00:26.740> doesn't<00:00:27.160> do<00:00:27.310> anything<00:00:27.730> it

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
rainbow torch doesn't do anything it

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.390 
rainbow torch doesn't do anything it
needs<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.660> copper<00:00:28.869> plate<00:00:29.140> base<00:00:29.500> in<00:00:29.830> order<00:00:30.250> to

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
needs the copper plate base in order to

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.810 
needs the copper plate base in order to
work<00:00:30.610> so<00:00:31.600> we'll<00:00:31.750> show<00:00:31.869> you<00:00:31.900> how<00:00:32.020> it<00:00:32.140> works<00:00:32.290> here

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
work so we'll show you how it works here

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.689 
work so we'll show you how it works here
here's<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:33.970> cleaning<00:00:34.270> steel<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:35.520> I'll<00:00:36.520> show

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
here's the cleaning steel and I'll show

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.130 
here's the cleaning steel and I'll show
you<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:36.879> first<00:00:37.059> time<00:00:37.210> I'm<00:00:37.300> going<00:00:37.449> to<00:00:37.510> dip<00:00:37.690> the

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
you the first time I'm going to dip the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.200 
you the first time I'm going to dip the
first<00:00:38.379> step<00:00:38.650> is<00:00:38.830> to<00:00:38.980> put<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.309> copper<00:00:39.640> plate<00:00:39.910> on

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
first step is to put the copper plate on

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.670 
first step is to put the copper plate on
the<00:00:40.660> steel<00:00:42.090> tip<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:45.330> get<00:00:46.330> your<00:00:46.540> your<00:00:47.019> copper

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
the steel tip and get your your copper

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.070 
the steel tip and get your your copper
plate<00:00:47.890> finished<00:00:48.309> there<00:00:48.460> now<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.750> rule<00:00:49.930> of

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
plate finished there now the rule of

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.600 
plate finished there now the rule of
thumb<00:00:50.260> is<00:00:50.530> to<00:00:50.589> water<00:00:50.979> after<00:00:51.280> every

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
thumb is to water after every

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.030 
thumb is to water after every
application<00:00:52.059> so<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:52.930> next<00:00:53.140> step<00:00:53.379> now<00:00:53.559> is<00:00:53.830> to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
application so the next step now is to

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.600 
application so the next step now is to
rinse<00:00:54.400> it<00:00:54.489> with<00:00:54.580> water<00:00:54.790> bucket<00:00:55.479> of<00:00:55.570> water<00:00:55.720> here

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
rinse it with water bucket of water here

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.979 
rinse it with water bucket of water here
rinse<00:00:57.610> it<00:00:57.729> with<00:00:57.820> water<00:00:58.059> if<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.540> don't<00:00:58.720> rinse

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
rinse it with water if you don't rinse

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.500 
rinse it with water if you don't rinse
it<00:00:59.110> with<00:00:59.199> water<00:00:59.409> there<00:00:59.909> the<00:01:00.909> rainbow<00:01:01.239> torch

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
it with water there the rainbow torch

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.090 
it with water there the rainbow torch
becomes<00:01:01.839> really<00:01:02.049> overwhelming<00:01:02.710> it<00:01:02.830> reacts

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
becomes really overwhelming it reacts

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.799 
becomes really overwhelming it reacts
really<00:01:03.460> fast<00:01:03.820> and<00:01:04.030> it's<00:01:04.150> very<00:01:04.330> difficult<00:01:04.540> to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
really fast and it's very difficult to

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:05.520 
really fast and it's very difficult to
control

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
control

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.550 
control
so<00:01:06.070> we<00:01:06.190> rinse<00:01:06.370> it<00:01:06.490> with<00:01:06.549> water<00:01:06.790> then<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:08.350> drive

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
so we rinse it with water then we drive

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.530 
so we rinse it with water then we drive
our<00:01:08.740> rainbow<00:01:08.950> torch<00:01:09.340> now<00:01:09.610> wherever<00:01:09.790> I<00:01:10.000> sprayed

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
our rainbow torch now wherever I sprayed

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.480 
our rainbow torch now wherever I sprayed
this<00:01:10.780> you're<00:01:11.590> going<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:11.799> get<00:01:11.950> like<00:01:12.190> you<00:01:12.220> hit<00:01:12.430> it

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
this you're going to get like you hit it

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.740 
this you're going to get like you hit it
with<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:12.640> hot<00:01:12.850> torch<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.390> get<00:01:13.510> your<00:01:13.630> different

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
with a hot torch you get your different

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.710 
with a hot torch you get your different
colors<00:01:13.990> reds<00:01:14.409> blues<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:15.190> grays<00:01:15.720> now

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
colors reds blues and grays now

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.320 
colors reds blues and grays now
depending<00:01:17.680> on<00:01:17.770> how<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:17.950> spray<00:01:18.370> it<00:01:18.580> if<00:01:19.120> you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
depending on how you spray it if you

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.970 
depending on how you spray it if you
kind<00:01:19.630> of<00:01:19.750> if<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:20.020> really<00:01:20.290> get<00:01:20.410> on<00:01:20.530> top<00:01:20.740> of<00:01:20.770> the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
kind of if you really get on top of the

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.430 
kind of if you really get on top of the
metal<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:22.000> start<00:01:22.390> spraying<00:01:22.690> it's<00:01:22.990> really

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
metal and start spraying it's really

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.960 
metal and start spraying it's really
going<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.620> go<00:01:23.800> hard<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.520> it's<00:01:24.700> going<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:24.880> go

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
going to go hard and it's going to go

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.330 
going to go hard and it's going to go
back<00:01:25.180> almost<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:26.320> steel<00:01:26.650> on<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:27.010> right<00:01:27.190> away

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
back almost to steel on you right away

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.700 
back almost to steel on you right away
if<00:01:27.730> you<00:01:28.000> kind<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.420> hold<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.750> back<00:01:28.900> and<00:01:29.200> let<00:01:29.680> it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
if you kind of hold it back and let it

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.160 
if you kind of hold it back and let it
work<00:01:30.010> slower<00:01:30.460> you<00:01:31.270> can<00:01:31.420> control<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:32.020> better

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
work slower you can control it better

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.870 
work slower you can control it better
and<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:32.680> want<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.040> keep<00:01:33.130> your<00:01:33.310> water<00:01:33.520> real

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
and you want to keep your water real

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.990 
and you want to keep your water real
close<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:34.180> handy<00:01:34.750> so<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.380> can<00:01:35.790> stop<00:01:36.790> the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
close and handy so you can stop the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.600 
close and handy so you can stop the
reaction<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.890> it<00:01:38.980> doesn't<00:01:39.250> get<00:01:39.310> out<00:01:39.370> of<00:01:39.490> hand

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
reaction so it doesn't get out of hand

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.020 
reaction so it doesn't get out of hand
on<00:01:39.940> your<00:01:40.090> penguin<00:01:41.190> now<00:01:42.190> a<00:01:42.220> deputy<00:01:42.580> threw<00:01:42.880> that
