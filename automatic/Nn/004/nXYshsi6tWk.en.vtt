00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 designer woman will understand caring better 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.940
 housewives 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.010
 that is why a small kitchen in this 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.219
 the country house turned out spacious and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.540
 cozy designer lyudmila zykina 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.370
 specially for our program are divided 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.370
 the secrets of the right cuisine 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.440
 to make your kitchen quite comfortable 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.970
 don't have to make it big sometimes 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.640
 much more important to make space 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.130
 maximum ergonomic that is comfortable 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.400
 and so the first rule is correct 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.320
 organize space space 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.930
 small but we once designed the house 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.480
 we deliberately made the kitchen such 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.510
 area no more although we could 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.910
 great do for god sake but i believe that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 mistress even in the kitchen is not good 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.199
 say car give but is 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.010
 Kapustin 3 kitchen and everything is in 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.650
 access here it is such a thing there to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.949
 sleep do not do a lot of movements she from step 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.110
 right step left all in the access zone 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.940
 rule second drawers with withdrawable 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.940
 mechanism is more convenient than cabinets with 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:12.210
 swing doors all rolling out 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:15.420
 easy rolling out all very capacious 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.320
 the boxes open nothing except here 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.200
 this box 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.810
 and this one here is a corner one 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.990
 he now rolls out the third rule 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.120
 make the most of floor cabinets 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.490
 easier to get when you have everything below 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.440
 and when you have a box on top of it is not very 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.650
 convenient only here 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.590
 drying here it is so double for 60 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.900
 centimeters marks 20th such double 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.650
 drying is very convenient too 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.010
 opening 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.960
 these doors and everything that we all allowed 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.240
 although now drying 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.580
 used in such boxes rule 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.590
 fourth, combine the kitchen table with 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.240
 additional cabinet will save 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.400
 useful space and will increase 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.160
 the number of storage places is the most important 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.730
 that the mistress in such but can come to 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:06.060
 this important table, too, with drawers with her 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.860
 sides and from us spoons from breaking tomato 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.720
 what if something else here 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.340
 bottlener and may their household 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.410
 to eat tea there 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.360
 their mills are also in the drawer I don't know there 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.459
 all this invention can my feet 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.769
 kaletnik do after in boxes and all 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.290
 everybody likes advice right here 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.379
 so I hurry package color everything is convenient 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.269
 Fifth rule, plan 3 levels of light 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:35.049
 first light and this is our working 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.810
 the surface is illuminated that's it 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:42.099
 for work a second light bar visit 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.680
 racks and common here it is all possible 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:48.390
 certainly more but less than there is 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.959
 light can not be three levels of light workers 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.069
 general and bar counter the sixth rule 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.079
 have a sink and hob 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.900
 surfaces apart from each other 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.660
 arm is better if the elements of water and 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.700
 the elements of fire will be in different planes 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.690
 so recommend the laws of feng shui pro when 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.180
 varnishing the kitchen 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.940
 hotel exist kitchen ergonomics 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.329
 because here is my to here and so on 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.610
 the hostess works and eat like that at home 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.739
 it was the seventh rule if you want 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.600
 increase the usable area engage 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.190
 sill if necessary he can 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.290
 used as an extra 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.389
 work surface when designing q 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.090
 and this was taken into account 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:31.660
 the window sill it is made and here from this 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.030
 material and ordered along with the kitchen and 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.310
 exactly at the same level it was all 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.709
 projected we brought this not 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.260
 achieved this rule the eighth is not 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.769
 save on literary supervision 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.900
 designer 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.040
 will take into account all the nuances and in time will make 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.040
 necessary adjustments
