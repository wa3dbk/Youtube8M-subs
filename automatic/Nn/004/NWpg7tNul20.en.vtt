I've<00:00:27.619> done<00:00:27.890> a<00:00:28.160> series<00:00:28.519> of<00:00:28.669> videos<00:00:28.970> before

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
I've done a series of videos before

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.810 
I've done a series of videos before
showing<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:30.500> mix<00:00:30.679> ability<00:00:31.130> of<00:00:31.279> our<00:00:31.369> G<00:00:31.579> pro

protein and different beverages this is
the<00:00:34.370> first<00:00:34.610> one<00:00:34.850> we've<00:00:35.059> done<00:00:35.090> though<00:00:35.449> that

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
the first one we've done though that

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.290 
the first one we've done though that
were<00:00:35.780> actually<00:00:36.079> comparing<00:00:36.500> our<00:00:36.620> Jean<00:00:36.829> pro

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
were actually comparing our Jean pro

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.790 
were actually comparing our Jean pro
tripeptide<00:00:38.300> protein<00:00:38.780> to<00:00:39.019> a<00:00:39.050> whey<00:00:39.350> protein

isolate<00:00:40.280> just<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.940> show<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.300> difference

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
isolate just to show you the difference

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.689 
isolate just to show you the difference
in<00:00:41.750> consistency<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:43.040> one<00:00:43.250> thing<00:00:43.460> that<00:00:43.579> you

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
in consistency the one thing that you

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.009 
in consistency the one thing that you
aren't<00:00:43.879> going<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.089> see<00:00:44.269> is<00:00:44.479> the<00:00:44.600> difference<00:00:44.899> in

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
aren't going to see is the difference in

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.740 
aren't going to see is the difference in
the<00:00:45.079> serving<00:00:45.470> size<00:00:45.680> our<00:00:46.610> competitors<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.420> 30

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
the serving size our competitors is a 30

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.899 
the serving size our competitors is a 30
gram<00:00:48.050> serving<00:00:48.320> size<00:00:48.680> to<00:00:48.949> yield<00:00:49.159> 30<00:00:49.489> grams<00:00:49.760> of

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
gram serving size to yield 30 grams of

protein where ours when we go through
the<00:00:51.949> process<00:00:52.210> brings<00:00:53.210> it<00:00:53.360> down<00:00:53.479> to<00:00:53.540> a<00:00:53.719> 15<00:00:54.170> gram

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
the process brings it down to a 15 gram

the process brings it down to a 15 gram
serving<00:00:54.680> size<00:00:55.100> that<00:00:55.519> yields<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:56.000> same<00:00:56.180> amount

of<00:00:56.629> protein<00:00:56.780> 30<00:00:57.320> grams<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.519> we're<00:00:58.670> going<00:00:58.759> to<00:00:58.820> go

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
of protein 30 grams so we're going to go

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.579 
of protein 30 grams so we're going to go
ahead<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.269> try<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.449> start<00:00:59.960> off<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.379> mix

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
the science of it is the fact that we

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.660 
the science of it is the fact that we

can get that amount of protein in such a
small<00:03:34.970> serving<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:35.720> many<00:03:35.810> people<00:03:36.170> ask<00:03:36.350> me<00:03:36.560> how

small serving so many people ask me how

we<00:03:39.170> take<00:03:39.410> our<00:03:39.590> process<00:03:40.010> through<00:03:40.220> what<00:03:40.370> it's

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
we take our process through what it's

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.340 
we take our process through what it's
called<00:03:40.640> electric<00:03:41.030> forces<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.990> basically

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
takes it through a process we put

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.310 
takes it through a process we put

that's how we can pack 30 grams of

protein in a 15 gram serving size what
this<00:04:14.630> also<00:04:14.840> does<00:04:15.230> is<00:04:15.530> eliminate<00:04:15.830> all<00:04:16.459> lactose
