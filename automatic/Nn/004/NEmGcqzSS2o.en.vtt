buckles are micro adjustable what that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.810 
buckles are micro adjustable what that
means<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.470> spin<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> buckles<00:01:05.189> 360

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
means as we can spin the buckles 360

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.080 
means as we can spin the buckles 360
degrees<00:01:06.119> spend<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> minute<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.549> if<00:01:08.549> we're<00:01:08.820> into

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
degrees spend a minute out if we're into

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
degrees spend a minute out if we're into
between<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.869> catches<00:01:10.680> here

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
between the catches here

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.100 
between the catches here
once<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.820> tight<00:01:12.000> wants<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> lose<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.900> dial

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
once it tight wants to lose we can dial

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.870 
once it tight wants to lose we can dial
it<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> micro<00:01:14.070> adjustable<00:01:14.340> buckle

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
it in with the micro adjustable buckle

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.289 
it in with the micro adjustable buckle
so<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.869> get<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> perfect<00:01:16.439> fit<00:01:17.150> we<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
so that we get the perfect fit we get a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.060 
so that we get the perfect fit we get a
bigger<00:01:18.540> power<00:01:18.780> strap<00:01:19.170> 35<00:01:19.920> millimeters<00:01:21.799> so<00:01:22.799> we

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
bigger power strap 35 millimeters so we

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.910 
bigger power strap 35 millimeters so we
get<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.790> better<00:01:24.299> rat<00:01:24.630> more<00:01:24.930> control<00:01:25.350> over<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
get a better rat more control over the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.289 
get a better rat more control over the
top<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.400> cuff<00:01:26.720> we<00:01:27.720> also<00:01:27.930> get<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
top of the cuff we also get the

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.760 
top of the cuff we also get the
releasable<00:01:30.299> spoiler<00:01:30.930> here<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.650> can

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
releasable spoiler here so we can

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.560 
releasable spoiler here so we can
accommodate<00:01:32.070> different<00:01:32.579> volumes<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.210> calves

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
accommodate different volumes of calves

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.469 
accommodate different volumes of calves
as<00:01:33.810> well<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.890> still<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.640> quick<00:01:36.060> adjust

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
bottom one is adjustable as well but it

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.899 
bottom one is adjustable as well but it
does<00:01:43.649> require<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.100> nail<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.430> wrench<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.790> make

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
does require a nail and wrench to make

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.450 
does require a nail and wrench to make
those<00:01:45.060> adjustments<00:01:45.619> this<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> buy<00:01:47.040> injected

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
those adjustments this is a buy injected

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.950 
those adjustments this is a buy injected
liner<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.880> we've<00:01:48.000> got<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> black<00:01:48.450> material

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
liner so we've got the black material

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.260 
liner so we've got the black material
which<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.229> stiffer<00:01:49.470> more<00:01:50.070> responsive<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
which is stiffer more responsive and the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.060 
which is stiffer more responsive and the
clear<00:01:51.600> plastic<00:01:51.899> material<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.500> top<00:01:52.710> which<00:01:52.920> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
clear plastic material on top which is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.039 
clear plastic material on top which is
softer<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:54.119> allows<00:01:54.329> us<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.570> very<00:01:54.840> easily

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
softer that allows us to very easily

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.020 
softer that allows us to very easily
open<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> throat<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.130> boot<00:01:56.310> much

open up the throat of the boot much

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.940 
open up the throat of the boot much
easier<00:01:57.390> seiner
