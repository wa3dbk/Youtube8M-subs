00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.330
 a 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.810
 I seek is to tell you 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.460
 of the car there we identified the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.890
 main hours volumes of the car 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.250
 so that I'm a little rebuild 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.950
 the hood section there another line 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.730
 to seek to reconstruct the form 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.290
 that there in the front where we go after the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.379
 present and thrillers beautiful put 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.680
 their bumps and the middle scudetto with 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.900
 the two bush at the sides and the thing that 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.269
 is however yielded to work 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.720
 on the sections to have what you 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.519
 see on the car so a shape 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.290
 still very muscular car trait 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:01:00.460
 is very sexual fluid and that's 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.080
 really important for alfa romeo 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.979
 so as I said earlier to 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.250
 liart 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:11.420
 this is a section there is a place at 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.030
 turn in his khl side we arrive on the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.090
 hood and then we go on the other muscles 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.920
 in circles there are there turnips that 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.590
 it's very important because he's going to have 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.150
 drawn a little and left continued by the 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.390
 cab of the car and will fall to 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.910
 the front and then we find this line 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.510
 who will generate as I said everything to 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.510
 the hour the scudetto perfect to the mayor 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.510
 it's very important to play on 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.930
 the other dimensionality so to have a 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:48.110
 very important discussion so that's 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:55.210
 the scudetto there we find dairy the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.210
 robot with the mouth to side 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.170
 the theoretical lines that we find 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.220
 also called culation and goes into the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.100
 mouth he will fall in the mouth he goes 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.110
 produce the two black parts that he 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.670
 So there are only 20 these elements there and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.880
 then there are small elements 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.170
 stylistics that are necessary for 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.170
 give a little bit of 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.030
 crank in the mouth of the bike 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.230
 very important to have a cabin to be 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.880
 stiff enough affirmed and to have the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.819
 sensation that the adventuress is compact 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.709
 so this situation she really is 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.319
 very important another feature 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.720
 those who follow the hood you have 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.230
 this line had that he has a 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.349
 traditionally you are therefore to emphasize 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.550
 again the hood of the car 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:04.400
 so if we imagine the section we have 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.880
 a movement that goes up and down 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.080
 and then again here you the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.940
 see there is the opening line the cases 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.870
 bring to this nature one does not have to 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.269
 can not open it 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.580
 we will surely have for reasons 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.110
 techniques but it's still 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:26.170
 necessary for the com gently I 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.020
 said for 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.410
 whether to make the agreement hold 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.410
 on a car 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.850
 or 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.650
 that's a bit more important figure 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:52.209
 the face of a farms and dairies globe 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.709
 on 4.6 and the really very iconic 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:04:00.950
 that is, we do not have elements 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:02.360
 added in and if we look 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.629
 the history of alfa romeo 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.709
 we really find a transformation 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:12.129
 of this phase of cheese in 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.129
 the story 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.760
 he 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.889
 I 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.610
 Yes, but 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.610
 it's okay 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.220
