I<00:00:23.800> use<00:00:24.430> it<00:00:24.550> every<00:00:24.640> day<00:00:25.210> come<00:00:25.420> rain<00:00:25.750> or<00:00:26.140> shine<00:00:27.330> as

I use it every day come rain or shine as
you<00:00:28.450> can<00:00:28.570> see<00:00:28.689> it's<00:00:28.779> maybe<00:00:29.410> not<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.800> cleanest

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
you can see it's maybe not the cleanest

you can see it's maybe not the cleanest
bike<00:00:30.600> around<00:00:31.600> but<00:00:32.080> it<00:00:32.590> is<00:00:32.739> my<00:00:32.949> my<00:00:33.489> trusty<00:00:33.820> steed

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
I use it nearly every day okay so I

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.070 
I use it nearly every day okay so I
still<00:00:39.220> can't<00:00:39.400> complain<00:00:39.910> about<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.210> ride<00:00:40.510> it's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080

still can't complain about the ride it's
very<00:00:41.320> very<00:00:41.470> comfortable<00:00:41.680> although<00:00:42.640> I<00:00:42.760> -<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
very very comfortable although I - it

very very comfortable although I - it
really<00:00:44.140> be<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.530> original<00:00:45.960> stock<00:00:46.960> seat

really be the original stock seat

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.160 
really be the original stock seat
because<00:00:47.650> I<00:00:47.680> was<00:00:47.949> like<00:00:48.820> sitting<00:00:49.120> on<00:00:49.330> a<00:00:49.390> blade<00:00:50.140> of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
because I was like sitting on a blade of

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.939 
because I was like sitting on a blade of
the<00:00:50.769> bay<00:00:51.370> glass<00:00:52.199> not<00:00:53.199> very<00:00:53.350> comfortable<00:00:53.650> on<00:00:53.799> my

the bay glass not very comfortable on my
my<00:00:54.460> bottom<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.530> change<00:00:56.530> that<00:00:56.680> straight<00:00:56.890> away

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
my bottom so change that straight away

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.070 
my bottom so change that straight away

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
and do that before the previous review

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.740 
and do that before the previous review
things<00:01:02.080> things<00:01:02.650> I'm<00:01:02.830> not<00:01:03.129> too<00:01:03.820> impressed

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
about with this bike is the some of the

about with this bike is the some of the
the<00:01:08.049> quality<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:08.890> components<00:01:09.840> although

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
the quality of the components although

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.240 
the quality of the components although
the<00:01:10.960> track<00:01:11.170> frame<00:01:11.530> is<00:01:12.960> hydroformed<00:01:14.250> aluminium

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
the track frame is hydroformed aluminium

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.920 
the track frame is hydroformed aluminium
is<00:01:15.549> quite<00:01:16.060> light<00:01:17.820> some<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.090> other

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
is quite light some of the other

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.139 
is quite light some of the other
components<00:01:20.259> such<00:01:20.680> as<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.920> pedals<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:24.310> replace

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
components such as the pedals to replace

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.980 
components such as the pedals to replace
the<00:01:25.840> stock<00:01:26.229> pedals<00:01:26.619> with<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:27.659> better<00:01:28.659> pair

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
the stock pedals with a better pair

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.349 
the stock pedals with a better pair
after<00:01:29.859> only<00:01:29.979> 500<00:01:30.490> miles<00:01:30.640> which<00:01:30.909> is<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.060> little

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
after only 500 miles which is a little

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.969 
after only 500 miles which is a little
bit<00:01:31.479> disappointing<00:01:31.960> after<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.590> bearings

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
bit disappointing after the bearings

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.580 
bit disappointing after the bearings
dropped<00:01:33.250> out<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:36.100> far<00:01:36.780> I've<00:01:37.780> replaced<00:01:38.439> the

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
dropped out and so far I've replaced the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.899 
dropped out and so far I've replaced the
crank<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:41.590> just<00:01:41.950> through<00:01:42.100> general<00:01:42.729> wear

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
crank and just just through general wear

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.660 
crank and just just through general wear
and<00:01:42.939> tear<00:01:43.329> really<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:45.520> bottom<00:01:46.329> bracket

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and tear really the bottom bracket

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.300 
and tear really the bottom bracket
fairly<00:01:48.670> recently<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.810> Dior<00:01:51.689> julia<00:01:53.310> replaced

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
fairly recently the Dior julia replaced

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.029 
fairly recently the Dior julia replaced
that<00:01:54.460> because<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:54.909> spring<00:01:56.009> gone<00:01:57.009> quite<00:01:57.369> weak

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
that because the spring gone quite weak

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.959 
that because the spring gone quite weak
I'm<00:02:00.039> on<00:02:00.249> my<00:02:00.399> my<00:02:01.119> second<00:02:01.679> cassette<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:02.969> chain

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
I'm on my my second cassette and chain

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.160 
I'm on my my second cassette and chain
so<00:02:04.479> overall<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:06.159> know<00:02:06.280> due<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.609> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
so overall you know due to the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.840 
so overall you know due to the
all-weather<00:02:08.170> riding<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.860> do<00:02:09.130> tends<00:02:09.729> to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
all-weather riding that I do tends to

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.510 
all-weather riding that I do tends to
get<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.000> little<00:02:10.149> bit<00:02:10.360> grimy<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.680> hunters<00:02:12.370> to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
get a little bit grimy and hunters to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.710 
get a little bit grimy and hunters to
wear<00:02:12.700> things<00:02:12.880> out<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.480> little<00:02:14.080> bit<00:02:14.260> there<00:02:14.410> but

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.830 

you<00:02:16.810> know<00:02:16.930> it's<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.200> be<00:02:17.290> expected<00:02:17.410> really<00:02:19.240> one

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
you know it's to be expected really one

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.290 
you know it's to be expected really one
thing<00:02:19.990> I'm<00:02:20.200> quite<00:02:20.700> surprised<00:02:21.700> about<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:22.120> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
thing I'm quite surprised about is the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.700 
thing I'm quite surprised about is the
is<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.470> disc<00:02:23.650> brakes<00:02:23.890> actually<00:02:25.380> I'm<00:02:26.380> still<00:02:26.560> on

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
is the disc brakes actually I'm still on

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.460 
is the disc brakes actually I'm still on
the<00:02:26.860> original<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.930> brake<00:02:28.930> pads<00:02:29.140> on<00:02:29.320> that

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
the original and brake pads on that

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.800 
the original and brake pads on that
which<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.800> quite<00:02:30.730> quite<00:02:31.150> surprising<00:02:31.690> really

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
which is quite quite surprising really

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.190 
which is quite quite surprising really
considering<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.800> mileage<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.580> do<00:02:34.090> do<00:02:34.420> town

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
considering the mileage and I do do town

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.710 
considering the mileage and I do do town
riding<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:35.950> there<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.460> fair<00:02:37.450> bit<00:02:37.600> of

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
riding so there is a fair bit of

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.220 
riding so there is a fair bit of
start/stop<00:02:39.030> towards<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.120> latter<00:02:40.270> part<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:41.050> my

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
start/stop towards the latter part of my

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.160 
start/stop towards the latter part of my
my<00:02:41.860> journey<00:02:42.100> which<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:43.300> know<00:02:43.390> nearly<00:02:43.810> twenty

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
my journey which you know nearly twenty

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.100 
my journey which you know nearly twenty
miles<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.440> day<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.650> think<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:45.460> don't<00:02:46.210> expect<00:02:46.540> I'd

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
miles a day I think I don't expect I'd

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.390 
miles a day I think I don't expect I'd
have<00:02:47.230> expected<00:02:47.320> those<00:02:47.770> to<00:02:47.920> wear<00:02:48.070> out<00:02:48.190> but

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
have expected those to wear out but

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.250

fronted raelia and it's required only a

small amount of adjustment over the five
thousand<00:03:08.560> miles<00:03:08.710> I<00:03:09.540> have<00:03:10.540> replaced<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.080> rear

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
thousand miles I have replaced the rear

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.260 
thousand miles I have replaced the rear
rear<00:03:11.920> wheel<00:03:12.780> only<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:14.110> couple<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.800> weeks<00:03:14.920> ago

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
rear wheel only a couple of weeks ago

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.160 
rear wheel only a couple of weeks ago
because<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:18.820> hub<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.540> bearings<00:03:20.080> on

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
because the the the hub the bearings on

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.540 
because the the the hub the bearings on
the<00:03:20.230> hub<00:03:20.380> were<00:03:20.560> were<00:03:21.010> knackered

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
the hub were were knackered

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.350 
the hub were were knackered
so<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:23.739> seems<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.820> fashion<00:03:25.180> these<00:03:25.300> days

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
so it seems that the fashion these days

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.810 
so it seems that the fashion these days
to<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.440> replace<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.950> wheel<00:03:27.190> rather<00:03:27.520> than<00:03:27.700> the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
to to replace the wheel rather than the

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.300 
to to replace the wheel rather than the
hole<00:03:28.060> rather<00:03:29.050> than<00:03:29.200> buy<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.380> new<00:03:29.770> home<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.100> have

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
hole rather than buy a new home and have

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.460 
hole rather than buy a new home and have
it<00:03:30.430> all<00:03:30.580> rebuilt<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.720> respect<00:03:32.430> I've<00:03:33.430> got<00:03:33.610> a

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
it all rebuilt and respect I've got a

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.470 
it all rebuilt and respect I've got a
matey<00:03:35.470> who<00:03:35.980> sorted<00:03:36.370> me<00:03:36.550> out<00:03:36.580> there<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.000> built

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
matey who sorted me out there and built

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.920 
matey who sorted me out there and built
the<00:03:37.570> wheel<00:03:37.690> up<00:03:37.870> for<00:03:38.110> me<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:40.150> wasn't<00:03:40.360> wasn't

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
the wheel up for me and it wasn't wasn't

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.900 
the wheel up for me and it wasn't wasn't
too<00:03:41.140> expensive<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:41.800> it's<00:03:42.130> not<00:03:42.310> worth<00:03:42.489> messing

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
too expensive so it's not worth messing

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.740 
too expensive so it's not worth messing
about<00:03:43.290> having<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.410> hub<00:03:44.950> rebuilt<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.750> just

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
better wheel it's a double skinned wheel

that's it really overall I'm pleased

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.450 
that's it really overall I'm pleased
with<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.400> bike<00:04:36.669> a<00:04:38.850> little<00:04:39.850> bit<00:04:41.460> disappointed

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
with the bike a little bit disappointed

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.779 
with the bike a little bit disappointed
in<00:04:42.580> in<00:04:42.880> some<00:04:43.240> of<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.449> cheaper<00:04:44.229> components<00:04:44.860> but

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
in in some of the cheaper components but

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.450 
in in some of the cheaper components but
you<00:04:46.570> know<00:04:46.660> I<00:04:46.690> think<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:47.800> do<00:04:47.949> get<00:04:48.160> what<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.430> pay

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
you know I think you do get what you pay

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.719 
you know I think you do get what you pay
for<00:04:48.639> I<00:04:48.880> think<00:04:49.770> this<00:04:50.770> was<00:04:51.250> a<00:04:51.280> particularly

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
for I think this was a particularly

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.100 
for I think this was a particularly
expensive<00:04:52.360> bike<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:54.340> retails<00:04:54.880> was<00:04:55.300> 550

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
expensive bike the retails was 550

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.990 
expensive bike the retails was 550
pounds<00:04:56.850> nearly<00:04:57.850> three<00:04:58.419> years<00:04:58.630> ago<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:59.610> so<00:05:00.610> you

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
pounds nearly three years ago and so you

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.510 
pounds nearly three years ago and so you
know<00:05:01.090> it's<00:05:01.660> there<00:05:02.380> are<00:05:02.470> more<00:05:02.710> expensive<00:05:03.160> bikes

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
know it's there are more expensive bikes

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.840 
know it's there are more expensive bikes
out<00:05:03.760> there<00:05:03.990> but<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.919> know<00:05:06.010> I<00:05:06.039> do<00:05:06.160> use<00:05:06.490> it<00:05:06.639> every

when<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:25.870> is<00:05:27.030> absolutely<00:05:28.030> naked<00:05:29.020> or<00:05:29.320> or<00:05:29.830> maybe

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
when it is absolutely naked or or maybe

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.129 
when it is absolutely naked or or maybe
look<00:05:30.250> at<00:05:30.400> something<00:05:30.729> like<00:05:30.789> a<00:05:30.910> specialized<00:05:31.479> but

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
look at something like a specialized but

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.159 
look at something like a specialized but
I<00:05:32.650> do<00:05:33.520> like<00:05:33.789> that<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.180> hybrid<00:05:34.539> style<00:05:34.810> is<00:05:35.139> a

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
I do like that the hybrid style is a

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.469 
I do like that the hybrid style is a
comfortable<00:05:36.160> comfortable<00:05:37.060> ride<00:05:37.360> I<00:05:37.650> can<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:39.479> can

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
comfortable comfortable ride I can I can

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.040 
comfortable comfortable ride I can I can
get<00:05:40.750> up<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.960> speeds<00:05:41.229> of<00:05:42.240> but<00:05:43.240> my<00:05:43.449> top<00:05:43.659> speed<00:05:43.780> is

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
get up to speeds of but my top speed is

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.290 
get up to speeds of but my top speed is
41<00:05:44.530> miles<00:05:44.680> an<00:05:44.889> hour<00:05:45.010> on<00:05:45.130> this<00:05:45.250> by<00:05:45.430> which<00:05:45.729> you

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
41 miles an hour on this by which you

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.110 
41 miles an hour on this by which you
knows<00:05:46.530> it's<00:05:47.530> fairly<00:05:47.800> yeah<00:05:48.130> fairly<00:05:48.639> quick<00:05:48.880> for

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
knows it's fairly yeah fairly quick for

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.879 
knows it's fairly yeah fairly quick for
for<00:05:49.690> something<00:05:49.870> that's<00:05:50.169> not<00:05:50.320> really<00:05:50.620> a<00:05:50.650> road

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
for something that's not really a road

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.240 
for something that's not really a road
bike<00:05:51.130> and<00:05:52.199> just<00:05:53.199> get<00:05:53.349> a<00:05:53.380> little<00:05:53.409> bit<00:05:53.740> unstable

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
bike and just get a little bit unstable

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.490 
bike and just get a little bit unstable
at<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.669> speed<00:05:54.970> but<00:05:55.210> you<00:05:55.840> know<00:05:55.960> motor<00:05:56.169> time

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
at that speed but you know motor time

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.939 
at that speed but you know motor time
I'm<00:05:56.650> averaging<00:05:57.130> about<00:05:58.139> between<00:05:59.139> 15<00:05:59.650> and<00:05:59.680> 80

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
I'm averaging about between 15 and 80

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.850 
I'm averaging about between 15 and 80
miles<00:06:00.280> an<00:06:00.430> hour<00:06:00.750> more<00:06:01.750> commuting<00:06:02.349> to<00:06:02.470> work<00:06:02.590> and

miles an hour more commuting to work and

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.839 
miles an hour more commuting to work and
it's<00:06:02.979> it's<00:06:03.820> absolutely<00:06:04.030> fine<00:06:04.419> I<00:06:04.479> can<00:06:05.340> you<00:06:06.340> ride

that quite comfortably for for you know

that quite comfortably for for you know
considerable<00:06:10.770> length<00:06:11.770> of<00:06:11.860> time<00:06:11.919> so

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330 
considerable length of time so

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.330 
considerable length of time so
and<00:06:14.590> overall<00:06:15.590> you<00:06:16.070> know<00:06:16.160> quite<00:06:16.550> quite<00:06:16.880> happy

well<00:06:19.340> that<00:06:19.520> we'll<00:06:19.730> see<00:06:19.880> what<00:06:20.000> it<00:06:20.060> looks<00:06:20.240> like

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
well that we'll see what it looks like

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.720 
well that we'll see what it looks like
in<00:06:20.630> another<00:06:20.990> 5,000<00:06:21.680> miles<00:06:21.830> which<00:06:22.760> is<00:06:22.910> but
