00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.340
 and here's another one of those situations in 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.490
 you don't really know what to do and yours 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 smartphone can save your life knows 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.820
 only he secret pleasure feel I don't know 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.520
 only thing around problem thanks anyway 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.890
 the fact is seen what that figure that 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.680
 does not do the world but let it be 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.820
 I really see this year will be 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.430
 completely out of phase 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.590
 but besides this there have been some 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.750
 taken up the lips apart 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.030
 the arbitration of the last matches is 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.479
 sure the bitten in the is learned 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.040
 shoulder no absurd thing and then there are those 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.559
 said that the balls are everything and in 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.600
 smash effects will be just like that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.629
 basically we will be on a path 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.280
 tracks that will lead us straight ahead 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.010
 through several rooms full of stuff 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.049
 fragile that can harm us or be 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.900
 help to survive the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.150
 our life as long as possible e 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.710
 our ammunition in this kind of 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.450
 shooters will be their balls 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.770
 big steel balls 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.270
 our goal will be to 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.460
 able to destroy them all with 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.680
 blue that we could be coming 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.200
 to our inventory 3 additional billy 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.240
 as I said earlier the marbles 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
 better to call them that will be the point 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.039
 of encounter between life and ammunition for a 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.049
 hit hit we'll get to 33 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.079
 ammunition in a cute game of 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.399
 risks and few waste rightly for 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.469
 be able to get as far as possible 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.299
 we will not only have to pay attention to 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.609
 send off our shots wasting 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.249
 fewer possible marbles but sheets of glass 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.869
 fixed or mobile will be our enemies e 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:50.100
 We'll have to clean up the road 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.109
 in front of us 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.240
 always with the utmost precision a 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:56.340
 shot too much and our game will have 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.630
 end also because going to collide 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.939
 against an obstacle 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.399
 it will mean losing in one shot great 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.289
 we will be part of our inventory 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.850
 thrifty to be able to better manage 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.439
 our treasure 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.690
 needless to say that the areas will become 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.910
 increasingly difficult obstacles always 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.740
 more insidious besides the positions of the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.870
 cones that will gradually become forever 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.909
 more hidden away 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.319
 been imposed very difficult to 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.030
 to reach 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.040
 also because our bodies will not be 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.140
 direct we should be able to guess for 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.110
 good distance to compensate 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.790
 the fall of our bullet the cones 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.930
 will not be the only targets from 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.849
 hit 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.500
 if we are lucky enough to 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.239
 our street we could find numerous 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.879
 power ups that will help us during the 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.680
 our run for the rooms like ad 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.659
 example endless balls for a period 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.120
 of limited time will be some of the 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.579
 bonuses that will help us more power 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.280
 up instead will be unlocked by hitting 10 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.440
 targets out of ten without making a smash 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.420
 hit because of its simplicity 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.250
 for the very minimalist design ed 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.049
 essential left much room for 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.690
 nice graphics and not so much 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.129
 heavy for our devices 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.349
 making the gaming experience pleasant 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.420
 and not just for the various effects of 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.980
 transparency of the glass but also of the shards 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.989
 who respond more or less 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.030
 realistic physics and impacts that 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.859
 we are going to produce the title is 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.409
 available as by now almost happens 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.359
 always both for android and for iphone e 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.060
 although the software house that produces it 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.519
 call the game mediocre instead 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.380
 far from it and it will be ideal for those 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.120
 short moments in which to take your own 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.099
 smartphone will always be better than 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.099
 turn your thumbs or look at the wall 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.260
 but in short never even read info of 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.829
 champion vera but leave it alone but how much 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.239
 I'm p 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:44.220
 but something of a very serious career 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.379
 there was a little but the champions 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.280
 league and the champions league luca ma le 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.280
 in short, new formations 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.280
 the castle
