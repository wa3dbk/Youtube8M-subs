00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.339
 inaugurated one week cycle 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.649
 in the south of São Paulo is the target of 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.559
 controversy between cyclists and 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.840
 neighborhood merchants 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.940
 the exclusive track for bicycles have 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.310
 approximately three kilometers is 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.710
 located in stretches of some streets and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.109
 avenues of moema district of the south zone of 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.910
 The capital of São Paulo is not 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.099
 use restricted to public holidays and 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.939
 bicycles have a track 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.399
 exclusive 24 hours a day changes 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.230
 in the road structure ended up affecting the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.660
 day to day for those who come here 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.780
 neighborhood resident for 30 years the colonel 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.370
 from pm josé fragoso did not like it 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.809
 according to him the acronym band is 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.030
 contributing to increase 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.640
 in traffic jams we did not 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.879
 There is justification for the shea 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.120
 cycles on preferred routes 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.940
 called fast flow 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.559
 Look, we already have two 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.379
 holy villain love the avenue 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.719
 ibirapuera and just in the alone 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.909
 put the x the conversation was easy 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.560
 cyclist willian cruz creator of the blog 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.510
 going to bike disagrees 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.610
 according to him the routes chosen are the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.080
 the neighborhood and easy to reach 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.900
 to cyclists 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.820
 another problem is related to the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.400
 parking of vehicles because of the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.290
 cycle to the vacancies for the zone 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.360
 South that once stood here had to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.610
 be moved and are now 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.939
 literally in the middle of the track 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.829
 in this aspect, drivers and cyclists 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.320
 agree that the solution can 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.500
 contribute to increasing the risks of 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.079
 accidents in the distance between the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.079
 cycle path and the parking space is 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.180
 minimum and the open car door 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.790
 invading the exclusive track of 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.590
 bikes and the fastest solution and more 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.840
 effective for this situation that people 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.119
 here is make the vacancies of blue zone 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.930
 on the right side of the track because on the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.640
 right 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.439
 You can already park in certain 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.030
 then we could do 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.469
 yes at certain times of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.450
 functioning is free and in others 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.890
 blue zone and to solve the problem 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.790
 parking the problem of opening 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.250
 door too 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.500
 In addition, drivers complain about 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.840
 asked for signaling many end up finding 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.910
 that cars parked in the blue zone 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.320
 they are standing in traffic 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.780
 I am now stopped that I thought that only 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.670
 want a queue of cars and it is not the 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.770
 cars are standing here left for 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.020
 shopping is in the middle of the street 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.880
 some traders fear losing 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.030
 customers with the lack of vacancies 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.040
 parking the way they did in 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.890
 blue zone on the side of the mountain range 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.900
 in the middle of the street so you think 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.390
 old person who comes in the office 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.890
 doctor over here for the car she has to 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.690
 down in the middle of the street 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.239
 marcelo sampaio director of relations 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.820
 of the residents' association says 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.880
 that the entity is not against the cycle track 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.280
 but the way it was planned we 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.660
 against us attacked the way the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.570
 prefecture does the interventions 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.850
 in the neighborhood and in the city of 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.010
 Paulo are whole we think should 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.989
 there is public consultation in the 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.880
 society must participate in the preparation 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.620
 of the urban project 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.410
 many cyclists are mobilizing 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.500
 with a petition in a protest at the 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.970
 next Saturday in favor of ciclofaixa 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.459
 they were motivated by the statements 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.260
 from a neighborhood merchant to the press 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.470
 she said that her millionaire clients 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.170
 they did not walk in high heels and 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.350
 protest organized through the websites is 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.060
 called bike millionaires and the boys 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.620
 They are willing to come well dressed and 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.660
 jump to show that it's possible for you 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.500
