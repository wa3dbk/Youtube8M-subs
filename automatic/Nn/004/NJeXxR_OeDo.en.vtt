00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Halli hello Mr. Peter joas logs 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.700
 today once again to word 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.760
 Today we show you how we do this 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.110
 have made a nail picture yourself 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.540
 You need it first 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.420
 at least 112 millimeters thick board 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.130
 We have a savings letter from here 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.359
 Baumarkt taken which are actually 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.170
 also super cheap that has maybe 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:29.250
 cost two euros we have it on then 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.750
 the size 50 x 50 cm then cut 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.059
 it takes her color around the board too 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.980
 prime it or if it suits you 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.630
 Of course, pros do not like to 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.630
 to paint 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.270
 then your template we have here see 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.340
 a peace sign and something around 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.960
 possibly to fix the peace sign 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.880
 sets out bin is thick and you there 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.030
 outside, or better, it is better 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.210
 you set it then you need it all 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.330
 quite a lot of nails we have 20 x 40 here 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.480
 mm nails and of course a hammer 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.190
 ours looks great or and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.900
 Of course the role is colorful here 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.930
 Wool chosen for the peace sign 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.060
 as colorful as it is then comes 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.680
 first your plate in your color 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.280
 we have a very close match here 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280
 chosen 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.670
 when you are done with it and the color 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.460
 you can really dry them 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.030
 Template lay on it with the nails 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.030
 to begin 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.619
 the nails always beat you in about 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.200
 one and a half centimeters distance into the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.680
 so firm that she has just so 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.680
 hold 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.020
 It is important that he always in the 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.020
 Insertion points insert 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.290
 the finished with the template traveled 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.230
 simply and in peace sign out that 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.180
 he just continues to travel too many 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.230
 unfortunately we do not have that right now 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.570
 video because the memory powder than us 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.540
 have done that and we unfortunately 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.980
 did not notice 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.440
 now you can actually already with the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.690
 roll starts to knot you roll the role 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.959
 Just hang on to a nail and start 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.080
 I just say it with the cobweb 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.270
 Just criss-cross like him 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.750
 just want to just watch it 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.520
 that they really only in the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.970
 interior good sign the role 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.970
 play 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.380
 and you're done with peace 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.100
 sign is actually super easy and 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.140
 very nice 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.940
 you can of course also any 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.730
 other motives for example take 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.710
 In the fall or a bird we have here 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.710
 of course a nice risk 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.030
 that was it for many thanks 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.510
 look and see you hopefully 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.510
 back soon
