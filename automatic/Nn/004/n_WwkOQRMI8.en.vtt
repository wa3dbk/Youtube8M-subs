to<00:00:04.650> you<00:00:04.770> about<00:00:04.890> side<00:00:05.610> welds<00:00:06.560> now<00:00:08.389> many<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.480> you

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
to you about side welds now many of you

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.239 
to you about side welds now many of you
saw<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.870> side<00:00:10.139> wolves<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.589> used<00:00:10.799> on<00:00:10.980> these

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:11.249 
saw the side wolves that I used on these

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:13.100 
saw the side wolves that I used on these
sleeves<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.999> notice<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.389> they're<00:00:12.929> little

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
sleeves and notice that they're little

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.560 
sleeves and notice that they're little
chunky<00:00:13.530> no<00:00:14.490> that's<00:00:14.669> because<00:00:15.059> these<00:00:15.269> were<00:00:15.419> made

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
chunky no that's because these were made

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.310 
chunky no that's because these were made
a<00:00:16.130> little<00:00:17.130> bit<00:00:17.220> roughly<00:00:17.610> it<00:00:17.880> was<00:00:18.030> made<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.140> make

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
a little bit roughly it was made to make

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.290 
a little bit roughly it was made to make
another<00:00:19.830> proof<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.220> concept<00:00:20.640> model<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
another proof of concept model for the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.690 
another proof of concept model for the
vibrant<00:00:21.870> printing<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.830> artwork<00:00:23.250> which<00:00:23.460> as

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:23.700 
vibrant printing of the artwork which as

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.690 
vibrant printing of the artwork which as
you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.210> see<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.920> is<00:00:25.920> some<00:00:26.280> vibrat<00:00:26.700> printing

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
you can see that is some vibrat printing

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.479 
you can see that is some vibrat printing
well<00:00:29.700> I<00:00:29.940> have<00:00:30.180> here<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.750> my<00:00:30.780> hand<00:00:31.489> another

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
well I have here in my hand another

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.340 
well I have here in my hand another
production<00:00:32.820> model<00:00:33.179> this<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.600> purely<00:00:34.050> for

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
production model this one is purely for

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.079 
production model this one is purely for
the<00:00:34.379> side<00:00:34.620> welds<00:00:35.929> now<00:00:36.929> ignore<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.909> the

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.089 
the side welds now ignore some of the

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:40.549 
the side welds now ignore some of the
little<00:00:39.239> imperfections<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.350> little

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
little imperfections like this little

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.619 
little imperfections like this little
band<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.280> that's<00:00:41.489> only<00:00:41.670> because<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.269> had<00:00:42.539> to

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
band here that's only because I had to

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.509 
band here that's only because I had to
use<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.839> bit<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.409> do-it-yourself<00:00:44.070> rig<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
use a bit of a do-it-yourself rig to

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.689 
use a bit of a do-it-yourself rig to
test<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:44.850> methodology<00:00:45.569> behind<00:00:45.659> this<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
test the methodology behind this and

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.770 
test the methodology behind this and
figure<00:00:47.699> out<00:00:47.819> what<00:00:48.030> kind<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> machine<00:00:48.629> i'm

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
figure out what kind of machine i'm

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.309 
figure out what kind of machine i'm
going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:49.050> making<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.769> final<00:00:50.039> project

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
going to be making for the final project

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:55.610 
going to be making for the final project
now<00:00:53.120> what<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.359> here<00:00:54.749> around<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.260> edge<00:00:55.350> is

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
now what I have here around the edge is

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.680 
now what I have here around the edge is
about<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.859> one<00:00:56.129> sixteenth<00:00:56.729> of<00:00:56.850> an<00:00:56.969> inch<00:00:57.059> lip

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
about a one sixteenth of an inch lip

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.709 
about a one sixteenth of an inch lip
that<00:00:58.499> will<00:00:58.829> stay<00:00:59.100> there<00:00:59.339> a<00:00:59.489> little<00:00:59.579> bar<00:01:00.329> not<00:01:00.569> so

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that will stay there a little bar not so

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.090 
that will stay there a little bar not so
much<00:01:01.699> instead<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.729> doing<00:01:02.819> a<00:01:03.420> weld<00:01:04.079> only<00:01:04.829> on<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
much instead of doing a weld only on the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.819 
much instead of doing a weld only on the
edges<00:01:05.579> leaving<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.509> know<00:01:06.659> very<00:01:07.380> little

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
edges leaving you know very little

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.359 
edges leaving you know very little
contact<00:01:08.670> space<00:01:08.939> that's<00:01:09.210> fused<00:01:09.890> I've<00:01:10.890> got<00:01:11.159> an

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
contact space that's fused I've got an

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.350 
contact space that's fused I've got an
edge<00:01:12.329> around<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.960> sleeve<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.969> solid

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
edge around the sleeve that is a solid

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.830 
edge around the sleeve that is a solid
chunk<00:01:15.539> of<00:01:15.659> plastic<00:01:16.250> you're<00:01:17.250> clear<00:01:17.939> layer<00:01:18.149> your

chunk of plastic you're clear layer your

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.420 
chunk of plastic you're clear layer your
printed<00:01:19.350> layer<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.799> then<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:20.039> laminate

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
printed layer and then your laminate

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.709 
printed layer and then your laminate
layer<00:01:20.640> are<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.630> fused<00:01:22.079> into<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:22.590> solid<00:01:23.039> piece

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
layer are all fused into one solid piece

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.910 
layer are all fused into one solid piece
that<00:01:24.719> means<00:01:24.899> that<00:01:25.079> your<00:01:25.200> laminate<00:01:25.590> will<00:01:25.770> not

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
that means that your laminate will not

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.440 
that means that your laminate will not
peel<00:01:26.250> off<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.990> means<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.320> oh<00:01:29.240> well<00:01:30.240> sleep

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
peel off that means that oh well sleep

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.450 
peel off that means that oh well sleep
