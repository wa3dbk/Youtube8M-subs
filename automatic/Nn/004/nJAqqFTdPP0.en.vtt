your<00:02:20.130> hair<00:02:20.370> through<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:23.090> like<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.240> guess<00:02:24.420> where

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
your hair through the like I guess where

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.300 
your hair through the like I guess where
the<00:02:24.840> holes<00:02:25.050> are<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:26.610> kind<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.830> blend<00:02:28.830> your<00:02:29.070> hair

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
the holes are to kind of blend your hair

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.780 
the holes are to kind of blend your hair
with<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.150> extensions<00:02:30.660> even<00:02:31.050> more<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
with the extensions even more so that

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.640 
with the extensions even more so that
takes<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.270> place<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.570> what<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.140> would<00:02:34.320> do<00:02:34.470> if

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
takes the place of what you would do if

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.180 
takes the place of what you would do if
you<00:02:34.830> were<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.610> use<00:02:35.910> separate<00:02:36.480> tracks<00:02:37.190> and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
you were to like use separate tracks and

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.070 
you were to like use separate tracks and
spaced<00:02:38.640> them<00:02:38.940> out<00:02:39.060> by<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.540> parting<00:02:39.960> your

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
spaced them out by like parting your

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.980 
spaced them out by like parting your
hair<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.600> anyway<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:43.910> just<00:02:44.910> went<00:02:45.570> ahead<00:02:45.630> and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
hair so anyway I just went ahead and

clipped<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:47.430> clipped<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.770> extension<00:02:49.770> too

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
clipped you clipped the extension too

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.420 
clipped you clipped the extension too
close<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> part<00:02:51.800> using<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.220> clips

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
close to the part using just the clips

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.250 
close to the part using just the clips
at<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.580> top<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.030> as<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.240> can<00:02:54.390> see<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.870> kind<00:02:55.110> of

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
at the top and as you can see I kind of

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.400 
at the top and as you can see I kind of
messed<00:02:55.620> up<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.070> first<00:02:56.280> time<00:02:56.550> around<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:57.410> had

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
messed up the first time around I had

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.760 
messed up the first time around I had
like<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.710> little<00:02:58.950> hole<00:02:59.250> so<00:03:00.090> I'm<00:03:00.510> unclipping<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
like a little hole so I'm unclipping and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.530 
like a little hole so I'm unclipping and
I'm<00:03:02.730> reek<00:03:03.150> lipping<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:07.880> I'm<00:03:08.880> gonna<00:03:09.120> get<00:03:09.390> it

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
I'm reek lipping so I'm gonna get it

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.480 
I'm reek lipping so I'm gonna get it
though<00:03:09.720> eventually<00:03:10.320> it's<00:03:10.470> my<00:03:10.770> first<00:03:11.070> time

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.310 

this<00:03:14.490> is<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:15.210> was<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.780> kind<00:03:15.990> of<00:03:16.050> amazed

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
this is like I was just kind of amazed

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.160 
this is like I was just kind of amazed
at<00:03:16.530> how<00:03:16.620> easy<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:17.100> was<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.670> put<00:03:18.510> these<00:03:18.690> in<00:03:18.870> I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
at how easy it was to put these in I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.720 
at how easy it was to put these in I
mean<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.740> guess<00:03:20.010> it's<00:03:20.190> not<00:03:20.310> rocket<00:03:20.580> science

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
mean I guess it's not rocket science

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.480 
mean I guess it's not rocket science
you're<00:03:21.180> just<00:03:21.330> clipping<00:03:21.600> hair<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.200> your<00:03:22.460> to<00:03:23.460> a

you're just clipping hair to your to a
part<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.480> just<00:03:24.990> kind<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.290> I've<00:03:25.620> never<00:03:25.830> done

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
part but I just kind of I've never done

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.670 
part but I just kind of I've never done
it<00:03:26.130> before<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.670> was<00:03:26.820> nervous<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.960> there<00:03:28.560> it

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680

is fully clipped in and it's kind of

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.020 
is fully clipped in and it's kind of
ratty<00:03:34.050> because<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.740> needs<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:34.980> be<00:03:35.130> combed<00:03:35.460> but

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
ratty because it needs to be combed but

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.150

I'm<00:03:36.420> just<00:03:36.690> gonna<00:03:36.840> pull<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.470> tug<00:03:37.800> it<00:03:37.980> to

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
I'm just gonna pull it and tug it to

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
I'm just gonna pull it and tug it to
make<00:03:38.370> sure<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:38.820> on<00:03:39.000> there<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.840> then<00:03:41.180> it's

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
make sure it's on there and then it's

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.480 
make sure it's on there and then it's
time<00:03:42.420> for<00:03:42.450> me<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.840> comb<00:03:43.140> my<00:03:43.470> hair<00:03:43.680> through<00:03:44.280> and

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
time for me to comb my hair through and

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.699 
time for me to comb my hair through and
try<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.730> blend<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.209> in<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:45.690> as<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.230> can<00:03:46.350> see<00:03:46.560> my

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
try to blend it in so as you can see my

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.320 
try to blend it in so as you can see my
hair<00:03:46.890> is<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.370> front<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.820> not<00:03:48.030> really

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
hair is in the front is not really

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.180 
hair is in the front is not really
blending<00:03:48.720> because<00:03:48.990> it's<00:03:49.170> not<00:03:49.440> super<00:03:49.680> straight

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
blending because it's not super straight

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:58.370 
blending because it's not super straight
and<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.730> I'm<00:03:54.180> going<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:56.720> probably<00:03:57.720> need<00:03:58.200> to

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
and so I'm going to probably need to

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.199 
and so I'm going to probably need to
Flatiron<00:03:58.980> even<00:03:59.459> though<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.580> don't<00:03:59.700> want<00:03:59.850> to

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
Flatiron it just a little bit to blend

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.530 
Flatiron it just a little bit to blend
it<00:04:02.880> in<00:04:05.630> because<00:04:06.630> right<00:04:07.140> now<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.560> looks<00:04:07.590> crazy

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
I have stopped wearing my hair straight

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.720 
I have stopped wearing my hair straight
it's<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.020> combination<00:04:43.350> of<00:04:43.710> things<00:04:43.950> number<00:04:44.430> one

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
it's a combination of things number one

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.860 
it's a combination of things number one
in<00:04:45.240> Atlanta

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
in Atlanta

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.760 
in Atlanta
it's<00:04:46.200> just<00:04:46.530> humid<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:48.570> air<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:49.020> moist<00:04:49.229> and

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
it's just humid and the air is moist and

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.280 
it's just humid and the air is moist and
my<00:04:50.010> hair<00:04:50.190> just<00:04:50.400> doesn't<00:04:50.729> stay<00:04:50.880> straight<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.860> -

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
my hair just doesn't stay straight and -

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.170 
my hair just doesn't stay straight and -
since<00:04:55.290> I've<00:04:55.500> been<00:04:55.770> wearing<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.430> curly<00:04:56.880> again

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
since I've been wearing it curly again

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.740 
since I've been wearing it curly again
like<00:04:57.479> I<00:04:57.600> said<00:04:57.840> earlier<00:04:58.229> it<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:59.550> not<00:05:00.450> even

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
like I said earlier it it's not even

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.740 
like I said earlier it it's not even
trained<00:05:01.110> anymore<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:02.430> by<00:05:03.030> trained<00:05:03.389> I<00:05:03.570> mean

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
trained anymore and by trained I mean

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.080 
trained anymore and by trained I mean
it's<00:05:03.930> not<00:05:04.080> heat<00:05:04.410> damaged<00:05:04.860> anymore<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:05.700> it<00:05:05.850> just

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
it's not heat damaged anymore so it just

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.469 
it's not heat damaged anymore so it just
doesn't<00:05:06.650> it's<00:05:07.650> not<00:05:08.090> automatically<00:05:09.090> straight

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
doesn't it's not automatically straight

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.620 
doesn't it's not automatically straight
like<00:05:09.720> it<00:05:09.900> before<00:05:10.590> it<00:05:11.220> would<00:05:11.400> be<00:05:11.669> I<00:05:12.030> didn't<00:05:12.510> have

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
like it before it would be I didn't have

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.210 
like it before it would be I didn't have
to<00:05:12.720> use<00:05:12.810> very<00:05:12.990> much<00:05:13.200> heat<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.710> my<00:05:13.860> hair<00:05:14.070> would

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
to use very much heat and my hair would

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.909 
to use very much heat and my hair would
get<00:05:14.340> straight<00:05:14.700> you<00:05:15.479> know<00:05:15.600> pretty<00:05:16.200> easily<00:05:16.470> now

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
get straight you know pretty easily now

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.370 
get straight you know pretty easily now
you<00:05:17.460> know<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:18.210> gets<00:05:18.389> straightened<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.169> then

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
you know it gets straightened and then

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.650 
you know it gets straightened and then
like<00:05:19.680> an<00:05:19.950> hour<00:05:20.100> later<00:05:20.460> it's<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:20.850> poof<00:05:21.090> ball<00:05:21.330> so

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
like an hour later it's a poof ball so

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.200 
like an hour later it's a poof ball so
anyway<00:05:22.590> I'm<00:05:22.770> running<00:05:23.039> the<00:05:23.460> flat<00:05:23.669> iron<00:05:23.880> across

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
anyway I'm running the flat iron across

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.090 
anyway I'm running the flat iron across
my<00:05:24.479> hair<00:05:24.690> to<00:05:24.900> kind<00:05:25.110> of<00:05:25.169> blend<00:05:25.380> it<00:05:25.590> in<00:05:25.710> a<00:05:25.740> little

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
my hair to kind of blend it in a little

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:34.010 
my hair to kind of blend it in a little
bit<00:05:26.780> better<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:31.039> once<00:05:32.039> I'm<00:05:32.250> done<00:05:32.280> with<00:05:32.520> that<00:05:33.020> I

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
bit better and once I'm done with that I

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.320 
bit better and once I'm done with that I
think<00:05:34.770> I'm<00:05:34.890> pretty<00:05:35.130> much<00:05:35.280> done<00:05:35.550> so<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:36.180> was

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
think I'm pretty much done so that was

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.279 
think I'm pretty much done so that was
really<00:05:36.630> easy<00:05:36.900> and<00:05:37.669> I<00:05:38.669> think<00:05:39.510> this<00:05:39.660> would<00:05:40.229> be

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
really easy and I think this would be

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.020 
really easy and I think this would be
really<00:05:40.710> cool<00:05:40.890> if<00:05:41.100> my<00:05:41.280> hair<00:05:41.520> was<00:05:41.760> super

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
really cool if my hair was super

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.340 
really cool if my hair was super
straight<00:05:43.700> for<00:05:44.700> like<00:05:45.360> a<00:05:45.390> fun<00:05:45.720> night<00:05:45.900> out<00:05:45.960> if<00:05:46.260> I

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
straight for like a fun night out if I

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.770 
straight for like a fun night out if I
wanted<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:46.919> add<00:05:47.160> a<00:05:47.700> little<00:05:48.030> bit<00:05:48.210> more<00:05:48.419> glam<00:05:48.750> a

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
wanted to add a little bit more glam a

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.920 
wanted to add a little bit more glam a
little<00:05:49.470> bit<00:05:49.620> more<00:05:49.860> fullness<00:05:50.460> or<00:05:50.880> volume<00:05:51.539> to<00:05:51.810> my

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
little bit more fullness or volume to my

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.120 
little bit more fullness or volume to my
hair<00:05:52.580> I<00:05:53.580> could<00:05:54.510> snap<00:05:54.900> these<00:05:55.169> bad<00:05:55.410> boys<00:05:55.650> in<00:05:55.890> and

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
hair I could snap these bad boys in and

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.270 
hair I could snap these bad boys in and
took<00:05:56.280> five<00:05:56.669> minutes<00:05:56.940> to<00:05:57.210> put<00:05:57.450> it<00:05:57.539> in<00:05:57.950> and<00:05:58.950> be<00:05:59.160> on

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
took five minutes to put it in and be on

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:09.350 
took five minutes to put it in and be on
my<00:05:59.310> way<00:05:59.520> I<00:06:05.000> don't<00:06:06.000> know<00:06:06.780> that<00:06:08.060> I'm<00:06:09.060> somebody

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
my way I don't know that I'm somebody

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.650 
my way I don't know that I'm somebody
who<00:06:09.750> would<00:06:10.200> be<00:06:10.380> who<00:06:10.740> would<00:06:10.919> wear<00:06:11.160> the<00:06:12.090> clip-ins

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 
who would be who would wear the clip-ins

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.440 
who would be who would wear the clip-ins
all<00:06:12.780> the<00:06:13.200> time<00:06:14.520> my<00:06:15.030> hair<00:06:15.419> is<00:06:15.860> fairly<00:06:16.860> long<00:06:17.450> on

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
all the time my hair is fairly long on

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:25.279 
all the time my hair is fairly long on
its<00:06:18.690> own<00:06:18.930> and<00:06:20.150> I<00:06:22.400> this<00:06:23.400> hair<00:06:24.060> is<00:06:24.419> actually<00:06:25.050> too

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
its own and I this hair is actually too

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.360 
its own and I this hair is actually too
long<00:06:25.530> for<00:06:25.860> me<00:06:25.979> believe<00:06:26.310> it<00:06:26.430> or<00:06:26.550> not

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
long for me believe it or not

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.879 
long for me believe it or not
I<00:06:27.550> would<00:06:28.389> probably<00:06:28.600> want<00:06:28.930> to<00:06:29.139> cut<00:06:29.410> it<00:06:29.530> a<00:06:29.680> little

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
I would probably want to cut it a little

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.450 
I would probably want to cut it a little
bit<00:06:30.300> to<00:06:31.300> make<00:06:31.750> it<00:06:31.960> just<00:06:32.139> maybe<00:06:32.740> an<00:06:32.979> inch<00:06:33.190> or<00:06:33.400> so

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
bit to make it just maybe an inch or so

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.150 
bit to make it just maybe an inch or so
longer<00:06:34.419> than<00:06:34.600> my<00:06:34.720> hair<00:06:34.960> it's<00:06:35.440> about<00:06:35.770> four

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
longer than my hair it's about four

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.310 
longer than my hair it's about four
inches<00:06:36.669> longer<00:06:36.910> than<00:06:37.060> my<00:06:37.330> hair<00:06:37.600> four<00:06:38.020> or<00:06:38.139> five

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
inches longer than my hair four or five

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.730 
inches longer than my hair four or five
inches<00:06:38.650> I'm<00:06:39.370> longer<00:06:39.610> than<00:06:39.850> my<00:06:39.940> hair<00:06:40.210> so<00:06:40.930> I

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
inches I'm longer than my hair so I

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.950 
inches I'm longer than my hair so I
think<00:06:42.729> that<00:06:43.090> I<00:06:43.120> would<00:06:43.360> like<00:06:43.540> it<00:06:43.690> to<00:06:43.810> be<00:06:43.840> a

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
think that I would like it to be a

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.480 
think that I would like it to be a
little<00:06:44.229> bit<00:06:44.380> closer<00:06:44.620> to<00:06:44.889> the<00:06:44.979> length<00:06:45.190> of<00:06:45.370> my

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
little bit closer to the length of my

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.930 
little bit closer to the length of my
hair<00:06:45.729> but<00:06:46.030> just<00:06:46.090> add<00:06:46.540> volume<00:06:47.520> and<00:06:48.520> fullness

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
hair but just add volume and fullness

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.090 
hair but just add volume and fullness
because<00:06:49.330> my<00:06:49.449> hair<00:06:49.630> is<00:06:49.720> really<00:06:49.900> fine<00:06:50.229> and<00:06:50.530> then

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
because my hair is really fine and then

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.960 
because my hair is really fine and then
I<00:06:51.490> think<00:06:52.479> that<00:06:52.860> as<00:06:53.860> far<00:06:53.919> as<00:06:54.130> the<00:06:54.310> texture<00:06:54.729> goes

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
I think that as far as the texture goes

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.469 
I think that as far as the texture goes
it<00:06:55.360> does<00:06:55.750> blend<00:06:56.050> with<00:06:56.260> my<00:06:56.380> hair<00:06:56.590> very<00:06:56.620> well

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
it does blend with my hair very well

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.610 
it does blend with my hair very well
except<00:06:58.479> that<00:06:58.630> my<00:06:58.750> hair<00:06:58.930> is<00:06:59.020> just<00:06:59.169> not<00:06:59.380> getting

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
except that my hair is just not getting
