00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.780
 very good everyone if you are and guys 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.010
 welcome a video so to speak 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.200
 special in the channel because you know 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.340
 that's good lately I'm not much for 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.860
 puppets because if I'm working 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.300
 I'm really doubting the devil 3 and 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.680
 how good this game was I wanted to 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.119
 show you the change a bit in case 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.650
 someone has the devil and is 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.119
 interested in having more space and 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.500
 all that you have a link the description 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.119
 of a page that I found in which 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.440
 makes us a small search between 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.000
 all the pages and we look for the most 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.370
 cheap if they have it available 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.170
 directly we decided the copy almost to 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.309
 instantly so I recommend that if 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.690
 you want to buy and get the new 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.280
 expansion of this game right now 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.750
 will teach what attracts a new you have a 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.920
 link to description so good without more 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.929
 guys let's start a bit with the theme 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.699
 because the truth that I played this game 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.859
 on your way out 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.210
 I started a lot but I had a failure and 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.519
 is that the game like that was staying 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.749
 too poor at first not 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.219
 that he had the theme of the house of 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:00.589
 auctions that made the game 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.289
 turn into an extreme drug it 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.970
 there was a bit that did not finish the 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.260
 everything not to curdle and in fact in this 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.570
 expansion has improved many things 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.100
 they have already fixed those books that had the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.840
 game for good walks are also not box and 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100
 not those failures that made the game 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.720
 will get worse and that our experience 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.920
 it was worse so good for all that 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.100
 people who have the devil that does have 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.320
 a lot of desire 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.820
 I have to tell you that the game deserves 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.590
 sorry not as well I say and at the beginning I 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.270
 I bored me what happened once and then all 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.409
 the time repeat and repeat but good 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.210
 how well are you seeing the issue of 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.610
 auction house has finally ended or 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.380
 be there is no more auction house in the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.780
 Devil can not do anything about 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.270
 business either with real money or with 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.970
 money from games all you get 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.320
 of equipment is what you get is for you 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.820
 work so to speak that either 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.170
 I work because the truth is that I 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.820
 step pipe playing and it's a game that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.170
 right now he has a lot of chicha like that 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.119
 how good this will be one of the first 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.619
 changes in which all the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.300
 theme of the house auctions because abyss 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.740
 no longer exists can not bring more than 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.020
 with the players that you have in game 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.670
 and then we have a new the verve that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.380
 it's called crossed that in fact now 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.580
 same is the character that I am most 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.840
 using in that I have a hunter 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.119
 demons also to 70 that as well is 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.159
 you are watching played little 54 is this going 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.750
 seriously there are people who doubt very much and 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.220
 has an exaggerated amount of works 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.479
 but I'm going to show you a little 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.009
 because we see here I have the barbarian who 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.540
 It was a bit of a shame but my character 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.000
 main in this case would be the crusader 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.470
 ok this would diego that the truth that 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.610
 is super epic in fact I'll be a 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.830
 little the team so that you see it to see 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.269
 where it is in fact they will have departure but 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.470
 well before bringing game I have to 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.520
 tell them how you are seeing me here is 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.970
 branded 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.710
 the flechita one level 67 level of legend 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.180
 this means that when we get to the 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.700
 maximum level because an expansion brings 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.120
 as well as new methods of the auction 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.800
 and others have been added level 70 10 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.540
 levels more and apart we have gotten a 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.620
 level of legend what does this mean? 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.930
 for people who also played lykov 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.980
 laws is the master's system that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.110
 well all this I'll explain 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.880
 better in game the subject of the levels of 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.050
 legend and that you vertical that have gotten 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.330
 not good in this case in this expansion 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.420
 have put a new act what would be the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.180
 act 5 is short but it's very good very 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.940
 fun and has its cinematics their 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.490
 voices in Spanish is all perfect and 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.440
 eager to play but really what 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.120
 what is devil comes after level 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.800
 70 and after you pass the game and it's 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.450
 because you see then he has gotten something that I 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.580
 I think it was really necessary that it's a 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.150
 adventure mode in this case there are 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.530
 several modes I forgive several modes and 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.030
 I also sent the issue of the 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.710
 difficulty that also by step because 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.180
 I want to explain so many things to you that 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.310
 final I wouldiam had not left me 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.720
 because the legends frames in short 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.130
 this case would be the normal difficulties 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.180
 difficult expert teacher minds that before 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.989
 I was 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.040
 but do not fall into difficulties 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.870
 very rare if in this case we have normal 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.040
 difficult expert that these do not have a 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.780
 bar as you see seen that has 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.700
 torment down to the left normal 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.310
 difficult to come, it also explains what 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.319
 bonus has every difficulty if we go 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.090
 to torment we have here a bar that 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.219
 although we are moving it is increasing 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.230
 the bonus of extra gold and experience 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.760
 that we have extra monsters in 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.290
 this case which in torments is 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.180
 absolutely madness bears there is no 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.739
 god that I killed those bugs and so 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.719
 I will teach how the 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.849
 topic with let's say at level 70 in mode 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.470
 torment 1 we get all the 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.419
 heading this finds the moment with the 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.500
 to close mod adventure and we join 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.730
 a safe game there are people 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.439
 going on and I'm going to explain 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.269
 the video and I'm going to leave you a little 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.129
 half but good the truth is that I had 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.750
 want to show you a bit about the subject and 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.129
 offer you already know that whenever I see 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.719
 interesting things I like to bring them to 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.639
 channel and apart from poking a bit of 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:20.130
 variety not that it is not bad that both 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.690
 game 18 and bain craft because the ship 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.310
 cited for the devil is not bad and good 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.130
 if you like a lot in case you would be interested 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.750
 would upload videos from ekiza better for 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.889
 teach the team that I have others but 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.130
 well in this case we would be here at 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.539
 way one we have in adventure mode and 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.780
 adventure mode we have several things to 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.610
 do 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.230
 we can make contracts that are called 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.240
 who are like these missions for the 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.040
 people that are totally random and 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.110
 with that they would give us some objects when 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.910
 we finish everything all the missions is 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.620
 say you are with friends, you want to play 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.440
 all because I light each one myself by 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.389
 example here I pray here and your friend 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.290
 there each one we complete the mission and 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.340
 when we finish with all the 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.470
 contracts that are all these 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.540
 exclamations would give us a cube that 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.910
 brings arms and quad even this cubital 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.010
 here also puts a stash now trico 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.630
 that brings a lot of objects already 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.130
 let's give another type of object that 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.450
 they open a thing called faults and 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.490
 like the valence faults that left me 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.320
 Quite cited the name opens this 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.300
 disc deneuve german what it is is that 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.840
 generates a kind of world that in that 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.360
 world 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.410
 we have a lot of fu with him because of 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.669
 made me change this life because the 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.490
 I have bad libya for you will have to say of 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.810
 value with the critic is because it opens a 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.460
 totally random world and load a 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.860
 bar that is when we kill bugs 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.479
 each bar already appears a box 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.190
 random game and of course this is 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.630
 can do different difficulties and the 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.400
 truth is that it is very very fun to 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.630
 play and good as well you are watching 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.030
 apart from these two things that I have 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.470
 explained the theme of the legend level 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.460
 As you can see, there are different 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.560
 levels is 358 161 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.220
 in short the game does not stop receiving 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.410
 experience of previous level then in 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.180
 this case is useful because our character 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.099
 has legend levels this is for 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.349
 all the characters and we can upload 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:55.789
 a few small attributes that what they do 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.530
 it's a little motivating to anyone 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.449
 truth is that this is pretty good 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.490
 thought not because of the theme of I'm still playing 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:02.930
 and I keep rising level little by little 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.319
 therefore it is very very but very 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.699
 all right 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.449
 from here you can upload damage hit 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:10.009
 critical in short we have different subtle 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:12.080
 possibilities to focus on our hero 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.250
 or character in fact they also teach us 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.199
 a little bit the team so you can see 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.150
 have more legendary have improved 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.410
 also the issue of the sale of weapons 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.330
 in this case since in weapons for 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.250
 our character and not for the rest of 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.479
 characters but good here I am a little 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.770
 the team I have gotten the truth 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.750
 which is pretty good for the little that 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.150
 I've been playing for a little bit because 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.650
 helped a lot is a crossed armchair 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.960
 apart has this update got me 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.789
 one thing called mysticism is 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.110
 that allows us to transfigure our 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.940
 objects this what do you mean as the 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.789
 world of warcraft on the lion are games 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.830
 where they allow us to change the appearance 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.090
 of our objects you see how it is 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.729
 changing the weapon and this would cost us 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.800
 25,000 and the general's weapons is 50 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.270
 maybe it's the one that I have but it is 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.469
 true that there are helmets that are very but 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.509
 that very well this took away one that is 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:56.509
 like a Chinese but I can put this 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:58.460
 west euros and half cuckold to sack is 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:00.199
 very very very very epic so good if 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.490

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.990
 Devil without being on the page you have 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.120

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.279

 comments you know and when traveling comment 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.059
 I would make my heart because it is a new 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:18.620
 phrase that is going to stay the channel thus 

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:21.649

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.629

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:29.779
 illustrator that have thrown meteorites and 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.129

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.469

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:35.029
