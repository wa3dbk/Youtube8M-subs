is<00:05:44.850> functional<00:05:45.390> I<00:05:45.890> don't<00:05:46.890> think<00:05:47.100> I<00:05:47.220> really

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
is functional I don't think I really

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.550 
is functional I don't think I really
need<00:05:47.760> an<00:05:47.880> alarm<00:05:48.210> system<00:05:48.480> not<00:05:48.990> like<00:05:49.170> the<00:05:49.320> ship

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
need an alarm system not like the ship

need an alarm system not like the ship
is<00:05:49.770> parked<00:05:50.160> in<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.340> high-crime<00:05:50.820> neighborhood

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
is parked in a high-crime neighborhood

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.590 
is parked in a high-crime neighborhood
Plus<00:05:52.740> that<00:05:53.100> means<00:05:53.310> figuring<00:05:53.640> out<00:05:54.090> how<00:05:54.270> to<00:05:54.330> hook

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
Plus that means figuring out how to hook

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.770 
Plus that means figuring out how to hook
the<00:05:54.780> system<00:05:55.170> up<00:05:55.350> to<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.650> generator<00:05:56.010> and

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
the system up to the generator and

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.900 
the system up to the generator and
that's<00:05:57.780> if<00:05:58.140> the<00:05:58.680> thing<00:05:58.890> even<00:05:59.070> works<00:05:59.400> which<00:05:59.730> is

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
that's if the thing even works which is

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.380 
that's if the thing even works which is
a<00:05:59.940> big<00:06:00.240> if<00:06:00.590> what<00:06:01.590> do<00:06:01.650> you<00:06:01.740> think<00:06:02.090> so<00:06:03.090> I<00:06:03.120> told

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
a big if what do you think so I told

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.720 
a big if what do you think so I told
them<00:06:03.480> just<00:06:03.690> to<00:06:03.780> go<00:06:03.900> to<00:06:03.930> sleep<00:06:04.290> I<00:06:04.500> mean<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:04.920> don't

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
them just to go to sleep I mean I don't

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.500 
them just to go to sleep I mean I don't
think<00:06:06.000> we<00:06:06.120> need<00:06:06.300> a<00:06:06.330> proximity<00:06:07.200> alarm<00:06:07.820> so<00:06:08.820> I

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
think we need a proximity alarm so I

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.940 
think we need a proximity alarm so I
went<00:06:09.900> ahead<00:06:09.990> and<00:06:11.360> told<00:06:12.360> them<00:06:12.540> to<00:06:12.630> go<00:06:12.780> to<00:06:12.810> sleep

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
went ahead and told them to go to sleep

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.490 
went ahead and told them to go to sleep
I'm<00:06:15.640> with<00:06:15.910> you<00:06:16.210> I<00:06:16.420> think<00:06:16.630> it'd<00:06:16.930> be<00:06:16.960> a<00:06:17.050> waste<00:06:17.350> of

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
I'm with you I think it'd be a waste of

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.190 
I'm with you I think it'd be a waste of
time<00:06:17.770> effort<00:06:18.160> and<00:06:18.790> light<00:06:19.150> all<00:06:19.510> of<00:06:19.870> which<00:06:20.050> are

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
time effort and light all of which are

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.080 
time effort and light all of which are
in<00:06:20.350> pretty<00:06:20.680> short<00:06:20.770> supply<00:06:21.430> around<00:06:21.460> here

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
in pretty short supply around here

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.840 
in pretty short supply around here
I'm<00:06:22.210> betting<00:06:22.810> down<00:06:23.140> instead<00:06:23.560> the<00:06:24.220> ship<00:06:24.520> really

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
I'm betting down instead the ship really

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.700 
I'm betting down instead the ship really
must<00:06:25.090> have<00:06:25.240> been<00:06:25.390> designed<00:06:25.750> for<00:06:25.900> a<00:06:25.960> small<00:06:26.350> crew

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
must have been designed for a small crew

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.980 
must have been designed for a small crew
only<00:06:27.100> a<00:06:27.130> single<00:06:27.520> mission<00:06:28.030> specialists<00:06:28.720> eat<00:06:28.840> up

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
only a single mission specialists eat up

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.950 
only a single mission specialists eat up
here<00:06:29.170> half<00:06:29.500> uprooted<00:06:30.310> which<00:06:31.180> in<00:06:31.390> fact<00:06:31.600> seems

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
here half uprooted which in fact seems

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.870 
here half uprooted which in fact seems
to<00:06:32.110> be<00:06:32.200> my<00:06:32.380> most<00:06:32.620> comfortable<00:06:32.920> option<00:06:33.700> as<00:06:33.850> far

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
to be my most comfortable option as far

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.730 
to be my most comfortable option as far
as<00:06:34.180> sleeping<00:06:34.570> arrangements<00:06:35.080> go<00:06:35.200> around<00:06:35.500> here

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
as sleeping arrangements go around here

as sleeping arrangements go around here
I<00:06:35.970> figure<00:06:36.970> it's<00:06:37.120> time<00:06:37.180> to<00:06:37.450> call<00:06:37.660> it<00:06:37.840> a<00:06:37.900> night

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
I figure it's time to call it a night

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.760 
I figure it's time to call it a night

only got to glow rods left no sense of
cracking<00:06:42.190> another<00:06:42.460> one<00:06:42.640> now<00:06:42.820> I've<00:06:43.660> sealed

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
over the airlock door and I've got

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
gonna wrap this up here he's hunkered

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.920 
gonna wrap this up here he's hunkered
down<00:06:56.860> inside<00:06:57.820> of<00:06:57.910> a<00:06:57.970> very<00:06:58.180> small<00:06:58.420> spaceship

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
down inside of a very small spaceship

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.900 
down inside of a very small spaceship
he's<00:06:59.140> got<00:06:59.290> a<00:06:59.320> couple<00:06:59.590> of<00:06:59.710> mylar<00:07:00.070> blankets<00:07:00.220> we

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
he's got a couple of mylar blankets we

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.400 
he's got a couple of mylar blankets we
know<00:07:01.090> we've<00:07:01.240> got<00:07:01.270> MREs<00:07:01.870> in<00:07:02.080> one<00:07:02.200> of<00:07:02.290> those

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
know we've got MREs in one of those

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.200 
know we've got MREs in one of those
rooms<00:07:02.710> I<00:07:02.920> think<00:07:03.160> this<00:07:03.310> would<00:07:03.490> be<00:07:03.580> a<00:07:03.610> very<00:07:03.850> very

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
rooms I think this would be a very very

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.570 
rooms I think this would be a very very
good<00:07:04.420> situation<00:07:04.690> for<00:07:05.170> Taylor<00:07:05.740> and<00:07:06.070> we're

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
good situation for Taylor and we're

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
good situation for Taylor and we're
gonna<00:07:06.670> let<00:07:06.910> him<00:07:07.000> get<00:07:07.150> some<00:07:07.300> sleep

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600 
gonna let him get some sleep

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.300 
gonna let him get some sleep
generally<00:07:08.050> when<00:07:08.170> he<00:07:08.320> sleeps<00:07:08.650> it<00:07:08.830> is<00:07:08.950> about<00:07:09.190> an

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
generally when he sleeps it is about an

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.040 
generally when he sleeps it is about an
eight-hour<00:07:09.610> real<00:07:09.970> time<00:07:10.240> process<00:07:10.750> so<00:07:10.930> we're

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
eight-hour real time process so we're

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.300 
eight-hour real time process so we're
gonna<00:07:11.140> go<00:07:11.380> ahead<00:07:11.440> and<00:07:11.560> wrap<00:07:11.740> this<00:07:11.800> one<00:07:12.130> up<00:07:12.190> here

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310 
gonna go ahead and wrap this one up here
