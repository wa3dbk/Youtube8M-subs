hair still feels not wet but damn it has
this<00:03:24.579> I<00:03:24.849> don't<00:03:25.569> know<00:03:25.690> like<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.989> won't<00:03:26.169> hold<00:03:26.409> so

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
this I don't know like it won't hold so

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.819 
this I don't know like it won't hold so
as<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.519> day<00:03:27.669> goes<00:03:27.909> on<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:29.139> parts<00:03:29.530> where<00:03:29.709> I

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
as the day goes on the parts where I

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.039 
as the day goes on the parts where I
used<00:03:30.099> more<00:03:30.639> of<00:03:30.849> the<00:03:31.000> curly<00:03:31.269> buttercream<00:03:31.870> will

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
used more of the curly buttercream will

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.659 
used more of the curly buttercream will
probably<00:03:32.440> swell<00:03:32.739> up<00:03:32.919> and<00:03:33.099> probably<00:03:33.370> won't

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
probably swell up and probably won't

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.460 
probably swell up and probably won't
hold<00:03:34.150> any<00:03:34.419> curl<00:03:34.720> definition<00:03:36.389> so<00:03:37.389> that's<00:03:38.229> going

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
hold any curl definition so that's going

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.500 
hold any curl definition so that's going
to<00:03:38.530> suck<00:03:38.799> but<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.579> is<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.299> success<00:03:41.139> with<00:03:41.560> the
