enjoyment which is what I think is the
goal<00:03:17.400> here<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.910> create<00:03:18.150> us<00:03:18.390> something<00:03:18.720> that

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
goal here is to create us something that

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.170 
goal here is to create us something that
uses<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.650> least<00:03:19.799> environmental<00:03:20.579> impact<00:03:20.970> with

uses the least environmental impact with

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.199 
uses the least environmental impact with
the<00:03:21.299> most<00:03:21.540> longevity<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.430> use<00:03:23.430> by<00:03:23.730> all<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.060> its
