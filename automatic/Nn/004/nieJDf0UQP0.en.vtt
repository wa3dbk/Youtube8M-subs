 a typical Italian dish and therefore 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.930

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.159
 time to cover but let's move on from 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.000
 preparations while I show you 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:20.340
 how to prepare aubergines aubergines 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 human cut so we have this 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.220
 that already lend themselves very easily to 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.430
 have this form however also with the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.659
 bigger aubergines to which 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.900
 remember to remove the liquids with 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.240
 the charlie they don't need 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.630
 we have to do them practically at the peak 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.630
 strips 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.259
 this is the form we should have for 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:55.899
 our balances meanwhile we begin 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.899
 to prepare the eggplant we put the oil 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:10.789
 and we put our eggplants to jump 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:13.220
 the oil in the pan which we don't have 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.410
 peeled because these details 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.840
 eggplants have a very thin peel 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.760
 and very tender and this is the time of 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.540
 our secret ingredient 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.760
 we have the sicilian pepper 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.860
 spicy and beautiful red pepper 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:34.510
 we will return to enter our own 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.510
 remaining it will be 3 for me 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:43.069
 add a pinch of salt and 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.069
 we continue to brown 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.800
 but that saute for good when 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:58.370
 they are well browned you can remove e 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:03:01.650
 put made left aside 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:07.470
 at this point we prepare ours 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:12.090
 sauce let's put the oil we make into 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.069
 on brown the onion and the type 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.230
 the fresh bone does not need a side 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.630
 non-existence 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.900
 we start already add the tomatoes 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.900
 peeled 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 salt 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.859
 a couple of ladles the cooking water 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.859
 some pasta 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:53.130
 we turn and put the lid on 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.620
 let it cook for about 20 minutes is 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.320
 time to throw the dough you 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.680
 I show how you had in spaghetti 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.900
 spaghetti should be folded into 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.120
 pot 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.800
 one must have the patience to see that 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.800
 they bend and then leave it to this 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.910
 point cooking the sauce is almost good 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:25.650
 point and then we're going to enter 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.650
 our aubergines 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.509
 I take and finish cooking the sauce 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.120
 with eggplant and time of tricks 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.699
 know of the recipe for you to prepare 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.669
 a good pasta when the fairy tale 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:52.600
 culture is not over yet enter the 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.600
 pasta in sauce 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.860
 add a cooking spoon of 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.860
 makeshift water 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.810
 and make them finish cooking is tied sta 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.830
 in your 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:17.480
 at this point the water is completely absorbed 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:21.680
 and the spaghetti have finished cooking 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:32.040
 we support our Lucan spaghetti 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:36.240
 it is clear abundant salted ricotta is a 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:39.960
 just a little bit of oil today spicy 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:45.260
