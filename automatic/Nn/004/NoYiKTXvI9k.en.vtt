flower beds in our lawns and it can be

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.249 
flower beds in our lawns and it can be
really<00:00:18.400> frustrating<00:00:18.990> one<00:00:19.990> of<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:20.140> most

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259 
really frustrating one of the most

frustrating problems is having grassy
weeds<00:00:23.320> growing<00:00:23.680> in<00:00:23.919> our<00:00:24.340> ornamental<00:00:25.000> beds

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
weeds growing in our ornamental beds

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.769 
weeds growing in our ornamental beds
among<00:00:25.989> our<00:00:26.140> broadleaf<00:00:26.919> ornamentals<00:00:27.610> and<00:00:27.820> that

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
among our broadleaf ornamentals and that

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.630 
among our broadleaf ornamentals and that
can<00:00:28.989> be<00:00:29.110> a<00:00:29.140> real<00:00:29.349> challenge<00:00:29.739> but<00:00:29.919> we<00:00:30.220> do<00:00:30.399> have<00:00:30.579> a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
can be a real challenge but we do have a

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.569 
can be a real challenge but we do have a
couple<00:00:31.029> of<00:00:31.300> products<00:00:31.840> or<00:00:32.050> chemicals<00:00:32.980> that<00:00:33.460> are

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
couple of products or chemicals that are

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.180 
couple of products or chemicals that are
on<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.850> market<00:00:34.300> that<00:00:34.930> can<00:00:35.470> be<00:00:35.620> used<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:36.010> help

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
on the market that can be used to help

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.760 
on the market that can be used to help
control<00:00:37.149> grassy<00:00:37.690> weeds<00:00:37.899> in<00:00:38.200> among<00:00:38.530> our

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
control grassy weeds in among our

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.550 
control grassy weeds in among our
ornamentals<00:00:39.430> so<00:00:39.970> for<00:00:40.210> example<00:00:40.630> we<00:00:40.780> have<00:00:41.050> some

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
ornamentals so for example we have some

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.380 
ornamentals so for example we have some
Bermuda<00:00:42.160> grass<00:00:42.610> actually<00:00:43.090> looks<00:00:43.270> like

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
Bermuda grass actually looks like

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.780 
Bermuda grass actually looks like
growing<00:00:43.660> up<00:00:43.870> in<00:00:44.080> among<00:00:44.410> our<00:00:44.620> irises<00:00:45.310> here<00:00:45.640> and

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
growing up in among our irises here and

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.760 
growing up in among our irises here and
it<00:00:46.450> would<00:00:46.540> be<00:00:46.660> very<00:00:46.690> difficult<00:00:47.050> to<00:00:47.380> spray

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
it would be very difficult to spray

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.430 
it would be very difficult to spray
these<00:00:48.540> individually<00:00:49.540> or<00:00:49.690> without<00:00:49.930> getting

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
these individually or without getting

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.080 
these individually or without getting
products<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.340> product<00:00:51.730> on<00:00:51.880> these

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
products the product on these

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.000 
products the product on these
ornamentals<00:00:52.690> but<00:00:53.290> as<00:00:53.440> mentioned<00:00:53.620> there<00:00:53.860> are<00:00:53.950> a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
ornamentals but as mentioned there are a

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.590 
ornamentals but as mentioned there are a
couple<00:00:54.160> products<00:00:54.640> that<00:00:54.790> are<00:00:55.060> listed<00:00:55.329> as

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
couple products that are listed as

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
shrubs and some ground covers now this

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.390 
shrubs and some ground covers now this
is<00:03:54.849> a<00:03:54.880> product<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.599> when<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.930> spray<00:03:56.319> it<00:03:56.400> in

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
is a product that when you spray it in

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.729 
is a product that when you spray it in
the<00:03:57.609> area<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.239> has<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.690> be<00:03:58.840> watered<00:03:59.319> in<00:03:59.470> because

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
the area it has to be watered in because

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.860 
the area it has to be watered in because
it's<00:03:59.919> absorbed<00:04:00.430> by<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.639> plants<00:04:01.150> roots<00:04:01.510> and

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
it's absorbed by the plants roots and

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.199 
it's absorbed by the plants roots and
then<00:04:02.470> taken<00:04:02.889> up<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.280> kills<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.760> plants<00:04:04.120> so

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
then taken up and kills the plants so

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.670 
then taken up and kills the plants so
that's<00:04:04.359> why<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.569> have<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.870> be<00:04:04.989> very<00:04:05.230> careful

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
that's why you have to be very careful

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.680 
that's why you have to be very careful
using<00:04:05.919> it<00:04:06.130> around<00:04:06.220> other<00:04:06.579> ornamentals<00:04:07.269> or

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
using it around other ornamentals or

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.539 
using it around other ornamentals or
other<00:04:07.810> plants<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.410> may<00:04:08.560> be<00:04:08.620> sensitive<00:04:09.190> or

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
other plants that may be sensitive or

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.479 
other plants that may be sensitive or
not<00:04:09.609> listed<00:04:10.209> on<00:04:10.299> the<00:04:10.480> label<00:04:11.250> because<00:04:12.250> they

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
not listed on the label because they

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.089 
not listed on the label because they
could<00:04:12.669> also<00:04:12.819> be<00:04:13.090> damaged<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:13.630> spray<00:04:14.049> it<00:04:14.230> water

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
could also be damaged so spray it water

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.060 
could also be damaged so spray it water
it<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.549> so<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.269> become<00:04:16.750> activated<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.709> so

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
it in so that it become activated and so

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.610 
it in so that it become activated and so
that<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.519> plants<00:04:19.060> can<00:04:19.120> then<00:04:19.359> absorb<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.930> this

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
that the plants can then absorb it this

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.029 
that the plants can then absorb it this
will<00:04:20.829> also<00:04:21.070> take<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.519> few<00:04:22.270> weeks<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:23.039> provide

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
will also take a few weeks to provide

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.300 
will also take a few weeks to provide
control<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.880> in<00:04:25.360> some<00:04:25.570> cases<00:04:25.840> there<00:04:26.139> may<00:04:26.349> be<00:04:26.380> a

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
control and in some cases there may be a

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.000 
control and in some cases there may be a
second<00:04:28.150> application<00:04:28.389> that's<00:04:29.139> necessary<00:04:29.800> and

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
second application that's necessary and

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.440 
second application that's necessary and
that's<00:04:30.130> true<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.700> other<00:04:30.849> products<00:04:31.419> that

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
that's true of the other products that

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.510 
that's true of the other products that
we've<00:04:31.599> talked<00:04:31.840> about<00:04:31.930> already<00:04:32.229> but<00:04:33.010> again

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
we've talked about already but again

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.310 
we've talked about already but again
