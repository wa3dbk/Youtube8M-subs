00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.740 
forgot but this is what it looks like it
kind<00:01:10.299> of<00:01:10.390> gives<00:01:10.509> you<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:12.180> glow<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.880> um<00:01:15.880> yeah<00:01:16.720> I

kind of gives you a glow and um yeah I

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.960

think it's worthwhile for $42 and I

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.420 
think it's worthwhile for $42 and I
think<00:01:22.840> it's<00:01:22.960> actually<00:01:23.320> like<00:01:23.439> 38<00:01:23.920> or<00:01:24.159> something

I<00:02:05.560> think<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:07.719> cream<00:02:08.490> says<00:02:09.870> be<00:02:10.870> right<00:02:11.230> on

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
I think that this cream says be right on

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.410 
I think that this cream says be right on
the<00:02:11.770> top

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the top

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.720 
the top
and<00:02:12.660> then<00:02:13.650> I'll<00:02:13.770> read<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.250> says<00:02:14.430> says

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.089 
and then I'll read what it says says

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.740 
soak in I always do this in the morning
because<00:02:42.769> find<00:02:43.769> out<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.760> find<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.180> clogs<00:02:45.480> my

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.540 
because find out like I find it clogs my
pores<00:02:46.019> if<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.410> do<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.680> at<00:02:46.769> night<00:02:46.800> because<00:02:47.400> I

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
pores if I do it at night because I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.840 
pores if I do it at night because I
tried<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:47.880> before<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.709> um<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.580> to

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
tried that before and um it's just to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.000 
tried that before and um it's just to
Gracie<00:02:51.180> for<00:02:51.569> night<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:51.989> too<00:02:52.230> heavy<00:02:52.650> for<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
Gracie for night it's too heavy for a

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.250 
Gracie for night it's too heavy for a
night<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:53.370> i<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.239> perfect<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
night but i think it is perfect for the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.090 
night but i think it is perfect for the
daytime<00:02:55.680> wear<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.959> anyways<00:02:58.319> I<00:02:58.440> do<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.860> and

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
daytime wear so anyways I do that and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.960 
daytime wear so anyways I do that and
then<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.280> put<00:02:59.780> my<00:03:00.780> Smashbox<00:03:01.560> primer<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
then I put my Smashbox primer on and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.430 
then I put my Smashbox primer on and
then<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.120> put<00:03:03.390> my<00:03:03.650> makeup<00:03:04.650> forever<00:03:05.040> HD

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
then I put my makeup forever HD

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.080 
then I put my makeup forever HD
foundation<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.489> think<00:03:08.549> that's<00:03:08.790> a

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
foundation on and I think that's a

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.990 
foundation on and I think that's a
perfect<00:03:09.299> mix<00:03:09.989> i've<00:03:10.980> had<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.489> cream<00:03:11.819> with

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
perfect mix i've had this cream with

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.360 
perfect mix i've had this cream with
many<00:03:12.209> different<00:03:12.480> foundations<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:14.190> all

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
many different foundations and it all

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.300 
many different foundations and it all
reacts<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.850> same<00:03:15.049> sometimes<00:03:16.049> if<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.739> have<00:03:17.280> a

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
reacts the same sometimes if you have a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.800 
reacts the same sometimes if you have a
little<00:03:17.850> too<00:03:17.970> much<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.269> your<00:03:18.420> nose<00:03:18.630> your

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
little too much on your nose your

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.020 
little too much on your nose your
foundation<00:03:19.320> can<00:03:19.470> slide<00:03:20.160> off<00:03:20.370> but<00:03:20.910> not

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
foundation can slide off but not

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.300 
foundation can slide off but not
everyone<00:03:21.480> uses<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:22.079> on<00:03:22.350> before<00:03:22.560> they<00:03:22.829> have

visible radiant skin yeah they're

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.470 
visible radiant skin yeah they're

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
totally right above that it takes five

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.990 
totally right above that it takes five
minutes<00:03:45.780> for<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.109> to<00:03:46.200> absorb<00:03:46.799> like<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.640> leave<00:03:47.880> it

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
minutes for it to absorb like I leave it

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.819 
minutes for it to absorb like I leave it
in<00:03:48.090> 45<00:03:48.299> minutes<00:03:48.660> but<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.230> think<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.590> goes

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
in 45 minutes but it I think it goes

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.710 
in 45 minutes but it I think it goes
faster<00:03:51.739> so<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:53.070> has<00:03:53.430> gently<00:03:53.820> apply<00:03:54.120> this

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
faster so it just has gently apply this

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.360 
faster so it just has gently apply this
to<00:03:55.019> concentrated<00:03:55.950> cream<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.730> face<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.950> that's

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
to concentrated cream to face so that's

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.509 
to concentrated cream to face so that's
about<00:03:59.489> it<00:03:59.690> you<00:04:00.690> apply<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.980> your<00:04:02.069> face
