my<00:02:35.790> vassal<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.480> that's<00:02:36.690> why<00:02:44.780> 42%<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.990> should

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
my vassal so that's why 42% this should

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.340 
my vassal so that's why 42% this should
have<00:02:46.290> dropped<00:02:46.560> already<00:02:47.810> there<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:48.960> go<00:02:49.110> and

but<00:03:15.990> I'm<00:03:16.380> actually<00:03:17.340> not<00:03:18.170> enforced<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.260> do<00:03:19.350> that

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
but I'm actually not enforced to do that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.830 
but I'm actually not enforced to do that
because<00:03:19.709> I've<00:03:20.010> got<00:03:20.250> enough<00:03:20.880> more<00:03:21.180> score<00:03:21.390> as<00:03:21.660> it

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
because I've got enough more score as it

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.020 
because I've got enough more score as it
is<00:03:21.930> as<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:22.920> see<00:03:23.040> here<00:03:23.220> there<00:03:23.400> is<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.760> show

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
is as you can see here there is the show

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.410 
is as you can see here there is the show
strength<00:03:24.480> but<00:03:24.870> it<00:03:25.080> needs<00:03:25.260> 100<00:03:25.830> percent<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:27.180> if

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
strength but it needs 100 percent so if

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.090 
strength but it needs 100 percent so if
I<00:03:27.510> want<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.690> do<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.110> need<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.440> retake<00:03:28.830> the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
I want to do that I need to retake the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.449 
I want to do that I need to retake the
this<00:03:29.400> territory<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:31.290> what<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.739> does<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.220> it

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
this territory and what it does is it

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.120 
this territory and what it does is it
actually<00:03:32.880> gives<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.410> 20<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.440> each<00:03:34.680> manic

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
point up here you can only take this

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.810 
point up here you can only take this
option<00:03:37.440> show<00:03:37.709> strength<00:03:38.010> if<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.459> did<00:03:38.640> the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
option show strength if you did the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.790 
option show strength if you did the
humiliation<00:03:39.570> conquest

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.490 

yeah<00:03:43.800> The<00:03:44.100> humiliation<00:03:44.370> casus<00:03:45.120> belli<00:03:45.500> but

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
yeah The humiliation casus belli but

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.199 
yeah The humiliation casus belli but
another<00:03:46.920> very<00:03:47.040> good<00:03:47.519> thing<00:03:47.700> especially<00:03:47.940> for

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
another very good thing especially for

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.600 
another very good thing especially for
migrating<00:03:48.630> traps<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.140> find<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.680> very<00:03:49.709> useful<00:03:50.130> is

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
migrating traps I find it very useful is

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.910 
migrating traps I find it very useful is
actually<00:03:50.940> creating<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.480> vessel<00:03:51.810> taking<00:03:52.800> that

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
actually creating a vessel taking that

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.130 
actually creating a vessel taking that
trait<00:03:53.130> power<00:03:53.340> do<00:03:54.000> not<00:03:54.269> take<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.690> cache<00:03:54.870> as<00:03:55.080> you

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
trait power do not take the cache as you

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.850 
trait power do not take the cache as you
can<00:03:55.290> see<00:03:55.410> here<00:03:56.030> my<00:03:57.030> income<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:57.900> bad<00:03:58.530> as<00:03:58.830> a

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
can see here my income is so bad as a

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.440 
can see here my income is so bad as a
migrating<00:03:59.430> tribe<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.950> where<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.250> sits<00:04:02.670> can't

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
migrating tribe that where it sits can't

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.180 
migrating tribe that where it sits can't
actually<00:04:03.600> find<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.080> but<00:04:04.200> I'll<00:04:04.380> get<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.620> huge

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
actually find it but I'll get a huge

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.620 
actually find it but I'll get a huge
inflation<00:04:06.320> there<00:04:07.320> oh<00:04:07.970> that's<00:04:08.970> not<00:04:09.150> really

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
inflation there oh that's not really

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.960 
inflation there oh that's not really
that<00:04:09.750> much<00:04:09.989> but<00:04:10.769> considering<00:04:11.670> its<00:04:11.790> eighth

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
that much but considering its eighth

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.900 
that much but considering its eighth
goal<00:04:12.209> points<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:13.019> so<00:04:13.260> it's<00:04:14.220> really<00:04:14.489> not<00:04:14.700> worth

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
goal points a so it's really not worth

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.690 
goal points a so it's really not worth
it<00:04:15.320> but<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.530> can<00:04:16.680> take<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.010> piece<00:04:17.280> through<00:04:17.549> you

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
it but I can take this piece through you

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.190 
it but I can take this piece through you
which<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.660> quite<00:04:20.000> significant<00:04:21.020> with<00:04:22.020> me

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
which is a quite significant with me

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.260 
which is a quite significant with me
getting<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.590> Basil's<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.490> lot<00:04:23.700> more<00:04:23.729> cash

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
getting to Basil's and a lot more cash

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.900 
getting to Basil's and a lot more cash
overtime<00:04:25.340> you'll<00:04:26.340> get<00:04:26.520> some<00:04:26.669> aggressive

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
overtime you'll get some aggressive

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.830 
overtime you'll get some aggressive
expansion

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
expansion

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.710 
expansion
that's<00:04:28.410> what<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.370> I'll<00:04:30.150> just<00:04:30.420> send<00:04:30.660> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
that's what it is and I'll just send the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.870 
that's what it is and I'll just send the
demands<00:04:30.990> but<00:04:31.710> as<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:31.920> see<00:04:32.070> we<00:04:32.190> got<00:04:32.310> fifty

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
demands but as you see we got fifty

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.210 
demands but as you see we got fifty
prestige<00:04:33.270> out<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.440> we<00:04:34.830> then<00:04:35.040> got

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
prestige out of that and we then got

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.000 
prestige out of that and we then got
another<00:04:37.190> prestige<00:04:38.870> because<00:04:39.870> of<00:04:40.770> the

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
another prestige because of the

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.520 
another prestige because of the
penalties<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.700> this<00:04:41.880> war<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:42.480> we<00:04:42.720> gained<00:04:42.930> fifty

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
penalties of this war so we gained fifty

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.700 
penalties of this war so we gained fifty
seven<00:04:43.920> prestige<00:04:44.750> undoing<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> humiliation

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
seven prestige undoing the humiliation

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.610 
seven prestige undoing the humiliation
war<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:47.940> it's<00:04:48.150> very<00:04:48.360> useful<00:04:48.840> actually<00:04:49.230> and

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
war so it's very useful actually and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.070 
war so it's very useful actually and
I'll<00:04:50.280> get<00:04:50.520> an<00:04:50.730> event<00:04:51.090> for<00:04:51.330> losing<00:04:51.780> prestige

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
I'll get an event for losing prestige

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.830
