00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
this is the first one it's going to have

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.910 
this is the first one it's going to have
its<00:01:33.689> problems<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.259> hope<00:01:34.409> they're<00:01:34.590> fixed<00:01:34.829> by

its problems I hope they're fixed by

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.280 
its problems I hope they're fixed by
software<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> actual<00:01:36.329> looking<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
software but the actual looking at the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.899 
software but the actual looking at the
watch<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.680> obviously<00:01:38.130> not<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> software<00:01:38.670> thing

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
actually it's a USB Drive this is where

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.100 
actually it's a USB Drive this is where
all<00:01:56.790> your<00:01:56.969> instructions<00:01:57.240> are<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.990> just

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
all your instructions are so you just

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.620 
all your instructions are so you just
plug<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.469> into<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.829> computer<00:01:59.450> you<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.540> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
plug this into the computer you have to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.090 
plug this into the computer you have to
figure<00:02:00.869> out<00:02:00.899> which<00:02:01.170> way<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.409> goes<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:01.950> is

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
figure out which way it goes in which is

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.350 
figure out which way it goes in which is
actually<00:02:02.399> kind<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.610> funny<00:02:02.850> because<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.299> so

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
actually kind of funny because it's so

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.959 
actually kind of funny because it's so
thin<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.040> thought<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> clever<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.820> would

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
thin I thought this is clever this would

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.270 
thin I thought this is clever this would
be<00:02:06.060> good<00:02:06.180> advertising<00:02:06.810> for<00:02:06.960> companies<00:02:07.320> you

got<00:02:30.659> to<00:02:30.750> go<00:02:30.840> back<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.230> drawing<00:02:31.379> board<00:02:31.530> and

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
got to go back to the drawing board and

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.949 
got to go back to the drawing board and
fix<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.849> face<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.599> fix<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
connectivity and you know what if it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.460 
connectivity and you know what if it
means<00:02:36.269> having<00:02:36.659> a<00:02:36.840> watch<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.200> needs<00:02:37.349> a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
means having a watch that needs a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.500 
means having a watch that needs a
battery<00:02:37.680> instead<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:38.849> solar<00:02:39.150> charge

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
battery instead of this solar charge

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.330 
battery instead of this solar charge
then<00:02:39.900> put<00:02:40.079> a<00:02:40.109> battery<00:02:40.379> in<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.739> thing<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.099> that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
then put a battery in the thing so that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.619 
then put a battery in the thing so that
way<00:02:41.459> we<00:02:41.579> don't<00:02:41.670> have<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:41.970> look<00:02:42.090> at<00:02:42.239> this<00:02:42.390> face

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
way we don't have to look at this face

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.990 
way we don't have to look at this face
being<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.049> shiny<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:44.430> maybe<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.790> power

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
being this shiny and maybe the power

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.670 
being this shiny and maybe the power
will<00:02:45.299> be<00:02:45.510> increased<00:02:45.659> enough<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.409> keep

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
will be increased enough to keep

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.550 
will be increased enough to keep
