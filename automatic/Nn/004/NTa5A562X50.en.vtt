00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 but no 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.130
 hello very good everyone this is going to be the 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.800
 first tutorial for my channel of the 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.090
 rubik cubes and will do that is for 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.090
 me the easiest in two by two 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.840
 so let's start the 2 for 2 as 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.840
 unlike 3 x 3 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.340
 but we have from a center and take out the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.220
 base of that center and also that list 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.790
 Well in this case 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.460
 there is no center or edges are not only 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 corners so this cube works out 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.160
 using the same algorithms that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.170
 those to make the corners of the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.600
 first loss on the final face of the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.650
 role play and 3 x tennis that's why it's more 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.650
 short on solutions 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.480
 so we do not have that I always started 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.510
 for the white face to face let's see 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.250
 what we have left 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.370
 for example like this store to tell 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.290
 let's talk to each other about this is not 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.300
 the white we have it upwards then 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.830
 has green and red if we are going to 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.390
 look for one that has green or red 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.580
 would be here a no 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.120
 now we have his life here until 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.120
 download it 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.070
 we can see it here so we put it 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.740
 here 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.010
 we have to put it up if 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.920
 we do it like this 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.570
 it looks good on us but it is removed 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.620
 been a very easy trick is to put what 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.330
 let's turn around like this to stay is 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.070
 remove is to remove it 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.820
 upload the one we wanted to upload here 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.640
 and put this back 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.909
 It is very easy and we have been well 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.909
 and this one that we already had well placed 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.469
 let's put another example is this has 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.310
 to go here not and if it would go up the same 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.310
 way doing so 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.049
 let's do the same procedure if 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:10.080
 he takes off he moves away he goes up and he 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.930
 recover and we would have the face 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.989
 with all of which are supposed not 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.480
 to the last face as the longest 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.709
 the most complicated 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.930
 so let's do we have to 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.519
 look at the choruses here are the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.560
 same ones that are going to go here no other 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.409
 yellow up and then here in those of 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.060
 here that we're going to look at does not 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.530
 I have to be here because this one 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.000
 the orange version is wrongly placed 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.430
 blue would go on this side not 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.290
 as if some in green is here but 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.980
 has there orange 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.980
 I am red not 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.120
 if we look once to the side and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.670
 we look green green orange nothing red 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.500
 is here but here the blue does not fit the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.100
 red is not always here but there is not the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.340
 red and here there is blue and here orange that 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.410
 is this is the one that is well placed 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.710
 even if it is poorly oriented but it is good 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.980
 placed 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.450
 let's do feel algorithm 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.540
 putting it here we have to do as 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.410
 in transportation it is like that 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:25.780
 so it is recover 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.030
 over here that we remove you see 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.550
 is the lack is to go up is next 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.430
 you put it back it was not then go up 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.000
 is this other side you recover the one that has 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.820
 the white here to lower it and here what 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.200
 same recover the white to lower it and 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.390
 they do not stay in one place and they have 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.660
 permuted these three here the other three 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.860
 and let's see if we have stayed 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.570
 being wrong because we do the same 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.010
 movement watching is here not what 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.620
 we move up 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.720
 then we remove the other face 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.140
 we recover this we lower it recover 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.379
 and we went down and we have already been twice 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.959
 these are already well placed 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.209
 now you have to orient the and for that is 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.730
 the same algorithm that is so 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.349
 let's do it 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.610
 welcome like this this is what I do 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.100
 one way or another but now we're going to 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.270
 do it the same way we lower it 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.550
 towards this side we go towards the other 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:27.909
 we go down this side 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.979
 we had the other one is already good 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.110
 placed now without touching the cube of 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.720
 down we rotate the part above this other 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.720
 that is not badly placed we go down 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.110
 we remove we raise and return we go down 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.560
 we remove we go back and we see that a return 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.710
 that darwin we turn to the one that is wrong 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.940
 we go down we go up we go back 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.800
 we go down we remove we raise and we return already 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.590
 we have gone the normal top 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.670
 it is still if it is left more we rotate 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.360
 and we have already left 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:05.620
 the cube solved while we continue giving 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.620
 a little faster 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.190
 but explaining the experts then it 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:15.080
 can explain for example here we are going to 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.080
 team up to do it 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:24.590
 so let's look for the green or red not 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:27.900
 here is the green here yes 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:31.380
 and let's also say 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.199
 I was here as when I raise it, it does not come off 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.680
 none of us can upload it perfectly and 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.560
 let's find the other 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:44.330
 is here now I know how the sequita goes up 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:47.539
 we are rotating we can leave it there not 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.300
 let's do this for example this is 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:53.080
 bad is wrong is wrong 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.490
 let's do the 2 the bleeding late 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.009
 that is a parity 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.560
 so we rotate once 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:03.900
 we already have is fine 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.600
 it's just fine so let's do 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.949
 the extra algorithm has already arrived 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.949
 all and this would only be 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.250
 place them as we expected a little 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.250
 faster 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:22.129
 and turn the layer and we would have the 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.439
 cube solved 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.550
 so good I hope you served 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:30.409
 of help 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:34.470
 if you have this as you already know how to use it 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:36.600
 because people usually have this 3 x 3 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.610
 and when you eat you are already know 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.259
 do this 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.270
 just as I do not expect that I have served you 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:45.650
 of much and until the next video there 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.650
 forget to subscribe and give light
