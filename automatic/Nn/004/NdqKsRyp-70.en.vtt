00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.220
 but today we are doing mine 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:19.430
 favorite prescription us he do now prescription 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.689
 and that's from jamie oliver that 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.570
 I do not take on one to one though 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.280
 is just because of him and yes what should i do 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.160
 say so it is not a recipe of 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.599
 I did not turn away from a giant and I did 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.370
 make now so that tells also 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.980
 always not as a deposit copyright 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.590
 foundress show what but slightly better 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.150
 you is the time to say so yes and 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.479
 maybe not a combination 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.089
 quite as typically it is a prescription off 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:48.019
 come to my favorite suter 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.390
 fresh peas 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.550
 so now tk peas but here 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.100
 also meatballs in the world 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.360
 made tomato sauce and this 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.309
 combination between new york flash 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.110
 talking is not quite that typical though 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.120
 I think it's just super 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.979
 awesome and that's why I had to 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 absolutely the recipe and wanted 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.159
 I also have to show it 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.659
 yes and I did it again enough 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.820
 talked over and that's why I can go 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.900
 and again have fun just watch 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.640
 We start counting a small block 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.300
 and how do we beat now very fine 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.330
 I make the recipe for two people 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.310
 and if that's for more people 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.840
 So you want to do it for four people then 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.840
 just double the ingredients 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.440
 as you can see you have me next 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.240
 beautiful 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:50.640
 basil and I lie to 40 sheets 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:56.430
 from the stalks which turn both 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.619
 play but also leaves only separately so 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.440
 and I give him style as you can see 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.160
 chop now not now the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.160
 basil or washed and with mine 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.280
 Klub simply lures a top 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.550
 sweaty then I take now 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.770
 a can of tomatoes 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.900
 they are peeled and in their own juice 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.480
 I now get no policy is 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.519
 not quite normal but they go up 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.269
 every case too and give one ours 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:37.790
 knife in and cut tomatoes 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:46.019
 ever before with easier to cook 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:49.470
 and now I'm sure if I'm upset 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:59.120
 Olive oil is there should be nice 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:59.120
 hot the top banker 's knife to vision 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:14.730
 if you once was 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:17.930
 the garlic and creation longer 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.930
 slowly color 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.579
 between a jute on the plan 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:32.249
 meanwhile we can have ours here 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:34.340
 basil the leaves and the fine 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:37.099
 or we have once through 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.239
 to fall michal 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.239
 you see the garlic beautiful brown 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:52.470
 and I 'll add the tomatoes to it 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.970
 all about impressions this one more 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.040
 a little bit let everything short again 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.660
 bring to the boil 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.810
 the sauce a boiled you see it 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.260
 I'm still steaming now 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.849
 this whole chopped basile 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.160
 combination only everything under and you see 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.690
 It's the recipe you can tomato sauce 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.950
 I 've already done that 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.299
 not from jamie and that 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.780
 original concept it all over with 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:22.160
 pepper salt to taste 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:25.139
 let everything simmer with meda flame 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.120
 means vision driven before and cake 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.090
 offered 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.700
 you 'll see a board one again 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.229
 make was work meat minced meat 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.810
 couple the original recipe you give up 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:42.300
 meatballs advance sausage find that 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.389
 I do a great thing you know that 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.280
 from my kirchner clubs recipe from the 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:52.830
 simple reason he did not always have 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.570
 a lot of time to cook and I think so 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.900
 Here's a great idea if you are here now 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.090
 deliberately advising on this 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.220
 only meat which pushes out the 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.360
 maybe a little bit formed and then on 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.750
 rotates and that is also a concept 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.760
 really good recipe for things when it does 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.530
 I want to go fast and I will 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.150
 do everything I could here 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:22.020
 Persecuted wholegrain flour are always 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.060
 better than noodles from pure white what he 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.070
 asks what has been done here is one 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.800
 accident with the heating and 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.400
 boiling hot water at the thermostat 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.560
 repair 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.289
 it sometimes happens like you see 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.950
 to do that to me 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:42.150
 Annette press and then turn 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.970
 you need is three is four 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.970
 meatballs out of a big out 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.130
 gets as I said 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.550
 you can easily lose weight as well 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.980
 and the 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.460
 shorten yourself and that explains the 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.730
 quick variant because I am with my 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.260
 Part now was traveling all day 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:07.070
 and I use it only the remaining light and 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:09.250
 Weighing now and doing it easy 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.240
 the simple variant now if i 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.780
 now has to go a little faster 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.340
 sometimes you see here i have 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:20.540
 herbs taken thyme and rosemary 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:24.560
 three branches of rosemary and 672 done and 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:28.120
 I have all the same now 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.120
 the meatballs are rolled 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.960
 be fried 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.620
 I handled my herbs 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:43.040
 you see something and now you just become 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:45.590
 only the meatballs are turned 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.000
 Oil seared are background 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.610
 meatballs advise 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.410
 here is our sosa we take now 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.020
 Another shot of balsamic vinegar I would be 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.930
 for white and so took one 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.440
 sauce you already see the tomatoes 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.860
 Cook 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:05.390
 but as long as everything continues to fry or 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:09.290
 cooking in the water 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:13.960
 hereby the sauce still on the 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.960
 open sea and let them progress 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:23.180
 you see my left like cooking and 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:27.039
 I just give doctors the book there 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:31.449
 the into the boiling water from the roll in 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:35.770
 so I save myself to block 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:35.770
 that does not stop the whole thing
