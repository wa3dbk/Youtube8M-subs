botanicals it's in absolutely everything
and<00:02:30.950> so<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:32.060> don't<00:02:32.270> know<00:02:32.540> what<00:02:32.930> I'm

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
and so I really don't know what I'm

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.410 
and so I really don't know what I'm
supposed<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.380> use<00:02:33.620> so<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.610> top<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.060> off

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
supposed to use so to top it off

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.870 
supposed to use so to top it off
yes<00:02:35.750> I'm<00:02:35.959> allergic<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.320> shave<00:02:36.590> too<00:02:37.310> shea

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
yes I'm allergic to shave too shea

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.060 
yes I'm allergic to shave too shea
butter<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.420> almond<00:02:38.959> oil<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.620> all<00:02:39.769> of<00:02:39.920> those

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
butter to almond oil to all of those

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.580 
butter to almond oil to all of those
type<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.310> things<00:02:40.430> that's<00:02:40.880> out<00:02:41.060> then<00:02:41.780> I'm<00:02:42.140> also

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
type of things that's out then I'm also

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.870 
type of things that's out then I'm also
allergic<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.160> coconuts

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
allergic to coconuts

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.360 
allergic to coconuts
so<00:02:44.090> coconut<00:02:44.420> oil<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:45.050> also<00:02:45.470> out<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.950> can't<00:02:46.190> type

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
so coconut oil is also out I can't type

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.340 
so coconut oil is also out I can't type
to<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:46.880> so<00:02:47.600> when<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.810> have<00:02:47.930> an<00:02:48.050> allergy

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
to that and so when you have an allergy

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.590 
to that and so when you have an allergy
that<00:02:48.739> eliminates<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.580> many<00:02:50.060> possible

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
that eliminates so many possible

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.750 
that eliminates so many possible
products<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.350> I<00:02:51.380> really<00:02:51.800> just<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.250> don't<00:02:52.400> know

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760
