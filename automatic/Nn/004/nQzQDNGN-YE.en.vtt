 wolf with the hand for tan 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.330
 we're here 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.120
 begin this session of matins esade with the presence of sergio ríos 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.739
 president of csif ccoo 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:13.649
 iberia 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:19.089
 I want to tell him his presence riki will present him 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.440
 is with us because I say no 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.790
 after he managed to defend himself well a today and always 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.519
 our peoples 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.400
 complicated sector 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.280
 alarte west margin changes as explained 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.350
 from channels that this imparts in the profitability 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.479
 and obviously we all stand the attributes always today 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.110
 is the speed of changes so I think that 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.920
 this agility of change 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.510
 na adapting low consumers is also the elements 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.190
 important is that it has allowed us 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.980
 to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 manage manage the crisis and that the crisis does not affect us 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.850
 we have made a qualitative leap because 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.130
 the overlap that had been captured would be much higher among the visits 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.360
 who made the drinks 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.400
 and the times he's doing his backs has been much less 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.280
 to which I am sorry for so much and we are visiting 252 points within 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.660
 our people 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.110
 We make 40 thousand visits per day our clients 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.680
 tempts me routes for the 26 visits a day saleh the tremendous number of 40 thousand 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
 and now I'm going to be the envy of everything was based 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 because 75% of what we charge has been targeted 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.390
 prague 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.650
 and this was evidently a competitive advantage in itself what from today 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.470
 a very relevant 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.700
 and it allows us to be a little independent and evidently this accompanied 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.250
 of some volumes 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.170
 stratospheric when you look at it according to what different dimensions of the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.230
 money because we are one we move products with little added value for 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.460
 both see produce and sell 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.210
 and delivered how we handled 85% 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.610
 of which the chain or the 90 group tecnocasa spain 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.920
 We tend to be 15 million bags a week 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 and 9 million liters 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.379
 but I think that 2011 will not be prices we will not actually see 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.010
 we are already seeing that there is a 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.999
 increase 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.429
 by model inflation is logical harem now we see it clear but 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.839
 suspects that the companies and many this and follow the companies we have to 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.459
 end price decisions 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.889
 4 5 months 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.100
 and this was not so evident that not the one that inflation would be 3 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.340
 we are struggling with price increases 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.760
 in situations where it was not known if there would be deflation course 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.949
 but I think it's going to assume the margins situation is very 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:44.949
 deteriorated 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.979
 Obviously the small room companies that are suffering 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:48.919
 heap 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.919
 and the large distribution companies are very wrong 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.539
 we have decided you 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.539
 for two reasons and young people after one because we are convinced 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.219
 2 because the corporation or force and third reason 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.030
 d'elía is he is not the most important but relevant a large part of bonds 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.559
 of all managers the with it 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:14.779
 is to invest in people despite the crisis 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.929
 what matters most to French is hard to think 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:21.369
 in static do not sit down that they can see from an agent because crisis 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:22.899
 sto min 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:26.549
 pro when you go facts you say done the right thing is people investing 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.289
 bringing the crisis better 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:32.289
 and if my mind and yes yes yes I said today I wish so visionary 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.319
 the one that seen thus is not to say with satisfaction that pepsico we have done 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.849
 clearly why is this because at this moment 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.229
 any investment that makes more people 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.979
 the return is multiplied by infinity 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:47.749
 the people today 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.419
 has assumed n + invest in it 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:54.109
 I joined the dollar should throw to the street in quotes josé adam pop love 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.469
 any tipuanas investment in people 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:57.939
 have a return 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.129
 much bigger than I have 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.249
 keep investments have increased a lot to companies 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.069
 information 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.389
 kick investments in people development 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.419
 that is giving us a commitment 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.809
 satisfaction and motivation in the final 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:15.689
 I understand without being able to justify clearly is one of the differential elements 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.009
 the results 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.959
 to 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.299
 p be at a competitive disadvantage 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.059
