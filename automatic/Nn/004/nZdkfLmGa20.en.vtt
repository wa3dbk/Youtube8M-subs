to say is this is gonna be the first

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.610 
to say is this is gonna be the first
career<00:04:21.239> mode<00:04:21.390> that<00:04:21.510> I<00:04:21.570> really<00:04:21.960> really<00:04:22.229> go<00:04:22.410> in

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
career mode that I really really go in

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.350 
career mode that I really really go in
depth<00:04:23.250> with<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.700> want<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.000> show<00:04:24.180> you<00:04:24.240> guys

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
depth with it I want to show you guys

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.300 
depth with it I want to show you guys
every<00:04:25.110> move<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.500> make<00:04:25.740> off

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
every move I make off

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.100 
every move I make off
whew<00:04:26.520> now<00:04:26.760> I<00:04:27.000> think<00:04:27.120> this<00:04:27.389> is<00:04:27.540> manager<00:04:27.990> mode

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
whew now I think this is manager mode

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.409 
whew now I think this is manager mode
and<00:04:28.230> I<00:04:28.260> think<00:04:28.440> it's<00:04:28.530> important<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.190> show<00:04:29.460> the

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419

missed<00:06:04.830> that<00:06:04.979> I<00:06:05.070> couldn't<00:06:05.370> really<00:06:05.460> believe<00:06:05.580> it

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
missed that I couldn't really believe it

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.580 
missed that I couldn't really believe it
that<00:06:06.090> was<00:06:06.210> right<00:06:06.389> before<00:06:06.419> half-time<00:06:06.840> did<00:06:07.500> in

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
that was right before half-time did in

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.200 
that was right before half-time did in
the<00:06:07.650> 72nd<00:06:08.400> minute<00:06:08.490> there<00:06:08.729> wasn't<00:06:08.970> that<00:06:09.000> many

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
the 72nd minute there wasn't that many

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.029 
the 72nd minute there wasn't that many
chances<00:06:09.510> this<00:06:09.990> one<00:06:10.200> felt<00:06:10.470> right<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:10.710> love<00:06:10.979> and

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039

Dorsky

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
Dorsky

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.610 
Dorsky
and<00:06:11.700> again<00:06:12.300> he<00:06:12.539> couldn't<00:06:12.900> put<00:06:13.080> that<00:06:13.260> one<00:06:13.440> home

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
and again he couldn't put that one home

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.800 
and again he couldn't put that one home
so<00:06:13.919> the<00:06:14.010> man<00:06:14.220> that<00:06:14.400> cost<00:06:14.639> 63<00:06:15.389> million<00:06:15.630> I<00:06:15.780> think

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
so the man that cost 63 million I think

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.200

coming<00:06:18.539> up<00:06:18.630> big<00:06:18.870> I<00:06:19.020> hope<00:06:19.169> he<00:06:19.289> doesn't<00:06:19.470> pull<00:06:19.620> it

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860
