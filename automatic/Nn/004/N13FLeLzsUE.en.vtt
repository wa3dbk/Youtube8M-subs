Bad and this is supposed to be

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.360 
Bad and this is supposed to be
indicative<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.629> sometimes<00:00:43.530> they

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
indicative of that and sometimes they

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
whole things you know made to look like

whole things you know made to look like
it's<00:00:48.420> made<00:00:48.719> out<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.960> copper<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.320> something<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
it's made out of copper or something and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.529 
it's made out of copper or something and
sometimes<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.340> versions<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
sometimes when they do versions of that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.330 
sometimes when they do versions of that
I<00:00:51.750> don't<00:00:51.899> really<00:00:52.020> care<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.890> an<00:00:53.070> entire

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
I don't really care but to do an entire

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.650 
I don't really care but to do an entire
one<00:00:53.550> made<00:00:53.789> out<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.090> sparkly<00:00:54.480> blue

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
one made out of like sparkly blue

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.080 
one made out of like sparkly blue
crystal<00:00:54.989> meth<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.820> awesome

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
crystal meth I think is a really awesome

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.569 
crystal meth I think is a really awesome
screwed<00:00:57.809> up<00:00:57.930> idea<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.680> great<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
screwed up idea I think it's great and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.529 
screwed up idea I think it's great and
certainly<00:01:00.239> unique

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
certainly unique

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.000 
certainly unique
and<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.230> certainly<00:01:01.530> appropriate<00:01:01.770> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and it's certainly appropriate to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.830 
and it's certainly appropriate to
Breaking<00:01:02.280> Bad<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.940> here's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> closer<00:01:03.359> look<00:01:03.600> at

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
Breaking Bad so here's a closer look at

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.509 
Breaking Bad so here's a closer look at
the<00:01:04.080> figure<00:01:04.350> sculpt<00:01:04.739> itself<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.309> kind<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the figure sculpt itself you can kind of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.010 
the figure sculpt itself you can kind of
see<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.689> where<00:01:06.869> his

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
see just like you know where his

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.230 
see just like you know where his
shoelaces<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.920> his<00:01:08.100> pants<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.610> his<00:01:08.700> coat<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
shoelaces and his pants and his coat and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.060 
shoelaces and his pants and his coat and
where<00:01:09.360> his<00:01:09.479> buttons<00:01:09.810> would<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.920> all

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
where his buttons would be but it's all

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.590 
where his buttons would be but it's all
kind<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.430> harder<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> see<00:01:12.060> because<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.570> only

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
kind of harder to see because not only

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.240 
kind of harder to see because not only
is<00:01:12.840> blue<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.409> embedded<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.920> glitter

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
is blue but it's embedded with glitter

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
is blue but it's embedded with glitter
and<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:15.180> glitter<00:01:15.479> gives<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> kind<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.170> like

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and that glitter gives it kind of like

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
and that glitter gives it kind of like
crystal<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> look<00:01:17.159> now<00:01:17.310> I've<00:01:17.430> never<00:01:17.610> held<00:01:17.880> below

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
crystal a look now I've never held below

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.370 
crystal a look now I've never held below
crystal<00:01:18.509> meth<00:01:18.659> before<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.170> don't<00:01:19.320> really

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
crystal meth before so I don't really

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.749 
crystal meth before so I don't really
know<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.799> looks<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.520> kind

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
know what it looks like but this is kind

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.700

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
of a fun toy version of what it would be

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.609 
of a fun toy version of what it would be
again<00:01:23.520> you're<00:01:24.000> looking<00:01:24.119> at<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.450> toy<00:01:24.689> that's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
supposed to look like it's crystal meth

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.620 
supposed to look like it's crystal meth
how<00:01:28.650> awesome<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.130> not<00:01:29.970> awesome<00:01:30.119> like<00:01:30.450> yay
