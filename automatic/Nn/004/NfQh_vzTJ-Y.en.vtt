00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.410
 dvd criticism my further trailer check 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.620
 to a film with mark wahlberg 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.120
 in the main role of the like 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.259
 Kriegkrieg antikriegsfilm comes along 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.630
 and with that we would be looking at the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.630
 German trailer of survivor 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.320
 a storm is raging in us 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:35.010
 A burn a craving 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:37.879
 the will to give more than ever 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.879
 is conceivable 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.270
 That is the target person a leader 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.990
 Taliban whose last week is 20 marines 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.890
 killed 20 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.890
 we go with a company 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.280
 this makes us already position 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.010
 based 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:11.210
 All right, that's more than just tenths 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:12.070
 It is an army operation 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.930
 endangered 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.580
 he is banking zero one penny 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.380
 does the radio work we have 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.940
 now we have two options 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.560
 let them run and see on 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.600
 he runs right down and we have 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.950
 200 of those in the nape, secondly, we 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.119
 Eliminate the endangerments we can 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.490
 but do not kill any children 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.670
 We'll release you and go home 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.200
 and we did the right thing 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.040
 radio to hear us honestly have no 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.330
 reception you have what does not look good 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.369
 I think it's massive right now 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.369
 fireworks and let 's go 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.229
 Allofs 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.229
 no matter 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.330
 and then you can fight 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.080
 from all over the world we can do it or 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.080
 certainly 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.100
 no matter how painful everything gets again 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.790
 or the deep you fall you will never 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.790
 to fight on 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.690
 especially in the European world no 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.220
 We often go to this kind of film directly 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.260
 to say but please not this is 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.819
 American patriotic crap but 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.099
 I have the feeling that wage increases 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.150
 could be through out morals obama 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.819
 brings the universe movie 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.470
 expected from 20 march 2014 in 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.540
 the german cinemas and tells the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.280
 true story of some elite soldiers 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.360
 who are stationed in Afghanistan and 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.310
 get the order one 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.470
 barely eliminating taliban leaders 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.329
 This foursome in troops is withdrawn from 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.680
 elite soldiers among others played in 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.930
 by mark wahlberg taylor kitsch 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.610
 vigorously realize that they are one 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.140
 to stand over against will be afterwards 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.579
 from a boy had this discover 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.780
 want to release themselves to the base 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.579
 but withdraw very quickly 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.920
 cut off from her way back and 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.980
 Of course, that's a dramatic one 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.849
 and critical scenario 2005 should be perfect 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.819
 this situation actually 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.230
 Afghanistan has a conflict 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.030
 Of course, you can feel it quickly 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.099
 that the whole thing somehow here 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.690
 but I will find patriotic stuff 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.459
 the trailer starts with the globo 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.690
 the music was a bit undercut 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.700
 that you feel okay maybe 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.739
 he tries these two sides 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.930
 to represent and also the motive too 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.849
 ask the opposing side why something 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.230
 is as it is and not just this 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.760
 patriotic freedom kram 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.319
 I pull off also believe that mark 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.819
 Wahlberg could have felt that in 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.650
 to steer the right situation 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.150
 film comes with 50 million dollars 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.500
 budget safe I think so 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.790
 you can see the optics here too 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.519
 and I have one or the other 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.690
 positive in advance of this film already 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.819
 heard and I have to be completely honest 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.519
 say that the tried and tested and happy 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.959
 80 points also says that the movie 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.790
 probably more than just this 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.590
 That's why I have to say one-sided stuff 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.790
 times quite relaxed be let's see what 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.319
 The film also has two Oscars 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.030
 get nominations and that's why I'm 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.700
 I know what was just us at it 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.260
 from the 20 march 2014 in the German 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.760
 Cinemas have to offer everyone 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.450
 If so, I'll keep you up to date 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.070
 you say 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.960
 you find that directly bad or bad 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.789
 oh said maybe that can be a little 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.620
 little more or is the theme easy 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.240
 for you through it's just always one 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.990
 very double-edged sword myself 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.970
 can only say 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.530
 my brother is actually a soldier and 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.600
 also stationed several times in Afghanistan 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.270
 was that the topic just often with pure 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.010
 pacifism is hard to discuss and 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.440
 It's just two very big and also 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.090
 There are tragic sides and yes there I am 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.830
 worthwhile with my trailer section 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.020
 So what do you say to the trader city 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.790
 like the comments and the likes one 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.260
 downloader like this track let it 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.520
 Who else will not stay there
