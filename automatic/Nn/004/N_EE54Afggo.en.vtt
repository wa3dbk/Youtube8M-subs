00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:08.580
 Tell me, folks, what are you talking about? 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.950
 and welcome everyone to another video 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.139
 in which I was as you know 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.170
 employees this year has not yet been 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.270
 announced also far will be released 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.570
 in only in November but there are some things 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.130
 new ones that you play painting around 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.930
 not exactly the new call of duty is 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.390
 more like this year's studio that will 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.060
 develop the game is between art then 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.520
 there are many things being speculated on 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.239
 the studio is what the theme will be 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.340
 of the game will be the vector 22 and black ops 3 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.030
 will have a way men as it goes 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.520
 be and today or yesterday the recently 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.950
 say the mark lan that is the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.960
 responsible head of the studio 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.960
 treyarch ended up giving a kind of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.420
 lecture or in an interview 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.920
 on dai cd ey keynote in las vegas it 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.620
 ended up saying some things well 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.650
 interesting about the way men and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.840
 one of them is even very curious because the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.770
 modus org according to he was not to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.330
 exist 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.040
 Then you must be asking yourself God. 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.470
 as it was not valid since it exists 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.600
 that one of the most legal ways available 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.070
 in the call of duty series after 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.590
 multiplayer there are people who like a lot 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.030
 more of multiplayer is to spend much more 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.119
 the way the shoulders than the actual 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.790
 multiplayer and and second it happens 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.890
 some very interesting things that I 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.350
 I'll explain to you here since in the 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.180
 time they felt this affinity 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.909
 with the series with the future had already 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.350
 developed such participations but 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.720
 from the 4 km activist ended up having 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.329
 a new system of development or 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.119
 be the next employees they 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.490
 would be carried out every two years or 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.040
 be a year inffinito air launched a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.100
 digger and in the other year to train and this 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.170
 It was happening there for a long time. 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.540
 until basically in the safe goals that there 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.549
 went back to work later we had 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.840
 a slide gamer and then the people 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.430
 You have to train with who you are now. 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.009
 three companies and we have a 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.340
 game development cycle of three 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.769
 years but then it was only two years 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.340
 and he was very inquisitive and in doing the 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.930
 upgrade of the year I want the décor is not had 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.760
 a very great expectation in relation to 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.800
 to the game since they had never done 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.989
 such a great job in relation to 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.849
 call of duty series and he was with the 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.560
 service already half way late campaign 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.660
 multiplayer mode things look like 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.049
 they were not working very well and they 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.340
 had this idea of ​​putting the way the 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.290
 men but it was a kind of 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.750
 joking was not at all serious 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.940
 he even suggested this to the rest of the 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.190
 Studio staff and also such board 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.099
 video and lots of people did not put faith 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.860
 that the way men would go forward would not 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.900
 would be successful since it is call of duty with 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.130
 the others have nothing to do with second 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.200
 this is a totally 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.329
 different and if you stop to analyze 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.290
 really does not make much sense but it 's the 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.530
 mark lane 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.060
 He thought he 's face to face, let's do it. 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.829
 I'm going to hit my chest. 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.440
 I'll put it here in the game as if 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.879
 an additional one and let's see where it is 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.000
 This is going to stop. 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.549
 and thanks to his idea of ​​putting it 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.109
 hit the chest and we will not put and 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.040
 Let's see what this really is going to 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.709
 to happen 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.350
 was what really made the series we are 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.620
 so spectacular and started with a modus 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.450
 the simple voter limited with the 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.130
 same multiplayer gameplay system 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.340
 such led is all that apparatus of the series 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.980
 call of duty in the matter of cuts is 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.440
 evolution to the weapon system 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.660
 It was a simple situation, however. 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.700
 very interesting for the time being that 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.910
 very pleased the players of koff last 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.769
 and today is one of the coolest ways but 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.410
 one of the most played 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.019
 within the series that it lasts and 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.880
 thanks to his insistence that today 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.310
 really we have a way men 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.319
 have other mirrored shadow games in the 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.079
 men of the future channel and also 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.850
 sledgehammer ended up putting the mode 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.640
 men 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.940
 in advanced offer since it did both 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.530
 success in cof 25 black ops 1 and also 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.090
 black ops 2 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.500
 so this is it people I wanted 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.510
 share it around with you and hope 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.980
 that you like this news thanks to the 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.280
 insistence of online marketing 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.800
 We had the opportunity and we're going 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.720
 have the opportunity now to play 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.370
 the modus org out next to 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.930
 Ombudsman also formerly 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.700
 had this option a and also remembering that 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.260
 the videogame does not have much more than nothing 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.650
 but keep six this several and several 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.960
 molds based on the way men 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.450
 On top of the place flowed Eduard is a 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.550
 series of matches in one of the 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.980
 runners of the series that has more modes 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.540
 NGOs have more templates by a way the 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.240
 men available from all over the internet 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.400
 for the future and four will not solve more 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.380
 has many templates and a coturno vector 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.770
 There are many deaths 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.260
 The new models are playing until today. 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.520
 no dilzon luiz no goal to act 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.500
 Who gets there and I hope you have 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.020
 liked today 20 thank you very much for 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.710
