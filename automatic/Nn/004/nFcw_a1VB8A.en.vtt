 with all due respect that he deserves to me 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.330
 I think you talk more about the triples 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:13.259
 on your back and you who is like a vision 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:15.509
 of free respect because they do not leave it bad 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.699
 in your position as a woman you take advantage 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.439
 you get to Chinese now you've gotten 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.600
 carla terms with york and I think that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.189
 you should behave or maintain the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.410
 composure in certain situations no 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:35.850
 problem will not hire and with networks or with 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:40.100
 public in written carla that can be 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.100
 an indignant god 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:55.500

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.989

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.989
 this man from india 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.989
 Y 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.640
 and also to scrub the face 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.210
 lizette versus 5 of the river 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.040
 but my relatives defend myself not 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.980
 sit in the program that you for that 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.020
 so that you learn to be a little more 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.860
 sincere keep your ideas tell the truth 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.860
 what's up boss 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.450
 would not be part of life lessons or 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.810
 teach you but yes to why things 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.810
 clear 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.730
 what you have the program what things 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.280
 machete was and that you take advantage as 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.320
 you are woman in machete wings to men 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.880
 and make them look bad, all things 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.050
 what do I say I say so much behind the scenes 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.190
 like in front of cameras and that's why 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.900
 I have this kind of problem because I am 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.430
 the only person who if you dare be 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.229
 on camera what I really 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.820
 I would like to apologize for the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.500
 comment that I made yesterday and in the morning 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.760
 I apologized to Carla and now I want to 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.820
 georgette because I think the goal 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.980
 that you were not the one I'm asking 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.709
 apologize and apologizes but it rang 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.440
 as it was very very compromise what 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.360
 I say well, viewers, I'm going to 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.010
 I do a lot, I do it because 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.330
 fans will actually feel that I am 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.550
 very badly raised then as he asked 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.980
 apologies at once and I do not like it I repeat 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.870
 again 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.340
 I left yesterday I do not even think 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.629
 program I said I think I have my 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.739
 words better than the correct adjective 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.209
 I wanted to joke a little with her 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.010
 tell me this one goes in or not like all the 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.549
 world does it but I did not know how to handle my 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.590
 words 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.000
 that's why I apologized maybe in front of 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.969
 who told you hypocrite in the morning 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.590
 because he told you hypocrite 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.700
 a problem that I think I have has is 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.140
 that always knows how to do other 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.909
 things but not like doing TV 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.709
 I feel deported about a 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.000
 but if it is felt that way I ask you 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.010
 sorry you know what doing 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.810

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.519
 he called well I apologize in the way 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.310
 that I had moments I 've kept and 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.870
 never until now have you approached 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.849
 apologize because you have not done it 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.930
 you can ask whoever you want 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.459
 I am a person that when he commits a 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.480
 mistake once you calm down always 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.040
 apologize for the people 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.079
 production but what's up with you 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.609
 I had every intention of apologizing 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.049
 because it was not something that was not in 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.730
 my hands I am new to television no 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.900

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.370
 I had the opportunity or not because 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.359
 when I wanted to blame everything 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.579
 first that there is the day that I 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.019
 I approached then to threaten me to castel badly 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.780
 from me at that time then why 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:30.200
