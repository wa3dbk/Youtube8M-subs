for<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> couple<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.510> videos<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.080> there

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
for a couple of videos here and there

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.330 
for a couple of videos here and there
but<00:00:34.199> i<00:00:34.320> am<00:00:34.440> not<00:00:34.559> planning<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.980> using<00:00:35.129> it

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
but i am not planning on using it

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.820 
but i am not planning on using it
extensively<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.809> stand<00:00:37.230> by<00:00:37.379> that<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.710> you'll

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
see it every now and then I thought I'd

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
see it every now and then I thought I'd
do<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> special<00:00:39.600> gun<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.410> am

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
do it for the special gun but I am

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.869

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
for mag on top of that it was quickly

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.030 
for mag on top of that it was quickly
nerf<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.629> was<00:03:09.780> not<00:03:09.959> very<00:03:10.319> badly<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.010> it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
nerf and it was not very badly and it

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.380 
nerf and it was not very badly and it
was<00:03:11.220> nerfed<00:03:11.340> begin<00:03:11.760> sometime<00:03:12.090> around

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
was nerfed begin sometime around

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.690 
was nerfed begin sometime around
November<00:03:13.049> so<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.650> was<00:03:13.769> nerfed<00:03:13.950> twice<00:03:14.400> actually

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
November so it was nerfed twice actually

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.339 
November so it was nerfed twice actually
once<00:03:15.329> in<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.510> first<00:03:15.690> few<00:03:15.840> days<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.049> release

once in the first few days of release
and<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:17.310> don't<00:03:17.640> think<00:03:17.730> that's<00:03:17.849> gonna<00:03:18.000> happen<00:03:18.180> to

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
and I don't think that's gonna happen to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.240 
and I don't think that's gonna happen to
this<00:03:18.510> gun<00:03:18.720> cuz<00:03:18.870> it's<00:03:18.989> not<00:03:19.049> that<00:03:19.319> vastly<00:03:19.680> opie<00:03:20.040> a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
to kill the damn guy but that's my point

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.129 
to kill the damn guy but that's my point
we're<00:04:00.180> going<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.359> go<00:04:00.450> into<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.750> oil<00:04:00.930> rig

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
we're going to go into the oil rig

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.890 
we're going to go into the oil rig
gameplay<00:04:01.470> here<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.239> to<00:04:03.239> be<00:04:03.329> honest<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.750> gun

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
gameplay here and to be honest the gun

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.449 
gameplay here and to be honest the gun
is<00:04:04.019> worth<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.379> it's<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.650> fun<00:04:04.859> gun<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.129> use<00:04:05.250> its

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
is worth it it's a fun gun to use its

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.729 
is worth it it's a fun gun to use its
cutting<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:06.060> fixes<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.810> one<00:04:07.079> actually<00:04:07.680> the

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
cutting it fixes the one actually the

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.520 
cutting it fixes the one actually the
two<00:04:07.919> problems<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.120> m107<00:04:09.840> series<00:04:10.349> tends

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
two problems that the m107 series tends

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.589 
two problems that the m107 series tends
to<00:04:10.650> face<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:11.010> accuracy<00:04:11.549> is<00:04:11.579> kind<00:04:12.150> of<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.299> slow

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
to face the accuracy is kind of a slow

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.750 
to face the accuracy is kind of a slow
spread<00:04:13.049> recovery<00:04:13.530> not<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.129> fastest<00:04:14.579> it's

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
spread recovery not the fastest it's

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.029 
spread recovery not the fastest it's
manageable<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:15.750> also<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.560> has<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.889> wrong

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
manageable but also it has the wrong

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.310 
manageable but also it has the wrong
draw<00:04:17.760> speed<00:04:18.060> which<00:04:18.359> is<00:04:18.570> still<00:04:18.810> kind<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.079> true

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
draw speed which is still kind of true

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.140 
draw speed which is still kind of true
the<00:04:19.859> variant<00:04:20.220> doesn't<00:04:20.519> really<00:04:20.639> change<00:04:20.729> that

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
the variant doesn't really change that

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.330 
the variant doesn't really change that
but<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:21.900> does<00:04:22.079> fix<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.530> portability<00:04:22.889> problem

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
but it does fix the portability problem
