00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Welcome the people to a new one 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.060
 format and indeed to youtube effect it 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.230
 Already there is some way out there 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.300
 it started around 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.460
 actually, this should follow exactly 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.240
 this follows a sequel about yukio 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.109
 But I have only a few facts 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.730
 to the judo found over the anime and 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.050
 So much came about because of that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.369
 I thought hey do not clap this 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.519
 in an effect follow rows but 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.519
 make a new format and you 're sitting 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.019
 I'm curious how it will arrive 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.170
 I hope it is reasonably well 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.980
 because it 's only about cards then 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.870
 Let's start 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.850
 in the anime from june to july 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.760
 Sexually, the dearest have everyone 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.440
 main characters 2500 attack and 2000 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.450
 defense down to the black 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.129
 magician because he has 2100 defense the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.199
 chance that here in the first round exo 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.690
 the complete pulls so the five cards 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.780
 is less than a percent exactly 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.969
 it is taken 0 0 0015 blablabla 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.680
 percent again, of course , as second 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.290
 starts and thus draws six cards 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.180
 a little higher chance the beautiful 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.650
 it is the fear and the fear of you 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.170
 defense function of all cards 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.150
 divide by 50 to allow for a total of 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.400
 a pleasant play foot contributes 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.890
 Well, if these cards do not exist 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.930
 because the crew of the grim reaper has like that 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.400
 pretty funny you pay otherwise 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.380
 in june would see 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.360
 but do not be afraid there are also cards for 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.830
 math joyful and sunny karakuri 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.869
 cards because if you have the first two 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.640
 pay the name multiplied then go 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.079
 the sum of it at the end of the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.079
 many times three examples 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.270
 The cat vampire hunter is said to be one 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.410
 allusion to the protagonist in 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.940
 be kenya 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.310
 this can be recognized by a cover of 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.960
 Katharina for the game boy advance because 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.320
 Not every citizen should be a whip 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.030
 I believe the black magician 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.430
 is not magical because there is 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.410
 an xy sedcards from him the one 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.540
 allows a whole match with one 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.010
 You just have to win the beat 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.290
 left points of the opponent with this 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.180
 bring cat to zero and you have already 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.979
 also magically won three duels 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.110
 so people that 's it with the first episode 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.110
 New york shows me with one 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.739
 rating as you liked it 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.020
 Accordingly, it goes on 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.700
 with this format and by the way if you 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.920
 any better name comes up than 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.790
 video card away then it seems to me please 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.730
 in the comments 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.930
 and yes, I would say that has 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.930
 in the first episode of the skin are pure
