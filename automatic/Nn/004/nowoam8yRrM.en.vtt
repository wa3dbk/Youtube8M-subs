neat<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.350> haven't<00:00:22.560> done<00:00:22.710> as<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.519> shower<00:00:23.730> real

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.939 
neat I haven't done as a shower real
time<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.949> didn't<00:00:26.189> know<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.449> in<00:00:27.949> Reverse

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
time and I didn't know that in Reverse

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.530 
time and I didn't know that in Reverse
soul<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.340> they<00:00:29.490> actually<00:00:30.080> I'm<00:00:31.080> gonna<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.349> this

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
soul was they actually I'm gonna do this

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.380 
soul was they actually I'm gonna do this
so<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> wonder<00:00:33.960> if<00:00:34.170> elites<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.250> know

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
so I wonder if elites you know

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.479 
so I wonder if elites you know
unfortunately<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> elites<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.079> toys

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
unfortunately the elites are not toys

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.400 
unfortunately the elites are not toys
but<00:00:38.489> there<00:00:38.670> are<00:00:38.700> little<00:00:38.879> bears<00:00:39.090> everywhere

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
but there are little bears everywhere

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.479 
but there are little bears everywhere
and<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.920> similar<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> goblin<00:00:42.270> rift

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
and this is similar to a goblin rift

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.040 
and this is similar to a goblin rift
except<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> Goblin<00:00:44.940> rift<00:00:45.210> which<00:00:45.750> I've<00:00:45.899> only
