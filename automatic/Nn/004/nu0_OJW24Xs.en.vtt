00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
heist dlc trailer we can in fact make an

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.210 
heist dlc trailer we can in fact make an
educated<00:01:18.360> guess<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.680> beginning<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
educated guess so beginning with the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.950 
educated guess so beginning with the
lamb<00:01:20.430> patty<00:01:20.670> Casco<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:21.840> most

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
lamb patty Casco and this will most

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.109 
lamb patty Casco and this will most
likely<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.290> some<00:01:22.590> form<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> sports<00:01:23.220> car<00:01:23.520> every

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
likely be some form of sports car every

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.300 
likely be some form of sports car every
car<00:01:24.299> made<00:01:24.479> by<00:01:24.509> lamb<00:01:24.840> patty<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.409> based<00:01:25.770> off<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
car made by lamb patty is based off the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.490 
car made by lamb patty is based off the
Maserati<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.509> I'm<00:01:27.600> guessing<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.290> some

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
Maserati so I'm guessing it will be some

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.590 
Maserati so I'm guessing it will be some
form<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.890> sports<00:01:29.340> car<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:30.030> moving<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
form of sports car now moving on to the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.090 
form of sports car now moving on to the
next<00:01:30.780> vehicle<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.590> ding<00:01:31.860> current

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
next vehicle we have the ding current

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.950 
next vehicle we have the ding current
juro<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.150> most<00:01:33.329> likely<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.659> some

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
juro and this will most likely be some

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.140 
juro and this will most likely be some
form<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> motorcycle<00:01:35.040> possibly<00:01:35.549> even<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.909> dirt
