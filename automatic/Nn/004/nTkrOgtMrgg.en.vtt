00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.740
 you see real footage recorded 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.570
 witnessed the incident on the road 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.880
 which one of its members is rude 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.100
 violates the law the attacker starts 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.550
 beat man then picks up 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.680
 gun threatens beats the gun victim 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.420
 attacks helplessly man raises 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.060
 hands humbly allows himself to be beaten 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.279
 I hope that the striker is still not 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.820
 will shoot and all this could 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.770
 end differently for ordinary 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.440
 human dispute on the road is not yet 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.559
 reason to shoot a pistol if 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.000
 There is no threat to life and health 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.010
 no weapon can be used 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 however, lovers of fights on the roads 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.140
 spit on the law you may not be threatened 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.579
 only traumatic but also gunshot 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.960
 arms and so how to speak if in the hands 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.070
 have an aggressive person 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.460
 pistol 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.949
 options two humbly wait for him 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.720
 either calm down or shoot an option 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.240
 2 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.140
 at the risk of getting a bullet to do something 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.140
 for your protection 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.119
 cases of traumatic weapons 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.600
 shoot people without any valid 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.090
 reasons 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.460
 a huge number of shots here which 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.920
 can be freely seen on the Internet 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.110
 in all these cases, people who 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.300
 shot from traumatians could not 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.850
 and did not have time to do anything to 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.740
 prevent a pistol shot 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.500
 Of course the choice is whether to defend him from 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.390
 threats of traumatic weapons or 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.940
 rely on the prudence of the attacker 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.350
 everyone does for himself however if 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.630
 consider the practical aspect 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.750
 action is what can be done in this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.750
 situations 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.619
 what is the problem 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.150
 if we put a gun, then we can already 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.189
 treat as a threat to life and 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.670
 health and apply self-defense techniques 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:13.090
 and now I will reveal the secrets of it 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.040
 reception see we leave the line of fire 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.700
 grab the hand the gun is already looking in 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.700
 the other side 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.290
 then goes knocking the gun out of your hand 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.459
 look like that 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.260
 not palm not edge of the palm about powerful 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.410
 movement of the forearm the gun flies out of 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.410
 arms 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:41.370
 then comes a punch to the head 1 2 3 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.799
 we are stuck in and hit the knee 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.159
 belly or according to such tough measures need 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.930
 in order to force aggressive 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.930
 attacker with weapon stop 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.200
 attack he failed to attack again 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.159
 let's show quickly again this trick 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.440
 look and so raised their hands go away with 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:09.540
 line of fire we pour out the gun hit the head 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:15.120
 blow and blow to everything goes literally 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:18.319
 one and a half two seconds and necessarily 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.840
 necessary when you knock out a gun 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:24.120
 drop the attacker's stroke as you can 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.829
 you will have a few seconds in order 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.870
 to leave again real video 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.329
 fixed by outdoor cameras 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.849
 observations as a result of conflict on 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.609
 road participants start shooting each 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.370
 friend of a traumatic pistol sweat 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:45.530
 beating all this footage addition 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.530
 what happens on the roads every day 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.310
 let's consider the situation when you 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.370
 sit in the car you are threatened 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.110
 traumatic weapons on the doors and windows 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.510
 you are closed so here is one very important 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.670
 Do not open the board 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.460
 the doors do not go out do not disassemble and 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.740
 still closed doors and windows is 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:11.950
 for you though not very reliably on 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:13.990
 rubber bullet protection if an attacker 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.000
 opened the door and threatens you with a pistol 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.470
 you have every reason to apply 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.600
 traumatic weapon 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.940
 but there is one feature legally 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.440
 it is very difficult to apply the law forbids 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.570
 shoot less than one 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.440
 meters shoot in the head in the neck in the area 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.160
 from iv to 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.870
 in the end, if we talk about survival, then 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.630
 some cases you will have to break 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.150
 the law if only to comply with the letter of the law 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.500
 then chances of salvation can be 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.500
 destroyed is real life
