00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 That's how you hurt when you hire a crook. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 I can convince anyone of anything. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.500
 It's an art to convince people to trust you. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
 - I want to. - What do you know now, I'm not taking you. 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.000
 Maybe you could teach me ... 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 ...in your room. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.500
 - Wow! - Seriously ? 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.500
 - Do you feel sexy? - Little bit. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Yes ? Good. Let's beat him. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 We're 30 people in total. Everyone gets a percentage. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Act and go quickly. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 - Who is the girl ? - Our trainee. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.000
 - You putting it on? - I'm here too. 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 - No, Farhad, I do not. - Should. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.000
 You are never allowed to leave the character. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 Where are my black brothers? 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
 - I'll take care of it. - What the ? 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Sorry! 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.500
 - Congratulations, you are a criminal! - You are extraordinarily talented. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.500
 THIS YEAR 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Where's the big hit? I thought you were doing that. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Which one we earn so much that we retire? 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 It needs discretion. Without mistakes. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.500
 You seem trusted, but you do not know me. 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.000
 Is he your target? Wonderful... 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 It's not good to mess with this one. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.500
 - All, $ 1,100,000. - Nicky, it's my money too! 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.500
 Now it becomes interesting! 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.500
 In this branch there is no place for feelings. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.500
 - You die if you give them away. - How is it ? 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 Dude! 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.000
 There are two kinds of people in the world. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.000
 Some are hammers, others are nails. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.500
 You decide what you want to be. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 FOCUS 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.500
