but as the pants are very high waisted I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.130 
but as the pants are very high waisted I
don't<00:01:34.050> feel<00:01:34.440> too<00:01:34.979> exposed<00:01:38.270> okay<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.960> is

don't feel too exposed okay so this is

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.469

how I carry the muse - I'm left-handed

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.390 
how I carry the muse - I'm left-handed
so<00:01:42.900> it's<00:01:43.170> always<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> then<00:01:44.280> I

it's really a pain to get in and out of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.080 
it's really a pain to get in and out of
this<00:01:49.350> bag<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.520> very<00:01:50.729> quickly<00:01:50.970> show

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
this bag but just to very quickly show

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.330 
this bag but just to very quickly show
you<00:01:51.330> what<00:01:51.510> I<00:01:51.690> have<00:01:52.020> inside<00:01:52.500> here<00:01:52.560> I'll<00:01:53.010> start

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you what I have inside here I'll start

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.050 
you what I have inside here I'll start
off<00:01:53.550> with<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.810> back<00:01:55.140> pocket<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.800> to<00:01:56.100> me<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.580> got

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
off with the back pocket and to me I got

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.290 
off with the back pocket and to me I got
a<00:01:57.090> feel<00:01:57.330> that<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.750> bag<00:01:58.610> really<00:01:59.610> resembles

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
a feel that this bag really resembles

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.499 
a feel that this bag really resembles
the<00:02:00.450> Saline<00:02:01.550> what<00:02:02.550> is<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> name<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.330> bank

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
the Saline what is the name of the bank

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.139 
the Saline what is the name of the bank
trapeze<00:02:04.170> bag<00:02:04.649> just<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:05.940> it

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
trapeze bag just that you know it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.990 
trapeze bag just that you know it
doesn't<00:02:06.300> have<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.810> two<00:02:07.020> flaps<00:02:07.380> at<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> side

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
doesn't have the two flaps at the side

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.940 
doesn't have the two flaps at the side
so<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.720> feel<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:09.989> saline<00:02:10.590> took

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
so I really feel like saline took

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.180 
so I really feel like saline took
inspiration<00:02:11.880> from<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.870> muse<00:02:13.230> -<00:02:13.500> because<00:02:13.890> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
inspiration from the muse - because a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.449 
inspiration from the muse - because a
lot<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.209> pretty<00:02:15.810> similar<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.650> at<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
lot of it is pretty similar so at the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.000 
lot of it is pretty similar so at the
back<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:17.910> this<00:02:18.150> big<00:02:18.540> pocket<00:02:19.380> which<00:02:19.800> is

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
back you have this big pocket which is

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.040 
back you have this big pocket which is
very<00:02:20.370> useful<00:02:20.640> because<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.540> difficult<00:02:21.780> to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
very useful because it's so difficult to
