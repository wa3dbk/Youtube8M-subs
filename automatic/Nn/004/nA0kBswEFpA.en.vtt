00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.549
 Well, not all this is the first 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.740
 minecraft video that took a minute 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.990
 real because this game is pretty 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.330
 interesting and has too many things in 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.700
 which take advantage of 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.379
 entertainment or being creative 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.240
 then the first video is the most 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.400
 simple and basic that exists in everything 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.339
 minecraft that is to make the table 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.070
 crafting this will help us to 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.869
 Do practically 90% of things 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.320
 what can be done here that are 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.980
 too many quite exaggerated and good 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.720
 we started 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.840
 Well, your first visit is 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.190
 find a tree 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.190
 how can you see music here 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.790
 you can only normally when they appear 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.990
 First 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.490
 it's so with the little hand 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.130
 good with the hand with the trunk 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.230
 they're going to start hitting us they do not have the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.000
 clip and a piece of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.570
 wood 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.650
 and if you want to be under the tree 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 your 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.510
 but we're going to need this piece of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.750
 wood this trunk 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.280
 well then we press the key to open 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.720
 The inventory 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.930
 and we put the wooden box here 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.960
 we took out the four tables the four of 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.750
 wooden board and the four the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.050
 we grab with a left click and with the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.880
 right click 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.210
 we are going to press on each of the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.690
 tables and the table will be formed 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.690
 crafting 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.960
 and that's all has already got more 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.470
 space to create things I do not know that 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.930
 we want to create 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.590
 with a dynamite 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.800
 I do not have enough so you do not 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.800
 pulls out 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.400
 the gunpowder they have from the clippers 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.400
 we have 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.490
 neither activates things 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.110
 internal 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.379
 but anyway 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.530
 already to pick up the keeps in click of 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.799
 left they destroy it and return it to 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.799
 to have 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.579
 Well, I think that's all 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.069
 pulls out of consecutive videos because they're going to 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.540
 do something short but I do it more than 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.890
 nothing for the futures that come more 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.710
 ahead of how to do this 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.400
 guns firing tnt but they are the 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.459
 more advanced things a little bit that 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.190
 it's all I'm doctor 21 and sorry we were 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.170
 finished video tutorials but I have not 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.880
 had time until now I have not had 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.410
 you win the truth I am sincere because 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.940
 I've been several years in the electronic 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.880
 investigating editing and various things 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.520
 Well, there is a moment that 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.020
 you get to know something quite and you already 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.180
 you crash and know more unfortunately 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.770
 but anyway that does not take away the taste of 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.590
 keep doing the videos is something 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.290
 dizzy 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.290
 soon I will return we have 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:33.959
 well that's all Florentine see you 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.959
 in the next video see you later
