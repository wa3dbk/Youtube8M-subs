00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.260
 or for growers you remember the 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.990
 reusable container that we use 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:18.680
 it got good, well, here it is 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.860
 the zucchini you see how it is in 15 days 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.080
 the size that you have taken and well I am going to 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.650
 explain a little bit this is the male flower 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.380
 vale is a flower with a very long hair and 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.230
 here this flower and has fertilized another flower 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.090
 which are the females and that's why you're 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.330
 spoiling well this is the female flower 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.629
 the flower and here the channel starts to come out 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.370
 quoted you see how big you have how 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.010
 it is forming well this is another flower 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.080
 macho the much longer hair comes what 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.239
 what are we going to do here a bit of no 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.799
 we have is in a container is not in 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.680
 So, what are we going to do? 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:57.049
 is a bit of a clarification or clarification of the 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.960
 plant is worth not so much need not 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.760
 we can pretend that it produces the same in 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.989
 a container always nest that on land 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.960
 therefore what we have given is a 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.110
 small fruit thinning is worth here 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.540
 we have a group of flowers which 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.229
 Well here it is curdling a bit but what 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.350
 let's remove 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.230
 let's try to select a little 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.960
 both the male flower 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.150
 like the females to not leave many and 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.340
 that fruit that gives us that we ring order 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.220
 ok here we have a little bit lower 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.850
 another and then with good scissors 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.510
 sharp 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.980
 what we do is remove good value here 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.570
 we see 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.640
 like there are good courgettes these leaves 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.680
 that are here broken others can go 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.650
 removing it , we can remove it 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.200
 many because the more leaves we remove 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.060
 more lung we are removing eliminating 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.770
 of the plant but good some small 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.140
 leaves so there's a little more 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.880
 light is not wrong to remove them 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.870
 here we have some flower some leaf 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.860
 old woman 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.410
 a little dry and back we are removing 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.530
 do not pass at the time of cutting always 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.150
 the leaves a little old and dry 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.760

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.130

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.480
 more tiny and such a good one because I know 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.430
 we are going to remove it is worth giving us fear 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.910

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.620
