00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
don't know you're doing you don't know

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.460 
don't know you're doing you don't know
what<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.250> aim<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.640> series's<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:25.289> mean

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
what the aim of the series's and I mean

what the aim of the series's and I mean
there's<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> lot<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.769> rotor<00:00:26.099> division<00:00:26.519> ones<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
there's a lot of rotor division ones and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.820 
there's a lot of rotor division ones and
the<00:00:27.539> road<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> glory<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.320> which<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.710> think

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the road to glory so which I just think

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.950 
the road to glory so which I just think
we're<00:00:28.949> boring<00:00:29.279> because<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:30.570> know<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> end

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
we're boring because you know the end

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.139 
we're boring because you know the end
isn't<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.470> final<00:00:32.189> thing<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.610> kind<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
isn't a final thing it's just kind of a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.479 
isn't a final thing it's just kind of a
they<00:00:33.480> decide<00:00:34.260> when<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.469> stops<00:00:34.680> whereas<00:00:35.340> this

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
they decide when it stops whereas this

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.830 
they decide when it stops whereas this
series<00:00:35.790> will<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.030> an<00:00:36.239> actual<00:00:36.360> end<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
series will have an actual end to it

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.600 
series will have an actual end to it
okay<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> whole<00:00:37.950> idea<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.340> here<00:00:38.520> is

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
okay so the whole idea of this here is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.130 
okay so the whole idea of this here is
that<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.790> build<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.329> team<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.020> course

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that I build this team now of course

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
you're missing that left mid spots I'll

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.110 
you're missing that left mid spots I'll
show<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.450> why<00:00:42.920> basically<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.789> put

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
on Twitter can you lend me 800 k roughly

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.229 
on Twitter can you lend me 800 k roughly
100<00:00:49.230> k<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:50.309> nicely<00:00:50.700> been<00:00:51.000> enough

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
100 k and that's nicely been enough

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.779 
100 k and that's nicely been enough
because<00:00:51.600> as<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:51.960> has<00:00:52.440> had<00:00:52.649> at<00:00:52.789> 66,000

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
because as you can see has had at 66,000

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.240 
because as you can see has had at 66,000
and<00:00:54.180> I've<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.660> got<00:00:54.780> 20,000<00:00:55.379> left<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and I've really got 20,000 left and a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.299 
and I've really got 20,000 left and a
spring<00:00:56.850> /<00:00:56.969> about<00:00:57.180> 60<00:00:57.510> k<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.809> whole<00:00:57.960> day<00:00:58.140> so

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
spring / about 60 k the whole day so

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.650 
spring / about 60 k the whole day so
yeah<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> know<00:00:59.550> that's<00:00:59.699> roughly<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> price<00:01:00.420> in

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
yeah I know that's roughly the price in

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660 
yeah I know that's roughly the price in
the<00:01:00.719> minute<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.739> he'd<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.010> left<00:01:02.340> mid<00:01:02.520> if

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the minute and so he'd be left mid if

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
the minute and so he'd be left mid if
you<00:01:02.879> wandering<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> same<00:01:04.589> long

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
you wandering so this is the same long

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.289 
you wandering so this is the same long
to<00:01:05.010> build<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.339> basically<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> Chelsea<00:01:06.119> team

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
to build it's basically the Chelsea team

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.969 
to build it's basically the Chelsea team
and<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.900> might<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.049> thinking<00:01:07.140> why<00:01:07.590> storage

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and you might be thinking why storage

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
and you might be thinking why storage
not<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> mid<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> reasons<00:01:09.630> for

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
not right to mid all the reasons for

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.480 
not right to mid all the reasons for
that<00:01:09.810> because<00:01:10.049> I'm<00:01:10.439> trying<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.710> build<00:01:10.860> quite<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that because I'm trying to build quite a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.609 
that because I'm trying to build quite a
current<00:01:11.790> Chelsea<00:01:12.119> team<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:13.229> course<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
current Chelsea team and of course and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.780 
current Chelsea team and of course and
what<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:13.979> thinking<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.310> doing<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.610> putting

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
what I was thinking of doing is putting

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090 
what I was thinking of doing is putting
matter<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:15.990> Left<00:01:16.290> hazard<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.860> right

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
matter on the Left hazard on the right

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.580 
matter on the Left hazard on the right
and<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:18.000> having<00:01:18.210> Lampard<00:01:18.750> an<00:01:18.900> Oscar<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.439> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and then having Lampard an Oscar but of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
and then having Lampard an Oscar but of
course<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.280> matters<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.180> attacking<00:01:21.479> mid

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
course you know matters in attacking mid

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.880 
course you know matters in attacking mid
and<00:01:22.460> has<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.790> left<00:01:24.030> mid<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:25.590> chemistry

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
and has the left mid and for chemistry
