00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hey guys i have another app review for

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.869 
hey guys i have another app review for
you<00:00:02.939> today<00:00:03.140> today<00:00:04.140> we're<00:00:04.319> looking<00:00:04.529> at

00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:04.879 
you today today we're looking at

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.089 
you today today we're looking at
seasonality<00:00:05.879> go<00:00:06.450> it's<00:00:07.049> basically<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.649> weather

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
seasonality go it's basically a weather

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.049 
seasonality go it's basically a weather
application<00:00:08.340> for<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.150> iPad<00:00:10.820> it's<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.880> little

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
application for the iPad it's a little

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.810 
application for the iPad it's a little
bit<00:00:12.150> different<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.630> than<00:00:13.200> other<00:00:13.820> applications

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
bit different in than other applications

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.880 
bit different in than other applications
I've<00:00:15.269> seen<00:00:15.570> because<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.990> kind<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.260> offers<00:00:16.650> some

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
I've seen because it kind of offers some

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.660 
I've seen because it kind of offers some
more<00:00:17.130> features<00:00:17.400> than<00:00:18.590> your<00:00:19.590> standard<00:00:19.949> you

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
more features than your standard you

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.240 
more features than your standard you
know<00:00:20.699> whether<00:00:21.060> blog<00:00:21.330> or<00:00:21.800> Weather<00:00:22.800> Channel

information you would like to look at

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.139 
information you would like to look at
you<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.410> even<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.649> multiple<00:00:35.370> screens<00:00:35.760> that

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you can even have multiple screens that

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.720 
you can even have multiple screens that
will<00:00:36.360> show<00:00:36.570> different<00:00:36.960> stuff<00:00:37.610> here's<00:00:38.610> the

set<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.640> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.300> application<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:47.000> here<00:00:48.000> we

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
set up on the application and here we

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.299 
set up on the application and here we
can<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.600> our<00:00:49.160> current<00:00:50.160> temperature<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
can see our current temperature and

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.760 
can see our current temperature and
pressure<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.789> wind<00:00:54.000> speed<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.870> couple

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
pressure and wind speed and a couple

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.380

other<00:00:56.120> current<00:00:57.120> information<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:59.059> here<00:01:00.059> next

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
other current information and here next

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.510 
other current information and here next
to<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.070> seven<00:01:02.070> day<00:01:02.219> weather

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
to it we have a seven day weather

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.780 
to it we have a seven day weather
forecast<00:01:03.320> then<00:01:04.320> obviously<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> radar

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
forecast then obviously we have a radar

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.969 
forecast then obviously we have a radar
map<00:01:06.240> which<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.100> animate<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
map which you can you know animate the

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.770 
map which you can you know animate the
radar<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.840> graph<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
radar and here we have a graph of the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
radar and here we have a graph of the
past<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.259> current<00:01:16.430> temperature<00:01:17.430> also<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.770 
over the projected future and what you
can<00:01:36.479> do<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:39.329> second

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
can do is you can go to the second

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.630 
can do is you can go to the second

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
graphs and here we see a temperature

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.649 
graphs and here we see a temperature

not<00:01:55.409> near<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> coast<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> be

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
not near the coast it's not going to be

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.719 
not near the coast it's not going to be
any<00:01:57.210> sort<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.200> wave<00:01:58.500> height<00:01:58.530> set<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.640> my

any sort of wave height set for my
location<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.420> obviously<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
location and obviously because it's the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.230 
location and obviously because it's the
middle<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.860> summer<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.060> any

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
middle of summer it's not like any

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.730 
middle of summer it's not like any
snowfall<00:02:03.689> information<00:02:04.530> from

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
location on the third screen they give

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.260 
location on the third screen they give
you<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.789> radar<00:02:09.619> screen<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:12.150> know

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
you is just a radar screen you know

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.240 
you is just a radar screen you know
where<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.540> can<00:02:12.660> interact<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.319> draw<00:02:14.069> in

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
where you can interact and draw in

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.760 
where you can interact and draw in
closer<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.970> your<00:02:15.360> location<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.400> monitor<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
closer to your location and monitor the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.640 
closer to your location and monitor the
radar<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:19.950> way<00:02:21.080> then<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.200> gives<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
radar that way then it gives you the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.970 
radar that way then it gives you the
option<00:02:22.970> over<00:02:23.970> here<00:02:24.390> where<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.349> can<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
option over here where you can have the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.199 
option over here where you can have the
sidebar<00:02:26.489> disappear<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.980> just<00:02:28.980> look<00:02:29.250> at<00:02:29.489> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
sidebar disappear and just look at the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.900 
sidebar disappear and just look at the
page<00:02:30.450> without<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.290> sidebar<00:02:31.769> kind<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.760> gives

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
page without the sidebar kind of gives

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.370 
page without the sidebar kind of gives
you<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.030> bit<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.599> little<00:02:34.590> bit<00:02:34.709> bigger<00:02:36.380> screen

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
you a bit of a little bit bigger screen

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.910 
you a bit of a little bit bigger screen
show<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.830> information<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:40.080> then<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.769> can

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
show the information and then you can
