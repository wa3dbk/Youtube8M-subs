John Cusack and I think he's a good
actor<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.660> he<00:00:57.750> brings<00:00:57.930> somebody<00:00:58.199> to

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
actor and I think he brings somebody to

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.900 
actor and I think he brings somebody to
this<00:00:58.440> role<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.190> something<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.760> another

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
this role that is something that another

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.430 
this role that is something that another
actor<00:01:00.300> definitely<00:01:00.660> could<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:01.050> done<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
few scenes he was overacting in my

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.130 
few scenes he was overacting in my
opinion<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.450> was<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:09.930> too<00:01:10.110> much

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
opinion it was just a little too much

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.200 
opinion it was just a little too much
just<00:01:10.619> too<00:01:10.799> soon<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> movie<00:01:11.700> went<00:01:12.090> on

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
just too soon but as the movie went on

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.940 
just too soon but as the movie went on
as<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> plot<00:01:12.840> progressed<00:01:13.290> as<00:01:13.530> his<00:01:13.710> character

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
as the plot progressed as his character

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.350 
as the plot progressed as his character
matured<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.610> little<00:01:14.700> bit<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:15.150> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
matured a little bit because this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.609 
matured a little bit because this
character<00:01:15.509> actually<00:01:15.840> matures<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.380> lot

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
character actually matures a lot

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.050 
character actually matures a lot
throughout<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.040> movie<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.490> anyone<00:01:17.880> would

him appeared doors open and he was
revealed<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.180> more<00:01:24.390> depth<00:01:24.630> than

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
revealed to have more depth than

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.539 
revealed to have more depth than
originally<00:01:25.409> he<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> very<00:01:26.100> beginning

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
originally he was in the very beginning

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.010 
originally he was in the very beginning
and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.700> liked<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:26.939> about<00:01:27.180> his<00:01:27.509> character<00:01:27.840> one

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and I liked that about his character one

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
and I liked that about his character one
of<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> things<00:01:28.350> though<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> definitely

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of the things though that I definitely

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.410 
of the things though that I definitely
noticed<00:01:29.340> during<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.610> movie<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.150> felt

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
noticed during this movie was it felt

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.880 
noticed during this movie was it felt
like<00:01:30.570> there<00:01:30.720> were<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.900> few<00:01:31.229> scenes<00:01:31.619> like

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
like there were a few scenes like

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.710 
like there were a few scenes like
missing<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.939> could<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.360> tell<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
missing like I could just tell the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.390 
missing like I could just tell the
production<00:01:34.259> something<00:01:34.650> was<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
production something was going on in the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.130 
production something was going on in the
production<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:35.909> movie<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.329> did<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.900> go

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
production this movie that did not go

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.510 
production this movie that did not go
well<00:01:37.350> because<00:01:37.710> there<00:01:37.890> were<00:01:37.979> certain<00:01:38.159> scenes

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
well because there were certain scenes

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.370 
well because there were certain scenes
where<00:01:38.759> they<00:01:38.820> would<00:01:38.970> start<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.450> last<00:01:39.750> time<00:01:40.020> we

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
where they would start and last time we

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.450 
where they would start and last time we
saw<00:01:40.560> these<00:01:40.710> characters<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.250> were<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
saw these characters they were in a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.270 
saw these characters they were in a
certain<00:01:41.579> spot<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.840> seems<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.560> where<00:01:44.070> are

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
certain spot now it seems like where are

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.530 
certain spot now it seems like where are
they<00:01:44.490> how<00:01:44.820> did<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.210> here

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
they how did they get here

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.719 
they how did they get here
something<00:01:46.350> should<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.619> happened<00:01:46.890> there<00:01:47.430> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
something should have happened there to

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.120 
something should have happened there to
branch<00:01:48.119> into<00:01:48.630> what<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.869> are<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.009> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
branch into what we are now in and it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.620 
branch into what we are now in and it
just<00:01:50.340> seemed<00:01:50.520> very<00:01:50.700> strange<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.570> were

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
just seemed very strange like there were

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.440 
just seemed very strange like there were
entire<00:01:51.930> scenes<00:01:52.350> either<00:01:52.920> deleted<00:01:53.549> or<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:54.329> even

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
entire scenes either deleted or not even

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.330 
entire scenes either deleted or not even
filmed<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.170> needed<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:55.890> basically

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
filmed that needed to be there basically

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.679 
filmed that needed to be there basically
I<00:01:56.430> think<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> main<00:01:57.000> problem<00:01:57.180> with<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.509> movie

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
I think the main problem with this movie

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.990 
I think the main problem with this movie
is<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.140> feels<00:01:58.439> very<00:01:58.610> unbalanced<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.850> can

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
is it feels very unbalanced and you can

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670 
is it feels very unbalanced and you can
easily<00:02:00.210> look<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.780> say<00:02:00.899> that's<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> directors

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
easily look and say that's the directors

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.289 
easily look and say that's the directors
fault<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.460> my<00:02:02.610> opinion<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.119> might

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
fault and in my opinion it might

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.459 
fault and in my opinion it might
actually<00:02:03.509> be<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.899> think<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
actually be I think this is a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.230 
actually be I think this is a
good-looking<00:02:05.070> movie<00:02:05.369> some<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.759> shots<00:02:06.000> are

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
good-looking movie some of the shots are

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.180 
good-looking movie some of the shots are
really<00:02:06.390> good<00:02:06.869> looking<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.680> feel<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
really good looking but I feel like the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.150 
really good looking but I feel like the
movie<00:02:08.369> tonally<00:02:09.090> was<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:09.690> kind<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.160> naturally

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
movie tonally was just kind of naturally

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.770 
movie tonally was just kind of naturally
the<00:02:11.310> direct

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
the direct

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.750 
the direct
there's<00:02:12.010> responsibility<00:02:13.010> there<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.340> make<00:02:13.580> you

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
there's responsibility there to make you

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.059 
there's responsibility there to make you
feel<00:02:14.180> as<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:14.600> from<00:02:15.170> scene<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.440> scene<00:02:15.620> we're

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
feel as if from scene to scene we're

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.590 
feel as if from scene to scene we're
watching<00:02:16.430> something<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.850> would<00:02:17.209> logically

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
watching something that would logically

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.090 
watching something that would logically
take<00:02:17.870> place<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.319> way<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.770> how<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
take place this way and this is how the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.830 
take place this way and this is how the
character<00:02:19.550> should<00:02:19.760> be<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.600> how<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
character should be and this is how the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.660 
character should be and this is how the
characters<00:02:21.260> progress<00:02:21.650> but<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.280> just<00:02:22.430> kind<00:02:22.610> of

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
characters progress but it just kind of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.820 
characters progress but it just kind of
felt<00:02:22.910> very<00:02:23.150> rocky<00:02:23.569> as<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.050> movie<00:02:24.260> went<00:02:24.470> on<00:02:24.590> but

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
felt very rocky as the movie went on but

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.440 
felt very rocky as the movie went on but
honestly<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.220> think<00:02:25.340> my<00:02:25.550> main<00:02:25.760> issue<00:02:26.060> with<00:02:26.300> this

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
honestly I think my main issue with this

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.570 
honestly I think my main issue with this
movie<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.200> motive<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.980> killer<00:02:28.250> it's

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
movie is the motive of the killer it's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.390 
movie is the motive of the killer it's
so<00:02:28.940> glossed<00:02:29.480> over<00:02:29.810> like<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.530> just<00:02:30.770> it's<00:02:31.010> not

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
so glossed over like it's just it's not

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.550 
so glossed over like it's just it's not
really<00:02:31.760> explained<00:02:32.390> in<00:02:32.660> much<00:02:32.870> depth<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.380> guy

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
really explained in much depth this guy

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.229 
really explained in much depth this guy
is<00:02:33.620> like<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.100> meticulous<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:34.819> do<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.030> things

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
is like so meticulous so do the things

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.180 
is like so meticulous so do the things
that<00:02:35.390> he<00:02:35.510> does<00:02:35.660> if<00:02:36.020> he<00:02:36.319> sets<00:02:36.680> up<00:02:36.890> all<00:02:37.040> this

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
that he does if he sets up all this

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.920 
that he does if he sets up all this
stuff<00:02:37.489> so<00:02:37.760> well<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.209> seems<00:02:38.480> like<00:02:38.540> they<00:02:38.750> should

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
stuff so well it seems like they should

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.350 
stuff so well it seems like they should
have<00:02:39.050> given<00:02:39.230> him<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.830> better<00:02:40.250> reason<00:02:40.850> to<00:02:41.030> get

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
have given him a better reason to get
