00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
there what I did is go into object

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.740 
there what I did is go into object
dropper<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.149> I<00:00:54.149> got<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.629> these<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:57.120> I

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750

come up jump on top of this get a little
the<00:01:12.180> speed<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.659> jump<00:01:13.020> over<00:01:13.290> past<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.920> Eddy

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
the speed and jump over past this Eddy

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.800 
the speed and jump over past this Eddy
thing<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.479> I'm<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:17.670> took<00:01:17.850> me<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> just

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
thing and I'm here it took me I just

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.090 
thing and I'm here it took me I just
trying<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> find<00:01:19.320> different<00:01:19.409> spots<00:01:19.830> try<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
trying to find different spots try to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.740 
trying to find different spots try to
get<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> glitch<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.729> work<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.509> finally

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
get the glitch to work and I finally

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
get the glitch to work and I finally
found<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> lot<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.270> speed

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
found one and you get a lot of speed

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.210 
found one and you get a lot of speed
once<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.200> flying<00:01:25.619> pretty<00:01:25.799> high<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.979> just

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
once you get flying pretty high you just

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.620 
once you get flying pretty high you just
go<00:01:26.580> under<00:01:26.729> spread-eagle<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.299> off<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
go under spread-eagle and off to the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.450 
go under spread-eagle and off to the
side<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.960> let<00:01:28.080> you'll<00:01:28.229> land<00:01:28.439> over<00:01:28.710> there<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
side and let you'll land over there and

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.210 
side and let you'll land over there and
then<00:01:29.549> using<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.180> get<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:31.220> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
then using that you can get to here and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.539 
then using that you can get to here and
you<00:01:32.610> can<00:01:32.700> skate<00:01:32.970> up<00:01:33.409> that's<00:01:34.409> pretty<00:01:35.070> much<00:01:35.400> how

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you can skate up that's pretty much how

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.800 
you can skate up that's pretty much how
you<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.180> pretty<00:01:36.540> simple

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
you do that it's pretty simple

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
you do that it's pretty simple
straightforward<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.790> you're

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
straightforward if you have if you're

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.520 
straightforward if you have if you're
having<00:01:39.090> trouble<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.750> super<00:01:40.020> fly<00:01:40.259> glitch

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
having trouble with the super fly glitch

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.460 
having trouble with the super fly glitch

easy takes a little practice yeah I'll

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.560 
easy takes a little practice yeah I'll
show<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:50.700> what<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
show it to you now what you do is you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.370 
show it to you now what you do is you
just<00:01:51.600> go<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.899> an<00:01:51.990> object<00:01:52.350> dropper<00:01:52.909> get<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:54.320> go<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
just go on an object dropper get a go to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.459 
just go on an object dropper get a go to
ramps<00:01:55.920> get<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> large<00:01:56.820> quarter<00:01:57.210> pipe<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:58.259> use

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
ramps get a large quarter pipe you use

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.730 
ramps get a large quarter pipe you use
you<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.649> turn<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.399> its<00:01:59.610> side<00:02:00.500> place<00:02:01.500> like

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
you just turn it on its side place like

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
you just turn it on its side place like
this<00:02:02.659> throw<00:02:03.659> your<00:02:03.810> board<00:02:04.430> place<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> marker<00:02:06.110> run

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
this throw your board place a marker run

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.930 
this throw your board place a marker run
sprint

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
sprint

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.930 
sprint
oh<00:02:08.970> absolutely<00:02:11.150> run<00:02:12.150> sprint<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.700> get<00:02:14.700> that

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
oh absolutely run sprint you get that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.070 
oh absolutely run sprint you get that
basic<00:02:15.180> idea<00:02:18.830> there<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:20.070> go

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
basic idea there we go

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.820 
basic idea there we go
as<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:22.860> see<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.250> get<00:02:23.400> lots<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.940> speed<00:02:24.180> and

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
as you can see you get lots of speed and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.590 
as you can see you get lots of speed and
you<00:02:25.830> fly<00:02:26.040> too<00:02:26.100> far<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.670> doesn't<00:02:26.970> allow<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.450> to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
you fly too far it doesn't allow you to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.140 
you fly too far it doesn't allow you to
land<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.020> stuff<00:02:28.290> even<00:02:28.530> if<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.710> could<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.940> let's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
land on stuff even if you could so let's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.970 
land on stuff even if you could so let's
say<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.330> do<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.660> it's<00:02:30.960> takes<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.770> little<00:02:31.860> bit

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
say you do that it's takes a little bit

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.710 
say you do that it's takes a little bit
of<00:02:32.040> practice<00:02:32.460> took<00:02:32.580> me<00:02:32.670> about<00:02:32.820> 10<00:02:33.210> 20<00:02:33.510> minutes

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
of practice took me about 10 20 minutes

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.320 
of practice took me about 10 20 minutes
to<00:02:33.810> get<00:02:33.930> up<00:02:34.020> here<00:02:34.550> not<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.700> mention<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.030> hour<00:02:36.150> I

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
to get up here not to mention the hour I

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.920 
to get up here not to mention the hour I
spend<00:02:36.690> trying<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.990> find<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.230> spot<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.500> do<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:38.930> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
spend trying to find a spot to do it you

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.100 
spend trying to find a spot to do it you
intensify<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.620> shark<00:02:40.980> jump<00:02:41.250> by<00:02:41.970> far

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
it's it's fun you can do this glitch

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.690 
it's it's fun you can do this glitch
