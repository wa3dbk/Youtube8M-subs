00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
my my home security camera systems had

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.080 
my my home security camera systems had
an<00:02:14.880> old<00:02:15.030> camera<00:02:15.300> they<00:02:15.720> don't

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
an old camera they don't

an old camera they don't
that<00:02:16.239> I<00:02:16.269> was<00:02:16.450> not<00:02:16.660> using<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:17.050> my<00:02:17.080> house<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.310> I

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
that I was not using on my house so I

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.860 
that I was not using on my house so I
took<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.550> apart<00:02:18.849> took<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.209> camera<00:02:19.390> out<00:02:19.599> of<00:02:19.660> it

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
took it apart took the camera out of it

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.369 
took it apart took the camera out of it
it's<00:02:20.650> basically<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.550> same<00:02:21.790> camera<00:02:22.390> as<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.629> had

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
it's basically the same camera as I had

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.619 
it's basically the same camera as I had
but<00:02:23.709> it's<00:02:23.830> got<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.010> much<00:02:24.400> wider<00:02:24.790> angle<00:02:25.060> lens<00:02:25.450> so

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
but it's got a much wider angle lens so

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.449 
but it's got a much wider angle lens so
I'm<00:02:25.720> hoping<00:02:25.959> that<00:02:26.110> helps<00:02:26.379> me<00:02:26.410> out<00:02:26.769> with<00:02:27.220> the
