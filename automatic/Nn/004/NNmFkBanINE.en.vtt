this<00:00:39.489> deep<00:00:39.899> because<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:41.050> deeper<00:00:41.409> you<00:00:41.530> plant

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
this deep because the deeper you plant

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.219 
this deep because the deeper you plant
them<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.760> more<00:00:42.969> roots<00:00:43.179> the<00:00:43.569> more<00:00:43.749> green<00:00:44.050> you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:44.229 
them the more roots the more green you

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:47.059 
them the more roots the more green you
get<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.710> more<00:00:44.890> white<00:00:45.729> stuff<00:00:46.089> on<00:00:46.329> the

get the more white stuff on the

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:53.399 
get the more white stuff on the
scallions<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:51.309> we<00:00:51.429> fill<00:00:51.639> it<00:00:51.670> up<00:00:52.170> use<00:00:53.170> the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
scallions so we fill it up use the

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.169 
scallions so we fill it up use the
bigger<00:00:53.589> ones<00:00:53.859> to<00:00:54.069> get<00:00:54.219> bigger<00:00:54.429> scallions<00:00:54.969> that

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
bigger ones to get bigger scallions that

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.329
