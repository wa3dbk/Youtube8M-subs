00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.300
 I'm going to prepare a recipe that I have 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.420
 sure will make a lot of mouth water 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.429
 people is a Milanese escalope a thing 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.120
 that's why we're going to serve 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.120
 it's cool 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.380
 The first thing you have to do is to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.600
 choose the house but I will do it here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.490
 to show that you do not have 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.210
 need for the most noble meat 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.849
 director 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.529
 so let's go there first of all I'll 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.540
 write a little more 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:41.730
 then we'll temper a little 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:49.559
 of parsley, finely grated Parmesan 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:52.010
 thin salt and pepper - I'll mix 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.070
 good 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.670
 this is going to be done 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.530
 on one side only because as Bertin runs the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.530
 risk of getting too seasoned 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.390
 But now we'll prepare the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.659
 our own bread flour 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.700
 I'm going to get the bread so that in our 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.700
 processor to put in 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:29.080
 dump directly into crato example 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.480
 use now then we will pat the 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.760
 our breaded steak 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:39.790
 first one to expose it only 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:45.840
 usually we are two sides the egg and 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.840
 now in our rosemary flour 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.610
 and to accompany our breaded steak 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.940
 I 'm preparing here to want to hit, it's not 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.930
 what 's potato every day now I go 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:09.190
 give our touch first 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:13.170
 put a little milk I'll put the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.700
 body for medium the grated cheese 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.560
 parmesan and a top 100 the end that is the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.459
 hand cone that will give a taste 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.440
 very special here in our son and 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.130
 it's time to spruce up our 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.130
 bugs 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.910
 first of all here the oil is already 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.540
 hot but I'll add a special touch 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.140
 adding a little olive oil and now 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.140
 the Japan 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.680
 and put the fat that is ahead 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.630
 we leave here a little bit because 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.730
 We turn here next door and I've prepared 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.890
 a dish with the absorbent paper I 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:08.600
 I'm going to get out of there and give him a point. 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.130
 if you like and the animal well past 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.750
 just have to do the following to fat 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.270
 It can not be very hot. 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.120
 otherwise to get to the point the 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:24.739
 inside it will burn part of the cornea 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.640
 so it made the fire decrease. 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:34.970
 good 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:37.760
 now we put here we'll have a 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.150
 empathic accompaniment is a special 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:46.630
 pier and potato all ready with 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.630
 neat and well ordered presentation
