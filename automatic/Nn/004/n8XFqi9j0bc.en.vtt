00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
chlorine is called oh and this one you

chlorine is called oh and this one you
might<00:00:27.390> not<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:27.779> seen<00:00:28.019> before<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.640> one

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
might not have seen before this is one

might not have seen before this is one
or<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.390> haven't<00:00:30.570> done<00:00:30.750> today

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140

it's<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.250> poly<00:00:32.730> dentate<00:00:33.950> meaning<00:00:34.950> or<00:00:35.219> uh

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
it's a poly dentate meaning or uh

it's a poly dentate meaning or uh
specifically<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> bidentate<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.649> bonds<00:00:38.610> in

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
specifically a bidentate get bonds in

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.970 
specifically a bidentate get bonds in
two<00:00:39.180> places<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> metal<00:00:40.200> instead<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.770> one

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
two places to the metal instead of one

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.560 
two places to the metal instead of one
place<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.579> doesn't<00:00:41.640> make<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> single<00:00:42.450> bond

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
place so it doesn't make a single bond

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.330 
place so it doesn't make a single bond
that<00:00:42.719> means<00:00:42.870> two<00:00:43.230> single<00:00:43.620> bonds<00:00:43.800> separately

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that means two single bonds separately

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.180 
that means two single bonds separately
and<00:00:44.700> that's<00:00:45.420> just<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> shorthand<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.800> moment

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and that's just the shorthand for moment

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.840 
and that's just the shorthand for moment
that<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.180> called<00:00:48.629> ethylene<00:00:49.350> diamine<00:00:52.850> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that this is called ethylene diamine and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.790 
that this is called ethylene diamine and
yes<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.750> there's<00:00:55.379> three<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
yes you have to know there's three of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.200 
yes you have to know there's three of
them<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.430> know<00:00:56.579> when<00:00:56.969> they're<00:00:57.180> in

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
them you have to know when they're in

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.529 
them you have to know when they're in
your<00:00:57.360> book<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:59.030> I<00:01:00.199> have<00:01:01.199> no<00:01:01.379> idea<00:01:01.710> where<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
your book and I have no idea where that

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.350 
your book and I have no idea where that
that's<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.930> point<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:06.330> know<00:01:06.360> why<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.260> yeah

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
that's the point you know why it's yeah

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.410 
that's the point you know why it's yeah
and<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.630> only<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.920> em<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:12.150> two

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and this only one of em here not two

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.620 
and this only one of em here not two
hours<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> other<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.350> you

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
hours like the other of you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.230 
hours like the other of you
okay<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.689> we<00:01:15.810> got<00:01:15.930> Eppley<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.619> mean<00:01:17.240> now

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
okay so we got Eppley and I mean now

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.859 
okay so we got Eppley and I mean now
there's<00:01:19.170> two<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.830> them<00:01:20.189> normally<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.720> would

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
there's two of them normally we would

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.820 
there's two of them normally we would
say<00:01:22.110> die<00:01:22.640> ethylene<00:01:23.640> Dunham<00:01:24.560> however<00:01:25.560> that's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
say die ethylene Dunham however that's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.420 
say die ethylene Dunham however that's
confusing<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.689> Eveline<00:01:28.259> diamine<00:01:29.189> is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
confusing because I Eveline diamine is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.300 
confusing because I Eveline diamine is
something<00:01:29.790> else<00:01:30.290> there's<00:01:31.290> two<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.770> wings<00:01:32.040> into

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
something else there's two up wings into

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.899 
something else there's two up wings into

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
Amit's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.620 
Amit's
this<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.380> ethylene<00:01:35.369> diamonds<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.390> there's

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this is to ethylene diamonds so there's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.539 
this is to ethylene diamonds so there's
a<00:01:36.810> special<00:01:37.280> prefix<00:01:38.390> whenever<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.689> have

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
a special prefix whenever you have

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:48.429 
a special prefix whenever you have
Polident<00:01:41.549> inks<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.369> ends<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:46.399> so

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
Polident inks and it ends with this so

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.270 
Polident inks and it ends with this so
instead<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.649> dye<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.950> use<00:01:50.159> by<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.479> this

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
instead of dye you use by so it's this

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.880 
instead of dye you use by so it's this
Tris<00:01:53.810> tetrakis<00:01:55.009> pentakus<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.170> ends<00:01:58.409> in

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
Tris tetrakis pentakus so it ends in

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.940 
Tris tetrakis pentakus so it ends in
I<00:01:58.920> don't<00:01:59.520> makes<00:01:59.729> no<00:01:59.880> sense<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.260> is<00:02:01.560> this

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
I don't makes no sense so this is this

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.500 
I don't makes no sense so this is this
ethylene<00:02:04.950> diamine<00:02:05.159> don't<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:05.940> die<00:02:06.150> not

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
ethylene diamine don't you just die not

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.050 
ethylene diamine don't you just die not
this<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.710> this

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
this but this

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.260 
this but this
ethylene<00:02:09.990> diamine<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.709> then<00:02:11.520> we'll<00:02:11.760> put<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
ethylene diamine and then we'll put this

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.150 
ethylene diamine and then we'll put this
in<00:02:12.569> brackets

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.770 

okay<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.430> meaning<00:02:17.940> -<00:02:19.640> okay<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:21.150> got<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.510> in

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
okay this meaning - okay we got that in

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.830 
okay this meaning - okay we got that in

the great question do I add like a giant
fluoride<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:10.400> know<00:04:10.550> because<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:11.210> ionic<00:04:11.780> so

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
fluoride you know because it's ionic so

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.470 
fluoride you know because it's ionic so
it's<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.260> counter<00:04:12.650> ion<00:04:12.830> whatever<00:04:13.580> dynamics<00:04:14.300> we

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
it's a counter ion whatever dynamics we

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.430 
it's a counter ion whatever dynamics we
don't<00:04:14.780> only<00:04:15.770> for<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.070> ligands<00:04:16.750> do<00:04:17.750> we<00:04:17.900> do<00:04:18.080> that

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
don't only for the ligands do we do that

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:26.290 
don't only for the ligands do we do that

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
you said there's three of the like the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.720 
you said there's three of the like the
infant's<00:04:32.750> every<00:04:33.140> nine<00:04:33.350> their<00:04:34.160> cities

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
infant's every nine their cities

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.760 
infant's every nine their cities
well<00:04:35.240> not<00:04:35.480> like<00:04:35.690> he<00:04:35.990> said<00:04:36.230> there's<00:04:36.440> three<00:04:36.740> of

well not like he said there's three of

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.890 
well not like he said there's three of
the<00:04:37.070> kind<00:04:37.370> yeah<00:04:37.640> there's<00:04:38.030> three<00:04:38.390> more<00:04:38.630> minutes

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
the kind yeah there's three more minutes

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.620 
the kind yeah there's three more minutes
for<00:04:39.320> you<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.800> know<00:04:39.920> are<00:04:40.400> they<00:04:40.580> all<00:04:40.730> neutral

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
for you to know are they all neutral

there's the Ocelot Oh which is - - and
there's<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.940> EDTA<00:04:50.540> which<00:04:50.930> i<00:04:51.050> think<00:04:51.110> is<00:04:51.290> four

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
there's the EDTA which i think is four

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.380 
there's the EDTA which i think is four
months<00:04:52.150> yeah

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
months yeah

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.640 
months yeah
EDTA<00:04:53.780> you're<00:04:54.140> actually<00:04:54.380> going<00:04:54.500> to<00:04:54.590> do<00:04:54.650> a<00:04:54.680> lab

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
EDTA you're actually going to do a lab

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.260 
EDTA you're actually going to do a lab
okay<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:58.070> those<00:04:58.280> are<00:04:58.430> all<00:04:58.490> listed<00:04:58.760> in<00:04:59.060> that

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
okay and those are all listed in that

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.060 
okay and those are all listed in that
table<00:04:59.570> on<00:04:59.840> that<00:04:59.870> page<00:05:00.230> that<00:05:00.500> has<00:05:00.620> all<00:05:00.800> the

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
table on that page that has all the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.540 
table on that page that has all the
ligands<00:05:01.490> for<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.540> to<00:05:02.660> go<00:05:03.130> next<00:05:04.130> one<00:05:04.310> I<00:05:06.070> mean<00:05:07.070> oh

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
ligands for you to go next one I mean oh

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.880 
ligands for you to go next one I mean oh
and<00:05:08.390> there's<00:05:08.570> five<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:08.810> them<00:05:09.020> so<00:05:09.350> it's<00:05:09.470> a<00:05:09.530> Penta

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
and there's five of them so it's a Penta

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.640 
and there's five of them so it's a Penta
two<00:05:12.890> M's<00:05:16.000> okay<00:05:17.000> this<00:05:17.210> is<00:05:17.390> normally<00:05:17.930> sulfate

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
two M's okay this is normally sulfate

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.430 
two M's okay this is normally sulfate
but<00:05:19.070> what<00:05:19.790> did<00:05:19.910> I<00:05:20.030> say<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.570> ending<00:05:20.990> is<00:05:21.170> four

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
but what did I say the ending is four

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:30.340 
but what did I say the ending is four
ligands<00:05:21.740> oh<00:05:23.470> so<00:05:24.470> so<00:05:25.040> oh<00:05:25.220> oh<00:05:29.350> and

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
ligands oh so so oh oh and

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.190 
ligands oh so so oh oh and
there's<00:05:31.250> only<00:05:31.400> one<00:05:31.520> of<00:05:31.700> them<00:05:31.910> so<00:05:32.450> no<00:05:33.140> prefix

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
there's only one of them so no prefix

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.020 
there's only one of them so no prefix
this<00:05:36.200> is<00:05:36.440> we've<00:05:36.800> got<00:05:37.010> chromium<00:05:37.640> what's<00:05:37.850> the

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
this is we've got chromium what's the

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.520 
this is we've got chromium what's the
charge<00:05:38.480> inside<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.440> brackets<00:05:40.810> plus<00:05:41.810> one

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
charge inside the brackets plus one

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.070 
charge inside the brackets plus one
what's<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:42.860> charge<00:05:43.040> of<00:05:43.250> something<00:05:45.760> -<00:05:46.760> to

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
what's the charge of something - to

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.340 
what's the charge of something - to
ammonia<00:05:48.080> zero<00:05:48.560> so<00:05:49.450> what<00:05:50.450> does<00:05:50.660> chromium<00:05:51.110> have

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
ammonia zero so what does chromium have

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.970 
ammonia zero so what does chromium have
to<00:05:51.500> be<00:05:53.080> +3<00:05:54.080> 3<00:05:55.060> -<00:05:56.060> 2<00:05:56.300> equals<00:05:56.660> the<00:05:57.080> bracket<00:05:57.620> charge

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
to be +3 3 - 2 equals the bracket charge

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:08.040 
to be +3 3 - 2 equals the bracket charge
of<00:05:58.460> +1<00:06:00.760> so<00:06:01.760> this<00:06:02.180> one<00:06:02.480> is<00:06:03.160> where<00:06:04.160> most<00:06:05.980> Penta<00:06:06.980> I

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
of +1 so this one is where most Penta I

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.020 
of +1 so this one is where most Penta I
mean

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:40.050 

salt<00:06:13.030> Pato<00:06:16.260> chromium<00:06:19.710> three<00:06:21.780> chloride<00:06:39.060> yeah

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
salt Pato chromium three chloride yeah

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.790 
salt Pato chromium three chloride yeah
it<00:06:40.270> doesn't<00:06:40.480> matter<00:06:40.720> that<00:06:41.050> this<00:06:41.230> is<00:06:41.410> one<00:06:41.620> and

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
it doesn't matter that this is one and

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.280 
it doesn't matter that this is one and
this<00:06:41.950> is<00:06:42.010> two<00:06:42.160> because<00:06:42.670> it's<00:06:42.970> an<00:06:43.120> ionic<00:06:43.780> naming

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
this is two because it's an ionic naming

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.740 
this is two because it's an ionic naming
for<00:06:44.530> the<00:06:44.620> counter<00:06:45.010> I<00:06:45.040> mean<00:06:45.970> anything<00:06:46.480> outside

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
for the counter I mean anything outside

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.830 
for the counter I mean anything outside
the<00:06:46.810> breakfast<00:06:47.200> is<00:06:47.590> I<00:06:48.060> so<00:06:49.060> we<00:06:49.180> name<00:06:49.390> it<00:06:49.420> like<00:06:49.690> I

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
the breakfast is I so we name it like I

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.190 
the breakfast is I so we name it like I
like<00:06:50.050> magnesium<00:06:50.680> chloride<00:06:50.980> and<00:06:51.550> KCl<00:06:51.940> to

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
like magnesium chloride and KCl to

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.800 
like magnesium chloride and KCl to
sodium<00:06:53.200> chloride<00:06:53.560> NaCl<00:06:54.240> you<00:06:55.240> don't<00:06:55.420> name<00:06:55.600> the

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
sodium chloride NaCl you don't name the

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.420 
sodium chloride NaCl you don't name the
two

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.120 

okay<00:07:01.150> let's<00:07:01.360> finish<00:07:01.600> this<00:07:01.840> last<00:07:02.140> one<00:07:02.500> there's

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
okay let's finish this last one there's

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.020 
okay let's finish this last one there's
pens<00:07:03.580> I<00:07:03.760> mean<00:07:04.120> that's<00:07:04.420> nh3

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
pens I mean that's nh3

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.910 
pens I mean that's nh3
five<00:07:07.030> there's<00:07:08.020> a<00:07:08.320> chloro

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:08.920 
five there's a chloro

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.630 
five there's a chloro
there<00:07:09.700> the<00:07:09.940> chromium<00:07:10.390> 3<00:07:11.020> plus<00:07:11.050> and<00:07:11.830> then<00:07:12.520> the

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 
there the chromium 3 plus and then the

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.630 
there the chromium 3 plus and then the
counter<00:07:13.120> ion<00:07:13.540> is<00:07:14.110> something<00:07:17.160> so<00:07:18.160> let's<00:07:18.370> put

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.640 
counter ion is something so let's put

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.970 
counter ion is something so let's put
this<00:07:18.760> all<00:07:18.970> together

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
this all together

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:34.670 
this all together
throw<00:07:20.980> him<00:07:21.280> in<00:07:23.490> brackets<00:07:24.490> and<00:07:26.280> a<00:07:27.600> 3<00:07:28.680> 5<00:07:29.730> CL<00:07:31.350> s<00:07:32.350> oh

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
throw him in brackets and a 3 5 CL s oh

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.660 
throw him in brackets and a 3 5 CL s oh
that<00:07:35.680> will<00:07:35.860> make<00:07:36.130> sure<00:07:36.280> that<00:07:36.430> charge<00:07:36.820> works

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:38.670 
that will make sure that charge works

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.230 
that will make sure that charge works
towards<00:07:39.670> what<00:07:40.090> our<00:07:40.360> premiums<00:07:40.840> plus<00:07:41.260> three

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 
towards what our premiums plus three

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.210 
towards what our premiums plus three
minus<00:07:43.240> one<00:07:43.540> for<00:07:44.020> flooring<00:07:44.530> that<00:07:44.740> gives<00:07:45.070> the

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.220 
minus one for flooring that gives the

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.960 
minus one for flooring that gives the
overall<00:07:45.400> charge<00:07:46.150> of<00:07:46.330> plus<00:07:46.780> two<00:07:47.400> the<00:07:48.400> sulfates

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:48.970 
overall charge of plus two the sulfates

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.620 
overall charge of plus two the sulfates
minus<00:07:49.450> 2<00:07:49.690> that<00:07:50.170> works<00:07:50.410> out
