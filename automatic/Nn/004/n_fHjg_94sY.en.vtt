00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:06.720
 yes hello love dropped off Lusa we are there always name belonging test video Bayer 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.989
 and today we want to introduce you to two travel bags 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:11.890
 but on the left side have this 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.809
 Fascher of Cumberland 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.809
 even though Gruber northeim-west is now available in black and brown 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.650
 at the manufacturer you have to pay 25 Euro cash if you go to Amazon 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.810
 Cuxhaven already for just under 20 euros 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.960
 on the right side of me a cup of OPNET 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.039
 these courses from manufacturers 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.980
 50 euros on Amazon you always click for 40 euros 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.760
 Parents begin to persecute Wanderers 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.760
 and that was how it opened 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 Stecheesser grab the iPad 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.210
 this is simply caravan 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.480
 if some pressure 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.730
 suppress 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.690
 and it's already inside 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.690
 if you watch, there are two magnets here 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.610
 actually keeps up pretty good 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.180
 "Man Son Reetz and then have to rappel 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.900
 Year is not one 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.240
 we are the recess you can operate the volume control 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.010
 soon switch 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.270
 you have up here in the headphone entrance free should also some suitcases 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.500
 to adjust 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.760
 us down here 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.460
 the sending comment and the speaker 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.420
 However, there is no recess for the wisdom that one can 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.120
 because so well served 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.300
 if you flatten the bag 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.910
 you have the recesses waiting for the palate and up here for the 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.810
 Make poets 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.720
 he had to be his shortcoming 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.180
 are all functions 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.540
 yes exempted can all be given quite simply the EPS 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.710
 Combi all states 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.810
 one more feature is that you can press the button in Stenkamp 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.210
 Portrait 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.640
 However, it is not exactly sure this fits the right way 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.270
 if you give it cash and you encourage it to surface 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.440
 Canvas just longer so that's not a resistance 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.070
 of such proportions and are 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.070
 he did not want it to continue falling 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.999
 yes the bag is still 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.599
 how one assumes that it is not right all her leatherette 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.249
 and Jung is even more 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.599
 something patterned 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.680
 in our case last time the destruction of Fortis 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.669
 are already that the eads-leadership looks a bit high quality 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.010
 one has here again a magnet whose precursor should keep 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.909
 and here a recess that you can with your finger 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.719
 Can open flap 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.049
 yes, too, the iPad must first purely 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.159
 Mr. Mill also has a small flap with a magnet 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.309
 hide that was one 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.219
 it is also easy to suppress 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.219
 Here it is a bit more difficult than when landing 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.219
 it's best to just push in a bit more 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.959
 it's almost the team's leather lion is just up here to what 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.069
 but not quite finished it is actually better solid cut 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:05.659
 although then it missed the function of the magnet boy but something like that 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.199
 definitely better 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:12.009
 Again, the recess almost all exposed as you can see here is already 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.389
 yes the home button something 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:15.619
 under pressed 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:19.029
 but not spared you can press it but it is strange 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:21.899
 significantly heavier than the other bag 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.679
 so that the ESMA does not close you can already see that in the beginning 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.509
 actually does not really fit 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:29.789
 if you move the iPad a little bit and put it around a bit 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:30.549
 squashed 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.729
 then it will fit here too 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.869
 but a bit awkward 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:38.629
 It's also here with a man on TV 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.849
 up here you can also see that a recess for the sensor for me 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:42.929
 censorship 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:46.689
 the lower area light on free so that you can connect to Karl and on the 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:47.809
 Fence becomes 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:49.649
 and here on the right side too 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.829
 Tesla loudspeaker neither and the mute switch free however 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.439
 It's pretty close to praise 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.439
 that you have to gram from Minh Fingernail around it so you just have to 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:01.929
 that one gets quiet 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.439
 If you have more features then you can complete this page 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.789
 serve 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:10.169
 and on the back we have one left here 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.049
 with which we can stack the front stack to hold the travelers 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.769
 that man's not just easier to owe the burdens 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.419
 pretty hard on the other hand, the other have got it 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.370
 we can set up the part for example Infranor Front 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.789
 and notice that hurts something can just flip over and then you could 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.830
 Example such a quite good if it is in Safari for example 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.800
 open any page 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.499
 you can draw better m most often 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.499
 the iPad is just on the table 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:47.149
 still a function and brings yes the same class with you can do that as 

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:50.819
 Place a hero in Querfurt or portrait or across a hit mark 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.700
 and that's a bit better, even in the evening light, Bild wobbles 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:56.629
 quite well 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.699
 After all, you can see a lot of space and have to sit on the table 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.909
 Stanley stands 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.249
 first door, for example, if you watch movies and 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:09.659
 this is one if I hold on all the time 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.379
 because that's too smooth 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:15.610
 The banks again that it is not directly stunned 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.300
 and already know when they will succeed 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.129
 and we'll let you have it so it fits 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.430
 yes even with the providers a not very good protection guaranteed 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.849
 this is made of genuine leather 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.830
 However, the Aufbahrung a bit sharp-edged amanit feels 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.069
 However, it is not such a big disadvantage 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.469
 that you have to try that 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.229
 If you compare them both almost again then it looks natural 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.680
 A matter of taste which optically better like 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.240
 however, this would be ideal 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.570
 Found something because you pronounce from a buy recommendation 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.569
 because she clearly better her shut up Â» 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.419
 to the Aufbahrung the for example in the area Baden 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.650
 especially Siemens 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.010
 that you can serve them better
