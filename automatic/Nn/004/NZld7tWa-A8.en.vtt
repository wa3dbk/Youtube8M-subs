00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
back it got out of control between the

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.230 
back it got out of control between the
two<00:03:36.970> of<00:03:37.090> them<00:03:37.240> to<00:03:37.600> say<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.930> least<00:03:38.110> and<00:03:39.240> maybe

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
two of them to say the least and maybe

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.820 
two of them to say the least and maybe
shouldn't<00:03:41.140> have<00:03:41.260> gotten<00:03:41.470> out<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:41.680> control

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
shouldn't have gotten out of control

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.200 
shouldn't have gotten out of control
maybe<00:03:42.160> they<00:03:42.400> should<00:03:42.610> have<00:03:42.700> figured<00:03:42.970> out<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.090> way

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
maybe they should have figured out a way

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.480 
maybe they should have figured out a way
to<00:03:43.570> do<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.200> but<00:03:44.440> they<00:03:44.860> were<00:03:44.980> on<00:03:45.100> a<00:03:45.130> collision

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
to do it but they were on a collision

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.490 
to do it but they were on a collision
course<00:03:45.780> because<00:03:46.780> they<00:03:46.900> were<00:03:46.960> such<00:03:47.200> big

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
course because they were such big

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.980
