the<00:01:16.460> more<00:01:16.640> questions<00:01:16.789> that<00:01:17.030> we<00:01:17.180> have<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.600> more

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
the more questions that we have the more

the more questions that we have the more
exciting<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.289> work<00:01:18.439> is

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
exciting the work is

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.080 
exciting the work is
you<00:01:20.710> add<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:20.890> little<00:01:20.979> bit<00:01:21.250> more<00:01:21.400> data<00:01:21.580> each<00:01:21.850> time

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
you add a little bit more data each time

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.690 
you add a little bit more data each time
you<00:01:22.240> take<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.390> step<00:01:23.310> Nina's<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:24.400> doesn't<00:01:24.640> eat

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
you take a step Nina's that doesn't eat

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.830 
you take a step Nina's that doesn't eat
you<00:01:24.759> to<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.939> answer<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.360> tells<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.630> where<00:01:25.750> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
you to the answer it tells you where the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:33.320 
you to the answer it tells you where the
answer<00:01:26.080> isn't

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.630 

when<00:01:33.930> you're<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.590> sort<00:01:34.800> of<00:01:34.860> confused<00:01:35.340> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
when you're really sort of confused and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.100 
when you're really sort of confused and
you're<00:01:35.760> a<00:01:35.790> bit<00:01:35.970> too<00:01:36.000> close<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.810> data<00:01:36.990> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
you're a bit too close and the data that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.660 
you're a bit too close and the data that
you<00:01:37.320> have

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
you have

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.070 
you have
then<00:01:38.850> you're<00:01:39.240> unable<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> big

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
then you're unable to see the big

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.440 
then you're unable to see the big
picture<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> perfect<00:01:42.270> time<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
picture then it's the perfect time to

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.730 
picture then it's the perfect time to
just<00:01:42.600> stop<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.830> run<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:45.740> just

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
just stop and go out for a run and just

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.020 
just stop and go out for a run and just
clear<00:01:47.130> your<00:01:47.250> mind<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.580> it<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:47.909> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
clear your mind of it and then it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.370 
clear your mind of it and then it
becomes<00:01:48.119> much<00:01:48.420> clearer<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.960> kind<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
becomes much clearer that kind of

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:59.130 
becomes much clearer that kind of
questions<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.950> should<00:01:49.979> ask

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.540 

maybe<00:01:59.740> come<00:01:59.890> up<00:01:59.920> with<00:02:00.040> something<00:02:00.370> that<00:02:00.520> you

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
maybe come up with something that you

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.340 
maybe come up with something that you
didn't<00:02:00.850> think<00:02:00.880> about<00:02:01.240> before<00:02:01.360> like<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.870> new<00:02:02.140> way

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
didn't think about before like a new way

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.460 
didn't think about before like a new way
to<00:02:02.790> present<00:02:03.790> your<00:02:04.000> data<00:02:04.240> that<00:02:04.750> makes<00:02:05.260> things

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
to present your data that makes things

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.110 
to present your data that makes things
somewhat<00:02:05.860> clearer<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.520> can<00:02:06.670> lose<00:02:06.850> your

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
somewhat clearer and that can lose your

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.150 
somewhat clearer and that can lose your
next<00:02:07.390> step<00:02:07.570> in<00:02:07.720> your<00:02:07.750> research

if you already have an answer to a
