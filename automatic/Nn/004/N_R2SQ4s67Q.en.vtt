00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
series we're going to take a look at the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.900 
series we're going to take a look at the
next<00:00:06.299> few<00:00:06.450> things<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.870> want<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.080> learn<00:00:07.910> so

next few things you want to learn so

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.950 
next few things you want to learn so
your<00:00:09.090> inverted<00:00:09.420> hovering<00:00:09.929> orientations<00:00:11.960> you

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
your inverted hovering orientations you

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.370 
your inverted hovering orientations you
got<00:00:13.170> those<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:14.480> those<00:00:15.480> left<00:00:16.670> those<00:00:17.670> right<00:00:18.380> and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
got those in those left those right and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.690 
got those in those left those right and
then<00:00:19.529> tail<00:00:19.830> them

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.570 

once<00:00:25.300> you<00:00:25.420> get<00:00:25.570> those<00:00:25.750> down<00:00:26.460> we're<00:00:27.460> gonna

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
once you get those down we're gonna

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.950 
once you get those down we're gonna
start<00:00:27.970> working<00:00:28.150> on<00:00:29.250> backwards<00:00:30.250> flight

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.810 

in<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> little<00:00:34.770> bit<00:00:34.890> be<00:00:35.160> able<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.520> loops

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
in a little bit be able to do loops

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.680 
in a little bit be able to do loops
ramming<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:36.840> circles<00:00:37.579> figure<00:00:38.579> Eight's<00:00:38.790> all

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
ramming the circles figure Eight's all

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.569 
ramming the circles figure Eight's all
that<00:00:40.020> good<00:00:40.230> stuff<00:00:40.260> backwards<00:00:40.829> around<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
that good stuff backwards around the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.319 
that good stuff backwards around the
field<00:00:43.579> after<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> hang<00:00:45.269> of<00:00:45.360> that

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
field after you get the hang of that

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.579 
field after you get the hang of that
we're<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.480> start<00:00:48.809> working<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.260> same

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
we're gonna start working on the same

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.729 
we're gonna start working on the same
thing<00:00:49.860> inverted<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.960> inverted<00:00:52.470> we're<00:00:52.620> going

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
thing inverted so inverted we're going

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.270 
thing inverted so inverted we're going
to<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.070> forwards<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.940> backwards<00:00:55.280> you're

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
to do this forwards and backwards you're

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.530 
to do this forwards and backwards you're
gonna<00:00:56.399> want<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.699> able<00:00:56.729> to<00:00:56.909> do<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.089> circles

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
gonna want to be able to do the circles

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.560 
gonna want to be able to do the circles
in<00:00:57.659> both<00:00:57.870> directions<00:00:59.269> you're<00:01:00.269> going<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> want

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
in both directions you're going to want

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
in both directions you're going to want
to<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.719> able<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.050> figure<00:01:01.440> eights<00:01:01.680> inverted

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
to be able to do figure eights inverted

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.690 
to be able to do figure eights inverted
and<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:03.710> it's<00:01:04.710> time<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.949> start<00:01:05.250> working<00:01:05.339> on

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and then it's time to start working on

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.570 
and then it's time to start working on
this<00:01:05.929> backwards<00:01:06.929> inverted<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:08.009> I'm<00:01:08.250> not

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
this backwards inverted which I'm not

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
this backwards inverted which I'm not
good<00:01:08.820> at<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.179> I'm<00:01:09.270> probably<00:01:09.509> gonna<00:01:09.690> crash<00:01:10.020> here

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
good at so I'm probably gonna crash here

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.680 
good at so I'm probably gonna crash here
so<00:01:10.530> I'm<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.770> getting<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:17.509> yep<00:01:18.509> I

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
so I'm just getting into this yep I

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.480 
so I'm just getting into this yep I
crash<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.440> that's<00:01:19.649> another<00:01:19.890> good<00:01:20.130> reason<00:01:20.190> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
crash so that's another good reason to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.389 
crash so that's another good reason to
have<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> sin<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.860> after<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.220> that

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
have a sin so after you get all that

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:25.940 
have a sin so after you get all that
stuff<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.909> showed<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:25.470> stuff<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.920> just

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
stuff I showed you the stuff we just

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.660 
stuff I showed you the stuff we just
talked<00:01:26.369> about<00:01:26.550> in<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:26.940> video<00:01:27.149> down<00:01:28.670> that's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
talked about in this video down that's

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.309 
talked about in this video down that's
about<00:01:29.970> when<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.390> time<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.810> start<00:01:31.080> learning

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
about when it's time to start learning

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:35.779 
about when it's time to start learning
some<00:01:31.679> 3d<00:01:32.130> stuff<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.069> can<00:01:35.280> start<00:01:35.610> off

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
some 3d stuff you know you can start off

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.010 
some 3d stuff you know you can start off
with<00:01:36.060> little<00:01:36.360> things<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.780> tic<00:01:37.080> TOCs<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.840> get

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
with little things like tic TOCs you get

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.949 
with little things like tic TOCs you get
into<00:01:40.200> those<00:01:40.380> by<00:01:40.649> doing<00:01:41.039> rainbows<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.959> rainbow

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
into those by doing rainbows a rainbow

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:58.450 
into those by doing rainbows a rainbow
is<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.429> basically<00:01:44.429> a<00:01:44.550> big<00:01:44.880> huge<00:01:45.179> tick-tock

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.310 

then<00:01:59.030> you<00:01:59.150> can<00:01:59.299> start<00:01:59.630> doing<00:01:59.720> them<00:02:00.049> a<00:02:00.080> little

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
then you can start doing them a little

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.410 
then you can start doing them a little
less<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.920> little<00:02:01.850> less<00:02:04.210> eventually<00:02:05.210> you'll<00:02:05.330> be

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
less a little less eventually you'll be

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:17.890 
less a little less eventually you'll be
able<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.630> get<00:02:05.810> into<00:02:06.049> tic<00:02:06.260> TOCs

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.430 

you<00:02:18.650> got<00:02:18.860> your<00:02:19.330> Iran<00:02:20.330> tic<00:02:20.659> TOCs

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.350 

same<00:02:26.040> thing<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.460> can<00:02:26.610> just<00:02:26.640> kind<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.090> start

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
same thing you can just kind of start

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:44.630 
same thing you can just kind of start
out<00:02:29.600> doing<00:02:30.600> these<00:02:30.840> really<00:02:31.110> big<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.620> wide

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.850 

you<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:45.540> start<00:02:45.840> working<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.290> your<00:02:46.440> pair<00:02:46.710> of

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
you can start working on your pair of

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.440 
you can start working on your pair of
flips<00:02:47.130> if<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.490> want<00:02:47.730> I<00:02:47.940> mean<00:02:48.150> those<00:02:48.300> are

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
flips if you want I mean those are

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.180 
flips if you want I mean those are
pretty<00:02:48.630> crazy<00:02:49.020> that's<00:02:49.319> an<00:02:49.470> advanced<00:02:49.830> move

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
pretty crazy that's an advanced move

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.580 
pretty crazy that's an advanced move
that's<00:02:51.090> something<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.600> started<00:02:52.080> learning<00:02:52.260> way

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
that's something I started learning way

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.830 
that's something I started learning way
before<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:52.980> should<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.510> because<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.540> you

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
before I should have because that you

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.449 
before I should have because that you
see<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.050> still<00:02:55.470> don't<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.740> my<00:02:55.800> inverted

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
see I still don't have my inverted

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.150 
see I still don't have my inverted
backwards<00:02:56.940> flight<00:02:57.240> down<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.709> started

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
backwards flight down but I started

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.390 
backwards flight down but I started
working<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.580> all<00:02:59.730> kinds<00:02:59.760> of<00:03:00.120> stuff<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:01.400> after

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
working on all kinds of stuff and after

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400 
working on all kinds of stuff and after
I<00:03:02.430> crashed<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:03.060> few<00:03:03.209> times<00:03:03.480> doing<00:03:03.959> stuff<00:03:04.290> like

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
I crashed a few times doing stuff like
