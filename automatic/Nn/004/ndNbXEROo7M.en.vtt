00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.250
 b it only remains blank and the video showed 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.890
 How do you make an automatic fireplace? 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.420
 This is where I'm going to show you the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:27.300
 You 'll call here now and we'll 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.420
 you light ours on the sand already paid 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.559
 our area but before I get authored 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.100
 was I meant that this fireplace is 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.450
 made with that fireball then you 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.370
 can only do it 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.110
 I could only do speak right here 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.469
 to decorate your home in creative mode 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.520
 because it is very difficult to find that ball 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.160
 of fire and so it is easier to 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.420
 decorate your buildings leave your 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.820
 homes then let's go the tutorial 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.219
 So I came back to start, I know. 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.219
 make a three deep hole 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:12.650
 seven in width and not seven in 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.210
 length and six width 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:22.530
 so here the set length and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.310
 six wide made the hole there goes 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:32.220
 put a 2 story floor goes up here 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:36.200
 at the corner of the hole and a pack of nerds 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.200
 Here I will forget to get him. 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.579
 middle rock 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:47.610
 Let's put the rock of nec 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:52.979
 done that, let's see down here 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.530
 Let's put two blocks here two 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.380
 redstone torches in front of the block and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.409
 two blocks on the history of 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.840
 Redstone then we put ourselves 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.290
 repeaters here and we'll make the call 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.410
 here to stop here 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.760
 now is to make our marina what are we 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:20.129
 put on 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:26.260
 here are three blocks here two here and now 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:33.489
 3 jet three tall here and two here 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:35.079
 behind clothes here and two more here 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.829
 so here we can now 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:43.060
 close here and break here 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:47.290
 to stand as a fireplace that even 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.200
 way back here wants to get a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.760
 block anybody else here for 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.579
 differentiate 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.780
 Let's put it here. 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:04.299
 that way but it will look beautiful because 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:07.030
 we put the lever here then 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.099
 to be more beautiful and after that 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.819
 let's come here let's put a block 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:20.620
 here to break a call here 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:22.780
 Let's cover the game here with our 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.069
 Leave here and we'll come and put 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.329
 they 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:34.269
 so that it is inherent in putting the 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:37.780
 fireballs half in each 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.900
 after that we will cover here put 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.440
 the repeaters and we'll call this 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.440
 block here 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:54.310
 that way we'll come here like this 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:55.889
 then we'll put a block here and a 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.060
 repeater here 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:05.139
 after that we will break here from the block 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.919
 and let's put this rate here is a 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.709
 Here's a block here. 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:14.250
 too many people here in the 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.989
 front and a tony network up here 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.049
 done this we will vote repeated here with 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.639
 Four law and adds that too and 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:28.599
 Let's call that far and we'll do it. 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.610
 so doing this let's test 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.979
 here I think it 's practically 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.800
 ready but only break that puts precise 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:40.270
 to stay the same remember that it is also that 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.729
 Just packing here to stay the business. 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.449
 beautiful but you can do it the way you 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.330
 you want 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.629
 that way and now we're going to test here 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.199
 let's call it can serve her understood 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:54.939
