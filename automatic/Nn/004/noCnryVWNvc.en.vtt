00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.760
 musical actress 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.270
 at the Berlin Philharmonic begins when you go with your ticket you are looking 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:05.110
 your armchair 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.760
 because returning that there is a spatial sequence that is almost sonorous that plan 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.460
 mint architecture action is practically already in a way it's almost 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.560
 a preamble from the music then when the music starts to sound you give 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.030
 account I think there are funds part overlapping 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.030
 wonderful in itself as such an architecture that lends all its 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.180
 beauty for music so that this second one expresses with 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.180
 maximum 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.520
 there was a before and after in the history of the auditoriums marked by 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.890
 the philharmonic of berlin 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.340
 which was made in 1963 by the architect Sharon never in close 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.560
 collaboration with gerbert font carayaÃ³ 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.940
 It was the first time that the sound source was placed in the center of the auditorium 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.520
 surrounded by the public 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.310
 the relations between music and architecture have always existed 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.620
 and nowadays it is in the auditoriums where this is reflected most clearly 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.399
 communion between the two disciplines 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:19.049
 in that sense 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.659
 you think four baa vargas 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.919
 also the house we're going 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.569
 now 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.290
 the relationship between min 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.290
 music and architecture el fundi 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.149
 I have felt that the architecture 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:57.469
 it is significant of age 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.469
 the opposite 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:03.379
 the architecture 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.109
 in this sense 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.969
 I read and there 22 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.129
 fantastic to ensure 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.260
 according to indispensable acoustics particularly by the orchestra 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.009
 symphonic 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:21.519
 percent to develop solid support in to create 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.579
 atmosphere 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.649
 about colors 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:26.829
 in another way 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.829
 one wonders 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:44.029
 One of the great advances in architectural music has been the 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:44.400
 weather 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.399
 reverberation 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:48.749
 that quality that has the sound of bouncing off walls and staying 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.499
 during the time 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:54.229
 that reflex is fundamental since when mixing with the sound of ida it is created 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.369
 the sound sensation of the surround sound 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:59.879
 that allows the directionality that the human being needs to develop with 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.699
 fullness the sense of hearing 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.029
 with the thorium situation if the creation of dry spaces is achieved 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.429
 in which the sound took very little to disappear 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:09.960
 and that of bright spaces 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.960
 with a longer reverberation time in the year 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.800
 page recover the music that ferrer 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.250
 I hope that this science matter julia the coefficient of action the 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.810
 Social capacity will be checked according to the dimensions of the room 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.490
 if we start a very large room 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.759
 the materials 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.159
 actively rolls 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.000
 the blow of before 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.159
 need for the little ones 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.569
 because it is important to maintain just two times of war 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.550
 and that the feature of viral form clarity of the room 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.259
 in parameters that have been raised up to the music 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.800
 we have all been able to see 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.380
 by the way is that most of the audiences new current surplus 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.060
 last generation have option until copies your panel construction 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.650
 horizontal suspended from the ceiling that are adjustable in iquique if they result 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.970
 regulates precisely for 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.319
 I managed to bounce the sound 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.969
 dark spots 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.279
 coop together in the puppets to concentrate the petit sound is a way to assign 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:20.719
 fifa and also in four procedures as a substitute split the room and reduce 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:24.379
 subsidies little like for example what is being given and is music from 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.379
 camera and open it in the case of symphonic music 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.560
 Depending on the space, different resources are used to obtain the 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.599
 optimal acoustic quality 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.599
 It is very important to distinguish between the needs of an audience on the air 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.599
 free not yet closed and an empty room 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:54.770
 in the country evidently a lot of effe 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.819
 outdoor shows but always with some acoustic shells since of 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:03.530
 somehow we try to let some media try to play sedlacek 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.449
 tonic let's say a million buildings apart from that are used 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.550
 obviously do not suffer from teeth 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.039
 the telephone justice to be able to defend their ideas one of them 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.039
 sd solid as if it were more commented indoor 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.440
 the ingenious procedure like for example 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.559
 in the house of port music of 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:28.050
 the architect rem things 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.050
 stop some web 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.989
 armrests let's say silicone that make absorbent elements for when 

00:06:35.989 --> 00:06:37.460
 the room is empty efe 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.690
 precisely for what 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.669
 will in some way represent sound absorption 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.939
 the president would cause the existence of dozens of people 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.939
 when it came down 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.339
 all the world 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:03.819
 efe with music a plasticity of time with music and get a 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.819
 plasticity of time also with space 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.990
 yes, in principle 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.310
 as well as la la the ontological connection that there would be people space 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.310
 or temporary and the musical space 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.710
 all
