holidays we have to have macaroni and
cheese<00:01:19.590> cuz<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.280> mean<00:01:20.580> well<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.299> thing

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.149 
cheese cuz I mean well for one thing
that's<00:01:21.689> how<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> judge<00:01:22.200> every<00:01:22.350> restaurant<00:01:23.009> is

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that's how I judge every restaurant is

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.380 
that's how I judge every restaurant is
if<00:01:23.340> they<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.670> good<00:01:23.850> night<00:01:24.030> creme<00:01:24.240> cheese

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
if they have good night creme cheese

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.280 
if they have good night creme cheese
right<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:26.509> it's<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.810> family<00:01:28.140> tradition

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:43.180 
someone who is in an interracial

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.150 
someone who is in an interracial
relationship<00:07:43.420> and<00:07:44.110> frankly<00:07:44.620> when<00:07:44.830> I<00:07:44.860> grew<00:07:45.130> up

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.160 
relationship and frankly when I grew up

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.810 
relationship and frankly when I grew up
in<00:07:45.340> Texas<00:07:45.580> to<00:07:46.090> me<00:07:46.270> I<00:07:46.740> looked<00:07:47.740> at<00:07:47.950> Mexican<00:07:48.670> and

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:48.820 
in Texas to me I looked at Mexican and

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.670 
in Texas to me I looked at Mexican and
wine<00:07:49.180> almost<00:07:49.540> the<00:07:49.690> same<00:07:49.900> because<00:07:50.320> there<00:07:50.530> were

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 
wine almost the same because there were

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.510 
wine almost the same because there were
so<00:07:51.010> I<00:07:51.340> mean<00:07:51.910> it's<00:07:52.240> just<00:07:52.390> part<00:07:53.050> of<00:07:53.170> the<00:07:53.260> culture

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 
so I mean it's just part of the culture

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.730 
so I mean it's just part of the culture
becoming<00:07:54.520> having<00:07:55.240> bejita<00:07:55.600> x'<00:07:55.750> and<00:07:56.050> margaritas

and<00:07:57.190> things<00:07:57.430> like<00:07:57.610> that<00:07:57.790> that's<00:07:57.970> just<00:07:58.150> part<00:07:58.390> of

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 
and things like that that's just part of

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.170 
and things like that that's just part of
our<00:07:58.870> culture<00:07:58.930> the<00:07:59.680> Mexican<00:08:00.220> culture<00:08:00.430> you<00:08:01.060> know

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180
