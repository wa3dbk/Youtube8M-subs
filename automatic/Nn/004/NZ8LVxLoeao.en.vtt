00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
when you do take it on a figure-eight

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.540 
when you do take it on a figure-eight
course<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.980> realize<00:00:45.379> whoever<00:00:46.379> designed<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

suspension and chassis on this car
had<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> sense<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.899> humor<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.920> stability

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
had a sense of humor we have stability

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.369 
had a sense of humor we have stability
control<00:00:53.699> completely<00:00:54.180> off<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.840> totally

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
control completely off you can totally

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.750 
control completely off you can totally
defeat<00:00:55.620> stability<00:00:55.980> control<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.610> that's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
defeat stability control and that's

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.600 
defeat stability control and that's
important<00:00:57.210> because

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:08.950 

you<00:01:01.090> can<00:01:01.360> throw<00:01:01.660> this<00:01:04.830> around

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:18.980 

that<00:01:09.530> was<00:01:09.680> bad<00:01:10.100> admittedly<00:01:10.960> but

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.410

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.610 
now I've already set a lap time now I'm
just<00:01:28.720> screwing<00:01:28.990> around

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
just screwing around

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.380 
just screwing around
you<00:01:30.220> can<00:01:30.370> back<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.970> car<00:01:31.240> in<00:01:32.909> there's<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.090> only

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
you can back the car in there's the only

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.670 
you can back the car in there's the only
thing<00:01:34.510> that<00:01:34.630> really<00:01:34.780> holds<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:35.170> back<00:01:35.200> is<00:01:35.560> the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
thing that really holds it back is the

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.080 
thing that really holds it back is the
transmission<00:01:36.250> that's<00:01:36.430> why<00:01:36.610> I<00:01:36.640> kind<00:01:36.909> of<00:01:36.970> get

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090

sloppy at the end there you have to go

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:48.710 
sloppy at the end there you have to go
gear<00:01:39.430> up

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.400

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.870 
kind of makes the slides a little
difficult<00:02:43.190> because<00:02:43.280> they<00:02:43.489> don't<00:02:43.640> want<00:02:43.760> to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
difficult because they don't want to

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.400 
difficult because they don't want to
change<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.450> big<00:02:44.690> year<00:02:44.900> when<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.080> want<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.320> be

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
change that big year when you want to be

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.160 
change that big year when you want to be
you<00:02:45.650> know<00:02:45.680> tapping<00:02:46.190> out<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.400> second<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.989> can't

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
you know tapping out in second so can't

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.830 
you know tapping out in second so can't
go<00:02:48.350> gear<00:02:48.620> up<00:02:48.770> at<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.300> diameter<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> corner

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
go gear up at this diameter of a corner

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.710 
go gear up at this diameter of a corner
and<00:02:51.489> again<00:02:52.489> those<00:02:52.760> weren't<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.000> best<00:02:53.209> drifts

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
and again those weren't the best drifts

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.610 
and again those weren't the best drifts
but<00:02:54.410> they<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.709> illustrate<00:02:55.400> how<00:02:56.120> loonie<00:02:56.720> this

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
but they to illustrate how loonie this

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.320 
but they to illustrate how loonie this
