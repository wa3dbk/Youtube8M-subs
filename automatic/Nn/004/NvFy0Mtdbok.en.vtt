00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
need to remove plastic engine cover it

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.600 
need to remove plastic engine cover it
just<00:00:13.110> pops<00:00:13.349> off<00:00:13.590> it's<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.219> on<00:00:14.370> rubber

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
just pops off it's just on rubber

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.349 
just pops off it's just on rubber
mountings<00:00:15.030> sort<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.480> pop<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.870> off<00:00:17.300> out<00:00:18.300> of

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
mountings sort of pop that off out of

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.439 
mountings sort of pop that off out of
the<00:00:18.539> way<00:00:19.369> next<00:00:20.369> thing<00:00:20.699> but<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.090> soundproof

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the way next thing but it's soundproof

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.170 
the way next thing but it's soundproof
in<00:00:21.810> here<00:00:22.670> just<00:00:23.670> lift<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.060> up<00:00:25.939> when<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.000> lift

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
in here just lift this up when you lift

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.089 
in here just lift this up when you lift
this<00:00:27.300> up<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.960> see<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.740> diesel

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
this up you can see the diesel

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.279 
this up you can see the diesel
common-rail<00:00:29.490> running<00:00:30.480> along<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.720> top<00:00:30.900> you've

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
common-rail running along the top you've

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.560 
common-rail running along the top you've
got<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> metal<00:00:31.859> fuel<00:00:32.610> pipes<00:00:32.880> coming<00:00:33.300> off<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
got the metal fuel pipes coming off to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.090 
got the metal fuel pipes coming off to
the<00:00:33.690> injector<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.320> we're<00:00:34.440> always<00:00:34.620> looking<00:00:34.739> for

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the injector so we're always looking for

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.630 
the injector so we're always looking for
the<00:00:35.280> metal<00:00:35.550> feel<00:00:35.760> real<00:00:37.070> only<00:00:38.070> another<00:00:38.370> feel

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
the metal feel real only another feel

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.100 
the metal feel real only another feel
real<00:00:38.879> while<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.180> common-rail<00:00:39.510> pressure

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
real while the common-rail pressure

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.610 
real while the common-rail pressure
sensor<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:42.300> original<00:00:42.660> connector<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.230> ESO

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
sensor and the original connector on ESO

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.569 
sensor and the original connector on ESO
want<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.960> remove<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> plug<00:00:49.460> port<00:00:50.460> off

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
want to do this remove the plug port off

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.799 
want to do this remove the plug port off
to<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:50.879> side<00:00:51.770> okay

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
to one side okay

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.959 
to one side okay
see<00:00:54.809> our<00:00:54.960> module<00:00:55.289> has<00:00:55.440> two<00:00:55.680> connections<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
see our module has two connections the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.369 
see our module has two connections the
first<00:00:57.270> connection<00:00:57.600> I'm<00:00:58.410> gonna<00:00:58.680> put<00:00:59.420> and<00:01:00.420> at

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
first connection I'm gonna put and at

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.200 
first connection I'm gonna put and at
the<00:01:01.440> pressure<00:01:01.680> sensor<00:01:02.219> listen<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> click

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the pressure sensor listen for the click

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.859 
the pressure sensor listen for the click
that's<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> end<00:01:04.409> nice<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.920> tight<00:01:05.720> second<00:01:06.720> one

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
that's the end nice and tight second one

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.170 
that's the end nice and tight second one
dead<00:01:07.200> easy<00:01:07.350> or<00:01:08.100> Mario<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.700> original

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
dead easy or Mario for the original

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.010 
dead easy or Mario for the original
connector<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:14.790> also<00:01:14.939> click<00:01:15.330> nice

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
connector and that will also click nice

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.870 
connector and that will also click nice
and<00:01:16.290> tight<00:01:20.360> back<00:01:21.360> down<00:01:22.220> next<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.640> find

and tight back down next in it is find

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.999 
and tight back down next in it is find
somewhere<00:01:24.180> mount<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> module<00:01:24.960> we're<00:01:25.830> gonna

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
somewhere mount the module we're gonna

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.840 
somewhere mount the module we're gonna
come<00:01:26.280> round

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.160
