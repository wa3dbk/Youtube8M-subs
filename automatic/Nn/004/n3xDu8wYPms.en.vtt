00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.260
 for me we have a tablet props completely different good 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.910
 it's different here personal 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.989
 because it is able to communicate with your mobile phone 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.639
 good if my when is a blackberry 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.869
 with all of you 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.860
 the queen does not waste time 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.600
 rivero that engages small that bets by a multitáctil screen of 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.859
 7 inches 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.609
 but that has a great resolution 1024 by 600 almost almost the same resolution 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.429
 that has the ipad the sheet also has a touch frame 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.840
 which enables 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.070
 extend its use beyond the screen 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.810
 behind 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.290
 it has programmed in anti-slip rubber if we look more closely we find 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.970
 down here good connection my uncle ho st next a mini hdmi connection 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.730
 next we have a connection of SMEs to connect a cobble 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.280
 on top 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.860
 we met with him hector millán from 3com to five to put him 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 a headphones 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.420
 we have here the multimedia volume controls 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.340
 and next to us we have the button of what the lit and off in front we have 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.600
 with a 3 megapixel camera that serves to make video conferences between 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.509
 other things and on the sides 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.659
 we find two speakers that by the way sounds very good 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.990
 back part 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.620
 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.770
 what the flash does not have 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.140
 was the company controlled by a dual-core processor though 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.310
 always lacked ram memory 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.420
 it has sent in capacities of 16 32 64 gigas 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.990
 but eye that does not have a new expansion 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.020
 the full is the only tablet uses the new qnx operating system created 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.730
 originally for industrial environments that one of the strengths of its 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.640
 operating system is excellent multitasking performance 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.799
 that allows you 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.340
 use several applications running at the same time 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.400
 offers a desktop based on what they call letters 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.900
 that allows you to see intuitively all the contents that 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.590
 you have open the latest sales success is internet and your browser 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.910
 has the ability to navigate pages with html5 or with flash 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.539
 all great and here we come to the most controversial point that happens with the mail 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:26.779
 Well, you have two options or do this through the commission of the black berry 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:32.109
 to full use the secure connection gross performances through the web 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.889
 because nowadays they do not have any application that allows you 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.149
 set up your email as for example the daily mail have promised 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:43.589
 that this point will be solved soon but that moment is a point 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.109
 weak to it was set 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.650
 and they talk about April through the pelvis with the playbook so it shows me the 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:55.239
 messages the contacts the calendar and everything you can imagine milan perry 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.849
 You can also use for example 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:57.820
 the gps 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.709
 cobo the data 3g 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.929
 at the moment he turned off the blackberry 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.699
 no information of these remain more than anything 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.769
 so there is no sensitive data that can be lost at the time of 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.249
 pirandello god forbid another point in its favor is that it can be configured 

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.050
 and managed for your business 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.809
 better than none 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:27.769
 its price 499 mc 16 gigas 599 32 and 699 the 64 gigas box was going and its weight 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.850
 425 grams 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.600
 perfect to take it to any bag even in the pocket of the 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.990
 jacket in short that we liked lots so we put him 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.359
 our foot stamp pt 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.489
 and you know that if you want to know more about table is about phones or 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.030
 any other bump that happens 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.790
 on this visit do not feel guilty the easy and fun technology until 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.530
