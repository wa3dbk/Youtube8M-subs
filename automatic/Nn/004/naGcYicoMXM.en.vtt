00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.630
 It is everyone Hello world rubber market's 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.460
 ToDay 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:16.450
 I think that I want to do about this theme 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:18.600
 I would like to work on the easy side spin short practice method 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.170
 By watching this video 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.760
 Though it is side spin short 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:31.650
 It says the usual way to the place that contains that short Pan Pan 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:36.210
 First of all, the speed is slowed down first, so the other party's 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:43.649
 Reflection speed for pitch speed of this ball 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:44.910
 Nde it can take away to also suddenly rotation is applied and kick ass First, the amount of rotation with respect to it 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.360
 I have to read 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.400
 After the place called or the orientation of the rotation is lateral rotation of the or landscape under rotation of the In 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.050
 Watch the rotation 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.450
 It is possible to take away also reflected speed of at Tteyuu very took to the other party 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.840
 Odious 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:06.430
 Even if you hit it, it may be 3 or not, but whether it is turning properly or not 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:11.200
 Because so that do not know a technique This is a very effective technique 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:15.510
 It is a side spin short but you can get three effects 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:21.500
 Variations of the short will increase First though I'm the first one 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:25.160
 It is a short with a normal return and a male with a pan and play 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.040
 Is I have a lot of people who can be replaced but the Tteyuu side say and one Kyu here 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.810
 Spin short 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.610
 The variation of the short can be increased like 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.890
 next 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.720
 It is possible to shift the Well of Sheikh backhand timing of opponent 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.010
 It means 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:50.440
 After all one pompon runs and dodono and shake 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:54.200
 Te late Fuwan while making a turn in there but I will come raining because backfire shake people 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.649
 When it comes , the teaching comes out without a little timing 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.670
 There are quite a lot of people who take shape 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.670
 May be specific 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.259
 It is the third but it is the third effect 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.260
 After doing a side spin short 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.600
 It means that you can collect the next ball in the back 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:18.200
 What happens if you can collect it back? 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:24.220
 Is to say that I once sold Te Dokan interrupted while the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.220
 There are three effects like this if you remember the side spin 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.660
 Main subject's side spin from here 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.190
 Though it is easy practice method 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.190
 When it say what kind of training method 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.440
 From straight 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:46.060
 Ask out a long serve is gradually practice method that will move to cross 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.060
 First of all please watch the play video 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.720
 Putsu 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.510
 Yes How was the video 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:35.770
 It is 8 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:40.060
 If you start with a cross and try to get a side spin 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.450
 After all, doing this it's often deviates to the side than er back cross 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.990
 I'm getting a side spin 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.040
 Over here and say 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:53.600
 Is a person who would skip has Tsu that would skip the Fern often 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.800
 Slightly since First ask out of the straight 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:02.760
 I 'm in the middle, you're in the middle 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:05.170
 While motion as it slides to the left you come to Long Saab 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.180
 I will put in a side spin 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:13.599
 It's getting more and more 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:15.810
 Wear a sense of putting in a side spin short by going from straight to cross 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:23.550
 It means to go 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:27.270
 If you can finally do a side spin when the other driver comes in, this is pretty 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.319
 I think that what will the nasty weapon to take to the other party 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.830
 If you want to increase the variation of the short Challenge to side spin short by all means 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.830
 Please try
