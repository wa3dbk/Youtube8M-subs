00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.580
 so welcome to another more call video 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.440
 of duty fans of the farc we're going 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 to see all together and it 's worth the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.559
 accessory fire fast as many already 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.599
 you will know the rapid fire is an accessory 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.730
 that makes your bullets shoot them more 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.250
 fast of the weapon but of course that has 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.080
 certain advantages and certain disadvantages and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.730
 now let's see all together so 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.140
 well let's go there let's start with the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.160
 major disadvantages that the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.869
 rapid fire and as we are seeing 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.640
 obviously not new to any call of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.289
 duty the rapid fire in what it does 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.119
 it's basically that the weapon is going away 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.579
 for basin has a very high recoil 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.410
 and that makes you miss many bullets and the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.910
 precision fails a lot in a game 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.980
 where precision is very important 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.020
 I think that the issue of 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.640
 that is viable but that rapid fire 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.200
 while as we are seeing if not 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.090
 we carry out rapid fire obviously the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.649
 bullets do not scatter so much and makes 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.719
 we have better marksmanship for which 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.610
 we can kill our enemy 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.899
 much more easily we will see 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.000
 here now on the wall 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.590
 comparison to the left shots of 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.760
 fast fire and right without fire 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.800
 fast and the truth that there is a great 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.300
 difference but nevertheless happening already 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.620
 the positive things of the rapid fire 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.930
 as we have more firing rate 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.729
 we can kill our enemy more 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.840
 we can easily see here that what 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.539
 sent in zero 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.340
 three tenths of a second while yes 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.500
 we do not have quick games we stop a 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.569
 weapon that does not have rapid fire we kill 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.939
 from zero with four seconds but the 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:20.219
 question is that everything you kill before 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.020
 it's worth it for a tenth of a second 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.789
 has the rapid fire with what is going 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.409
 the weapon then the answers sincerely 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.030
 is not the rapid fire in this game 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.439
 it's not worth anything talking about a 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.569
 known and that the aim is super 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.549
 difficult and it is very difficult to hit bullets 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.100
 since people are jumping doing das 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.020
 It is up and down is essential 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.490
 aim and above if we talk about fire 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.170
 fast that will be very much how we are 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.789
 seeing I think it's not worth anything 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.560
 penalty because if you have bad aim or the 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.000
 weapon goes a lot you're not going to hit 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.590
 bullets and obviously you're going to die now 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.989
 we are seeing a gun without fire 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.819
 fast it's a submachine gun and look how good 

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.469
 which is enclosed in quotation marks since above 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.599
 submachine gun is not a big strong in this 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.429
 game since an endorsement 27 for example kills 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.869
 just as well as a submachine gun close to 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.250
 the left we are seeing shots of 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.689
 fast fire and right without fire 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.030
 fast and the truth is that there is a great 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.770
 difference apart now let's see that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.530
 not always the rapid fire kills before 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.910
 because analyze one after the second I 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.519
 I have done and here we are going to see that with 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.350
 rapid fire kills 500 while if 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.850
 it was a quick kill of 500 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.600
 and three there is not a big difference 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.400
 honestly it is very similar so if 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.200
 we talk about a tenth or less one 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.050
 tenth and talking about that the aim is 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.090
 very difficult and as I say many maps 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.430
 they are great and giant we go with 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.260
 submachine guns and with rapid fire does not go 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.270
 to come out nothing good so as well I 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.890
 I repeat it's not worth it and not even with 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.180
 vertical grip that is like the 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.280
 took to the left we are seeing 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.070
 rapid fire and grip that makes 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.900
 we also have better aim but nothing 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.030
 that is, it stays the same, we lose many 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.740
 bullets are expressed many bullets and not worth 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.000
 nothing worth it or with a grip 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.710
 we are seeing fire hilt 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.120
 fast we do not have to the left and a 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.130
 weapon without accessories we have it to the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.900
 right all are their rifles so 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.610
 nothing is not worth the rapid fire in 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.780
 this game but everything that is not worth it 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.490
 the rapid fire in this game I 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.170
 I would like you to see the speed at which 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.580
 spend a charger fast fire let's go 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.860
 to see with rapid fire we spend a 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.690
 charger in 29 seconds while yes 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.340
 we do not carry fast fire spend them with 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.040
 the incredible figure of three with six 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.640
 seconds so 45 bullets if I do not 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.680
 mistaken 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.110
 with fast fire two with nine and three 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.360
 with six without rapid fire are seven 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.670
 tenths seven tenths of a second 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.740
 there's not much difference so like 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.020
 I say to myself honestly I do not just 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.700
 convince the fire fast since neither 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.800
 shoot the bullets incredibly the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.630
 fast there is not a big difference takes 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.460
 a lot of bullets and besides that neither 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.620
 you kill a lot faster so 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.690
 definitely do not set fire fast 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.280
 It's not worth it, although if you 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.440
 It goes well, obviously in putting on what 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.390
 but my opinion at a statistical level and 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.010
 level that I have tried it does not apply to 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.780
 nothing worth a quick fire in this 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.980
 game so nothing that ends the video of 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.450
 today if you really liked the video 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.430
 has already served you can give you a good 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.780
 like that helps me a lot and if still 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.430
 I'm subscribed to the channel, you can do it

 totally free until someone 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.100
 change let's hope it never happens so 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.540
 nothing I say goodbye to everyone and 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.260
