so part 3 we are going to assemble the
cake<00:00:03.740> so<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:05.069> like<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:06.180> make<00:00:06.569> my<00:00:06.629> kicks<00:00:07.140> into<00:00:07.440> two

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
cake so I like to make my kicks into two

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.540 
cake so I like to make my kicks into two
layers<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:09.050> I<00:00:10.050> recommend<00:00:10.440> cutting<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.190> top

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
layers and I recommend cutting the top

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.060 
layers and I recommend cutting the top
and<00:00:11.759> bottom<00:00:12.120> off<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:14.599> did<00:00:15.599> not<00:00:15.719> cut<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.109> top<00:00:16.590> nor

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and bottom off I did not cut the top nor

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.150 
and bottom off I did not cut the top nor
the<00:00:17.369> bottom<00:00:17.730> off<00:00:17.910> because<00:00:18.570> i<00:00:18.810> was<00:00:18.990> lazy<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.770> i

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
the bottom off because i was lazy and i

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.620 
the bottom off because i was lazy and i
was<00:00:20.250> thinking<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> cake<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.330> small

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
was thinking that the cake is so small

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.730 
was thinking that the cake is so small
already<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.519> shouldn't<00:00:23.519> cut<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:25.080> bottom<00:00:25.410> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
already I shouldn't cut the bottom and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
already I shouldn't cut the bottom and
top<00:00:26.070> off<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.650> recommend<00:00:28.650> at<00:00:29.099> least<00:00:29.160> cutting

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
top off but I recommend at least cutting

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.179 
top off but I recommend at least cutting
the<00:00:30.000> top<00:00:30.300> off<00:00:30.480> because<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.140> don't<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the top off because I don't like the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.660 
the top off because I don't like the
crunchy<00:00:32.759> feeling<00:00:33.180> when<00:00:33.690> I'm<00:00:33.840> eating<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.440> cake

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
crunchy feeling when I'm eating the cake

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.479 
crunchy feeling when I'm eating the cake
because<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.910> frosting<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.719> smooth<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
because the frosting is so smooth and

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.590 
because the frosting is so smooth and
cake<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.730> very<00:00:39.000> moist<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.820> smooth<00:00:41.820> also<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
cake is very moist and smooth also I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.990 
cake is very moist and smooth also I
just<00:00:43.500> don't<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.040> crunchy<00:00:44.399> feeling<00:00:44.730> but

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
just don't like that crunchy feeling but

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.990 
just don't like that crunchy feeling but
if<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.809> are<00:00:45.840> okay<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.489> totally

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
if you are okay with it you can totally

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.779 
if you are okay with it you can totally
just<00:00:48.180> skip<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.590> leave<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
just skip it and just leave it as it is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.160

two big dollops of the frosting on the
top<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.880> may<00:01:12.479> look<00:01:12.510> like<00:01:13.080> there's<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.010> lot<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
top it may look like there's a lot of
frosting<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:15.000> first<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.450> trust<00:01:15.960> me<00:01:16.020> it's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
frosting at first but trust me it's

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.649 
frosting at first but trust me it's
gonna<00:01:16.799> work<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.490> later<00:01:18.350> just<00:01:19.350> put<00:01:19.560> about

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
gonna work all out later just put about

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.080 
gonna work all out later just put about
three-fourths<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.990> what<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:23.090> your

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
three-fourths of what you have of your

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.300 
three-fourths of what you have of your
total<00:01:24.390> amount<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.140> frosting<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.799> top<00:01:26.130> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
total amount of frosting on the top of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.300 
total amount of frosting on the top of
the<00:01:26.520> cake

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.640 

so<00:01:33.310> when<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.610> think<00:01:33.820> that<00:01:34.150> it's<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:35.170> big<00:01:35.350> amount

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
so when you think that it's a big amount

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.820 
so when you think that it's a big amount
already<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.210> can<00:01:37.390> just<00:01:37.750> start<00:01:38.110> spreading

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
already and you can just start spreading

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.030 
already and you can just start spreading
defrosting<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.360> rare<00:01:40.690> edges<00:01:41.320> of<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.830> cake

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
defrosting to the rare edges of the cake

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.030 
defrosting to the rare edges of the cake
it<00:01:42.850> will<00:01:43.390> not<00:01:43.720> like<00:01:43.990> fall<00:01:44.230> down<00:01:44.470> or<00:01:44.650> anything

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
it will not like fall down or anything

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.830 
it will not like fall down or anything
it<00:01:45.340> would<00:01:45.490> just<00:01:45.700> like<00:01:45.910> kind<00:01:46.150> of<00:01:46.180> like<00:01:46.240> stay

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
it would just like kind of like stay

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.710 
it would just like kind of like stay
there<00:01:47.110> it's<00:01:47.520> pretty<00:01:48.520> cool<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.600> was

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
there it's pretty cool and because I was

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.120 
there it's pretty cool and because I was
doing<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.050> video<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.770> was<00:01:54.010> very<00:01:54.780> impatient<00:01:55.780> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
doing the video I was very impatient and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.270 
doing the video I was very impatient and
I<00:01:57.130> did<00:01:57.400> not<00:01:57.430> let<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.970> kick<00:01:58.650> fully<00:01:59.650> cool<00:02:00.040> down

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
I did not let the kick fully cool down

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.410 
I did not let the kick fully cool down
before<00:02:00.520> frosting<00:02:01.180> it<00:02:01.330> so<00:02:01.900> make<00:02:02.110> sure<00:02:02.140> that<00:02:02.320> you

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
before frosting it so make sure that you

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.030 
before frosting it so make sure that you
cool<00:02:04.420> your<00:02:04.600> kick<00:02:04.840> down<00:02:05.080> before<00:02:05.470> frosting<00:02:05.830> or

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
cool your kick down before frosting or

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.730 
cool your kick down before frosting or
the<00:02:06.370> frosting<00:02:06.850> will<00:02:07.000> melt<00:02:07.210> like<00:02:07.600> what<00:02:08.320> my<00:02:08.470> kick

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
the frosting will melt like what my kick

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.460 
the frosting will melt like what my kick
is<00:02:08.860> doing<00:02:09.130> right<00:02:09.250> now<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:10.960> still<00:02:11.170> tastes

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
is doing right now but it still tastes

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.970 
is doing right now but it still tastes
really<00:02:11.680> good<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.080> kind<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.440> see<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
really good so you kind of see that the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.800 
really good so you kind of see that the
frosting<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.490> kind<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.850> like<00:02:15.940> laying<00:02:16.390> on<00:02:16.690> the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.290 
frosting is kind of like laying on the
edge<00:02:16.960> but<00:02:17.350> not<00:02:17.530> falling<00:02:17.980> down<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:19.000> okay

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
edge but not falling down it's okay

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.830

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
on the sides just don't try to smooth it

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.960 
on the sides just don't try to smooth it
out<00:02:28.810> now<00:02:29.020> just<00:02:29.050> like<00:02:29.440> slap<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.920> on<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.280> we<00:02:30.760> will

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
out now just like slap it on and we will

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.290 
out now just like slap it on and we will
fix<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.420> later<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.920> try<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.190> cover<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.970> whole

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
fix it later just try to cover the whole

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.320 
fix it later just try to cover the whole
cake<00:02:34.330> with<00:02:35.140> frosting<00:02:35.790> who<00:02:36.790> cares<00:02:37.030> about<00:02:37.239> how

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
cake with frosting who cares about how

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
cake with frosting who cares about how
it<00:02:37.420> looks<00:02:37.570> right<00:02:37.630> now<00:02:37.810> it's<00:02:38.020> gonna<00:02:38.200> look

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
it looks right now it's gonna look

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.030 
it looks right now it's gonna look
beautiful<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.550> smooth<00:02:39.850> later<00:02:40.120> okay<00:02:41.040> just

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
beautiful and smooth later okay just

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.540 
beautiful and smooth later okay just
smear<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.430> thing<00:02:42.760> on<00:02:42.880> I<00:02:46.320> find<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.620> spatula

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
smear that thing on I find the spatula

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.850 
smear that thing on I find the spatula
to<00:02:48.910> work<00:02:49.060> best<00:02:49.420> right<00:02:49.840> here<00:02:50.050> because<00:02:50.350> it<00:02:50.680> has<00:02:50.830> a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
to work best right here because it has a

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.190 
to work best right here because it has a
bigger<00:02:51.130> surface<00:02:51.400> area<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.209> it's<00:02:52.959> more

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
bigger surface area and it's more

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.950 
bigger surface area and it's more
efficient

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.320 

so<00:02:57.800> after<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.280> think<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.790> have<00:02:58.910> smeared

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
so after you think that you have smeared

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.530 
so after you think that you have smeared
all<00:02:59.540> sides<00:02:59.900> already<00:03:00.880> your<00:03:01.880> frosting<00:03:02.330> should

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
all sides already your frosting should

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.740 
all sides already your frosting should
be<00:03:02.630> all<00:03:02.780> gone<00:03:03.640> if<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.790> think<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:05.240> it's<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.570> lot

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
be all gone if you think that it's a lot

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.260 
be all gone if you think that it's a lot
frosting<00:03:06.320> right<00:03:06.410> now<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:07.070> okay<00:03:07.880> where

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
frosting right now it's okay where

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.580 
frosting right now it's okay where
you're<00:03:08.450> going<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.720> take<00:03:08.900> some<00:03:09.110> out<00:03:09.290> later

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
you're going to take some out later

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.410 
you're going to take some out later
we're<00:03:10.190> not<00:03:10.340> going<00:03:10.460> to<00:03:10.520> use<00:03:10.640> all<00:03:10.850> of<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.240> on

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
we're not going to use all of this on

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.700 
we're not going to use all of this on
the<00:03:11.540> cake<00:03:12.280> we<00:03:13.280> are<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.580> trying<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.410> get<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.440> lot

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
the cake we are just trying to get a lot

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.690 
the cake we are just trying to get a lot
of<00:03:15.740> frosting<00:03:16.070> on<00:03:16.460> to<00:03:18.070> make<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.220> job<00:03:19.430> easier

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
of frosting on to make the job easier

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.050 
of frosting on to make the job easier
later<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.510> can<00:03:20.870> say<00:03:21.020> it<00:03:21.140> like<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:22.060> when

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
later I can say it like that and when

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.540 
later I can say it like that and when
you're<00:03:24.020> done<00:03:24.260> smearing<00:03:24.770> everything<00:03:25.190> on<00:03:25.400> the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
you're done smearing everything on the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.000 
you're done smearing everything on the
cake<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:26.210> can<00:03:26.360> just<00:03:26.540> use<00:03:26.750> your<00:03:27.050> metal<00:03:27.680> spatula

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
cake you can just use your metal spatula

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.310 
cake you can just use your metal spatula
and<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:28.430> kind<00:03:29.300> of<00:03:29.390> smooth<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.810> out<00:03:29.870> now<00:03:30.080> and

and just kind of smooth it out now and

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.230 
and just kind of smooth it out now and
you<00:03:31.190> can<00:03:31.340> see<00:03:31.550> that<00:03:31.730> there's<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.030> lot<00:03:32.180> of

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
you can see that there's a lot of

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.970 
you can see that there's a lot of
frosting<00:03:32.600> sticking<00:03:33.200> on<00:03:33.320> your<00:03:33.470> metal<00:03:33.740> spatula

on that we're just going to take a
little<00:03:44.330> bit<00:03:44.540> off<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.040> just<00:03:46.040> kind<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.310> go<00:03:46.490> with
