00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.500
 after the insolvency in resolution of thq 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.650
 Some already have entertainment 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.660
 thanked company of heroes 2 but it is 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.420
 landed in good hands soon 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.130
 distributed by Koch Media and on the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.529
 market and we have been in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.880
 the closed beta of the game crashed and 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.460
 first impressions collected 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.320
 matthias tables played yes and right 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.840
 Extensive and must say the price 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.300
 although we are now at the closed beta only 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.140
 the multiplayer variants single player 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.969
 mode of awareness around the soviets and around 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.980
 this will continue so could not even 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.590
 but not try the online 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.539
 multiplayer is almost everything really good 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.210
 We had a total of six tickets to 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.700
 disposal and also a large range 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.289
 Vehicles and technologies so that you 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.320
 since all the tactics from problem 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.760
 could be graphically very nice again 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.680
 Of course they have one again 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.230
 Latte put on the smoke is very 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.149
 voluminous we just saw and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.339
 there is now also this tool insight 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.650
 system which means that the units 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.150
 really by such things as smoke 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.500
 or other obstacles in your sight 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.659
 are limited and that makes 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.820
 playful really really much ago 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.100
 that's the way you have, for example 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.540
 also grenades or you can also man 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.400
 some vehicles can be handy 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.290
 use for example a broken one 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.520
 Vehicle forward the thing explodes 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.049
 and behind them come the soldiers 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.759
 the enemy can not see the soldiers 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.850
 that can work very well 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.840
 that can be tactical for some 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.909
 make surprises with the opponent 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.400
 how were the stability at the moment? 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.530
 game we had zero crashes and also 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.640
 so from the balancing autumn that felt 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.590
 play really well 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.020
 the computer opponents were already one 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.850
 bit met but you need it 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.780
 first a get-together that one 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.780
 learn the game first 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.030
 and what I really love about it 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.820
 already macabre is all these effects 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.770
 and all that, so I hardly know one 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.670
 real time strategy game that you good 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.740
 would look like 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.560
 reliquie has got it right 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.630
 which I still miss a bit 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.550
 are vehicles i have so far only 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.500
 seen some light chain vehicles 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.380
 but the farmers come down eight 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.430
 and he can see a donation like that 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.390
 so that they are really good but 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.180
 Vehicles are like already in the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.070
 completely filus 1 who is a luxury so 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.500
 You can not do that at the very beginning 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.030
 build later in the game and there you can 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.950
 you do not even dream about it now 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.310
 into the mini 20 tanks to pull 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.500
 the tactically 23 well applicable or 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.930
 klose armor for example formal 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.940
 start decide that's one 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.910
 battle in the winter that is also a new one 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.490
 feature of the game when rivers freeze 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.050
 you can completely new ways on maps 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.550
 open safely and can be in the enemy for 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.140
 fall from behind in the back 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.910
 but of course it also has disadvantages 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.950
 are frozen on and yes just 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.620
 Everything looks good can happen 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.070
 a big window over that influence 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.330
 and or over ice and speaks a panzer 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.280
 that can happen 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.590
 and that was certainly not cheap 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.840
 Not at all that's the thing so it 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.330
 There are three different resources and 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.360
 only oil can beans armor is oil 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.160
 Seldom sown but winter brings 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.500
 some other problems with yourself and 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.060
 Although not usually quite cold 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.860
 cold there is blizzard we have 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.340
 right now so there is precursor 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.640
 from that 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.260
 it's like a minister in real life 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.610
 snowstorm and that means of course 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.980
 that the visibility hardly 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.230
 but not only that is there 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.010
 Of course it gets freezing cold and that means 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.720
 for the soldiers 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.180
 they either have to be a fireplace 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.850
 find or in those building ums 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.140
 they can die and the fireplaces 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.930
 I not yet quickly assemble 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.720
 would be if a passerby is no but with 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.020
 my pioneers so hearty others 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.730
 time anytime 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.040
 that means I have to be in advance 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.170
 to prepare for such events and 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.970
 rush ahead in time 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.510
 do not mourn for a soldier 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.280
 threaten 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.990
 So sure you really have a 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.420
 computer from two very many things 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.710
 but pay attention to the result so far 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.710
 really successful
