00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.510

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.830

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.509
 I was so happy this apartment was 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.970
 so great and not expensive 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.730
 and then no internet, this dream 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.470
 as easy so prof splattered so have 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.140
 I though it may not be not 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.400
 that have well therefore see now can 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 But I'm leaving you want that now 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.710
 just let it know that it was yesterday 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.670
 has expired 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.530
 I want to do you a few things 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.660
 I present now in the last 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.280
 days in the last month so a bit 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.559
 used more often and I start directly 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.820
 on 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.129
 do you know these chains that are like that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.870
 so this chain braided the love 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.300
 I have very very great 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.000
 I bought from h &amp; m not braided 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.309
 but also so this pearl and I have 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.360
 grad 12 99 cost but it is up 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.890
 Now I think one of the most beautiful 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.559
 chains that I have created more and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.500
 also in a similar pattern 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.890
 but I had similar similar 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.570
 structure so i believe i say that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.850
 now again I can not speak German 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:25.229
 with political commitment this kind of 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.549
 This type of chain is currently caught 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.340
 very good I have from here 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.750
 cotta bought for 10 euros before then is 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.810
 that rather so that I am sitting now or you 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.420
 in a cafÃ© and who likes someone and 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.890
 start with the tasty exchange 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.310
 Realizes that this sudden 1 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.149
 seconds look that since the total toll 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.649
 are and you just so yes you can find 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.750
 he really does not know him 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.560
 again hot what is on the job whether the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.590
 unemployed person 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.290
 you just only so electricity 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.000
 just so much energy from the reception 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.369
 By the way , it is so that you the people 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.040
 actually attracts people attracts the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.590
 so are you like yourself if you are like that 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.179
 energy radiates then come 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.099
 actually only people back to you 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:17.329
 I once heard the 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:18.590
 the same bed we have so okay 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.790
 have looked at us now and we find 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.159
 Us great and now what do you do 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.329
 Now I ask myself that way I can 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:32.090
 not imagine that the gentleman then 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.849
 so now put in the courage and says 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.709
 or appeals to me or something 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.159
 you can do that one has to 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.139
 shit web download or what can 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.459
 you do 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:48.049
 I can not say as before them yes 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.879
 hello I'm just that goes in the 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.989
 Turkey for God's sake 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.699
 I understand I'm wrong 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.040
 men search but that only has me now 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:56.930
 sometimes as interested as you actually are 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.459
 You get to know each other as you actually do 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.219
 Meet new people if you are 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.489
 actually no friends has so 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:08.780
 he is with me at the moment 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:11.569
 okay, please do not go wrong 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.900
 understand i read a book that 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.900
 is called 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:22.790
 why do men like bad girls 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:26.569
 It got me the book within three 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.139
 hours read that were 100 540 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.549
 pages 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.579
 I think there are also in German if 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.340
 I then find cheers 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:39.349
 After reading the book he was like that 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:41.659
 I'm not so after this book 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.500
 I just learned a lot too 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.780
 good-natured 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.489
 There are girls, for example, one 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.900
 hour on the partner wait for 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.199
 example comes with the first leather partner 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.599
 too late I spend an hour on my partner 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.949
 I would wait to be the old one now 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.099
 I want to say okay okay 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:04:00.349
 if you go bad girl up 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.659
 you wait half an hour and then go 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.680
 such things are in there just like that 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:08.539
 few examples and that for example 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.530
 So I found Fritz Kater found that 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:14.989
 example, you should not be too male 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.840
 So let's say it is not there 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.729
 spider and you can actually 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.290
 you also remove yourself but i said 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.660
 can not use the ground must 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.400
 necessarily do and here and there can 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.350
 you open about the rare bottle or 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.480
 do you have a thing can times the light bulb 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.090
 exchange so that choices men good 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.350
 Find 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.930
 okay I can do everything myself 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.280
 but I do not know what then in the 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.020
 men in front of money from then on 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.240
 but I am needed or not 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.490
 but unaware of this feeling out alive 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.270
 Well, so I totally loved this book 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.470
 cool so then I have an example max 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.430
 And there I have a pair of glasses 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:58.850
 you bought the brand trussardi 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:01.280
 trussardi okay i think that's one 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.610
 Italian brand was the glasses 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.950
 lowered from 300 euros to 20 euros 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.920
 I bought the ones I like them cool 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.240
 is really cool filter category 3 the 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.580
 I would not use the word "cool" but 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.050
 missing the category 3 and would like too 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.060
 I put it somehow clear as with 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:23.150
 in any case I am without glasses 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:25.850
 recently this here pendik marinade where 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.520
 just like that and so are and then 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:34.340
 I see the glasses so look at the 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.570
 price 500 euro is there I have before so 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.340
 You also have to buy a bargain 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.810
 given the eyeglasses country told 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.370
 can you have a look? 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.590
 really an original and the man 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.080
 has confirmed yes that is an original 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.850
 trussardi glasses and yes sometimes there is 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.140
 at tk maxx really good bargain and 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.270
 I was very happy about it and 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.830
 They really like to truck you too 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:56.450
 if they have something big but now 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.889
 I still have two cosmetic products for you 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.430
 in fact 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.710
 totally shocked so the masterpiece 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.419
 liquid eyeliner from maybelline that has 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.740
 such a very thin point I do not know 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.180
 if I can see that, then 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.479
 really very thin tip 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.009
 I love I love the I'm 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.189
 now for two weeks have the more for 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:19.219
 bought seven euros but so great back then 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:21.409
 you can be such a nice tip so 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.840
 make a point eyeliner and he is 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.029
 really nice black and then at 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.569
 springs still at free but there are 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:31.789
 unfortunately nothing free.de track and I have 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:34.610
 me the first time the Bahama mama 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:36.430
 purchased that is actually that 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.949
 I believe one has to be the industry 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.909
 as bronzing powder that's what the whole thing looks like 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:45.080
 but I use this as a whole 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:46.159
 contour and here you can also good 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.529
 realize that I'm a bit 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:50.719
 but sometimes it has to be exaggerated 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:52.400
 be that way and i'll find the color 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:54.979
 actually really good with me 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.900
 and so you see yourself I'm one 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.339
 very bright day and I have the way 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.990
 today the climate skate make up again 

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:02.089
 I am full on that again 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:06.469
 skater make-up ascended 

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:08.779
 my cousin has in her puberty 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:11.180
 so acne had and very much 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:12.919
 many took and holes and it has 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.419
 very dissatisfied and said yes me 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:16.430
 try the klima skip make up 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.919
 and he has them out of them 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:22.189
 something is ordered immediately or half 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:24.740
 share it was only 10 euros and respect 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:26.479

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:33.259

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:34.339

 again regularly but as I said if 

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:48.199
 I would have a flat then I would 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.149
 really counted drank video posts 

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:53.240

00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:56.469
 Well, that's the name, ok, I'm pushing you 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.469
