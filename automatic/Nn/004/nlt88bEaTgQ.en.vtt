sent in by Francesca and this is related

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.980 
sent in by Francesca and this is related
to<00:00:08.040> Phalaenopsis<00:00:08.940> orchids<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.540> their<00:00:09.750> flower

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
to Phalaenopsis orchids and their flower

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.440 
to Phalaenopsis orchids and their flower
spikes<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.679> said<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.429> previous<00:00:11.880> video<00:00:12.030> that

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
spikes I said in a previous video that

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.959 
spikes I said in a previous video that
some<00:00:12.980> Phalaenopsis<00:00:13.980> orchids<00:00:14.340> should<00:00:14.610> not

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
some Phalaenopsis orchids should not

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.870 
some Phalaenopsis orchids should not
have<00:00:15.269> their<00:00:15.540> flower<00:00:15.780> spikes<00:00:16.230> cuts<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.010> she

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
have their flower spikes cuts and she

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.490 
have their flower spikes cuts and she
asked<00:00:18.119> me<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.420> elaborate<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.960> bit<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.350> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
asked me to elaborate a bit on the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.759 
asked me to elaborate a bit on the
subject<00:00:19.949> okay<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.930> clarify<00:00:21.930> things<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.529> will

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
subject okay to clarify things I will

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.679 
subject okay to clarify things I will
start<00:00:22.980> by<00:00:23.130> saying<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.670> most<00:00:23.939> Phalaenopsis

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
start by saying that most Phalaenopsis

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.080 
start by saying that most Phalaenopsis
orchids<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.500> find<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.949> stores<00:00:26.099> like

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
orchids that we can find in stores like

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.720 
orchids that we can find in stores like
this<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.750> are<00:00:27.990> complex<00:00:28.920> hybrids

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
this one are complex hybrids

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.759 
this one are complex hybrids
this<00:00:30.090> means<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.660> species<00:00:30.990> were<00:00:31.410> crushed

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
this means that species were crushed

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.370 
this means that species were crushed
together<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.480> resulting<00:00:33.960> hybrids

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
together and then the resulting hybrids

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.410 
together and then the resulting hybrids
were<00:00:34.559> crushed<00:00:34.950> again<00:00:35.309> together<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.210> on

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
were crushed again together and so on

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.350 
were crushed again together and so on
and<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.780> forth<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.680> lot<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.370> generations

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and so forth for a lot of generations

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.560 
and so forth for a lot of generations
actually<00:00:39.710> until<00:00:40.710> scientists<00:00:41.460> or<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.180> persons

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
actually until scientists or the persons

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.430 
actually until scientists or the persons
who<00:00:42.920> crossed<00:00:43.920> orchids<00:00:44.809> developed<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:46.079> phone

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
who crossed orchids developed some phone

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.440 
who crossed orchids developed some phone
apps<00:00:46.680> or<00:00:46.800> circuits<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.340> produce<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.820> lot<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
apps or circuits that produce a lot of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.139 
apps or circuits that produce a lot of
flowers<00:00:48.840> very<00:00:49.200> tall<00:00:49.500> flower<00:00:49.920> spikes<00:00:50.370> big

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
flowers very tall flower spikes big

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.869 
flowers very tall flower spikes big
flowers<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.010> most<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> orchids

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
flowers and so on so most of the orchids

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.340 
flowers and so on so most of the orchids
that<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.180> find<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> stores<00:00:55.050> are<00:00:55.320> very

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
that you find in the stores are very

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.979 
that you find in the stores are very
complex<00:00:55.949> hybrids<00:00:56.489> they're<00:00:56.969> nowhere<00:00:57.210> near<00:00:57.360> as

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
complex hybrids they're nowhere near as

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.549 
complex hybrids they're nowhere near as
close<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.000> species<00:01:00.420> look<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.260> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
close to what the species look like and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.619 
close to what the species look like and
how<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:02.039> evolved<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> goal<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.539> this

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
how they evolved now the goal with this

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.570 
how they evolved now the goal with this
massive<00:01:03.920> hybridization<00:01:04.920> was<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.250> obtain<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
massive hybridization was to obtain a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.219 
massive hybridization was to obtain a
Phalaenopsis<00:01:06.210> orchid<00:01:06.570> which<00:01:06.840> could<00:01:07.049> produce

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
Phalaenopsis orchid which could produce

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.679 
Phalaenopsis orchid which could produce
a<00:01:07.560> lot<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> flowers<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> flower<00:01:08.700> spike<00:01:09.060> those

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
a lot of flowers on a flower spike those

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.500 
a lot of flowers on a flower spike those
tall<00:01:10.229> gracious<00:01:11.040> flower<00:01:11.340> spikes<00:01:11.729> iino<00:01:12.299> and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
tall gracious flower spikes iino and

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.929 
tall gracious flower spikes iino and
some<00:01:13.020> other<00:01:13.170> things<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:14.070> along<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
some other things but along with this

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.300 
some other things but along with this
process<00:01:15.450> some<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.020> traits<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
process some of the traits that the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.179 
process some of the traits that the
species<00:01:17.610> had<00:01:18.119> were<00:01:18.450> lost<00:01:18.780> forever<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.590> one<00:01:20.009> of

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
species had were lost forever and one of

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.179 
species had were lost forever and one of
them<00:01:20.400> was<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> sequential<00:01:21.590> blooming<00:01:22.590> aspect

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
them was the sequential blooming aspect

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.490 
them was the sequential blooming aspect
of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> species<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.450> what<00:01:24.630> does<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.990> mean

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
of the species now what does this mean

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.399 
of the species now what does this mean
well<00:01:26.070> species<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:27.030> produce<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.600> flower<00:01:27.990> spike

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
well species will produce a flower spike

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.620 
well species will produce a flower spike
that<00:01:28.920> will<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.060> look<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that will really not look like the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.420 
that will really not look like the
flower<00:01:30.810> spikes<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.409> know<00:01:31.619> from<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> complex

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
flower spikes you know from the complex

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.520 
flower spikes you know from the complex
hybrids<00:01:32.939> will<00:01:33.329> produce<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.960> pretty<00:01:34.320> short

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
hybrids will produce a pretty short

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.910 
hybrids will produce a pretty short
flower<00:01:34.860> spike<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.490> probably<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.350> three

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
flower spike and probably one to three

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.850 
flower spike and probably one to three
flowers<00:01:38.250> open<00:01:38.939> at<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> time<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:40.259> after<00:01:40.650> those

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
flowers open at a time now after those

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.520 
flowers open at a time now after those
flowers<00:01:41.340> boom<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.030> die<00:01:42.270> flower<00:01:43.200> spike

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
flowers boom and die flower spike

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.160 
flowers boom and die flower spike
continues<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.549> stay<00:01:44.850> green<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.509> continues<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
continues to stay green and continues to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.499 
continues to stay green and continues to
leave<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> next<00:01:47.159> season<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:48.060> will<00:01:48.240> bloom

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
leave and the next season it will bloom

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.109 
leave and the next season it will bloom
once<00:01:48.840> again<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:50.040> your<00:01:50.189> kid<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.790> produce

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
once again but your kid can produce

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.330 
once again but your kid can produce
another<00:01:51.659> flower<00:01:51.960> spike<00:01:52.380> next<00:01:52.740> season<00:01:53.130> so

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
another flower spike next season so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
another flower spike next season so
eventually<00:01:53.850> will<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> species

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
eventually will the species

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
eventually will the species
Phalaenopsis<00:01:55.470> orchid<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.860> will<00:01:56.159> get<00:01:56.430> about<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
Phalaenopsis orchid you will get about I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.999 
Phalaenopsis orchid you will get about I
don't<00:01:57.390> know<00:01:57.570> seven<00:01:57.899> flower<00:01:58.320> spikes<00:01:58.740> all

their flower spikes cut because because

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.210

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
spikes years after years now you might

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.390 
spikes years after years now you might
wonder<00:03:21.209> why<00:03:21.420> do<00:03:21.780> species<00:03:22.500> keep<00:03:22.950> their<00:03:23.160> flower

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400

well<00:03:25.920> actually<00:03:26.310> no<00:03:27.000> because<00:03:27.450> keep<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.500> mind

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
well actually no because keep in mind

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.009 
well actually no because keep in mind
these<00:03:29.100> flower<00:03:29.400> spikes<00:03:29.730> will<00:03:29.970> not<00:03:30.150> have<00:03:30.480> big

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
these flower spikes will not have big

these flower spikes will not have big
huge<00:03:31.260> blooms<00:03:31.650> they<00:03:32.220> will<00:03:32.370> not<00:03:32.519> be<00:03:32.700> long<00:03:32.970> and

huge blooms they will not be long and

huge blooms they will not be long and
they<00:03:33.540> will<00:03:33.690> not<00:03:33.930> bear<00:03:34.230> 20<00:03:34.860> flowers<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.489> orchids

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
they will not bear 20 flowers of orchids

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.759 
they will not bear 20 flowers of orchids
they<00:03:36.450> will<00:03:36.570> have<00:03:36.780> one<00:03:37.140> two<00:03:37.350> three<00:03:37.590> little

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
they will have one two three little

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.100 
they will have one two three little
flowers<00:03:38.280> compared<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.390> hybrids<00:03:39.870> which

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
flowers compared to the hybrids which

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.580 
flowers compared to the hybrids which
can<00:03:40.350> have<00:03:40.670> 15<00:03:41.670> flowers<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.470> the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
can have 15 flowers so this is the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.070 
can have 15 flowers so this is the
downside<00:03:44.100> with<00:03:44.370> hybridizing<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:45.900> this

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
downside with hybridizing but in this

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.530 
downside with hybridizing but in this
case<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:46.830> okay<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.430> cut<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.940> flower<00:03:48.120> spike

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
case it is okay to cut the flower spike

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.259 
case it is okay to cut the flower spike
in<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.440> case<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.830> species<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.610> should<00:03:51.030> leave

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
in the case of species you should leave

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.880 
in the case of species you should leave
the<00:03:51.450> flower<00:03:51.630> spike<00:03:51.959> be<00:03:52.230> because<00:03:52.620> they<00:03:52.739> will

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
the flower spike be because they will

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.949 
the flower spike be because they will
always<00:03:53.100> ruble<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:53.790> eventually<00:03:54.360> after<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.660> few

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
always ruble and eventually after a few

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.050 
always ruble and eventually after a few
years<00:03:55.230> you'll<00:03:55.799> have<00:03:55.920> quite<00:03:56.549> a<00:03:56.580> few<00:03:56.730> flower

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
years you'll have quite a few flower

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.750 
years you'll have quite a few flower
spikes<00:03:57.450> with<00:03:57.660> tiny<00:03:57.989> few<00:03:58.799> little<00:03:59.130> flowers<00:03:59.549> but

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
spikes with tiny few little flowers but

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.729 
spikes with tiny few little flowers but
it<00:03:59.790> will<00:04:00.000> still<00:04:00.269> be<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.510> great<00:04:00.810> show<00:04:01.080> okay<00:04:01.680> so

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
it will still be a great show okay so

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.259 
it will still be a great show okay so
