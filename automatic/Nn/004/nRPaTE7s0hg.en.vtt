00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
stabbing and it's kind of like a knuckle

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.779 
stabbing and it's kind of like a knuckle
duster<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.600> fits<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:42.960> fists<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.670> can

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
duster it fits in your fists and you can

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.180 
duster it fits in your fists and you can
use<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.480> swing<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.410> use<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> punch

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.389 
use this and swing you can use it punch
and<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.329> are<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:49.140> looks<00:00:49.649> they're<00:00:49.920> not

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and these are just for looks they're not

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.889 
and these are just for looks they're not
sharpened<00:00:50.850> or<00:00:50.940> anything<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.660> still

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
sharpened or anything but they can still

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.470 
sharpened or anything but they can still
I<00:00:52.410> guess<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.430> stabbed<00:00:53.699> into<00:00:53.910> something<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I guess it be stabbed into something it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240 
I guess it be stabbed into something it
has<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> barbed<00:00:54.960> affect<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.649> small<00:00:55.949> cardboard

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
has a barbed affect the small cardboard

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.440 
has a barbed affect the small cardboard
box<00:00:59.480> like<00:01:00.480> this

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
box like this

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.670 
box like this
function<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:06.520> goes<00:01:07.520> in<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:09.080> you<00:01:09.170> can<00:01:09.320> do<00:01:09.470> as<00:01:09.650> a

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
function to goes in and you can do as a

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.920 
function to goes in and you can do as a
slash<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:16.910> hard<00:01:17.150> part<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.510> getting<00:01:17.660> both

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
slash to the hard part is getting both

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.610 
slash to the hard part is getting both
of<00:01:18.080> them<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.350> hit<00:01:18.530> exactly<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.250> same<00:01:20.470> if<00:01:21.470> you

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
of them to hit exactly the same if you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.560 
of them to hit exactly the same if you

our interesting weapon this was the
first<00:01:38.180> one<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.369> this<00:01:40.369> was<00:01:40.610> supposed<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.060> be<00:01:41.150> a

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
first one and this was supposed to be a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.080 
first one and this was supposed to be a
set<00:01:41.780> they<00:01:42.080> go<00:01:42.229> together<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:43.520> can<00:01:43.670> tell

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
set they go together you can tell

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.450 
set they go together you can tell

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
they're pretty much the exact same shape

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.070 
they're pretty much the exact same shape
but<00:01:46.460> what<00:01:47.150> I<00:01:47.180> noticed<00:01:47.540> with<00:01:47.690> this<00:01:47.840> one

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
but what I noticed with this one

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.450 
but what I noticed with this one
whenever<00:01:48.290> people<00:01:48.650> came<00:01:48.979> over<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:49.400> they

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
whenever people came over and they

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.800 
whenever people came over and they
looked<00:01:49.729> at<00:01:49.910> it<00:01:50.060> they<00:01:50.180> said<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.450> was<00:01:50.540> kind<00:01:50.750> of

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
looked at it they said it was kind of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
looked at it they said it was kind of
fat<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.680> was<00:01:51.830> really<00:01:52.100> thick<00:01:52.520> and<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:54.530> finger

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
fat it was really thick and the finger

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.859 
fat it was really thick and the finger
holes<00:01:55.040> are<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:55.250> little<00:01:55.550> bit<00:01:55.729> small<00:01:56.119> it's<00:01:56.450> aight

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
holes are a little bit small it's aight

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.320 
holes are a little bit small it's aight
end<00:01:57.110> I'm<00:01:57.380> really<00:01:57.649> skinny<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:58.640> it's<00:01:59.119> not<00:01:59.300> a

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
end I'm really skinny so it's not a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.150 
end I'm really skinny so it's not a
problem<00:01:59.509> for<00:01:59.780> me<00:01:59.810> but<00:02:00.410> pretty<00:02:00.770> much<00:02:00.890> none<00:02:01.070> of

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
problem for me but pretty much none of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.070 
problem for me but pretty much none of
my<00:02:01.220> friends<00:02:01.399> can<00:02:01.700> wear<00:02:01.880> these<00:02:02.030> because<00:02:02.570> the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
my friends can wear these because the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.420 
my friends can wear these because the
finger<00:02:03.410> holes<00:02:03.590> are<00:02:03.740> really<00:02:03.950> small<00:02:04.190> and

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
finger holes are really small and

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.790 
finger holes are really small and
because<00:02:05.330> it's<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:05.690> thick<00:02:06.050> it's<00:02:06.259> actually<00:02:06.590> kind

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
because it's so thick it's actually kind

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.960 
because it's so thick it's actually kind
of<00:02:06.950> hard<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.670> hold<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:10.310> before<00:02:10.490> putting<00:02:10.819> the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
of hard to hold it so before putting the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.900 
of hard to hold it so before putting the
claws<00:02:11.300> in<00:02:11.600> i<00:02:11.870> decided<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.590> i<00:02:13.040> would<00:02:13.430> trim<00:02:13.790> it

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
claws in i decided that i would trim it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.930 
claws in i decided that i would trim it
down<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:15.020> it's<00:02:15.140> thinner<00:02:15.470> i<00:02:15.770> also<00:02:16.340> why<00:02:16.670> didn't

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
down so it's thinner i also why didn't

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.750

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
comfortable for me to have it slightly

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.130 
comfortable for me to have it slightly
looser<00:02:22.160> because<00:02:23.000> now<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.300> can<00:02:23.480> conform<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.110> my

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
looser because now it can conform to my

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.370 
looser because now it can conform to my
hand<00:02:24.440> better<00:02:24.650> but<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:26.390> doesn't<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:27.170> still

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.440 
hand better but it doesn't it's still
not<00:02:27.560> large<00:02:27.800> enough<00:02:27.890> for<00:02:28.069> my<00:02:28.310> friends<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.150> i

don't<00:02:29.900> really<00:02:29.990> think<00:02:30.110> that's<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.380> problem

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590
