00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.121
 The following trailer has been approved for the selected audience. 

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.875
 The existence of UFOs has been known for thousands of years ... 

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.374
 and hiding for a hundred years 

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.263
 The problem is not to prove that UFOs exist. 

00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:26.276
 It consists in starting to reveal energy and propulsion systems 

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:28.331
 that allow them to reach us. 

00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:33.475
 Scientists must look at clear evidence 

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.911
 decide - oh my god, aliens are real 

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.258
 and accept it. 

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:45.953
 Such scientists have been here for hundreds of years, but they have been mercilessly silenced 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.920
 for power to centralized petrochemical, oil, gas and coal systems. 

00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:57.330
 And now these misanthropic sociopaths are bringing the planet to the final boundary. 

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:13.342
 Governments have not moved anywhere, so as people we have decided to make our own movement. 

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:15.667
 A document with historically highest funding by ordinary people. 

00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:22.562
 We are trying to develop a device that will conquer the perpendicular power of gravity. 

00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:27.506
 We have so many variations to get vacuum energy or zero point energy ... 

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:30.904
 This alien was found in the Atacama Desert. 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.969
 We have the best scientists to do DNA testing. 

00:01:35.323 --> 00:01:40.035
 We have 1,150 CE-5 Ambassador Teams. 

00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:43.073
 I can verify that there is a real phenomenon here. 

00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:48.902
 It is probably the most important thing that is happening today on this planet, 

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:50.585
 and yet no one talks about it. 

00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:10.585
 If we get together, this can be done in months, not decades. 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.996
 Available online and in cinemas April 22, 2013 

00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:15.339
 ... for this is the fate of mankind.
