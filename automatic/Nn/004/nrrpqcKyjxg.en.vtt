00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:06.095
Technique to revive the dead.

00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:12.246
Scientists at the University of Arizona,
Tucson (USA) have developed a procedure

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:15.896
radical to recover patients to edge
of death.

00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:18.835
What does this new technique?

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:24.666
Basically the technique involves replacing
all his blood, cold salt water.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:30.766
If one is 10 degrees Celsius, without
brain activity, no cardiac activity,

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:36.306
bloodless anyone would agree
that he is dead. However, still

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:41.846
we can bring back. Peter explained
Rhee, who along with Samuel Tisherman, the

00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:47.926
University of Maryland, Colesh Park, has shown
it is possible to keep the bodies in "animation

00:00:47.926 --> 00:00:53.646
suspended "for hours. The procedure
It has already been tested in animals was drained

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:59.795
the blood of his body and then the cooled
20 degrees Celsius below the temperature.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:04.426
Once the damage is repaired, blood
It is pumped back through the veins,

00:01:04.426 --> 00:01:09.716
and thus the body warms up slowly
to its normal temperature and

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:12.466
heart is beating again again.

00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:18.445
The animals used in experiments
shown few ill effects upon awakening,

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:23.576
beyond a daze that
in any case it does not last more than a day.

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:27.866
When it was announced that would take place
human experimentation (victims

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:33.676
shooting firearms and other accidents
fatal), the discussion started on

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:39.106
this issue, because for some, this technique
It involves passing the patient's death

00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:45.346
to heal him. Tisherman notes that it is important
let the public know that it is not science fiction,

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:49.886
but the technical proposal is based on
experimental work and is being studied

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:55.576
in a disciplined manner, with the aim of
save the lives of people. This is a bold

00:01:55.576 --> 00:02:01.125
way to get more time to resolve
urgent problems and could change history

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:07.445
medicine against accidents
mortals. Is it possible ?. Well, we'll see.
