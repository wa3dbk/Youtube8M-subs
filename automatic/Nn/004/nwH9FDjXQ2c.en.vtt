again a tire blew out caused damage
around<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.859> wheel<00:00:59.070> well<00:00:59.539> and<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.780> has<00:01:00.989> been

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
around that wheel well and it has been

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.070 
around that wheel well and it has been
repaired<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.300> repaired<00:01:03.300> properly<00:01:03.539> actually

stop<00:01:33.390> making<00:01:33.810> those<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.470> about

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
stop making those I think about

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.530 
stop making those I think about
somewhere<00:01:36.270> arranged<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.860> 2006<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.159> our<00:01:38.640> 2008

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
somewhere arranged at 2006 so our 2008

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.690 
somewhere arranged at 2006 so our 2008
somewhere<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.079> range<00:01:40.290> 2004<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> 2006

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
somewhere in that range 2004 to 2006

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.219 
somewhere in that range 2004 to 2006
that's<00:01:41.880> why<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.270> went<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.570> all<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> sprinter

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that's why they went to all the sprinter

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.069 
that's why they went to all the sprinter
chassis<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.640> why<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.540> today

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
chassis so that's why you see that today

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.109 
chassis so that's why you see that today
great<00:01:46.770> camera<00:01:47.040> tree<00:01:47.399> there's<00:01:47.610> no<00:01:47.759> smells

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
inside of here no odors just a clean

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.870 
inside of here no odors just a clean
unit<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:52.290> definitely<00:01:53.070> shows<00:01:53.340> very<00:01:53.790> well

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
unit you definitely shows very well

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.429 
unit you definitely shows very well
you'll<00:01:54.420> notice<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.840> when<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
you'll notice that when you get on the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.709 
you'll notice that when you get on the
inside<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> inside<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.430> much<00:01:56.909> nicer<00:01:57.210> than<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
inside the inside is much nicer than the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.170 
inside the inside is much nicer than the
outside<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:59.009> outside<00:01:59.340> does<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.759> some<00:01:59.969> Sun

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
outside the outside does have some Sun

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.690 
outside the outside does have some Sun
fading<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:01.049> again<00:02:01.649> overall<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.460> very

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
fading but again overall it's a very

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.310 
fading but again overall it's a very
nice<00:02:02.909> unit<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.479> don't<00:02:03.659> want<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.049> don't

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
nice unit so I don't want to I don't

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.370 
nice unit so I don't want to I don't
want<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:06.210> know<00:02:06.299> cause<00:02:06.570> any<00:02:06.810> alarm<00:02:07.200> or
