00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
 they say that curiosity although it has the 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.700
 power to kill somehow a 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.460
 cat apparently humans are 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.220
 immune we know how to unleash the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.380
 greatest mysteries that we know some 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.340
 of these are very interesting and in 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.110
 change others really puzzling 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.079
 so much that it will make you dig deeper into the subject 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.390
 I assure 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.789
 very well then I invite you to you 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.800
 you see four great mysteries 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.800
 of humanity first part 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.990
 one of the many related mysteries 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.610
 with the murder of john f kennedy was 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.760
 undoubtedly the one that has to do with the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.220
 diva looks for this woman known 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.500
 subsequently with this name due to 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.810
 his old-fashioned clothes and handkerchief 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 that he had tied to his head 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.080
 I found in the scene when 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.260
 facts were carried out on the day that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.310
 the president was killed she was 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.350
 filming the passage of the caravan 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.890
 presidential with a good camera 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.229
 cinema surely 8 millimeters this 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.940
 film that he recorded could undoubtedly be the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.740
 most valuable document for 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.200
 investigation of the murder of john 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.330
 f.kennedy since it was filmed from the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.610
 better viewing angle to register 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.979
 everything that happened on the mound of 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.550
 grass the place from where the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.550
 shots 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.690
 when the shots were heard his 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.630
 way of reacting it was strange because 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.850
 everyone crouched less than her 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.020
 this was the last time you could see 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.450
 this mysterious woman 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.750
 the diva seeks has never been able to be 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.640
 identified or interrogated and nothing has been 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.189
 known about the valuable movie he filmed 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.100
 the best testimonial document of 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.659
 jfk's murder is still a 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.659
 mystery whereabouts unknown 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.630
 the sea and celestial sailed on November 7 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.410
 of 1872 from new york under the command 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.780
 from the experienced capital benjamin brics 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.270
 the crew consisted of eight 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.880
 men the captain's wife and her daughter 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.530
 the ship carries a cargo of 700 thousand 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.990
 barrels of American alcohol that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.930
 they waited in genoa but they never arrived 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.380
 to receive the shipment on 5 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.320
 December 1832 the sea and celestial was 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.670
 found by the bric oletta of and 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.130
 sailing adrift and unmanned 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.650
 on board the sailboat sailed on course 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.600
 fixed and was in perfect condition 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.190
 conservation 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.400
 they dropped a boat and after a few seconds 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.140
 they managed to board the ship the first 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.510
 inspection confirmed that the vessel was 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.880
 desert there was no trace of the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.410
 crew had disappeared by 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.720
 full 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.000
 the lifeboats were complete 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.520
 the interior of the boat was 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.580
 empty and loading together with all 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.970
 the provisions were intact the first 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.300
 officer found jewelry money a valuable 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.390
 gold medallion furniture books letters 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.430
 personal and clothing all 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.980
 It was in order and it seemed that the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.410
 crew was still there but not 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.390
 there was nobody what surprised the most 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.820
 captain of the other ship was find in the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.430
 kitchen over a hot stove 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.980
 a saucepan with a freshly cooked chicken 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.640
 and some tea bowls still warm on the 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.280
 central table 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.560
 all data will be confusing everything is 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.080
 ordered the small objects reposed 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.200
 on its tables and shelves if it had been 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.730
 a storm or collision would have fallen 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.740
 the logbook found 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.080
 in the camera between the captain and the 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.660
 last entry of November 24, no 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.950
 they reflected nothing extraordinary nothing that 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.780
 could explain the mysterious 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.780
 disappearance of the crew 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.020
 the marfa lights or ghost lights are 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.600
 some supposed balls of light that appear 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.480
 they change color and dance in the 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.580
 air to these lights they are called from that 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.220
 way through the town where they appeared 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.700
 East of March in the state of Texas 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.130
 in the usa there is only evidence 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.420
 testimonial about it and many believe 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.820
 which are due to the lights of the 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.370
 automobiles reflected in the clouds to 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.290
 reflectors of light and obviously also 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.050
 there are some who consider that they are ships 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.750
 extraterrestrial space 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.780
 Robert Reed Ellison was the first 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.509
 report about these lights in 1883 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.060
 At first he thought they could 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.550
 be fires of the Apache Indians but 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.490
 later the researchers needed 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.349
 that during the day they were not achieved 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.000
 find remains of ashes or other 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.750
 evidence elements that were 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.520
 fires that caused those lights 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.470
 the skeptics have made the claim 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.539
 that the ghost lights are no more 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.430
 that the distant lights of cars that 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.430
 They pass by a road in the distance 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.349
 horizon however they do not offer any 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.270
 explanation of the sightings and 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.310
 stories transmitted by the Apaches 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.039
 who argue that the lights are the 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.870
 spirit of one of his chiefs either 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.030
 they take into account the observations made 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.919
 for the cowboys and the soldiers a lot 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.039
 before the road was 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.650
 built today those lights continue 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:40.090
 being an enigma for science amen of 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.090
 an important tourist enclave 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.260
 on June 30, 1908 about 7 in the 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.510
 tomorrow the inhabitants of a part of the 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.180
 immense region of Siberia north of 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.250
 russia felt a huge explosion that 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.330
 it shook the ground and produced a light 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.830
 blinding the magnitude of it 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.470
 up to about 1000 kilometers of 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.360
 distance and 60 kilometers from the site 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.340
 the people were thrown 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.130
 violently to the ground due to a 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.870
 strong expansive wave this was followed 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.420
 of a production of a smoke column 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.000
 several meters high 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.430
 the explosion that would later be 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.830
 located in a desolate area near 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.990
 of the tunguska river had a power 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.900
 estimated a thousand times greater than the bomb 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.540
 atomic of hiroshima supposedly at 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.160
 being a meteorite the scientists 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.320
 They expected to meet a huge 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.880
 crater on site and numerous 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.790
 fragments of rocks scattered in the 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.310
 forest however his surprise was 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.660
 capitalized to not find neither one nor 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.460
 the other 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.830
 this caused an intense debate 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.170
 scientific and many theories 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.660
 they started to think about reaching 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:55.020
 there are about 30 of them with greater or 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.970
 lower credibility the most accurate up 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.310
 the moment is that it was a 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.920
 meteorite or a comet that entered the 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.450
 terrestrial atmosphere and exploded a couple of 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.120
 kilometers above the ground 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.970
 Siberian at this time it was believed that 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.800
 the same would be composed of ice what 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.770
 which would explain the absence of remains 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.020
 rocky in the whole area this explanation 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.220
 does not yet satisfy the entire community 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.290
 scientific 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:23.200
 that the agent has never been discovered 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.760
 cause of such a huge explosion has 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.530
 motivated numerous theories of the 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.430
 conspiracy without any foundation 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:32.290
 scientific some pretty crazy 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.880
 among them is the possible fall and 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.860
 explosion of a spaceship 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.170
 a violent gas leak from the interior 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.540
 of the earth and has even speculated 

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:43.270
 that could be caused by tests 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:46.290
 attributed to nikola tesla and 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.290
 his ray of death
