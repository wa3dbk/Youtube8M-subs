on most of the living wall installations

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.749 
on most of the living wall installations
we<00:01:06.450> suggest<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.990> layer<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.350> waterproofing<00:01:07.920> this

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
we suggest a layer of waterproofing this

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.609 
we suggest a layer of waterproofing this
can<00:01:09.000> also<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.420> purchased<00:01:09.630> at<00:01:09.899> Home<00:01:10.079> Depot<00:01:10.439> and
