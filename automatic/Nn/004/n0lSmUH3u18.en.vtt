00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
triangle that'll comes in on itself I'll

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.229 
triangle that'll comes in on itself I'll
show<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.350> what<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.560> mean<00:03:03.880> start<00:03:04.880> making<00:03:05.150> the

open triangle straight that way you come
down<00:03:08.360> there<00:03:08.780> then<00:03:09.680> instead<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.280> completely

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
down there then instead of completely
