if it actually makes that much of a

if it actually makes that much of a
difference<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> quad<00:00:38.640> core<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.629> the

difference to have a quad core or if the

actually makes any difference or
introduces<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> speed<00:00:45.180> improvement<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.890> what

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
introduces a speed improvement so what

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.200 
introduces a speed improvement so what
we're<00:00:47.370> seeing<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:50.640> quad<00:00:50.940> core

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
we're seeing here is that the quad core

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.900 
we're seeing here is that the quad core
is<00:00:51.420> getting<00:00:51.719> about<00:00:52.160> 75<00:00:53.160> frames<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.670> certain

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
is getting about 75 frames in certain

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.209 
is getting about 75 frames in certain
cases<00:00:54.090> whereas<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.899> dual<00:00:55.649> core<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.070> only

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
cases whereas the dual core is only

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.319 
cases whereas the dual core is only
hitting<00:00:56.670> about<00:00:57.030> less<00:00:57.690> than<00:00:57.899> 60<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.219> in<00:01:00.030> most

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
hitting about less than 60 so in most

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.689 
hitting about less than 60 so in most
cases<00:01:00.539> we're<00:01:01.440> seeing<00:01:01.770> about<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.100> 20%

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
cases we're seeing about a 20%

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.329 
cases we're seeing about a 20%
difference<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:04.110> favor<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> quad<00:01:04.979> core

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
difference in favor of the quad core

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.929 
difference in favor of the quad core
despite<00:01:06.150> being<00:01:06.180> lower<00:01:06.659> megahertz<00:01:07.610> now<00:01:08.610> this

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
despite being lower megahertz now this

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.270 
despite being lower megahertz now this
is<00:01:09.119> quite<00:01:09.630> ironic<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:11.119> Starcraft<00:01:12.119> 2<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
is quite ironic because Starcraft 2 is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.880 
is quite ironic because Starcraft 2 is
again<00:01:14.280> only<00:01:14.659> supposed<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.810> use<00:01:15.900> two<00:01:16.380> threats

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
again only supposed to use two threats

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.880 
again only supposed to use two threats
but<00:01:17.700> apparently<00:01:18.540> all<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.320> background

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
but apparently all the background

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.929 
but apparently all the background
processes<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:21.150> make<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> difference<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.939> so

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
processes can make a difference and so

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.410 
processes can make a difference and so
for<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.049> four<00:01:25.470> versus<00:01:25.860> four<00:01:26.420> during

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
for this is a four versus four during

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.410 
for this is a four versus four during
the<00:01:27.659> endgame<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.439> very<00:01:28.799> large<00:01:29.009> map<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.790> we've

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the endgame on a very large map so we've

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.620 
the endgame on a very large map so we've
practically<00:01:31.290> stressed<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> CPU<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.790> much<00:01:33.479> as

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
practically stressed the CPU as much as

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.600 
practically stressed the CPU as much as

the two now the advantage you get with
the<00:01:52.290> dual<00:01:52.470> core<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.399> burns<00:01:53.640> 35<00:01:54.210> watts

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the dual core is that it burns 35 watts

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.100 
the dual core is that it burns 35 watts
as<00:01:54.840> opposed<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.530> 45<00:01:56.040> watts<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.840> for<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> machine

of<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.259> caliber<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.189> doubt<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.090> battery<00:02:00.630> life

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
of this caliber I doubt the battery life

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.709 
of this caliber I doubt the battery life
is<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.500> key<00:02:02.100> concern<00:02:04.969> so<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.600> if

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
is a key concern so there you have it if

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.040 
is a key concern so there you have it if
you<00:02:06.780> had<00:02:06.869> any<00:02:07.079> doubts<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.619> far<00:02:08.489> as<00:02:08.759> gaming<00:02:09.690> goes

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
you had any doubts as far as gaming goes

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.840 
you had any doubts as far as gaming goes
whether<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.979> dual<00:02:11.190> core

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
not right the quad-core is in fact

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.230 
not right the quad-core is in fact
better<00:02:21.480> now<00:02:22.110> why<00:02:22.680> would<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.890> compare<00:02:23.400> these<00:02:24.000> two

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
better now why would I compare these two

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.020 
better now why would I compare these two

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
the key thing about these color

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.540 
the key thing about these color
saturation<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.400> RGB<00:03:59.880> LED<00:04:00.450> is<00:04:00.720> just

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
saturation of the RGB LED is just

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
saturation of the RGB LED is just
supremely<00:04:02.550> intense<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:04.560> fact<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.190> puts<00:04:05.570> even

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
supremely intense in fact it puts even

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.410 
supremely intense in fact it puts even
modern<00:04:07.200> LCD<00:04:07.830> backlit<00:04:08.520> with<00:04:08.940> LEDs<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.720> shame<00:04:09.960> so

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
modern LCD backlit with LEDs to shame so

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.810 
modern LCD backlit with LEDs to shame so
as<00:04:12.420> far<00:04:12.720> as<00:04:12.900> I'm<00:04:13.050> concerned<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.610> one<00:04:14.760> of

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
as far as I'm concerned this is one of

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.729 
as far as I'm concerned this is one of
the<00:04:14.940> few<00:04:15.210> laptops<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:16.170> you<00:04:16.290> can<00:04:16.440> actually

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
the few laptops that you can actually

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.090 
the few laptops that you can actually
get<00:04:16.890> in<00:04:17.040> RGB<00:04:17.520> LED<00:04:18.000> with<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.960> at<00:04:19.590> first<00:04:19.799> the

get in RGB LED with and at first the

get in RGB LED with and at first the
color<00:04:20.669> saturation<00:04:21.150> might<00:04:21.600> even<00:04:21.810> be<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.260> little

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
color saturation might even be a little

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.420 
color saturation might even be a little
bit<00:04:22.680> annoying<00:04:22.919> but<00:04:23.220> once<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.700> get<00:04:23.940> used

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
bit annoying but once you get used

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.409 
bit annoying but once you get used
to<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.669> you<00:04:25.449> will<00:04:25.630> learn<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.350> love<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:26.880> it's<00:04:27.880> one

to it you will learn to love it it's one

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.779 
to it you will learn to love it it's one
