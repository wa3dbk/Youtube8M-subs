one of their games at Sun like this year
the<00:01:07.049> game<00:01:07.260> wasn't<00:01:07.500> decided<00:01:07.920> until<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.580> last

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
few minutes one even went to overtime I

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.580

five<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.500> two<00:01:16.619> at<00:01:16.770> home<00:01:16.979> against<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.909> spread

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
five and two at home against a spread

close<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:21.150> Miami<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.409> i<00:01:22.470> think<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
close one in Miami but i think the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
close one in Miami but i think the
dolphins<00:01:23.130> win<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> fourth<00:01:23.880> quarter<00:01:24.180> by<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
dolphins win in the fourth quarter by a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.170 
dolphins win in the fourth quarter by a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
touchdown to close this one out and also

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420
