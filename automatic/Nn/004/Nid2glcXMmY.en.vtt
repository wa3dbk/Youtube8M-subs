one part that just photograph it is the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.920 
one part that just photograph it is the
shutter<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.680> front<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.309> back

has the full hundred in there i am in
the<00:00:44.940> Shannon<00:00:46.399> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.610> see<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> full

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the Shannon you can see here the full

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.500 
the Shannon you can see here the full
range<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:50.149> degrees<00:00:51.149> listed<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> shutter

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
range of degrees listed on the shutter

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.900 
range of degrees listed on the shutter
this<00:00:54.510> particular<00:00:54.809> piece<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.579> restorable<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
this particular piece is restorable I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.450 
this particular piece is restorable I
believe<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.600> still<00:00:58.550> works<00:00:59.550> but<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.480> well

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
believe it still works but not that well

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.280 
believe it still works but not that well
that's<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.609> little<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.960> when<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.170> turn<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:05.180> here

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
that's a little so when I turn this here

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.109 
that's a little so when I turn this here
it's<00:01:07.290> stuck<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> lubricants<00:01:09.030> are

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it's stuck I think the lubricants are

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.020 
it's stuck I think the lubricants are
very<00:01:09.360> dried<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.700> see

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
very dried up in here and you can see

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
very dried up in here and you can see
everything<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.080> still<00:01:13.229> greased<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.130> got

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
everything is still greased up it's got

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
everything is still greased up it's got
the<00:01:14.700> grease<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.509> dry<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.110> there's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
the grease it's just dry and there's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
the grease it's just dry and there's
there's<00:01:17.040> dust<00:01:17.250> inside<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.030> going<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
there's dust inside so it's going to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.200 
there's dust inside so it's going to
need<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.360> be<00:01:18.570> reclaimed<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.229> removed<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.210> you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
need to be reclaimed and removed and you

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
need to be reclaimed and removed and you
know<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.930> turn<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.560> turn

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
know if I if I turn this a little turn

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.590 
know if I if I turn this a little turn
but<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.310> takes<00:01:23.549> some<00:01:23.670> effort<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.420> I've

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
but it takes some effort you know I've

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.530 
but it takes some effort you know I've
got<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> turn<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> shutter<00:01:25.500> itself<00:01:25.979> as

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
got to turn the shutter itself as

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:35.719 
got to turn the shutter itself as
opposed<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:28.880> turning<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.520> you

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
opposed to turning the you know but you

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.249 
opposed to turning the you know but you
can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.060> there's<00:01:36.240> no<00:01:36.360> real<00:01:36.570> damage<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
can see there's no real damage to the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.310 
can see there's no real damage to the
gears<00:01:37.530> they're<00:01:38.009> all<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.450> very<00:01:39.450> good<00:01:39.750> condition

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
these are very nice very well-made gears

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.889 
these are very nice very well-made gears
from<00:01:48.570> Eclair<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.759> quite<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.899> engineering

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
from Eclair and quite a engineering

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.590 
from Eclair and quite a engineering
mechanism<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.270> very<00:01:54.479> good

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
mechanism and it's in very good

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510 
mechanism and it's in very good
condition<00:01:54.750> i<00:01:55.320> don't<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:56.159> see<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
condition i don't know you can see this

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.330 
condition i don't know you can see this
little<00:01:56.759> bit<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.030> fainting<00:01:57.509> here<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
little bit of fainting here in the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.660 
little bit of fainting here in the
shutter<00:01:59.340> i<00:01:59.610> don't<00:01:59.790> know<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:01.670> defect

shutter i don't know if that is a defect
or<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.119> i'm<00:02:04.049> sure<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.409> could<00:02:04.560> bend<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.009> back

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
or not i'm sure you could bend it back

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.980 
or not i'm sure you could bend it back
if

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
it's not supposed to be that way but yes

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.370 
it's not supposed to be that way but yes
this<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.709> one<00:02:09.890> for<00:02:10.130> restoration<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:11.380> no

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
this is one for restoration and no

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
you can see advances very wrong whole

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.430 
you can see advances very wrong whole
mechanism<00:02:44.269> is<00:02:44.780> very<00:02:44.989> smooth<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:48.140> needs<00:02:48.319> to

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
mechanism is very smooth just needs to

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.229 
mechanism is very smooth just needs to
be<00:02:48.530> removed<00:02:48.920> and<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.370> could<00:02:49.519> be<00:02:49.670> part<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.060> a

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
be removed and it could be part of a

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.770 
be removed and it could be part of a
working<00:02:51.230> camera<00:02:51.440> shooting<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.890> film<00:02:52.069> today

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
working camera shooting the film today

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.259 
working camera shooting the film today
so<00:02:53.780> that's<00:02:54.019> part<00:02:54.500> one<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.310> then<00:02:55.430> part<00:02:55.730> two<00:02:55.790> is

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
so that's part one and then part two is

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.750 
so that's part one and then part two is
this<00:02:57.519> full<00:02:58.519> body<00:02:58.790> here<00:02:59.319> which<00:03:00.340> contains<00:03:01.340> also

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
this full body here which contains also

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.750 
this full body here which contains also
the<00:03:02.030> shutter<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:03.130> lens<00:03:04.130> ports<00:03:04.640> and<00:03:06.459> this<00:03:07.459> one

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
the shutter and lens ports and this one

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.670 
the shutter and lens ports and this one
is<00:03:08.120> in<00:03:08.390> much<00:03:08.569> better<00:03:08.630> condition<00:03:08.989> than<00:03:09.470> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
is in much better condition than the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.500 
is in much better condition than the
other<00:03:09.860> one<00:03:10.100> in<00:03:10.370> fact<00:03:10.609> I'm<00:03:10.820> pretty<00:03:10.850> sure<00:03:11.329> it's

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
other one in fact I'm pretty sure it's

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.620 
other one in fact I'm pretty sure it's
in<00:03:11.720> working<00:03:12.410> condition<00:03:13.030> see<00:03:14.030> it's<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.239> standard

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
in working condition see it's a standard

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.900 
in working condition see it's a standard
reflex<00:03:17.650> maybe<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.680> little<00:03:18.739> model<00:03:19.310> number<00:03:19.609> over

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
reflex maybe a little model number over

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.340 
reflex maybe a little model number over
there<00:03:20.120> and<00:03:20.269> if<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.510> can<00:03:20.660> read<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.170> says

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
there and if you can read that it says

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.880 
there and if you can read that it says

GE 468 says on top too and this one I

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.580 
GE 468 says on top too and this one I
think<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.459> in<00:03:28.640> fully<00:03:28.880> working<00:03:29.209> condition<00:03:29.840> when

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
think is in fully working condition when

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.130 
think is in fully working condition when
I<00:03:30.620> turn<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.269> little<00:03:32.269> gear<00:03:32.600> here<00:03:32.930> for

I turn this little gear here for

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.490 
I turn this little gear here for
advancing<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.829> film<00:03:34.100> plate<00:03:34.400> it<00:03:35.380> see<00:03:36.380> it's

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
advancing the film plate it see it's

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.819 
advancing the film plate it see it's
turns<00:03:37.310> effortlessly<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.989> this<00:03:39.200> one<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.560> fully

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
turns effortlessly so this one is fully

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.520 
turns effortlessly so this one is fully
working<00:03:41.620> you<00:03:42.620> can<00:03:42.829> see<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:44.260> there's<00:03:45.260> the

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
working you can see the there's the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.160 
working you can see the there's the
shutter<00:03:46.420> working<00:03:47.420> in<00:03:47.510> there<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.959> will

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
shutter working in there and will

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.240 
shutter working in there and will
pressure<00:03:48.769> pins<00:03:49.190> are<00:03:49.430> there<00:03:50.500> gears<00:03:51.500> advancing

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
pressure pins are there gears advancing

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.059 
pressure pins are there gears advancing
effortlessly<00:03:52.850> in<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.500> think<00:03:54.500> this<00:03:54.590> could<00:03:54.799> go<00:03:54.920> on

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
effortlessly in I think this could go on

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.650 
effortlessly in I think this could go on
a<00:03:55.100> camera<00:03:55.489> right<00:03:55.639> now<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:56.030> start<00:03:56.329> shooting

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
a camera right now and start shooting

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.259 
a camera right now and start shooting
with<00:03:56.840> them<00:03:57.019> today<00:03:57.170> so<00:03:57.819> this<00:03:58.819> is<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:58.970> fully

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
with them today so this is a fully

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.259 
with them today so this is a fully
working<00:03:59.480> part<00:04:00.130> no<00:04:01.130> damage<00:04:01.579> that<00:04:01.760> i<00:04:01.790> can<00:04:02.030> see

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
working part no damage that i can see

ports<00:05:45.400> go<00:05:45.669> I<00:05:47.280> don't<00:05:48.280> know<00:05:48.430> if<00:05:48.580> there's<00:05:48.820> a

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
ports go I don't know if there's a

ports go I don't know if there's a
difference<00:05:49.300> in<00:05:49.510> the<00:05:49.599> lens<00:05:49.780> ports<00:05:50.199> these<00:05:50.550> you

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
difference in the lens ports these you

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.409 
difference in the lens ports these you
can<00:05:51.699> see<00:05:52.000> these<00:05:52.180> lens<00:05:52.479> ports<00:05:52.930> here<00:05:53.229> they<00:05:53.500> are

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
can see these lens ports here they are

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.089 
can see these lens ports here they are
not<00:05:55.419> threaded<00:05:55.840> these<00:05:56.590> are<00:05:56.710> probably

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
not threaded these are probably

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.129 
not threaded these are probably
camouflage<00:05:57.729> ports<00:05:58.180> I<00:05:58.330> would<00:05:58.510> imagine

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
camouflage ports I would imagine

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.360 
camouflage ports I would imagine
camouflage<00:06:02.139> standard<00:06:02.590> ports<00:06:02.919> and<00:06:03.130> then<00:06:03.220> this

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
camouflage standard ports and then this

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.140 
camouflage standard ports and then this
one<00:06:03.639> is<00:06:04.199> looks<00:06:05.199> like<00:06:05.380> the<00:06:05.530> same<00:06:05.740> kind<00:06:06.610> of<00:06:06.789> port

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
one is looks like the same kind of port

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.050 
one is looks like the same kind of port
probably<00:06:07.630> Calif<00:06:07.960> Lex<00:06:08.199> standard<00:06:08.680> as<00:06:08.800> well
