the next generation in motorcycle
hearing<00:00:12.000> protection<00:00:12.360> what<00:00:13.200> makes<00:00:13.410> this

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
hearing protection what makes this

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.650 
hearing protection what makes this
really<00:00:13.769> cool<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.639> different<00:00:15.210> from<00:00:15.450> most

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
really cool and different from most

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.800 
really cool and different from most
other<00:00:15.870> traditional<00:00:16.680> foam<00:00:16.980> earplugs<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.850> that

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
other traditional foam earplugs is that

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.279 
other traditional foam earplugs is that
unlike<00:00:19.650> blocking<00:00:20.250> all<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.850> sound<00:00:21.289> these

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
unlike blocking all of the sound these

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.790 
unlike blocking all of the sound these
are<00:00:22.470> specifically<00:00:23.070> designed<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.880> only<00:00:24.390> reduce

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
are specifically designed to only reduce

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.160 
are specifically designed to only reduce
harmful<00:00:25.800> frequencies<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.449> means<00:00:27.689> wind

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
harmful frequencies so this means wind

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.939 
harmful frequencies so this means wind
noise<00:00:28.380> exhaust<00:00:29.220> noise<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:31.019> reason<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.830> that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
noise exhaust noise the reason for that

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.600 
noise exhaust noise the reason for that
is<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.850> little<00:00:33.180> filter<00:00:33.950> inside<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.130> each<00:00:35.340> no

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
is this little filter inside of each no

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.860 
is this little filter inside of each no
noise<00:00:35.880> ear<00:00:36.090> plug<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:37.170> tiny<00:00:37.530> ceramic<00:00:37.860> filter

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
noise ear plug is a tiny ceramic filter

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.780 
noise ear plug is a tiny ceramic filter
inside<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.140> filter<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:41.040> specially

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
inside that filter is a specially

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.330 
inside that filter is a specially
designed<00:00:41.969> channel<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.620> specifically

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
designed channel that specifically

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.420 
designed channel that specifically
reduces<00:00:45.000> wind<00:00:45.600> noise<00:00:45.840> frequencies<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.190> rather

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
reduces wind noise frequencies so rather

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.779 
reduces wind noise frequencies so rather
than<00:00:47.700> blocking<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.420> sound<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.579> still

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
than blocking all sound you can still

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.549 
than blocking all sound you can still
hear<00:00:50.969> what's<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.420> around<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.840> things
