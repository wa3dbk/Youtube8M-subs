00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the lace on the front already but I

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.530 
the lace on the front already but I
forgot<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.210> has<00:02:18.360> lace<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.530> back<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.510> I

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
forgot it has lace in the back and so I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.090 
forgot it has lace in the back and so I
just<00:02:21.780> noticed<00:02:22.140> before<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.500> hit<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.800> record

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
just noticed before I hit the record

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.650 
just noticed before I hit the record
button<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> camera<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.540> hey<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:25.370> did<00:02:26.370> not

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.670 
cut the lace oh I'm sorry this is
actually<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.340> glueless<00:02:29.820> cap<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.380> normally<00:02:31.380> get

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
actually a glueless cap I normally get

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.180 
actually a glueless cap I normally get
the<00:02:31.830> full<00:02:32.010> lace<00:02:32.280> but<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.610> decided<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.390> try<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
the full lace but I decided to try the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.160 
the full lace but I decided to try the
glueless<00:02:35.190> cap<00:02:35.460> again<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:39.840> one<00:02:40.050> looks

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
glueless cap again and this one looks

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
glueless cap again and this one looks
much<00:02:40.440> better<00:02:40.650> than<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> first<00:02:41.220> glueless

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
much better than the first glueless

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.270 
much better than the first glueless
kappa<00:02:42.060> hat<00:02:42.420> because<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.500> first<00:02:43.770> one<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:43.980> had

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
kappa hat because the first one I had

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.370 
kappa hat because the first one I had
had<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:45.060> shiny<00:02:45.330> spot<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.140> center

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
had like that shiny spot in the center

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.470 
had like that shiny spot in the center

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
knots are small in the front and I may

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.560 
knots are small in the front and I may
have<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.250> cut<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.670> lace<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:41.970> little<00:03:42.330> bit<00:03:42.420> more

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
have to cut this lace a little bit more

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.410 
have to cut this lace a little bit more
i<00:03:42.630> lost<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.739> i<00:03:44.750> love<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:47.300> scissors<00:03:48.300> are

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
i lost the i love the scissors are

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.840 
i lost the i love the scissors are
normally<00:03:48.900> used<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.440> cut<00:03:49.650> my<00:03:49.800> lace<00:03:50.100> they're

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
normally used to cut my lace they're

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.580 
normally used to cut my lace they're
here<00:03:51.300> in<00:03:51.510> house<00:03:51.750> somewhere<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.500> they

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
here in house somewhere and they

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.040 
here in house somewhere and they
probably<00:03:52.769> got<00:03:53.070> thrown<00:03:53.370> away<00:03:53.519> by<00:03:53.640> mistake<00:03:54.269> but

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
probably got thrown away by mistake but

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.810 
probably got thrown away by mistake but
so<00:03:55.680> i<00:03:55.709> had<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:55.980> use<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.160> different<00:03:56.280> pair<00:03:56.730> of

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
so i had to use a different pair of

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.380 
so i had to use a different pair of
scissors<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.480> i<00:03:57.540> didn't<00:03:57.870> cut<00:03:58.140> these<00:03:58.410> as<00:03:59.390> cut

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
scissors and i didn't cut these as cut

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.210 
scissors and i didn't cut these as cut
the<00:04:00.540> lace<00:04:00.690> as<00:04:00.900> short<00:04:01.200> as<00:04:01.410> i<00:04:01.560> normally<00:04:01.620> do<00:04:02.100> so

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
the lace as short as i normally do so

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.289 
the lace as short as i normally do so
i'm<00:04:02.280> probably<00:04:02.489> gonna<00:04:02.700> have<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.850> go<00:04:03.000> back<00:04:03.120> over

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
i'm probably gonna have to go back over

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.410 
i'm probably gonna have to go back over
but<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.140> see<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.440> knots<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:04.890> that's<00:04:05.040> a
