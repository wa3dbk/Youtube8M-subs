notice that as I transfer I'm allowing

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.569 
notice that as I transfer I'm allowing
the<00:03:47.609> twist<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.359> stitch<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.989> untwist<00:03:49.650> that

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
the twist in the stitch to untwist that

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.670 
the twist in the stitch to untwist that
creates<00:03:50.939> a<00:03:51.209> little<00:03:51.450> bit<00:03:51.569> of<00:03:51.750> extra<00:03:52.319> room<00:03:52.470> that

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
creates a little bit of extra room that

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.520 
creates a little bit of extra room that
it<00:03:53.099> makes<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.519> easier<00:03:53.909> to<00:03:54.269> get<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.079> stitches

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
it makes it easier to get the stitches

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.699 
it makes it easier to get the stitches
