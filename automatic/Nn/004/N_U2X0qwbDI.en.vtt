so I think by sharing things like movies

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.389 
so I think by sharing things like movies
and<00:00:35.100> books<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:37.020> know<00:00:37.110> TV<00:00:37.500> shows<00:00:37.770> even<00:00:38.070> or

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
and books and you know TV shows even or

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.369 
and books and you know TV shows even or
songs<00:00:38.700> or<00:00:39.059> whatever<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.450> may<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.660> something

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
songs or whatever it may be something

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.869 
songs or whatever it may be something
that's<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> little<00:00:40.860> bit<00:00:41.010> more<00:00:41.160> personal<00:00:41.700> than

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that's a little bit more personal than

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.330 
that's a little bit more personal than
just<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:43.140> sweater<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.280> the

moment or what lipstick I'm wearing I

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.229

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.200 
and start talking about the book in the
movie<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.900> I'll<00:01:13.799> start<00:01:14.159> off<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.880> movie

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
because I actually sold the movie first

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.580 
because I actually sold the movie first

her from the senior life of American

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.129

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
teenager so that's the movie definitely

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.319 
teenager so that's the movie definitely
go<00:04:06.560> ahead<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:07.160> find<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.549> watch<00:04:07.819> it<00:04:07.850> come<00:04:08.239> back

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
go ahead and find it watch it come back

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.000 
go ahead and find it watch it come back
to<00:04:08.389> this<00:04:08.600> video<00:04:08.840> let<00:04:09.049> me<00:04:09.079> know<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.709> book<00:04:09.859> was

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
to this video let me know the book was

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.319 
to this video let me know the book was
written<00:04:10.100> first<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.790> then<00:04:10.940> they<00:04:11.030> made<00:04:11.209> the

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
written first and then they made the

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.060 
written first and then they made the
movie<00:04:11.630> and<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:12.380> think<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:12.769> should<00:04:12.799> actually

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
movie and I think you should actually

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.260 
movie and I think you should actually
watch<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.669> movie<00:04:13.910> for

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
watch the movie for

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.140 
watch the movie for
because<00:04:14.810> when<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.560> was<00:04:15.770> reading<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.190> book<00:04:16.400> they

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
because when I was reading the book they

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.479 
because when I was reading the book they
are<00:04:17.180> so<00:04:17.630> similar<00:04:17.989> but<00:04:18.380> there<00:04:18.500> also<00:04:18.680> are<00:04:18.830> a<00:04:19.100> few

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
are so similar but there also are a few

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.729 
are so similar but there also are a few
differences<00:04:19.940> but<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:20.570> think<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.050> way<00:04:21.170> that<00:04:21.530> the

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
differences but I think the way that the

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.110 
differences but I think the way that the
book<00:04:22.130> in<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.370> movie<00:04:22.490> kind<00:04:22.820> of<00:04:22.940> go

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
book in the movie kind of go

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.750 
book in the movie kind of go
hand-in-hand<00:04:23.510> is<00:04:23.960> awesome<00:04:24.410> and<00:04:24.650> if<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.550> see

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
hand-in-hand is awesome and if you see

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.160 
hand-in-hand is awesome and if you see
the<00:04:25.850> movie<00:04:26.090> first<00:04:26.300> you<00:04:26.600> can<00:04:26.720> kind<00:04:26.870> of<00:04:26.930> take

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
the movie first you can kind of take

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.690 
the movie first you can kind of take
those<00:04:27.350> characters<00:04:27.860> and<00:04:28.190> as<00:04:28.280> you're<00:04:28.550> reading

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
those characters and as you're reading

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.000 
those characters and as you're reading
the<00:04:28.880> book<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.090> can<00:04:29.330> imagine<00:04:29.630> them<00:04:30.080> in<00:04:30.350> the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
the book you can imagine them in the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.230 
the book you can imagine them in the
book<00:04:31.190> and<00:04:31.370> I<00:04:31.430> think<00:04:31.640> that<00:04:31.760> just<00:04:31.790> makes<00:04:32.060> the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
book and I think that just makes the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.390 
book and I think that just makes the
whole<00:04:32.270> experience<00:04:32.780> even<00:04:33.110> better<00:04:33.320> I<00:04:33.650> got<00:04:34.250> the

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
whole experience even better I got the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.070 
whole experience even better I got the
book<00:04:34.580> for<00:04:34.760> Christmas<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.390> I<00:04:35.420> read<00:04:35.660> it<00:04:35.780> in<00:04:35.870> one

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
book for Christmas and I read it in one

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.200 
book for Christmas and I read it in one
night<00:04:36.350> and<00:04:36.740> it's<00:04:37.580> definitely<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.970> different

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
night and it's definitely a different

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.030 
night and it's definitely a different
experience<00:04:38.420> in<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.080> movie<00:04:39.350> wadis<00:04:39.740> but<00:04:39.920> it's

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
experience in the movie wadis but it's

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.450 
experience in the movie wadis but it's
still<00:04:40.220> just<00:04:40.580> as<00:04:40.760> amazing<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.480> just<00:04:41.900> as<00:04:42.460> kind

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
still just as amazing and just as kind

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.700 
still just as amazing and just as kind
of<00:04:43.490> pleasurable<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.240> read<00:04:44.570> even<00:04:45.380> though<00:04:45.470> it<00:04:45.590> is

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
of pleasurable to read even though it is

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.410 
of pleasurable to read even though it is
like<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.070> same<00:04:46.250> story<00:04:46.520> if<00:04:46.880> that<00:04:47.000> makes<00:04:47.210> sense

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
like the same story if that makes sense

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.330 
like the same story if that makes sense
and<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.750> know<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.930> lot<00:04:48.140> of<00:04:48.170> people<00:04:48.500> say<00:04:48.890> like<00:04:49.160> oh

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
and I know a lot of people say like oh

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.560 
and I know a lot of people say like oh
the<00:04:49.550> book<00:04:49.700> is<00:04:49.850> always<00:04:50.000> better<00:04:50.150> than<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:50.510> movie

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
the book is always better than the movie

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.440 
the book is always better than the movie
but<00:04:50.990> personally<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.710> think<00:04:51.920> you<00:04:52.310> have<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.700> watch

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
but personally I think you have to watch

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.360 
but personally I think you have to watch
the<00:04:53.750> movie<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:54.260> read<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.620> book<00:04:54.830> together

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
the movie and read the book together

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.700 
the movie and read the book together
because<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.570> whole<00:04:56.750> experience<00:04:57.110> just<00:04:57.530> kind

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
because the whole experience just kind

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.980 
because the whole experience just kind
of<00:04:57.850> meshes<00:04:58.850> well<00:04:59.090> together<00:04:59.300> and<00:04:59.660> I<00:04:59.720> can't

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
of meshes well together and I can't

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.270 
of meshes well together and I can't
really<00:05:00.290> explain<00:05:00.530> that<00:05:00.710> any<00:05:00.920> other<00:05:01.100> way

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280
