00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.730
 they open dragon for about a week 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.860
 waking back, I found such a note 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.379
 on the nightstand I tried 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.539
 to figure out what was thinking half awake 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.280
 and it seems finally understood everything and now 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.740
 listen to me and learn the whole theory 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.840
 whole before or reject seven 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.970
 gods of dragons you hungarian empire 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 this is the key to the doors behind which is locked 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.960
 memphis gods i guess their 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 dragon souls are the keys to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.340
 Luganov who lead to the place of imprisonment 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.350
 elven gods morrigan says that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.210
 for everyone and catch it exists its 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.670
 the key to the example is the one that was in the temple 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.670
 the metal was opening up the source forces and wasn 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.890
 not all mirrors are our world is not at 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.950
 and catch Anna left open how Mike 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.340
 the beast is repeated forgotten over a period of levels 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.809
 for the same circle on and discover they can only be 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.329
 outside and he that way using 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.940
 the key of kiran the soul of one of the tanks 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.940
 dragons killed in 1 catch up and this 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.800
 soul open blush which was the sea but 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 because for the first time we were able to open the mirror 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.970
 when she already had a baby god in 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.979
 inquisition she says she doesn't understand 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.180
 how kira was able to independently open and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:18.090
 aviana why did you cut it and how did it 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:21.090
 made to open and catch ships 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.850
 need tremendous power about him that's all 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.040
 because he had a suitable soul I 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.750
 I do not think that it's aware of the Morrigan 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.659
 she is not understood by anything soul at all 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.299
 need luminary was a follower thought 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.130
 such a dragon but she really has no time 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.280
 think about did not see that prove it 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.040
 last words think i cry you i 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.170
 look 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.920
 feel if you taught us 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.810
 ever existed help me now 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.760
 so I suppose despite the generation 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.890
 you are the hungarian empire to think and the rest 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.020
 the gods are locked somewhere deep underground and 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.220
 the dragons spoke to those cards through 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.170
 dreams or something like that was someone 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.100
 told tywin herzen how to get to 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.770
 black city 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.900
 the result was a mor thinks wanted 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.280
 that the mor occurred but he was the first 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.410
 got sick badly 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.870
 from the creatures of darkness this led to 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.390
 what to think in the end was killed by gray 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.310
 watchmen about 17 years later when 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.700
 the dragon was killed vysery the guard died and 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.130
 the soul of god broke free 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.350
 still the key is why the creatures of darkness 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.080
 such a burning desire to find the next 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.150
 dragon and infect it nasty because 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.370
 what is the purpose is to 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.340
 destroy the ancient god sole 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.500
 possible way and now take a look at 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.320
 words in the world zone on the red illusion we 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.730
 in the shadow of a whisper recorded in the red world 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:49.450
 yummy we here we waited we slept we 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.390
 split we maimed we are infected we 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.100
 stand we wait we found dreams again 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.900
 we wake up i think it is ancient 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.380
 elf gods speaking by 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.790
 filthy red lirium is profane 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.040
 lazy and he's alive 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.650
 a letter to the lyre and we are very similar to speech 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.380
 ancient elves we endure it that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.269
 elves often say and we slept can 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.590
 refers to the ancient gods who are waiting 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:19.900
 here and mary until they are released and now 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.209
 let's talk about how sola reacted to 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.610
 possible killing all the gods of the dragons 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.010
 the gray guards wanted to go to the deep 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.350
 trails kill all remaining dragons 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.540
 to prevent in the future mod not 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.180
 I can believe that the gray guards came up 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.980
 such a plan is purposely finding old 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.769
 gods as soon as countries try 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.780
 prevent mor the demons are not what it is 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.120
 tool even if they were not aware 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.570
 that the idea itself is wrong city 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.680
 and not that you can outsmart forgive everything 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.570
 it makes me nervous solos negative 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.330
 reacts to the idea of ​​killing all the gods 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.880
 dragons he is who 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.400
 fist of gods so he seems to know 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.620
 that dragon souls are the key and if 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.510
 dragons kill engagement fear and fly away 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.120
 it looks like dragon age 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.660
 the inquisition opens the door all that 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.480
 required mark is a bit of a magic example 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.640
 the door to the red cafe in the quest blinks the door 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.380
 frame with missed time is the door 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.750
 which only opens if you 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.550
 collected a bunch of shards so i think 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.890
 marble has scanned sea ​​for a long time 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.140
 mythical gods to get keys 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:32.990
 from their own Kurds, the gods are eternal 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.990
 lack of time to wait 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.890
 created by the sauce is very durable and gods 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.110
 needed a thoughtful and reliable plan 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.510
 to choose but where the soul of the gods 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.310
 sent after release 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.230
 does they immediately open ilyuvar why 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.600
 metal needed a key last killed 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.550
 the dragon why he needed solokha 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:57.120
 how does all this relate to plan for revenge 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:59.460
 metal i don't know but finally the story about 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.830
 how android went crazy 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.020
 Once Andrei began to hunt 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.020
 mortals and on beasts she took from 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.530
 the events of the wicked creation dwelling in 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.960
 the abyss 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.480
 but even for their pussy goddess disastrous 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.220
 emptiness because on returning to andrew everything 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.710
 longer and longer could not get out 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.380
 madness adr will put on the armor made 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.690
 out of the void and everybody forgot how she looks 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.820
 she made weapons we and the plague 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.620
 emptied all of her and the hall 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.720
 screamed about what should have been 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.760
 remain forgotten and the rest of the gods 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.190
 frightened that he trumpeted begin to hunt 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.650
 and on them then the metal spread rumors about 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.810
 monster and she took the form of a huge 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.660
 snakes and crouched at the foot of the mountain 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.979
 waiting strayed dandruff metal came 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.919
 rushed to the hunter 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.419
 they fought three days and three nights 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.380
 deep cuts left andrew on 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:48.930
 snake body 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.570
 metal of its magic pulled silan royal 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.910
 and drank and knowledge how to find emptiness 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.669
 after that the great hunter is no longer 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.890
 could come back to the abyss again come 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.710
 the world of armor to Andrei is similar to that 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.810
 was samson he was driving him crazy and yet 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.030
 there are drawings in the temple of metal resembling 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.820
 elves affected by the red world of moms 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.490
 myself that if dragons are keys to something 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.770
 even more terrible something more ancient 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.400
 teach and fieschi and the gods there is nothing even 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.650
 boobs gods were afraid to score forgotten ones 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.200
 whom the alpine gods locked in the abyss 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.070
 lantern from gel Dauran de Rintala and 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.070
 perhaps their leader was fine hair 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.070
 salon
