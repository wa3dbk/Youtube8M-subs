then<00:01:49.770> it'll<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.759> special<00:01:51.360> attack

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
then it'll just do that special attack

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.069 
then it'll just do that special attack
so<00:01:52.070> just<00:01:53.070> max<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.790> three<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
so just max it out it three it's like a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.850 
so just max it out it three it's like a
wind-up<00:01:55.700> see<00:01:56.700> how<00:01:56.790> fast<00:01:57.000> my<00:01:57.180> belts<00:01:57.479> go<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.860> and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
wind-up see how fast my belts go in and

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.679 
wind-up see how fast my belts go in and
then<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.460> kind<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> slows<00:02:00.149> down<00:02:00.360> after<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
then it kind of slows down after a

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.209 
then it kind of slows down after a
little<00:02:00.810> while<00:02:00.899> alright<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.829> there's<00:02:02.040> two

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
little while alright so there's two

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.590 
little while alright so there's two
upgrade<00:02:02.579> paths<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.969> contused<00:02:03.329> they're

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
upgrade paths that contused they're

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.389 
upgrade paths that contused they're

I'm gonna be doing serious spinner let's

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.050 
I'm gonna be doing serious spinner let's
do<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.540> all<00:02:16.310> right<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.520> first<00:02:17.700> upgrade

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
do that all right and the first upgrade

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.420 
do that all right and the first upgrade
for<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.390> path<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.230> harder<00:02:19.590> they<00:02:19.740> fall

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
for this path is the harder they fall

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.850 
for this path is the harder they fall
whole<00:02:20.940> beat<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.270> terms<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.630> spin<00:02:21.870> release<00:02:22.650> the

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
got a bounce off of multiple enemies

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.150 
got a bounce off of multiple enemies
though<00:03:01.050> didn't<00:03:01.320> work<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.709> one<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:02.040> them

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
though didn't work on this one of them

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.590 
though didn't work on this one of them
there<00:03:03.150> we<00:03:03.240> go<00:03:03.360> yeah<00:03:03.720> look<00:03:03.930> at<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:06.180> doubles

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
there we go yeah look at that it doubles

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.550 
there we go yeah look at that it doubles
it<00:03:06.840> didn't<00:03:07.050> really<00:03:07.140> do<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.320> much<00:03:07.440> damage

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
it didn't really do that much damage

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.850 
it didn't really do that much damage
when<00:03:08.040> he<00:03:08.070> lands<00:03:08.940> but<00:03:09.410> it'll<00:03:10.410> probably<00:03:10.590> give<00:03:10.800> an

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
when he lands but it'll probably give an

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.540 
when he lands but it'll probably give an
upgrade<00:03:11.130> in<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.310> minute<00:03:11.520> for<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:12.350> here<00:03:13.350> we<00:03:13.410> go

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
upgrade in a minute for that here we go

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.020 
upgrade in a minute for that here we go
yeah<00:03:14.959> spin<00:03:15.959> ball<00:03:16.140> King<00:03:16.440> spin<00:03:17.430> right<00:03:17.700> around

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
yeah spin ball King spin right around

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.390 
yeah spin ball King spin right around
does<00:03:18.450> increased<00:03:18.900> damage<00:03:19.110> king<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.130> spin

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
does increased damage king of the spin

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.150 
does increased damage king of the spin
ball<00:03:20.610> wizards<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.360> spin<00:03:22.260> charge<00:03:22.560> here<00:03:22.950> is

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
ball wizards the spin charge here is

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.550 
ball wizards the spin charge here is
gonna<00:03:23.910> do<00:03:24.090> increased<00:03:24.420> damage<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:24.870> what's<00:03:25.080> 55

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
gonna do increased damage so what's 55

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.009 
gonna do increased damage so what's 55
and<00:03:26.010> then<00:03:26.160> when<00:03:26.790> enough<00:03:27.030> up<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.269> an<00:03:27.390> air<00:03:27.660> it'll

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
and then when enough up in an air it'll

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.040 
and then when enough up in an air it'll
do<00:03:28.260> 10<00:03:28.590> let's<00:03:29.190> see<00:03:29.280> how<00:03:29.340> much<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.580> does<00:03:29.670> now<00:03:30.050> 65

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
do 10 let's see how much it does now 65

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.100 
do 10 let's see how much it does now 65
and<00:03:31.380> then<00:03:31.470> when<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:31.890> knock<00:03:32.100> up<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.459> air<00:03:32.640> 15

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
and then when I knock up in the air 15

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.570 
and then when I knock up in the air 15
old<00:03:34.110> when<00:03:34.320> they<00:03:34.410> land<00:03:34.620> probably<00:03:35.040> 15<00:03:35.310> as<00:03:35.459> well

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
old when they land probably 15 as well

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.940 
old when they land probably 15 as well
alright<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.390> his<00:03:36.540> soul<00:03:36.780> gem<00:03:36.989> ability<00:03:37.440> is<00:03:37.620> spin

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
alright and his soul gem ability is spin

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.590 
alright and his soul gem ability is spin
the<00:03:38.100> tables<00:03:38.519> on<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.820> bottom<00:03:39.120> part<00:03:39.330> of<00:03:39.480> his

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
the tables on the bottom part of his

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.690 
the tables on the bottom part of his
body<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:39.959> let's<00:03:40.380> check<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.070> out<00:03:41.190> during<00:03:41.489> the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
body so let's check that out during the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.540 
body so let's check that out during the
four<00:03:41.910> spin<00:03:42.440> enemies<00:03:43.440> in<00:03:43.680> large<00:03:43.950> radius<00:03:44.400> or

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
four spin enemies in large radius or

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.910 
four spin enemies in large radius or
damaged<00:03:44.910> alright<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.200> what<00:03:46.410> I'm<00:03:46.500> gonna<00:03:46.590> do<00:03:46.769> is

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
damaged alright so what I'm gonna do is

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.080
