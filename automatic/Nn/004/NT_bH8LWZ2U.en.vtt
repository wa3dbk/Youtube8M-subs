00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
about to take the conversion you can

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.170 
about to take the conversion you can
kind<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.320> him<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.370> far<00:00:50.640> left<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.090> about

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
kind of see him on the far left is about

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.420 
kind of see him on the far left is about
to<00:00:51.390> approach<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.899> ball<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:53.070> basically

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
to approach the ball there so basically

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490 
to approach the ball there so basically
if<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:54.000> teams<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> Tri<00:00:54.870> they<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.320> four

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
if one teams for the Tri they get four

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.939 
if one teams for the Tri they get four
points<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> fella<00:00:57.120> converts<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.949> if

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
points and if the fella converts it if

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.619 
points and if the fella converts it if
they<00:00:59.039> convert<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.399> Tri<00:00:59.730> they<00:01:00.090> will<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.420> an

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
they convert the Tri they will get an

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.150 
they convert the Tri they will get an
additional<00:01:00.870> two<00:01:01.260> points<00:01:01.620> which<00:01:01.770> means<00:01:01.920> that

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
additional two points which means that

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.000 
additional two points which means that
if<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.180> convert<00:01:03.809> their<00:01:04.170> try<00:01:04.439> they

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
if they if they convert their try they

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.929 
if they if they convert their try they
get<00:01:05.189> 6.0<00:01:05.880> steps<00:01:06.270> into<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.630> hits<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:08.340> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
get 6.0 steps into it hits it and I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.789 
get 6.0 steps into it hits it and I
think<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.659> pretty<00:01:10.020> sure<00:01:10.260> we've<00:01:10.380> got<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.530> then

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
think be pretty sure we've got that then

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.620 
think be pretty sure we've got that then
so<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.010> two<00:01:11.280> points<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.570> in

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
so that's two points as you can see in

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.100 
so that's two points as you can see in
the<00:01:12.689> big<00:01:12.869> screen<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.290> will<00:01:13.409> say<00:01:13.970> goal<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.960> what

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the big screen it will say goal and what

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.330 
the big screen it will say goal and what
I'm<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.650> I'm<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.189> of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
conversion looks like from the solder

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.580 
conversion looks like from the solder
field<00:01:26.790> where<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.750> Brisbane<00:01:28.080> Broncos<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.500> this

the side line so I'll make their puppy
plays<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> ball<00:01:41.759> picks<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.479> might

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
plays the ball picks it up I might

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
plays the ball picks it up I might
scooch<00:01:42.930> around<00:01:43.079> though<00:01:43.829> they<00:01:44.159> call<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
scooch around though they call it the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.630 
scooch around though they call it the
rock<00:01:44.700> where<00:01:45.450> I'll<00:01:45.540> make<00:01:45.689> plays<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> ball<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
rock where I'll make plays a ball so the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.069 
rock where I'll make plays a ball so the
aim<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> game<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.060> obviously<00:01:48.329> score<00:01:48.780> try

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
aim of the game is obviously score try

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.020 
aim of the game is obviously score try
on<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.409> back<00:01:49.619> line<00:01:49.860> there<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.700> court<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
on that back line there the court the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.080 
on that back line there the court the
end<00:01:51.149> goal<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.009> they<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.189> five<00:01:53.460> tackles<00:01:53.729> each

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
end goal and they have five tackles each

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.270 
end goal and they have five tackles each
attacking<00:01:54.540> said<00:01:54.810> oh<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.770> must<00:01:55.979> go<00:01:56.100> further

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
attacking said oh you must go further

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.130 
attacking said oh you must go further
line<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.759> basically<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.270> he<00:01:57.420> gets<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.750> ball<00:01:57.960> down

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
line so basically if he gets a ball down

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.440 
line so basically if he gets a ball down
over<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.649> line<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.130> similar<00:01:59.280> NFL<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.329> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
over that line it's similar NFL but you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.429 
over that line it's similar NFL but you
actually<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> ball<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> touch

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
actually have to get the ball to touch

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.789 
actually have to get the ball to touch
the<00:02:01.590> ground<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.840> they<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.140> drive<00:02:04.530> for

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the ground and they get a drive for

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.139 
the ground and they get a drive for
points<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.250> then<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.399> might<00:02:05.579> goes<00:02:05.729> back<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
points and then I might goes back and

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.460 
points and then I might goes back and
tries<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.479> convert<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.140> from

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
tries to convert it from

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.990 
tries to convert it from
point<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:07.890> obviously<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> score<00:02:08.790> of<00:02:08.850> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
point there obviously the score of the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.800 
point there obviously the score of the
posts<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.840> get<00:02:09.990> an<00:02:10.080> easier<00:02:10.440> conversion<00:02:10.979> to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
posts you get an easier conversion to

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.300 
posts you get an easier conversion to
alright<00:02:12.810> this<00:02:12.960> is<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.170> decision<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.280> that

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
alright this is the decision for that

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.970 
alright this is the decision for that
try<00:02:14.610> then<00:02:14.880> oh<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.930> no<00:02:16.050> try<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.350> think<00:02:16.590> he<00:02:16.830> was

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
try then oh it's a no try I think he was

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.530 
try then oh it's a no try I think he was
called<00:02:17.100> up<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.550> particular<00:02:17.700> try<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.420> the

called up that particular try in the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.600 
called up that particular try in the
corner<00:02:18.810> there<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.770> very<00:02:20.430> different

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
