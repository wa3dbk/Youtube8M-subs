we<00:00:04.230> are<00:00:04.380> going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> learn<00:00:04.770> how<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.100> do<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.400> 3/4

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
we are going to learn how to do a 3/4

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.950 
we are going to learn how to do a 3/4
shimmy<00:00:06.710> which<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.950> perhaps<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.820> little<00:00:09.480> bit

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
shimmy which is perhaps a little bit

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.280 
shimmy which is perhaps a little bit
more<00:00:10.200> advanced<00:00:10.590> but<00:00:10.889> still<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:12.290> reasonably

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
more advanced but still a reasonably

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.870 
more advanced but still a reasonably
coordinated<00:00:13.769> beginner<00:00:14.130> can<00:00:14.370> get<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.610> hang<00:00:14.759> of

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
coordinated beginner can get the hang of

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.090 
coordinated beginner can get the hang of
this<00:00:15.000> as<00:00:15.210> well<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:16.230> what<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.410> want<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.859> think

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
this as well so what I want you to think

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.220 
this as well so what I want you to think
about<00:00:17.220> first<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:18.000> transferring<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.050> weight

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
about first is transferring the weight

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.099 
about first is transferring the weight
and<00:00:19.740> notice<00:00:20.580> as<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.150> shift<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.660> weight<00:00:21.869> from

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
and notice as you shift the weight from

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.679 
and notice as you shift the weight from
the<00:00:22.199> right<00:00:22.410> side<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.010> left<00:00:23.130> side<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.420> hips

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the right side to the left side the hips

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.480 
the right side to the left side the hips
will<00:00:25.470> slide<00:00:26.660> side<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> side<00:00:28.199> as<00:00:28.439> well<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.340> what

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
will slide side to side as well so what

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.070 
will slide side to side as well so what
I'm<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.179> I'm<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> step<00:00:30.929> my

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
I'm going to do is I'm going to step my

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.430 
I'm going to do is I'm going to step my
right<00:00:31.109> foot<00:00:31.710> slightly<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.430> front<00:00:33.140> shift<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
right foot slightly in front shift the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.250 
right foot slightly in front shift the
weight<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.280> foot<00:00:36.079> contract<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
weight to that foot contract the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.639 
weight to that foot contract the
obliques<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.219> lift<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.149> foot<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.690> drop<00:00:40.440> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.490 
obliques to lift the foot and drop it
down<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.040> front<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.430> me<00:00:42.200> transfer<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> weight

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
to that left foot contract the obliques

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.400 
to that left foot contract the obliques
on<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.739> right<00:00:46.950> side<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:48.000> lift<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.600> foot<00:00:48.840> and
