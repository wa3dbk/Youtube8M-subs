00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.570
 fit beyond the frame that it does not 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.310
 to like that after this one is a 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.260
 professional camera then this lens that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.939
 you can not book this camera 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.310
 but you can use the countless cameras 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.659

 and will tell the pros and cons of this 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.640
 Pro eye lens is that it is bahia one of the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.740
 cons is that class ie dropped in 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.080
 ground was already her life where it is also 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.909
 j less than lasted a year and nothing she 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.680
 stops running and darker environment 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.540
 and pressed is fixed ie you zoom 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.640
 gross comes more and more we are yes 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.829
 Are you going to photograph something you need 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.909
 more light this image can get quite 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.770
 choice 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.900
 the result may not be so cool now 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.610
 We'll talk a little bit about 24 70 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.560
 which is a lens that we consider 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.200
 versatile that we use a lot in 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.310
 that those who invest in quality and 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.930
 to Improve Your Pictures Exit 1855 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.080
 This was the first time I bought 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:03.290
 16 years ago and is a lens 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.390
 than the previous it is much clearer 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.730
 it is also slow superversatile because you 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.470
 have the option of weight is not a fixed lens 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.590
 So who is suddenly going to have 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.360
 a lens would be a good option that you 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.820
 not come to be used by those who have not 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.130
 sells and that 's what lasted a year and this 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.570
 10 you can see what follows is better only 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.850
 easier it is only that it is better too 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.900
 a new version of this lens was released 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.940
 this model that we are showing 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.970
 that it no longer exists to sell and 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.500
 this new model comes in two versions to 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.520
 first version talk a little more 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.960
 dark 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.450
 only it's still much better anyway 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.360
 that this is a bit more in 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.580
 that this one but it's a version she's so 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.110
 good as it is lighter including 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.970
 that this may have a little more expensive 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.110
 and do not put down the links to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.360
 every time we 're talking 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.250
 here are some extra suggestions for 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.100
 you buy in determining your 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.380
 pocket and from your back pocket 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.540
 need not necessarily buy a 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.209
 lens of the same brand as your camera 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.610
 There are many brands of lenses that 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.310
 They can be used in the ways of 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.940
 canon and nikon of sony there is no sigma 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.590
 for example for people talking and 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.200
 many others you can search in the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.150
 vh1 site on any other porn site 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.890
 then this tip is a suggestion for our 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.540
 who can only count on a lens not 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.070
 means that these lenses are the 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.269
 better if you buy a fixed lens 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.880
 you will get a picture quality 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.350
 much better but we chose these 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.120
 two lenses for being lenses more 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.650
