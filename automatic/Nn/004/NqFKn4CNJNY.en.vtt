beading into the backpack rooms are some
some<00:01:14.130> retailers<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.360> actually<00:01:15.689> trying<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
some retailers and actually trying to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.109 
some retailers and actually trying to
find<00:01:16.439> products<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.280> actually<00:01:17.850> quite

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
find products it is actually quite

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.789 
find products it is actually quite
difficult<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.810> therefore<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.530> can't

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
difficult and therefore if you can't

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
difficult and therefore if you can't
find<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.280> you've<00:01:20.490> got<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> potential<00:01:21.210> risk

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
find it you've got a potential risk

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.149 
find it you've got a potential risk
that's<00:01:21.659> gonna<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.960> out<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.140> code<00:01:22.320> or<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.070> gets

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that's gonna go out of code or it gets

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.219 
that's gonna go out of code or it gets
damaged<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.330> therefore<00:01:24.750> ends<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.110> getting

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
damaged and therefore ends up getting

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.310 
damaged and therefore ends up getting
wasted<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.100> me<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.460> easy<00:01:26.909> ideas<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
wasted so for me and easy ideas is a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.960 
wasted so for me and easy ideas is a
really<00:01:28.710> important<00:01:29.070> factor<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.520> making<00:01:29.790> sure

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
really important factor of making sure

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.240 
really important factor of making sure
that<00:01:30.210> certainly<00:01:31.200> from<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.409> retailer<00:01:31.890> point<00:01:32.100> of

that certainly from a retailer point of

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.700 
that certainly from a retailer point of
view<00:01:32.460> our<00:01:33.240> colleagues<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.960> really<00:01:34.229> get<00:01:34.380> into

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
view our colleagues can really get into

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
view our colleagues can really get into
there<00:01:34.860> find<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.369> product<00:01:35.579> quickly<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.299> it

there find a product quickly and get it
onto<00:01:36.509> shelf<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:38.369> beauty<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.790> corrugated<00:01:39.509> is

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
onto shelf the beauty of corrugated is

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.539 
onto shelf the beauty of corrugated is
that<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.350> precisely<00:01:40.799> tailored<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.520> fit

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that it can be precisely tailored to fit

any product

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.530 
any product
this<00:01:43.590> means<00:01:43.920> more<00:01:44.280> products<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> pallet<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
this means more products on a pallet and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.290 
this means more products on a pallet and
better<00:01:45.930> use<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.259> warehouse<00:01:46.799> space

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
better use of warehouse space

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.180 
better use of warehouse space
all<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.570> adds<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.230> less<00:01:49.380> lorries<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
all this adds up to less lorries on the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.210 
all this adds up to less lorries on the
road<00:01:50.370> and<00:01:50.670> lower<00:01:51.000> logistics<00:01:51.630> costs<00:01:52.220> there's

consumers love paper based packaging
because<00:02:16.430> it's<00:02:16.730> better<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.300> environment

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
because it's better for the environment
