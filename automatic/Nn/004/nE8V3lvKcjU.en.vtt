00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
it was so cool because I remember just a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.000 
it was so cool because I remember just a
couple<00:00:39.329> years<00:00:39.600> ago<00:00:39.690> when<00:00:40.079> WWE<00:00:40.680> was<00:00:40.770> doing

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
couple years ago when WWE was doing

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.369 
couple years ago when WWE was doing
house<00:00:41.190> shows<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.730> Montreal<00:00:42.690> he<00:00:42.899> was<00:00:43.050> coming

house shows in Montreal he was coming

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.400 
house shows in Montreal he was coming
out<00:00:43.500> pop<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.670> night<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.289> uh

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
out pop of the night and now it's uh

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.520 
out pop of the night and now it's uh
it's<00:00:47.390> more<00:00:48.390> than<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.539> now<00:00:48.870> he's<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.170> like

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it's more than that now he's just like

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.130 
it's more than that now he's just like
on<00:00:49.770> live<00:00:50.039> TV<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:51.090> front<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.449> millions<00:00:51.629> washing

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
on live TV in front of millions washing

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
on live TV in front of millions washing
at<00:00:52.230> home<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.910> think<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.180> probably

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
at home and it's I think it's probably

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.639 
at home and it's I think it's probably
one<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> things<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> go<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.530> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
one of the things you have to go out of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.200 
one of the things you have to go out of
your<00:00:55.860> way<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.430> personally<00:00:57.030> haven't

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
your way to see I personally haven't

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.080 
your way to see I personally haven't
seen<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> yet<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.350> am<00:00:58.920> definitely<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.760> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
seen it yet but I am definitely going to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.790 
seen it yet but I am definitely going to
I<00:01:00.390> guess<00:01:00.570> that's<00:01:00.870> kind<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.590> for

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
I guess that's kind of what I get for

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.349 
I guess that's kind of what I get for
not<00:01:01.920> watching<00:01:02.160> raw<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.699> they<00:01:02.789> say<00:01:03.000> anything

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
not watching raw and they say anything

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.940 
not watching raw and they say anything
can<00:01:03.480> happen<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> WWE<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:06.619> although<00:01:07.619> I

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
can happen in the WWE and although I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
can happen in the WWE and although I
think<00:01:10.010> Kevin<00:01:11.010> Owens<00:01:11.100> kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.729> hinted<00:01:12.659> at

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
think Kevin Owens kind of hinted at

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.480 
think Kevin Owens kind of hinted at
something<00:01:12.810> big<00:01:13.439> happening<00:01:13.920> when<00:01:14.159> he<00:01:14.310> tweeted

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
something big happening when he tweeted

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.609 
something big happening when he tweeted
out<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.909> he'll<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.450> watching<00:01:15.659> NXT<00:01:16.350> very

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
out that he'll be watching NXT very

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.980 
out that he'll be watching NXT very
closely<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:19.070> with<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.189> being<00:01:20.369> said<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
closely and with that being said you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.060 
closely and with that being said you
thought<00:01:21.990> he<00:01:22.170> could<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.470> came<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.890> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
thought he could have came out you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.260 
thought he could have came out you
thought<00:01:23.250> Neville<00:01:23.580> was<00:01:23.729> gonna<00:01:23.909> could<00:01:24.180> have

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
thought Neville was gonna could have

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.580 
thought Neville was gonna could have
came<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> could<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.840> been<00:01:24.900> anyone<00:01:25.110> from<00:01:25.320> NXT

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
came it could have been anyone from NXT

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.830 
came it could have been anyone from NXT
accepting<00:01:26.490> John<00:01:26.700> Cena's<00:01:27.060> open<00:01:27.210> challenge<00:01:27.390> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
accepting John Cena's open challenge and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.969 
accepting John Cena's open challenge and
I<00:01:27.869> think<00:01:28.110> that's<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:30.079> that's<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.619> charm

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I think that's the that's the the charm

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.920 
I think that's the that's the the charm
of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.729> open<00:01:33.000> challenge<00:01:33.240> thing<00:01:33.630> because<00:01:33.810> you

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
of the open challenge thing because you

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.330 
of the open challenge thing because you
never<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.530> who's<00:01:34.560> gonna<00:01:34.890> come<00:01:35.159> out

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
never really know who's gonna come out

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.370 
never really know who's gonna come out
and<00:01:35.549> who<00:01:36.150> ever<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.600> does<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.079> know<00:01:37.229> it's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and who ever really does you know it's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.830 
and who ever really does you know it's

Zayn loses he is out of NXT same wave

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.670

like<00:02:46.230> Bo<00:02:46.410> Dallas<00:02:46.620> left<00:02:47.070> he<00:02:47.250> kind<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:48.530> loses<00:02:49.530> his

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
like Bo Dallas left he kind of loses his

like Bo Dallas left he kind of loses his
match<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:50.130> then<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:50.490> him<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.730> Monday

Night<00:02:51.180> Raw<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:52.740> guess<00:02:53.160> because<00:02:53.460> now

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
Night Raw and I guess because now

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
happens on Raw it doesn't happen and

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.820 
happens on Raw it doesn't happen and
doesn't<00:02:59.820> even<00:02:59.940> consider<00:03:00.450> backing<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:01.110> NXT<00:03:01.380> I

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
doesn't even consider backing on NXT I

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.970
