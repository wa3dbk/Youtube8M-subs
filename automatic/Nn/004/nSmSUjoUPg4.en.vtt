00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.149
 How about health friends and friends from Mexico and I want to share with you in this 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:16.539
 occasion as I said second session has been seen in my new album go back to 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:17.120
 start 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.509
 in what is an annotated 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:20.689
 more fierce 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.909
 right mosley you have to use data from world ministries on 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.189
 xiii 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.189
 I can not enter min 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.780
 there are also all of them including the main ones 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.850
 what follows is without 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.980
 a way to get younger 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.450
 to fall after 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.650
 between this note that would be my son 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.470
 but fix and all 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.830
 according to the plan 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.990
 the next note of that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.990
 but to not fit the figures we are doing 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.630
 we do not have more comfortable 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.250
 this work should be a walk to fall to - 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.640
 I'm still not going to do slowly that would be the line for which I had 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.640
 could follow him at home 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.130
 come next I want to comment on what the right hand does and 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.940
 we're also going from the two slow speeds and the version 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.630
 normal 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.770
 so your interests are more voted 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.140
 with the flight despite the suspicion that our system should not be serious 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.269
 stacey should be 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.269
 what are the neighbors of the burriana sandy area 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.150
 and now coconut amount of the accounts are according to the changes where we are 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:37.249
 doing January taking into account that the network in the agreement 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.249
 even though he was rehearsing a melody 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.999
 I will be president 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.739
 in the final part about if there was a little cm such a way that he 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.339
 I share with you also stressed 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:19.059
 this should be 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.059
 in ballad version 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.929
 we continue with the slow version 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:45.159
 if you notice and in the same line that we are only at the beginning 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.989
 but at the end from where we are the minor's slip 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.989
 we continue 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.619
 when we are here in the minor 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:06.619
 the only thing that we are going to do is to perform like this in the same position 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.299
 now the biggest operation 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.619
 we changed 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:15.209
 to finish in 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.370
 to review this form 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.370
 closing with 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.150
 and well I was saying 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.000
 what the left hand does and what the right hand does in this melody is 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.870
 very sensitive to you, you can repeat it and use how many times 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.159
 want to get it out in the best possible way 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.659

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.330

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.999
 navy 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.999

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.639

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:10.979
 forever 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.080

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.070
 rolÃ³n 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.330
 between almost everything not doing 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.460
 another scenario 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.460
 the aerial means 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.449
