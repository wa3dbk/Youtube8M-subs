00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
connecting there's the the setup it says

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.110 
connecting there's the the setup it says
prime<00:02:30.599> X<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.349> then<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:32.430> serial<00:02:32.819> number

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
prime X and then the the serial number

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.330 
prime X and then the the serial number
so<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.480> checked<00:02:33.810> off<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.470> I'm<00:02:34.860> using<00:02:35.099> the

slipped<00:03:06.510> on<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.989> Mount<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:08.069> tell<00:03:08.280> by

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
slipped on the Mount I can tell by

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.640 
slipped on the Mount I can tell by
looking<00:03:09.030> at<00:03:09.470> VI<00:03:10.470> ipod<00:03:11.430> or<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.610> camera<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.780> then
