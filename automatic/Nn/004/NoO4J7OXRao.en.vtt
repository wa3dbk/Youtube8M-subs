and I'll take the next part or the other
side<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.709> basically<00:04:15.920> do<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.549> same<00:04:16.790> thing<00:04:17.180> and

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
side and basically do the same thing and

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.590 
side and basically do the same thing and
this<00:04:18.829> like<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.310> said<00:04:19.340> this<00:04:19.609> for<00:04:19.669> a<00:04:19.880> simple<00:04:20.359> bond

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
this like I said this for a simple bond

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.810 
this like I said this for a simple bond
and<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.230> can<00:04:21.410> almost<00:04:21.650> do<00:04:22.190> this<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:23.020> not<00:04:24.820> worry

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
and you can almost do this and not worry

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:33.990 
and you can almost do this and not worry
about<00:04:27.220> hair<00:04:28.220> pins<00:04:28.750> if<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:30.169> tuck<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.740> right

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.430 

yeah<00:04:35.000> but<00:04:35.360> this<00:04:35.480> seems<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:35.930> be<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.169> little

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
yeah but this seems to be a little

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.460 
yeah but this seems to be a little
uneven<00:04:39.280> I'll<00:04:40.280> do<00:04:40.550> is<00:04:40.730> I'll<00:04:40.910> bring<00:04:41.210> this<00:04:41.570> part

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
uneven I'll do is I'll bring this part

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:51.790 
uneven I'll do is I'll bring this part
around<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:44.479> will<00:04:44.720> check<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.050> again<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:51.650> you

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
around and I will check it again and you

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.770 
around and I will check it again and you
can<00:04:51.979> almost<00:04:52.100> just<00:04:52.400> wear<00:04:52.729> it<00:04:52.910> like<00:04:53.270> that<00:04:53.540> but

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
can almost just wear it like that but

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.760 
can almost just wear it like that but
it's<00:04:53.960> kind<00:04:54.229> of<00:04:54.350> lopsided<00:04:55.690> so<00:04:56.690> what<00:04:57.320> I'll<00:04:57.470> do

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
it's kind of lopsided so what I'll do

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.960 
it's kind of lopsided so what I'll do
now<00:04:58.040> is<00:04:59.770> just<00:05:00.770> pin<00:05:01.100> it<00:05:01.250> where<00:05:01.430> it<00:05:01.550> feels<00:05:01.760> like

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
now is just pin it where it feels like

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:10.389 
now is just pin it where it feels like
it<00:05:02.120> needs<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.540> be<00:05:02.750> pinned

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:10.399 

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:17.959
