00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.490
 a mouse perception yes we have 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.770
 today a tree stump reese 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.280
 what does it look like? 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.219
 principle, it is also a multi who stop 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.970
 The tree trunks are removed and sawed in 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.140
 principle same as original here as 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.260
 snag reese have the fsi here 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.970
 powertech just say i'm working 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.460
 I think is better and faster 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.080
 We have every part in the shop for 35,000 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.710
 100 euro under post devices 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.870
 the company is aha de the model itself 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.460
 we are relatively good at the portal 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.750
 need an output of 300 ps that 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.090
 I got the mountain right away 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.489
 to hit the working width would be 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 then 23 meters and maintenance costs of 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.700
 75 euros a day 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.230
 But we look at is we have 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.190
 Of course you can pay electricity here 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.449
 you can turn it down and what 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.100
 really horny of course is turning 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.960
 of it all that is really cool 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.460
 they can almost anything stuck in front 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.539
 access and here is de can if 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.160
 we the from left and right 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.930
 move here this flap open and shut 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.830
 do 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.270
 do not ask me now what the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.400
 Sinn probably has to shut up 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.560
 to be so eating at all 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.530
 can start and up here 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.930
 I can anchor these these 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.400
 guess so you can do it 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.869
 lash down so that just the tree or 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.549
 if you just do not just stump 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.810
 wants to remove but also others 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.400
 You can do things better first 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.509
 once removed 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.970
 we must now first we want a 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.030
 Turn around a bit because we do not have any 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.079
 Bank mood is correct then we have 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.079
 we'll do it the same 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.060
 such a missing one I have three times 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.630
 rausgesucht works maybe the most 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.909
 best we wanted one now 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.580
 tree stump is the fall would be good 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.940
 yes I want to be in a short and short time 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.300
 You see, that's a bit of what that is 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.270
 really ok here is also still stump 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.840
 been all tree but fast 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.840
 the first way 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.749
 or there 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.790
 that should be enough for now 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:13.209
 now have the tree stumps here 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.950
 one 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.209
 and here's the second okay I've got 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.709
 already cut off so far down there 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:26.549
 You do not see if I really like that 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:29.549
 bad here now okay 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:33.970
 but we will lower the topic 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.739
 can turn on here too 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.030
 make it closer while storming it 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.709
 tastes it is relatively fast 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.360
 So basically we do not have to do anything 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.290
 I can do that to you 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.290
 anyway, shut up and 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.220
 Now you hang it again 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.500
 looks great 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.030
 works great why I do that 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.930
 use instead of the normal tree stump 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.390
 freese if it is much better here 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.760
 works we see one here 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.260
 tree stump is gone because there is zero 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.390
 problems works fine 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.739
 There are also five stars for that 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.910
 is the first milk is because I know 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.819
 it 15 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.680
 yes, really works great 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.099
 visually one can not do anything to the motto 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.019
 gripe 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.430
 it looks really good, my god that 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.730
 this logic is not so high-resolution there 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.010
 it is sometimes put there otherwise me it 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.769
 everything is going great works fine 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.810
 completely fulfills its purpose and me 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.680
 think there is the murder in relative 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.690
 short time made so synonymous for it 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.010
 and find respectful thank you must have the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.049
 it was my friends again i said 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.049
 we watch makes good service
