they have updated the fit of the glove a
little<00:00:42.250> bit<00:00:42.340> too<00:00:42.490> I<00:00:42.520> think<00:00:42.760> they've<00:00:43.000> made<00:00:43.150> it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
little bit too I think they've made it

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.640 
little bit too I think they've made it
more<00:00:43.450> comfortable<00:00:43.900> which<00:00:44.140> is<00:00:44.320> certainly

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
more comfortable which is certainly

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.370 
more comfortable which is certainly
never<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.980> bad<00:00:45.250> thing<00:00:45.520> a<00:00:45.760> note<00:00:46.330> on<00:00:46.360> sizing<00:00:47.200> with

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
gloves themselves the first thing I'd

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.340 
gloves themselves the first thing I'd
like<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.400> draw<00:01:09.580> your<00:01:09.610> attention<00:01:09.790> to<00:01:10.180> is<00:01:10.540> the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
like to draw your attention to is the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.310 
like to draw your attention to is the
hard<00:01:11.830> knuckle<00:01:12.250> protector<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.780> certainly

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
hard knuckle protector this certainly

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.899 
hard knuckle protector this certainly
looks<00:01:14.560> like<00:01:14.650> it's<00:01:14.979> going<00:01:15.190> to<00:01:15.250> be<00:01:15.370> a<00:01:15.400> very<00:01:15.670> rigid

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
looks like it's going to be a very rigid

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.440 
looks like it's going to be a very rigid
piece<00:01:16.270> but<00:01:16.780> notice<00:01:17.470> here<00:01:17.740> when<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:17.979> flex<00:01:18.280> it<00:01:18.490> it

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
piece but notice here when I flex it it

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.539 
piece but notice here when I flex it it
moves<00:01:19.720> rather<00:01:20.020> easily<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:21.010> is<00:01:21.100> still

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
moves rather easily it is still

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.219 
moves rather easily it is still
certainly<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.120> hard<00:01:22.450> piece<00:01:22.690> but<00:01:22.960> it's<00:01:23.080> a

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
certainly a hard piece but it's a

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.219 
certainly a hard piece but it's a
comfortable<00:01:24.010> energy-absorbing<00:01:24.790> piece<00:01:25.420> they

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
feel good when you have them on and it's

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.070 
feel good when you have them on and it's
certainly<00:01:27.970> capable<00:01:28.240> of<00:01:28.600> moving<00:01:28.840> around

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
certainly capable of moving around

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.830
