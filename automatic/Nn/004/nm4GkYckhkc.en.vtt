or yeah dispensers yeah it's awesome and

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.520 
or yeah dispensers yeah it's awesome and
the<00:05:14.700> library<00:05:15.150> would<00:05:15.390> be<00:05:15.450> burning<00:05:15.960> but<00:05:16.260> I<00:05:16.290> guess

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
the library would be burning but I guess

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.760 
the library would be burning but I guess
that<00:05:16.800> we<00:05:17.730> set<00:05:18.390> out<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.630> fire<00:05:18.870> before<00:05:19.200> we<00:05:19.530> start

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
that we set out the fire before we start

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.890 
that we set out the fire before we start
in<00:05:19.830> this<00:05:19.920> episode<00:05:20.340> so<00:05:20.580> that<00:05:20.640> one<00:05:21.450> just<00:05:21.630> burned

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
in this episode so that one just burned

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.300 
in this episode so that one just burned
out<00:05:22.020> in<00:05:22.170> your<00:05:22.230> daily<00:05:22.380> but<00:05:22.740> usually<00:05:23.160> you'd

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
out in your daily but usually you'd

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.710 
out in your daily but usually you'd
start<00:05:23.580> burning<00:05:23.760> down<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.240> entire<00:05:24.450> mansion

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
start burning down the entire mansion

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.770 
start burning down the entire mansion
and<00:05:25.710> it's<00:05:26.220> horrible<00:05:26.490> I<00:05:26.790> think<00:05:27.030> that<00:05:27.210> sometimes

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
and it's horrible I think that sometimes

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.330 
and it's horrible I think that sometimes
what<00:05:28.110> would<00:05:28.440> be<00:05:28.620> here<00:05:28.830> too

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
what would be here too

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.490 
what would be here too
which<00:05:29.850> would<00:05:30.030> also<00:05:30.210> cause<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.840> burning<00:05:31.260> and

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
which would also cause the burning and

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.190 
which would also cause the burning and
yeah<00:05:32.040> so<00:05:32.700> that's<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.090> euro<00:05:33.300> Brian<00:05:33.660> mansion

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
yeah so that's the euro Brian mansion

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.740 
yeah so that's the euro Brian mansion
