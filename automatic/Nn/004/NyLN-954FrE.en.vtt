there<00:02:32.630> there<00:02:33.230> may<00:02:33.350> be<00:02:33.380> steel<00:02:33.860> back<00:02:34.100> there<00:02:34.280> I

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
there there may be steel back there I

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.100 
there there may be steel back there I
just<00:02:34.400> have<00:02:35.030> been<00:02:35.180> will<00:02:35.270> pick<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.450> up<00:02:35.570> my<00:02:35.750> magnet

just have been will pick it up my magnet

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.870 
just have been will pick it up my magnet
so<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.230> guess<00:02:36.470> it's<00:02:36.650> not<00:02:36.770> there<00:02:37.070> your<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:37.760> of

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
so I guess it's not there your that of

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.790 
so I guess it's not there your that of
the<00:02:37.970> grip<00:02:38.180> forever<00:02:38.510> slightly<00:02:38.900> wider<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.770> I

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
the grip forever slightly wider and I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.530 
the grip forever slightly wider and I
just<00:02:39.980> can't<00:02:40.190> feel<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.990> attraction<00:02:41.990> there<00:02:42.620> but

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
just can't feel the attraction there but

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.140 
just can't feel the attraction there but
