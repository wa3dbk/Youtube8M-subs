00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.539
 a workshop that surprised me enormously 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.039
 Thu 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.339
 used to participate in workshops 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.380
 much more literary given by 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:27.630
 doctors of youth writers and there 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.480
 I was in an environment that was all about 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.390
 I'm different very quickly 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.470
 preview that this workshop brought 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.729
 many years to the participants 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.309
 ghislain leaves a lot of room 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.730
 and while guiding them and making them 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.900
 go 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.330
 maximum 2 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.790
 in the eure in their image of in 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.340
 their imaginary here we did a 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.110
 series of three workshops on three after 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.110
 midi with different themes 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.940
 stalled students may 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.729
 already stalled and we managed through 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:13.590
 these workshops through my work of 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:15.690
 replication the family he thinks that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.450
 I do not work a lot of schools that 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.900
 I think that rap and that I could 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.470
 to end badly because of the elderly my loved ones 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.820
 they like me and that's because they 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.820
 have French realities months 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:41.740
 society they can believe konÃ© 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:48.610
 dangerous rest of the middle or at war 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.610
 and I thought 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.200
 I would like my family my 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.970
 loved ones and society do for me 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.760
 that he support me 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:09.479
 whatever I do they can soften me 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:12.140
 hand when I was from these workshops 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.140
 who came 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.670
 bah workshop 2 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.069
 traditionally yacine 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.790
 because of me 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.549
 brussels there really was a baggy 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.450
 deep on the individuals on their 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.420
 way 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.720
 to see how 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.950
 duty is more than the individual figures 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.780
 are almost a therapy 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.019
 and I am someone serious 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.550
 finally we can teach I was 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:49.650
 nice and I'm at school and I have a 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.720
 future then this workshop allows the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.560
 young people to express themselves 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:00.599
 but for my being here it themselves 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.180
 expresses themselves by being themselves and they are 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.810
 discover and discover themselves over the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.280
 time I would say well the workshop 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:14.250
 himself writing causes an 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.620
 displacement of the positions of the openings 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.560
 I would say subjective position of 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.880
 each speaker or in fact they are 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:27.540
 brought to engage themselves in the art 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.420
 to be the deepest to communicate 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.269
 their feelings the emotions and more 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.709
 particularly particularly 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.530
 problematic young people I'm 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.230
 as part of a service of 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.200
 psychiatry that finally allowed them 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.410
 to move from that position to 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.230
 caregivers or actually to 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.769
 both the nurses who intervened 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:04:03.150
 were put on the same level as in 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:06.420
 hope I answered write it's according to 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.910
 - this workshop brings a particularity 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.470
 of man 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:15.860
 very important is that the place that 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:20.000
 is given to the individual is very very 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:23.620
 important and that very quickly the person 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.370
 from this book I would say a search 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.080
 interior finally an introspection 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.580
 unexpectedly in general I think 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.300
 that it allows him when a crisis of 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.980
 self- confidence 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.289
 sap the chin after each 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.610
 Pope and everyone 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.030
 6 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.460
 but in the search for 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.230
 looking for solutions something 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.110
 which will allow us to exceed its 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.460
 difficulty of burn patients that's it 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.620
 which is interesting is that we are all 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.690
 on account work that every 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.380
 no one has his place 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:02.360
 can think about on itself 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.360
 the instruction and the tail 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.789
 for me write that way to express myself 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:20.979
 to write to me is to say what I 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.499
 can not say to must you do 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.449
 pass a message no longer write 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:28.899
 that's what I'm left for me 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:31.839
 write these beings book for me write 

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:33.759
 it's a pleasure and a cross on me 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:35.860
 write expressed itself tells images and 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.779
 supports what is happening in the world 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.729
 transmit messages talk about this 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.849
 I love what I do not like 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.259
 had to tell my five Chinese write 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.719
 her masters on whatever she follows to 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:49.509
 the interior write all say without embarrassment 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:52.149
 and without fear write with the island just 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:55.449
 with her the one where I express myself in Morocco 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:57.579
 for me to write it's my black therapy 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.619
 for me that will save the lives of bros 

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:01.869
 tell us what we want it to express 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:03.189
 a joy and a room for me to write 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:03.669
 it's a sentence that made some 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.709
 thing 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.839
 to write is a way of expressing oneself and a 

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:11.139
 certain taste of things and write it's 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:13.089
 that their gasoline and diesel is made for 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.020
 me who does not fall back on the rhythm of a 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:15.789
 meeting 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.090
 edit funds for me it's a moment 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.090
 warm
