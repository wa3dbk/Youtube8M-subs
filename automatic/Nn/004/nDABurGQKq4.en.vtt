find and there are a few locations that

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.290 
find and there are a few locations that

things<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.720> want<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.990> talk<00:00:25.170> about<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.529> that

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
things I want to talk about is that

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.099 
things I want to talk about is that
there<00:00:25.980> are<00:00:26.010> no<00:00:26.519> modifications<00:00:27.330> for<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.810> car

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
there are no modifications for this car

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.790 
there are no modifications for this car
specifically<00:00:28.740> um<00:00:29.810> you<00:00:30.810> can't<00:00:31.080> even<00:00:31.289> repair<00:00:31.650> it

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
specifically um you can't even repair it

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.290 
specifically um you can't even repair it
because<00:00:32.009> last<00:00:32.640> time<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.940> i<00:00:33.450> went<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:35.300> auto

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
because last time I i went to a auto

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.299 
because last time I i went to a auto
shop<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.960> says<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.590> car<00:00:37.890> cannot<00:00:38.129> be

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
shop it says that this car cannot be

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.220 
shop it says that this car cannot be
modified<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.790> I'm<00:00:39.300> guessing<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.200> of

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
modified so I'm guessing this is one of

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.660 
modified so I'm guessing this is one of
very<00:00:41.190> few<00:00:41.309> cars<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.420> modified<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
very few cars that can be modified and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.910 
very few cars that can be modified and
going<00:00:44.670> back<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.090> game<00:00:45.379> this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
going back to the game this is one of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.860 
going back to the game this is one of
the<00:00:46.980> few<00:00:47.250> places<00:00:47.550> where<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.120> could<00:00:48.270> find<00:00:48.600> this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the few places where you could find this

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.330 
the few places where you could find this
