DxO OpticsPro 10: Getting Started

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.940
DxO OpticsPro is the most powerful RAW converter available

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.060
offering the best image quality possible,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.500
both as a standalone app,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.060
and through seamless Adobe Lightroom integration.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.120
How does it do this?

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.820
With three specific techniques.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.680
First, DxO OpticsPro optimizes your photos

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.840
with a custom correction

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.820
based on the precise camera and lens combination you’ve used,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.480
compensating for any distortion,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.680
chromatic aberration,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.640
vignetting,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.780
or inherent softness in your lens.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.280
Then using Smart Lighting,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.280
it enhances the dynamic range of your image

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.880
by analyzing the scene and applying unique image-per-image corrections,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.140
revealing details that you may not have even realized were there.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.660
— and it can do this all automatically!

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.080
Finally, if the image exhibits any visible noise,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.840
DxO OpticsPro reduces that noise dramatically

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.360
giving you up to one full stop more than any other software,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.500
making an image shot at, say, 12800 ISO

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.740
look like it was shot at 6400.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.620
Let's take a look.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.100
To open an image directly in DxO OpticsPro,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.200
just navigate to it in the “Organize” tab.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.080
You don’t have to import anything:

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.020
simply point at any image anywhere on your system.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.220
If this is the first time you’re looking at a photo shot with a particular lens or camera,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.520
the software will ask to download the profiles it needs to get started.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.640
First you’ll briefly see your image as it was shot.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.520
But right away you’ll notice a “Correction Preview” dialogue,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.760
and almost immediately your photo will be enhanced.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.700
And you know what?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.480
That’s all you have to do!

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.120
You could save your photo and be done with it now.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.240
But let’s take a closer look to see what’s happening here.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.860
First, let’s compare to the original RAW image,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.380
so we can see exactly what DxO OpticsPro has done.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.060
By pressing the "Compare" button,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.780
you can instantly compare your photo as shot…

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.380
to as corrected.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.020
This is a great way to notice things like lens distortion straightening

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.120
…or in this image: lens vignetting removal

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.260
… or here: enhanced dynamic range with the Smart Lighting feature.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.360
This basic correction is simply a preset —

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.040
but a very smart preset — that’s being applied.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.140
You can apply other presets to your photos as well,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.640
which have been conveniently grouped as General Purpose,

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.100
Portrait and Landscape,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.740
Black and White, and more.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.600
You may have noticed at the top that the first preset is “DxO Standard,”

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.320
which is what’s applied when you first open an image.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.020
Let’s take a look at what the software is actually doing for us.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.380
By selecting "Customize,"

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.420
we can see each and every advanced correction being applied,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.460
along with many others you can apply on your own.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.060
It can be educational to scroll down the list,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.960
disabling each applied effect one at a time,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.560
to see what kind of change it has made,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.160
and enabling corrections that weren’t turned on.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.280
In some cases, simply enabling a correction is enough.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.900
You may not even have to touch a single slider.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.540
One of DxO OpticsPro’s most advanced features

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.900
is the PRIME noise reduction.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.100
PRIME is reserved for those extremely high ISO images,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.460
where noise reduction is a real challenge.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.100
It works so hard at reducing the noise in your photos

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.840
that it can only be previewed in the preview window here,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.100
and only applied to the full image on export.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.460
And if you ever forget what PRIME, or any other correction is in DxO OpticsPro,

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.820
simply click the question mark icon to reveal a built-in help system,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.740
explaining just what each feature is and how to use it.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.660
Let’s look at a couple more corrections.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.420
DxO ClearView is incredible,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.080
improving contrast and sharpness while removing haze from an image.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.940
But even images shot on a perfectly clear day can benefit from this.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.320
DxO Smart Lighting is another extremely powerful tool.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.700
By selecting between slight, medium, and strong presets,

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.900
or just dragging the slider,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.660
you can pull in more and more shadow and highlight detail,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.340
effectively building a high dynamic range image from a single RAW file.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.740
There are nearly 40 different correction settings you can apply to your photos,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.840
each one completely customizable, if you want to.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.140
In fact, if you come up with a combination of corrections you really love,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.080
you can save that as a new preset.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.540
I’ll call this one “HDR-ish, reduced saturation.”

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.800
Once saved, you can apply that preset to any other image from the preset menu.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.900
You can also copy and paste the corrections from one image…

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.240
to another.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.100
The corrections are always intelligent,

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.860
applying each adjustment as needed for that unique photo.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.480
Finally, remember that everything you do in DxO OpticsPro is non-destructive.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.080
At any time you can disable individual corrections,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.260
or revert your image back to how it started, using the "Reset" button.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.780
Once you’re pleased with your image,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.680
you can export or share it in a variety of ways.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.180
You can save a copy to disk at any size or format you like,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.100
send to nearly any application installed, including Apple’s new Photos app,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.620
and even choose what type of file you want to send there.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.200
You can publish directly to Facebook or
Flickr,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.540
and finally if you've arrived here from
Lightroom,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.360
you can send the photo right back.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.500
In fact, let's take a quick look at how
that workflow works.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.240
In Lightroom, select any photo or group of
photos

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.180
and select File &gt; Plug-in Extras &gt; Transfer
to DxO OpticsPro.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.720
This sends the RAW files to OpticsPro where the automatic corrections will be applied.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.460
Once you've made any changes you want

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.300
-- and remember, you may not need to change anything at all --

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.560
send them back by choosing Export
to Lightroom.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.780
You'll be asked to choose your preferred format

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.280
and the images will be loaded right back
into Lightroom.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.320
Once there, you may want to move them into the Collection you were working in,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.180
then continue to edit the photo in Lightroom.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.340
In fact, you could even re-edit the photo and in DxO OpticsPro and send it back to Lightroom again,

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.220
overwriting your previous file,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.680
but maintaining any additional adjustments made in Lightoom.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.740
As you can see, DxO OpticsPro is an incredibly powerful, versatile,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.640
and easy to use RAW decoder.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.780
It can integrate into any workflow

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.640
-- whether you're a working pro looking to
squeeze the last drop of quality out your files,

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.180
or simply a hobbyist who wants to get the
most out of your digital camera.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.720
An advanced Lightroom user,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.840
or someone who prefers to simply
organize your photos in folders.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.620
Give DxO OpticsPro all of your RAW
files,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.720
or only send it the most challenging photos.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.120
That's up to you. But no matter who you
are,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.520
DxO OpticsPro has a home in your toolkit.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.720
