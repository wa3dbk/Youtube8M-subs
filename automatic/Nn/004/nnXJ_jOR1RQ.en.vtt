00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
A big tractor is needed for a deep swamp paddy field.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is a walking tractor with rotary tiller at the back.

00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:19.000
It has a power take off (PTO) to drive the rotary tiller at the back. 

00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:21.971
It has 14 horse power.

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:25.623
We change the wheels to smaller size.

00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:28.488
As the tractor is lowered down, it gains more flexibility.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
With larger wheels, the turnaround is wider and it is more difficult for a driver to control.

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:43.000
The rotary speed cannot match with the moving speed of the large wheels.  Therefore, the rotary does not break the soils to smaller crumbs as needed.

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.007
The rotary size is 1 meter.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.389
Here is a driving seat.  It is not too high and more comfortable.

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:02.934
Three forward gears.

00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:08.254
This handle is for PTO turn on.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.320
Put on a forward gear and clutch.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.668
With smaller wheels, it is easier to make a turn and has better performance.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.554
The speeds of tractor and rotary are better matched resulting in better soil cultivation. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This tractor with rotary tiller is good for both dry soil and wet soil.
