00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
my name is Zack Shelby I'm from the IOT

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.339 
my name is Zack Shelby I'm from the IOT
team<00:00:08.280> here<00:00:08.639> arm<00:00:08.910> I'd<00:00:09.630> only<00:00:09.840> provide

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
team here arm I'd only provide

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.560 
team here arm I'd only provide
technology<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:11.400> computing<00:00:12.059> all<00:00:12.240> kinds<00:00:12.509> of

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
technology for computing all kinds of

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.829 
technology for computing all kinds of
computers<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.340> we<00:00:14.340> brought<00:00:14.549> along<00:00:14.839> examples

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
computers and we brought along examples

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.380 
computers and we brought along examples
of<00:00:15.960> how<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.170> use<00:00:16.529> no<00:00:17.190> power<00:00:17.460> microcontrollers

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
of how we use no power microcontrollers

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.830 
of how we use no power microcontrollers
and<00:00:18.680> software<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.920> IOT<00:00:20.369> create<00:00:21.270> cool<00:00:21.570> stuff

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
and software for IOT create cool stuff

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.970 
and software for IOT create cool stuff
so<00:00:22.650> what<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.279> now<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.910> a

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
so what we have here now is a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.800 
so what we have here now is a
internet-connected<00:00:26.090> Nespresso<00:00:27.090> coffee<00:00:27.390> mr.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
internet-connected Nespresso coffee mr.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.300 
internet-connected Nespresso coffee mr.
we're<00:00:28.080> doing<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.349> couple<00:00:28.710> things<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.160> think

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
we're doing a couple things we think

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.060 
we're doing a couple things we think
that<00:00:29.429> not<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.390> ordering<00:00:31.050> experience<00:00:31.859> should

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
that not the ordering experience should

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.500 
that not the ordering experience should
be<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> lot<00:00:32.460> smoother<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.210> we've<00:00:33.360> actually

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
be a lot smoother so we've actually

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.889 
be a lot smoother so we've actually
built<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.670> capsule<00:00:35.670> detection<00:00:36.239> technology

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
built a capsule detection technology

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.040 
built a capsule detection technology
using<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.770> small<00:00:37.980> microphone<00:00:38.540> and<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.570> n<00:00:39.809> bed

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
using a small microphone and the n bed

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.380 
using a small microphone and the n bed
chakra<00:00:40.530> ecosystem<00:00:41.280> software<00:00:41.879> platform

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
chakra ecosystem software platform

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.049 
chakra ecosystem software platform
inside<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.160> detect<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.820> kinda

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
inside so we can detect what kinda

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.700 
inside so we can detect what kinda
nespresso<00:00:45.450> capsules<00:00:45.750> people<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.500> drinking

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
nespresso capsules people are drinking

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.279 
nespresso capsules people are drinking
and<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.610> send<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> live<00:00:48.329> web<00:00:48.600> service<00:00:49.050> so

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and we send it to a live web service so

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.500 
and we send it to a live web service so
you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.070> track<00:00:50.280> how<00:00:50.610> much<00:00:50.789> your<00:00:51.000> office<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
you can track how much your office is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.180 
you can track how much your office is
consuming<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:52.739> automatic

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
consuming and then you can do automatic

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.279 
consuming and then you can do automatic
orders<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.699> here<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> porter<00:00:54.690> more<00:00:54.840> coffee<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
orders in here a porter more coffee to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.260 
orders in here a porter more coffee to
the<00:00:55.320> office<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.710> several<00:00:56.340> more<00:00:56.730> without

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the office for several more without

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.029 
the office for several more without
having<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.750> anything<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.530> actually<00:00:58.680> do

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
having to do anything so we actually do

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.579 
having to do anything so we actually do
light<00:00:59.940> detectors<00:01:00.510> who<00:01:00.719> are<00:01:00.809> detecting<00:01:02.210> we're

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
light detectors who are detecting we're

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.640 
light detectors who are detecting we're
using<00:01:04.589> lights<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.369> create<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:07.320> back

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
using lights to create the what back

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.899 
using lights to create the what back
color<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.060> detect<00:01:09.390> colors<00:01:09.799> we<00:01:10.799> also<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
color that we detect colors we also do a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.740 
color that we detect colors we also do a
lot<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:13.010> LED<00:01:14.010> light<00:01:14.369> control<00:01:14.939> using<00:01:15.390> huge<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
lot with LED light control using huge is

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.810 
lot with LED light control using huge is
low<00:01:15.869> energies<00:01:16.290> because<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
low energies because I'm actually have a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.249 
low energies because I'm actually have a
a<00:01:18.330> sign<00:01:19.110> where<00:01:19.500> we've<00:01:19.650> embedded<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.280> LED<00:01:21.270> lights

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
a sign where we've embedded I LED lights

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
a sign where we've embedded I LED lights
with<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> ble<00:01:23.340> controller<00:01:23.820> running<00:01:24.270> embed

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
with a ble controller running embed

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
with a ble controller running embed
software<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.619> actually<00:01:25.920> from<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.159> phone

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
software so actually from a phone

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.310 
software so actually from a phone
application<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.390> go<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.780> control<00:01:28.140> your

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
application you can go and control your

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
application you can go and control your
alley

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
alley

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.069 
alley
yeah<00:01:30.340> so<00:01:30.549> we<00:01:30.670> actually<00:01:30.820> connected<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.840> your

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
yeah so we actually connected to your

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.990 
yeah so we actually connected to your
systems<00:01:32.500> together<00:01:32.680> so<00:01:33.159> when<00:01:33.280> we<00:01:33.430> detect<00:01:33.790> the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
systems together so when we detect the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.060 
systems together so when we detect the
color<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.360> let's<00:01:34.720> say<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:34.899> Roma<00:01:35.350> capsule<00:01:35.890> which

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
color of let's say a Roma capsule which

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.850 
color of let's say a Roma capsule which
is<00:01:36.250> like<00:01:36.399> a<00:01:36.430> dark<00:01:36.729> gray<00:01:37.030> we<00:01:37.990> can<00:01:38.229> project<00:01:38.560> the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
is like a dark gray we can project the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.800 
is like a dark gray we can project the
same<00:01:39.070> light<00:01:39.340> into<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.670> side<00:01:39.939> just<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.630> fun

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
same light into the side just a fun

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.139 
same light into the side just a fun
effect<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:42.159> we<00:01:42.250> actually<00:01:42.399> did<00:01:42.759> this<00:01:42.880> project

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
effect so we actually did this project

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.469 
effect so we actually did this project
was<00:01:43.479> our<00:01:43.600> arm<00:01:44.250> hacker<00:01:45.250> team<00:01:45.640> inside<00:01:46.360> the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
was our arm hacker team inside the

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.240 
was our arm hacker team inside the
company<00:01:46.840> that's<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> oak<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.679> reason<00:01:48.130> we

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
company that's the oak and the reason we

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.219 
company that's the oak and the reason we
did<00:01:48.429> it<00:01:48.520> was<00:01:48.670> actually<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.299> try<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.659> learn<00:01:49.929> how

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
did it was actually to try to learn how

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.160 
did it was actually to try to learn how
hard<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.950> is<00:01:51.039> to<00:01:51.250> create<00:01:51.610> a<00:01:51.720> product<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:53.020> whole

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
hard it is to create a product the whole

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.319 
hard it is to create a product the whole
system<00:01:53.710> is<00:01:53.920> what<00:01:54.490> we<00:01:54.610> found<00:01:54.820> out<00:01:55.030> there's<00:01:55.270> a

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
system is what we found out there's a

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.060 
system is what we found out there's a
lot<00:01:55.539> of<00:01:55.570> us<00:01:55.960> is<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.170> software<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.649> have<00:01:56.770> to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
lot of us is the software you have to

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.700 
lot of us is the software you have to
create<00:01:57.280> it's<00:01:57.939> actually<00:01:58.329> a<00:01:58.360> lot<00:01:58.539> of<00:01:58.659> work<00:01:58.810> so

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
create it's actually a lot of work so

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.499 
create it's actually a lot of work so
we're<00:01:59.950> taking<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.490> knowledge<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.179> building

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
we're taking that knowledge and building

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.260 
we're taking that knowledge and building
a<00:02:01.569> lot<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.899> that<00:02:02.080> into<00:02:02.770> our<00:02:02.799> software<00:02:03.340> projects

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
a lot of that into our software projects
