00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.900 
area and hasn't created a single chance
so<00:03:44.769> Moreno<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:45.250> definitely<00:03:45.700> a<00:03:45.730> good<00:03:45.880> option

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
so Moreno is definitely a good option

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.970 
so Moreno is definitely a good option
for<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.450> double<00:03:46.660> gameweek<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:47.620> can<00:03:47.799> see

for the double gameweek and I can see
him<00:03:48.099> doing<00:03:48.280> well<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.930> now<00:03:50.169> let's<00:03:50.380> take<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.620> look

recently returned from injury and he

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.450 
recently returned from injury and he
would<00:04:25.900> rotate<00:04:26.050> well<00:04:26.440> with<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.800> matt

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
would rotate well with the and matt

from<00:04:27.669> Newcastle<00:04:28.389> in<00:04:29.050> midfield<00:04:29.350> I'm<00:04:29.919> fairly

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
from Newcastle in midfield I'm fairly

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.850 
from Newcastle in midfield I'm fairly
settled<00:04:31.000> with<00:04:31.270> hazard<00:04:31.720> Fabregas<00:04:32.319> sterling

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
settled with hazard Fabregas sterling

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.760 
settled with hazard Fabregas sterling
Henderson<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.610> Cambiasso<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.449> am<00:04:35.199> good<00:04:35.470> at<00:04:35.740> I

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
Henderson and Cambiasso I am good at I

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.129 
Henderson and Cambiasso I am good at I
can't<00:04:35.830> fit<00:04:36.190> in<00:04:36.280> coutinho<00:04:36.789> he's<00:04:37.479> in<00:04:37.630> great<00:04:37.900> form

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
can't fit in coutinho he's in great form

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.330 
can't fit in coutinho he's in great form
of<00:04:38.259> the<00:04:38.349> minute<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.740> really<00:04:39.009> think<00:04:39.130> he'll

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
of the minute and I really think he'll

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.550 
of the minute and I really think he'll
do<00:04:39.520> well<00:04:39.729> but<00:04:40.300> Henderson<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.080> ceiling<00:04:41.380> are

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
do well but Henderson and ceiling are

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.469 
do well but Henderson and ceiling are
also<00:04:41.770> good<00:04:42.099> options<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.669> have<00:04:43.210> higher

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
also good options and have higher

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.140 
also good options and have higher
ownership<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.259> my<00:04:45.009> dilemma<00:04:45.400> up<00:04:45.610> front<00:04:45.940> is

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
ownership and my dilemma up front is

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.240 
ownership and my dilemma up front is
whether<00:04:46.599> to<00:04:46.690> play<00:04:47.080> Aguero<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.740> Cain<00:04:47.979> with

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
whether to play Aguero and Cain with

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.059 
whether to play Aguero and Cain with
Giroux<00:04:49.030> on<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.360> bench<00:04:49.599> to<00:04:49.990> save<00:04:50.680> using<00:04:50.919> a

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
Giroux on the bench to save using a

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.309 
Giroux on the bench to save using a
transfer<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.520> bring<00:04:51.849> him<00:04:52.000> in<00:04:52.120> later<00:04:52.270> on<00:04:52.569> or

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
transfer to bring him in later on or

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.559 
transfer to bring him in later on or
whether<00:04:54.069> body<00:04:54.639> will<00:04:54.910> be<00:04:55.000> worth<00:04:55.150> getting<00:04:55.300> in

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
whether body will be worth getting in

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.390 
whether body will be worth getting in
and<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:56.380> would<00:04:56.500> mean<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:56.650> Cain<00:04:57.009> would<00:04:57.190> move

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
and that would mean that Cain would move

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.820 
and that would mean that Cain would move
to<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.639> bench<00:04:57.960> so<00:04:58.960> I'm<00:04:59.050> looking<00:04:59.259> at<00:04:59.500> around

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
to the bench so I'm looking at around

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.040 
to the bench so I'm looking at around
nine<00:05:00.130> or<00:05:00.160> ten<00:05:00.490> double<00:05:00.820> game<00:05:00.970> weakest<00:05:01.330> which

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
nine or ten double game weakest which

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.499 
nine or ten double game weakest which
certainly<00:05:02.500> looks<00:05:02.710> good<00:05:02.919> on<00:05:03.009> paper<00:05:03.419> for<00:05:04.419> my

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
certainly looks good on paper for my

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.719 
certainly looks good on paper for my
captain<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.199> think<00:05:06.009> you'd<00:05:06.160> have<00:05:06.220> to<00:05:06.370> be<00:05:06.400> brave

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
captain I think you'd have to be brave

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.430 
captain I think you'd have to be brave
to<00:05:06.789> go<00:05:07.150> against<00:05:07.539> house<00:05:07.690> all<00:05:07.900> this<00:05:08.050> game<00:05:08.229> week

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
to go against house all this game week

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.650 
to go against house all this game week
he's<00:05:09.220> in<00:05:09.430> form<00:05:09.699> he's<00:05:10.000> having<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.330> fairly

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
he's in form he's having a fairly

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.749 
he's in form he's having a fairly
consistent<00:05:11.199> season<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:12.099> he<00:05:12.310> has<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.520> double

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
consistent season and he has a double

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.820 
consistent season and he has a double
gameweek<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:14.080> he'll<00:05:14.289> definitely<00:05:14.500> be<00:05:14.710> getting

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
gameweek so he'll definitely be getting

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.699 
gameweek so he'll definitely be getting
the<00:05:15.039> armband<00:05:15.400> for<00:05:15.460> me
