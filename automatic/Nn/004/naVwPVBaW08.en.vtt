00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.330 
shocked when I came here I was thinking
all<00:03:35.930> about<00:03:36.110> just<00:03:36.350> giving<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:36.680> style<00:03:37.010> and

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
all about just giving it style and

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.400 
all about just giving it style and
attitude<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.330> stuff<00:03:38.510> like<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.900> but<00:03:39.049> there's

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
attitude and stuff like that but there's

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.070 
attitude and stuff like that but there's
so<00:03:39.620> much<00:03:40.180> technique<00:03:41.180> involved<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.840> wasn't

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
so much technique involved that I wasn't

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.140 
so much technique involved that I wasn't
even<00:03:42.290> aware<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.799> we<00:03:43.160> got<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.489> range<00:03:43.790> it's

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
even aware of we got that range it's

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.180 
even aware of we got that range it's
like<00:03:44.330> with<00:03:44.570> all<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.900> all<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.500> styles<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.070> we

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
like with all the all the styles that we

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.670 
like with all the all the styles that we
do<00:03:46.310> we've<00:03:46.880> there<00:03:47.390> is<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.540> perfect<00:03:48.079> teacher<00:03:48.260> for

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
do we've there is a perfect teacher for

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.890 
do we've there is a perfect teacher for
each<00:03:48.709> style<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.700> made<00:03:50.000> me<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.239> completely

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
each style it made me a completely

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.930 
each style it made me a completely
different<00:03:51.049> dancer<00:03:51.650> yeah<00:03:51.950> my<00:03:52.400> technique<00:03:52.880> was

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
different dancer yeah my technique was

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.490 
different dancer yeah my technique was
pretty<00:03:53.269> sloppy<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.750> must<00:03:54.019> have<00:03:54.170> been<00:03:54.290> when<00:03:54.440> I

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
pretty sloppy I must have been when I

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.420 
pretty sloppy I must have been when I
first<00:03:54.769> came<00:03:55.010> here<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:55.519> then<00:03:56.530> now<00:03:57.530> because

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
first came here and then now because

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.180 
first came here and then now because
they<00:03:58.640> focus<00:03:59.120> on<00:03:59.209> it<00:03:59.360> so<00:03:59.540> much<00:03:59.780> yeah<00:04:00.049> I'm<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:00.920> much

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
they focus on it so much yeah I'm a much

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.650 
they focus on it so much yeah I'm a much
better<00:04:01.220> technical<00:04:01.880> dancer<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:02.570> that

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
better technical dancer and that

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.210 
better technical dancer and that
reflects<00:04:03.110> everything<00:04:03.350> else<00:04:03.620> like<00:04:03.920> if<00:04:04.100> I'm

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
reflects everything else like if I'm

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.699 
reflects everything else like if I'm
better<00:04:04.400> technically<00:04:04.910> in<00:04:05.000> ballet<00:04:05.209> then<00:04:05.870> I'll

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
better technically in ballet then I'll

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.500 
better technically in ballet then I'll
be<00:04:06.860> better<00:04:07.040> in<00:04:07.280> jars<00:04:07.549> and<00:04:07.820> contemporary<00:04:08.420> and

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
be better in jars and contemporary and

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.789 
be better in jars and contemporary and
chop<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:08.900> everything<00:04:09.200> else<00:04:09.380> it's<00:04:09.560> all<00:04:09.650> about

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
chop and everything else it's all about

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.470 
chop and everything else it's all about
arm<00:04:10.040> alignments<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.790> how<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:10.970> hold<00:04:11.209> yourself

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
arm alignments and how you hold yourself

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.560 
arm alignments and how you hold yourself
and<00:04:11.930> then<00:04:12.019> that<00:04:12.260> affects<00:04:12.500> everything<00:04:12.799> else<00:04:13.010> I

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
and then that affects everything else I

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.909 
and then that affects everything else I
feel<00:04:14.570> like<00:04:14.750> we're<00:04:14.989> very<00:04:15.019> lucky<00:04:15.410> here<00:04:15.769> at

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
feel like we're very lucky here at

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:16.539 
feel like we're very lucky here at
Northern

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
Northern

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.719 
Northern
have<00:04:16.669> our<00:04:17.090> in<00:04:17.389> theater<00:04:17.930> because<00:04:18.769> it's<00:04:19.549> not

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
something every school's got I think

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.180 
something every school's got I think
it's<00:04:21.889> really<00:04:22.250> really<00:04:22.400> important<00:04:23.139> yeah<00:04:24.190> even

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
it's really really important yeah even

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.529 
it's really really important yeah even
if<00:04:25.280> it's<00:04:25.430> just<00:04:25.639> having<00:04:25.819> lessons<00:04:26.120> on<00:04:26.389> that

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
stage it's it's a bit the feeling is a

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.980 
stage it's it's a bit the feeling is a
bit<00:04:28.759> like<00:04:28.940> okay<00:04:29.270> I'm<00:04:29.389> I'm<00:04:29.930> trying<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:31.990> project

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
bit like okay I'm I'm trying to project

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.839 
bit like okay I'm I'm trying to project
something<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:33.949> audience<00:04:34.280> even<00:04:34.400> though<00:04:34.580> no

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
the stage it kind of helps you project

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.140 
the stage it kind of helps you project
out<00:04:39.080> as<00:04:39.259> well<00:04:39.470> like<00:04:39.740> if<00:04:40.340> we're<00:04:40.729> injured<00:04:41.030> if

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
out as well like if we're injured if

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.490 
out as well like if we're injured if
we're<00:04:41.300> in<00:04:41.360> a<00:04:41.419> jazz<00:04:41.629> class<00:04:41.930> then<00:04:42.139> he'll<00:04:42.289> say

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
we're in a jazz class then he'll say

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.619 
we're in a jazz class then he'll say
perform<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.460> as<00:04:43.550> if<00:04:43.699> there's<00:04:43.849> an<00:04:43.940> audience<00:04:44.240> and

perform it as if there's an audience and
then<00:04:44.690> that<00:04:44.870> kind<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.229> gets<00:04:45.470> as<00:04:45.620> used<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:46.039> using

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
then that kind of gets as used to using

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.439 
then that kind of gets as used to using
that<00:04:46.699> kind<00:04:46.940> of<00:04:47.000> energy

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
that kind of energy

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:48.670 
that kind of energy
we've<00:04:47.750> got<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:47.990> mirrors<00:04:48.259> which<00:04:48.409> are<00:04:48.500> great

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
we've got the mirrors which are great
