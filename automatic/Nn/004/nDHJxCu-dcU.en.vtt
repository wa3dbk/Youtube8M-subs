 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.700
 new video of me in today 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.950
 video I often become a little again 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.830
 do it yourself show and that's it 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:17.160
 to cover a patchwork and I will 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.690
 thanks a lot soon and i have aunt 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.720
 I thought what is a nice gift 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.910
 for somebody actually of all 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.560
 baby clothes and such things already 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.779
 and I thought one 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.640
 homemade patchwork blanket is one 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.740
 good memory and hopefully one 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.559
 good companion for the first years of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 babys, that's why I would say if 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.100
 you want to see me like this 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.309
 patchwork made 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.879
 that's what it looks like then yes, it just stays that way 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.020
 turn and enjoy my little guide 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.750
 the first thing I will do is mine 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.700
 Volume flows spread the s 1 cm 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.289
 Thick I bought in the fog may 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.030
 as well as my fabrics I'm mine 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.120
 right now search and think about something 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.289
 I would like to have 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.210
 next, I'll do exactly one 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.949
 plan how big should my blanket be like 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.489
 my quads should be big 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.840
 including cut and I have myself 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.670
 415 decided on 15 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.330
 Accordingly, I have my rectangle 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.030
 made 15 on 16 times 16 so I 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.200
 each have always cut 1 cm and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.860
 then it is already on the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.860
 cut out 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.020
 For this I put my square on and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.580
 use a carpet knife a cutter her 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.500
 Of course you can also get a fabric 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.540
 use a tailor or a whole 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.430
 normal scissors how to do that in the next 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.490
 step sees right here that 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.860
 click on my fabric first to remove 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.740
 a straight line that I then come with 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.479
 simple scissors follow with me 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.790
 sure that my line can go too 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.619
 right now because you have to definitely 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.270
 working accurately at a patchwork 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.479
 do not cover it up in the end 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.399
 looks like if i have my quads 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.170
 cut out h or mine 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.509
 then I put them on the squares 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.130
 ground and just look which one 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.700
 Patterns should be placed next to which 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.979
 become 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.479
 and what kind of mood would you like? 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.939
 I should rather have her in this blanket 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.569
 restless or should the patterns be 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.129
 just run straight from there 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.950
 I put her down a bit and look 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.060
 as I like it best 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.890
 in the next step it goes to the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.380
 sew together and I'll take those 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.310
 First row away and put the fabric 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.620
 each pattern on pattern so you want 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.230
 Definitely to see that you the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.640
 sewing right times together because that 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.170
 Whole apart is more 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.569
 pretty annoying from there always 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:39.959
 pattern on pattern and then not that 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:42.060
 here also already firmly together here 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.069
 you see that both parts are fixed 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.590
 sewn i take my next one 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.310
 square and lay here also pattern 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.310
 on pattern 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.220
 I already finished two rows here 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.020
 sewn and put here now even the 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.750
 first row on the second row and 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.970
 also pattern on things has to look 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.820
 just that the stitching of the individual 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.100
 squares are well over each other with it 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.650
 since not already tried somehow wrong 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.750
 to go but really every one 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.040
 seam is on top of each other and the whole thing is very 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.040
 looks accurate 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.710
 as with the individual rectangles 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.050
 I sew here so my single 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.760
 rail together 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.700
 Here you see, I have all the tracks 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.320
 sewn together with rectangles 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.030
 and now start all tracks 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.700
 still look to sew together 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.410
 Once everything is right and here 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.780
 I already finished sewing and 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.520
 Iron the whole thing over again 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.770
 now come the next steps with the 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.900
 volume fleece and of course you want 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.790
 make sure that says that the substance 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.120
 really straight it does not iron wrinkles 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.220
 raises 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.970
 and you all the accurate on the 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.190
 giving up volume could be important 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.990
 is now the individual squares 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.110
 stake out so you do not 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.210
 somewhere a stupid fold rheinmetall so 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.520
 you need pins here, there are 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.320
 also needed and you put it 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.120
 just i have them on every square 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.680
 infected so I'm really sure 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.090
 I'm not wrinkling anything 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.609
 but you can do that too 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.740
 just not every single square off 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.540
 that means I go around once completely 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.760
 Of course I do not go around the square 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.530
 but first all squares of 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.480
 top down and then from right to 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.669
 Slimming left here you can see that too 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.410
 the volume is now flowing on the volume 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.000
 clearly settle squares 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.440
 that is what the patchwork of the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.900
 children really down makes these 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.210
 upholstered squares and now comes too 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.160
 already the step with the rear fabric 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.990
 I want my blanket, of course 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.310
 back does not flow the blood shows 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.050
 but also a nice one 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.330
 jean have white for this 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.210
 I decided to spread the blanket now 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.760
 quite exactly on my job 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.770
 and do not put it here either 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.590
 at each square but approximately at 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.660
 every corner 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.340
 Now I go with the sewing machine again 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.800
 through and connect all three, so to speak 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.050
 My top patchwork lay my 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.110
 mean volume flows and mine 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.970
 lower cotton layer and if i use it 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.550
 I'm done then I cut that 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.470
 remaining volume flows off so that the 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.330
 whole has a straight edge and now 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.040
 already comes the next step 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.540
 Here I will once I have it 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.000
 created with a geodesic triangle with 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.910
 4 cm border so to speak once around the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.550
 beauties odor 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:37.010
 that has the effect that I now the 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.840
 the rest of the border, so to speak, twice 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.330
 I can bend here I have four cm 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.840
 cut off that I could now on 2 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:48.140
 cm and then again on another 2 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.730
 centimeters now on the blanket on it 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.320
 I just give you one 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.420
 straight edge one sees then from the outside 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.300
 not the three layers, so to speak 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.950
 but simply the cross-cutting material 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.510
 from below and all I have to do now 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:05.210
 Of course stake out again 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:06.710
 So I really do not slip 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.020
 I would recommend the corners too 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.330
 already set out even if you still have 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.680
 not only later with it 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.360
 afterwards not in distress comes again 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.040
 to have to do something but 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.650
 the blankets are also already staked out 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:22.550
 I have the technology and the whole I sew 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.650
 then now once along the line 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.610
 why complete and then I'll take care of it 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.770
 after that again a cent around the corners 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.450
 and you have the finished result 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.460
 took me a few days because of that 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.260
 I always have something different 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.340
 but I am that is a beautiful 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.170
 become profit 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.450
 she looks very fine since it is one 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.640
 Of course girls will be pink and a lot 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.200
 we flowers and playful drinne and 

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.060
 I am very satisfied with the result 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.610
 and of course hope that it is you 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.590
 just like me and you guys 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:56.090
 perhaps trying for once to 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:58.580
 So to make love to her that was a 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.890
 instructions for mahle patchwork blanket me 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.790
 Hope you liked the tutorial and 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:06.880
 you could do something with it 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:08.920
 how to cover such a yes 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.640
 quite complicated for newbies like 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.190
 I think 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.380
 How to get there and you can

 if he can handle it 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.060
 and whether we might further line 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.360
 I wish I read from therefore 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.490
 I would just be happy and we would 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.620
 See the many available
