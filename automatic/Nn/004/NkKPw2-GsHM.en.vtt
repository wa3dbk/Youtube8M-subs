00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
from the last gen which you can scratch

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.150 
from the last gen which you can scratch
just<00:00:18.240> by<00:00:18.420> looking<00:00:18.750> at<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.529> not<00:00:19.740> perfect

just by looking at it it's not perfect

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.740 
just by looking at it it's not perfect
however<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.850> camera<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.240> slightly<00:00:21.330> raised
