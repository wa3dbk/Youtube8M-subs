walls and she keeping the door a couple
of<00:02:01.469> times<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.189> was<00:02:03.060> looking<00:02:03.210> for<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> way<00:02:03.780> that

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
of times so I was looking for a way that

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.490 
of times so I was looking for a way that
I<00:02:04.229> could<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:05.430> monitors<00:02:06.060> but<00:02:06.540> obviously<00:02:07.380> I

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
I could have monitors but obviously I

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.949 
I could have monitors but obviously I
couldn't<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:08.420> justify<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
couldn't really justify have the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.360 
couldn't really justify have the
speakers<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.709> house<00:02:10.830> cause<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.129> thought<00:02:11.220> to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
speakers on the house cause I thought to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.430 
speakers on the house cause I thought to
keep<00:02:11.550> them<00:02:11.670> down<00:02:12.270> till

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
keep them down till

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.570 
keep them down till
up<00:02:13.590> until<00:02:14.720> about<00:02:15.720> these<00:02:16.260> four<00:02:16.980> wasn't<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.400> a

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
up until about these four wasn't up a

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.090 
up until about these four wasn't up a
French<00:02:17.820> studio<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.480> was<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.870> using<00:02:19.020> ma<00:02:19.350> Sony

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
French studio I was just using ma Sony

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.630 
French studio I was just using ma Sony
stereo<00:02:21.020> just<00:02:22.020> an<00:02:22.350> old<00:02:22.530> Sony<00:02:22.800> standing<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.430> God

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
stereo just an old Sony standing of God

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.110 
stereo just an old Sony standing of God
itself<00:02:23.940> with<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:26.280> speaker's<00:02:26.670> order

itself with a the speaker's order

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.060 
itself with a the speaker's order
so<00:02:27.930> obviously<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.860> speaker's<00:02:30.080> not<00:02:31.080> using<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
so obviously the speaker's not using the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.580 
so obviously the speaker's not using the
pin<00:02:32.400> set<00:02:32.700> up<00:02:32.790> by<00:02:33.030> Sony<00:02:33.450> leaf<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.140> fact<00:02:34.380> they
