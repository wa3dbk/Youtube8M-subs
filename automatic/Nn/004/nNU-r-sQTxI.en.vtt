00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.620
Hey, guys, I'm Rob Riches.
You're watching ProzisTV

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.620
and you're here in my kitchen.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.700
I'm about to head off
and do my morning cardio for the day.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.400
So, I thought now would be the perfect time 
to break down my actual supplement routine.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.509
I see a lot of questions from you guys
on the videos and on social media

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.040
asking me what supplements I take
and when, around cardio and weight training.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.900
This can make a difference,
especially if you're getting super lean,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.960
getting ready for competition or a photoshoot,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.232
and the supplementation, whilst they may only give you
an extra one or two percent,

00:00:54.232 --> 00:00:58.900
can really make a difference if you're putting your all
in with the training, in with the nutrition

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:03.800
and supplementation is just that,
they supplement the rest of your diet and training.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.280
So, let's break this down into two main training areas.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.100
We've got cardio and weight training.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.387
Now, cardio, certainly for my primary goal is,
I do cardio to trying burn the body fat,

00:01:16.387 --> 00:01:21.767
to bring about that conditioning that we see 
in the magazines, on the stage with the competition.

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:23.847
So, cardio, it's all about fat burning.

00:01:23.847 --> 00:01:25.840
And there's a couple of things I use for that.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.440
I always got my shaker cup with me
and, in that, I have these compartments.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.000
So the first thing I do when I wake up 
in the morning is two supplements I take.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.140
We have Acetyl-L-Carnitine and CLA.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.640
Conjugated Linoleic Acid
and Acetyl-L-Carnitine, otherwise known as ALCAR.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.578
These two different supplements 
really do pair well together, because...

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.400
CLA, and I take about 1,000 mg,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.020
these actually help metabolize stored body fat,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.320
they help break down our body fat,
which is nothing more than energy,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.675
stored energy into droplets, lipids, if you like,
and then get this burst into the bloodstream.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.780
So, why's that really good?

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.180
Well, first of all, this allows our body to take some of 
that body fat and make it available as a fuel source.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.380
This is where the ALCAR, 
or Acetyl-L-Carnitine comes in.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.720
This is fantastic as a transporter or a carrier.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.640
Basically, it latches onto those fat lipids 
and carries them into the mitochondria,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.980
the power cell of the muscle cells.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.220
It can be said that the Acetyl-L-Carnitine
can keep you doing the cardio longer and faster.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.400
And for me, I like to vary
between high-intensity interval training,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.920
20 minutes on the rowing machine

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.280
or on the bike, or an inclined treadmill.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.260
And other days, something much less intense

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:04.279
on a regular upright bike, inclined treadmill,
 walking at a fast pace, for about 45 minutes to an hour.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.480
I'm really changing up my cardio every other workout,
and these supplements stay the same.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.220
So, 1,000 mg of CLA, Tonalin if you can,
it's a much better quality CLA.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.140
And Acetyl-L-Carnitine, 1,000 mg.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.080
Also with that, I add some R-Lipoic Acid, about 150 mg.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.320
You can use ALA, but I like to use R-Lipoic Acid, 
again, it's a much higher quality form of ALA.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.888
Moving on, there's two other supplements that I take
before heading out and doing my cardio.

00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:39.162
And these don't necessarily help burn body fat,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.500
but they support lean muscle mass.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.600
These are Glutamine, I'm going to make one now.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.960
It's about 2 grams we need.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.060
It's considered a non-essential amino acid,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.740
but it is one of the largest amino acid pools
that gets depleted within our body.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.320
So, we're going to include that in the morning.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.606
And then, this is just BCAA,
Branched-Chained Amino Acids.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.460
I prefer to have one that has a high leucine content,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.500
so this one actually has a 8:1 ratio.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.060
Leucine is probably the most critical,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.120
the most important
of all branched-chained amino acids.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.880
So, BCAAs, Glutamine.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.900
So again, that's basically fuel for my muscles.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.200
I know a lot of you guys,
and me as well when I started out training,

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.652
we're always concerned about losing muscle mass.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.000
I've done shows for the past ten years,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.871
I've always preferred to do cardio
without eating anything.

00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:43.387
Therefore, fasted cardio.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.720
With the exception of amino acids
for a kind of fuel for my muscles.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.364
But I don't eat any calories
and I haven't lost any muscle mass over the years.

00:04:53.364 --> 00:04:57.200
So, that's been key for me 
in helping me chisel my physique

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.592
and really burn the body fat in the morning
without sacrificing muscle.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.640
But, the Glutamine and BCAAs I do find help.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.880
and essential building blocks for my body
in the morning.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.113
So make sure you get them in your diet first thing.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.400
All right, guys, that wraps our part 1
of our supplements special.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.014
