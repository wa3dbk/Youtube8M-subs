the<00:00:08.350> unit<00:00:08.800> wouldn't<00:00:09.250> cool<00:00:10.080> spray<00:00:11.080> the<00:00:11.259> year

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
the unit wouldn't cool spray the year

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:22.080 
the unit wouldn't cool spray the year
and<00:00:14.790> come<00:00:15.790> up<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:19.630> didn't<00:00:19.900> have<00:00:19.930> any

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
and come up we didn't have any

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.340 
and come up we didn't have any
temperature<00:00:22.930> on<00:00:23.080> that<00:00:23.110> oil<00:00:23.940> put<00:00:24.940> a<00:00:24.970> new<00:00:25.120> oil

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
temperature on that oil put a new oil

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.010 
temperature on that oil put a new oil
heater<00:00:26.350> in<00:00:26.590> it

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
heater in it

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.650

we're<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> trip<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.949> oil<00:00:29.190> safety<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.090> drift<00:00:30.450> off

we're a trip of oil safety and drift off

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.000 
we're a trip of oil safety and drift off
and<00:00:30.690> state<00:00:31.200> off<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.860> it<00:00:32.309> was<00:00:32.400> really<00:00:32.579> set

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
and state off so it was really set

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.710 
and state off so it was really set
because<00:00:34.790> all<00:00:35.690> that<00:00:35.840> refrigerant<00:00:36.470> has<00:00:36.590> been

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
because all that refrigerant has been

couple years ago I come upon this system

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.980 
couple years ago I come upon this system
that<00:02:44.300> had<00:02:44.480> been<00:02:44.750> clean<00:02:45.050> for<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.440> long<00:02:45.680> time<00:02:46.990> it

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:59.440 
that had been clean for a long time it
was<00:02:48.050> just<00:02:48.140> filthy<00:02:48.770> in<00:02:48.920> between<00:02:49.250> those<00:02:49.430> soil

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.020 

notice<00:03:00.110> their<00:03:00.260> head<00:03:00.380> pressures<00:03:00.890> about<00:03:01.130> 116

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
notice their head pressures about 116

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.319 

he's<00:03:10.010> liquid<00:03:10.340> wine<00:03:10.519> temperature<00:03:10.999> and<00:03:11.269> our
