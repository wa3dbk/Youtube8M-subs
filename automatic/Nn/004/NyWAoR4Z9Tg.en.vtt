00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello friends with you again divanich 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.970
 I just managed to save about 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.110
 it is to 15 thousand rubles of the family budget 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.570
 and I want to share with you how so u 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.279
 I got 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.090
 pay attention here this is ours 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.869
 old washing machine indesit w and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.289
 etc. 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.949
 82 cars of this already commercials 8 and 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.880
 the last time she had the following 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:39.329
 illness when turned on she blinked everyone 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.129
 I didn't take off the diode indicators 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.710
 it's on the video but on the internet I saw 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.800
 video necessarily mater a piece show 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.000
 how it looks useful on the forum and on 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.360
 form on the forums seemed all very 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.370
 simple and elementary people advised 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.100
 replace the capacitor and then what 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.180
 happened next I hid from the weight on 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.630
 the washing machine opens it very much 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 just 4 2 bolts unscrew unscrew 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.720
 also two hex bolts which 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.090
 keeps drowned the very scheme we dump from 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.090
 All wiring diagram 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:33.170
 and unfasten here this cover cap 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:36.680
 stitched and remove the fee is taken out very 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.340
 just and then what I did I produced 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.220
 a visual inspection of the board so as 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.630
 recommended on the forums and found that 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.050
 it is necessary to replace not only 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:53.869
 condensers 680 microfarad at 10 volts 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:55.550
 but also a capacitor at 470 microfarad at 10 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.920
 volt how I determined that very 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.280
 just pay attention to what they look like 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.310
 ordinary capacitors and what it looks like 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.550
 the capacitor demanded measurements very 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.000
 just the top of the cap 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.200
 condenser swell blown away her 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.300
 and this suggests that the capacitor 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.980
 burned out into disrepair this way 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.790
 I changed only two 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.780
 condenser 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.450
 And here is this larger capacitor on 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.950
 680 microfarad I am again on the advice on 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.989
 Forum replaced on thousand I put 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.000
 capacitor per thousand microfarad 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.420
 similar disease for indesit machine 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.610
 particular for my car for car 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.090
 my brand is so common 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.330
 that I had no difficulty 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.720
 find a solution I found it on the form 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.549
 instantly immediately capacitors 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.170
 of course I had to rummage all their stock 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.120
 window found and something like where you 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.170
 find condensate I don't know maybe you 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.540
 go in some 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.980
 old appliances from some old 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.200
 TV search on any 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.220
 markets on that so-called collapse but 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.570
 I found my collection and in this 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.600
 required literally 1 minute of work 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.310
 soldering iron everything is simple even visually 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.380
 determined the good price of the capacitor 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.510
 solder let 's quick now all 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.690
 I â€™ll collect it and show it to the machine 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.280
 all cover is installed back choosing 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.770
 wash and run mode 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.910
 Well, as you can see the car is very simple 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:42.560
 I managed to repair the car forgot the network 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:45.620
 turn on so the network machine includes all 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.020
 mega hasn't stopped putting my love 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.739
 increase speed reduction to not 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.860
 shaking her 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.690
 launching the wash mode well what can I do 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.080
 This machine to say she us very 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.930
 rescued this old woman when we only 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.180
 that the baby was born the wash was a lot well 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.070
 and considering that we are a pair of satin and 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.080
 look and get dirty very much love 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.530
 the machine works for us during these 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.530
 eight years old but almost constantly 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.959
 it would be very pity for me, especially since 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.239
 car otherwise i would say just 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.269
 wonderful and this is not an ad this 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.360
 statement of fact after a long 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.090
 long-term inspection would be a pity 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.160
 lose the more so as a solution to the problem 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.810
 it seemed so simple 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:37.010
 elementary therefore I advise everyone to 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.410
 than to run at least for a little bit of new cars 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.470
 strut search forum 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.720
 Often the solution is very, very, very 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.410
 simple well and most 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.720
 can handle it themselves like this 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.060
 Here's a short video I hope someone 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.890
 it was really helpful to everyone 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.890
 Thank you for the attention of all the best
