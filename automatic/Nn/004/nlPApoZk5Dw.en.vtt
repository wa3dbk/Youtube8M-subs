00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
since um since forever I guess um so let

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
since um since forever I guess um so let
me<00:00:36.989> talk<00:00:37.170> about<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.649> methodology<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.520> used

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
me talk about the methodology we used

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.979 
me talk about the methodology we used
first<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.290> success<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.460> an<00:00:41.760> actor<00:00:42.090> measures<00:00:42.570> um
