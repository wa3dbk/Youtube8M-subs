00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.430 
I speak the language of Tom blonde I
don't<00:04:24.090> have<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.240> definite<00:04:24.810> plan<00:04:25.050> for<00:04:25.320> what<00:04:25.410> I

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
don't have a definite plan for what I

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.050 
don't have a definite plan for what I
want<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.740> do<00:04:25.860> with<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.009> at<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.340> moment<00:04:26.370> but<00:04:27.000> I

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
want to do with it at the moment but I

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.939 
want to do with it at the moment but I
do<00:04:27.150> know<00:04:27.509> that's<00:04:27.750> certainly<00:04:28.229> not<00:04:28.889> a

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
do know that's certainly not a

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.710 
do know that's certainly not a
replacement<00:04:29.310> this<00:04:29.759> channel<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.330> just<00:04:30.360> a

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
replacement this channel is just a

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.779 
replacement this channel is just a
compliment<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.340> i<00:04:32.370> think<00:04:32.460> i'll<00:04:32.699> be

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
compliment to it so i think i'll be

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.730 
compliment to it so i think i'll be
using<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.180> mainly<00:04:33.449> if<00:04:33.750> i<00:04:33.930> get<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.199> pretty<00:04:34.530> new
