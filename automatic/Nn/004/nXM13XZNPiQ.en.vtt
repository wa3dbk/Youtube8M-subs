00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
like this yeah and i'm just thinking

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.510 
like this yeah and i'm just thinking
about<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> possibilities<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:50.340> I've

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
about all the possibilities like I've

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060 
about all the possibilities like I've
got<00:00:50.760> two<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:51.780> three<00:00:51.960> old<00:00:52.140> engines<00:00:52.559> stands<00:00:52.829> back

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
got two or three old engines stands back

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.529 
got two or three old engines stands back
here<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.550> always<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> way<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.449> I'm

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
here that are always in the way and I'm

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.410 
here that are always in the way and I'm
thinking<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.610> if<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.820> mounted<00:00:57.270> them

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
thinking you know if I if I mounted them

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.500 
thinking you know if I if I mounted them
up<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.899> rafters<00:00:58.590> over<00:00:59.219> here<00:00:59.510> especially

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
up in the rafters over here especially

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330 
up in the rafters over here especially
up<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.140> tall<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.829> could<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.129> them<00:01:02.219> up

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
up on this tall and I could get them up

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.740 
up on this tall and I could get them up
high<00:01:02.550> enough<00:01:02.609> where<00:01:02.820> they're<00:01:03.120> completely<00:01:03.510> out

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
high enough where they're completely out

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.289 
high enough where they're completely out
of<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> way<00:01:04.519> that<00:01:05.519> would<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.850> real<00:01:06.030> good

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
of the way that would be real good

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.719 
of the way that would be real good
because<00:01:06.979> when<00:01:07.979> you're<00:01:08.100> not<00:01:08.189> using<00:01:08.520> them

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
because when you're not using them

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.200 
because when you're not using them
they're<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.000> big<00:01:09.390> off<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.659> hunks<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.229> metal

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
they're just big off the hunks of metal

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.530 
they're just big off the hunks of metal
that's<00:01:12.210> good<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:12.659> gonna<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:13.049> real<00:01:13.229> good

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
that's good that's gonna be real good

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.640 
that's good that's gonna be real good
can't<00:01:15.540> wait<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.900> another<00:01:15.960> day<00:01:16.320> off<00:01:16.380> to
