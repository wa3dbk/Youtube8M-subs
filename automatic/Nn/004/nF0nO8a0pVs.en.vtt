00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.090 
it would work but i just know that
there's<00:03:11.690> several<00:03:12.019> ways<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.620> Apple<00:03:12.920> could

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
there's several ways that Apple could

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.190 
there's several ways that Apple could
implement<00:03:13.459> it<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:13.940> will<00:03:14.480> implement<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:15.110> in

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
implement it and will implement it in

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.009 
implement it and will implement it in
the<00:03:15.319> future<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:17.030> know<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.299> also<00:03:17.540> something

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
the future you know it also something

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.720 
the future you know it also something
and<00:03:18.260> we're<00:03:18.500> starting<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.829> see<00:03:18.890> this<00:03:19.100> with<00:03:19.310> some

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
and we're starting to see this with some

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.729 
and we're starting to see this with some
jailbreak<00:03:20.390> broken<00:03:20.930> applications<00:03:21.590> that

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
jailbreak broken applications that

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.009 
jailbreak broken applications that

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
say that to Siri clearly it has the

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.350 
say that to Siri clearly it has the
understanding<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.640> recognize<00:03:35.120> those

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
understanding to recognize those

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.479 
understanding to recognize those
commands<00:03:35.959> but<00:03:36.350> it's<00:03:36.470> not<00:03:36.590> allowed<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:37.130> do

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489

anything<00:03:37.519> about<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.090> now<00:03:38.239> why<00:03:39.170> can't<00:03:39.470> you<00:03:39.560> do

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
anything about it now why can't you do

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.030 
anything about it now why can't you do
that<00:03:39.769> that<00:03:40.250> obviously<00:03:40.820> is<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.209> future<00:03:41.480> of

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
that that obviously is the future of

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.410 
that that obviously is the future of
Siri<00:03:43.040> being<00:03:43.549> able<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.850> have<00:03:43.970> full<00:03:44.239> control

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
Siri being able to have full control

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.270 
Siri being able to have full control
over<00:03:44.630> your<00:03:44.870> device<00:03:45.200> full<00:03:45.680> control<00:03:45.920> over<00:03:46.010> the

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
over your device full control over the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.130 
over your device full control over the
applications<00:03:46.880> again<00:03:47.090> with<00:03:47.239> developer<00:03:47.720> AP<00:03:48.049> is

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
applications again with developer AP is

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.890 
applications again with developer AP is
so<00:03:48.799> if<00:03:48.950> Syria<00:03:49.340> can<00:03:49.489> be<00:03:49.579> tied<00:03:49.850> into<00:03:50.090> any<00:03:50.480> app

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
so if Syria can be tied into any app

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.319 
so if Syria can be tied into any app
it's<00:03:51.260> limitless<00:03:51.739> really<00:03:52.280> any<00:03:52.489> application

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
it's limitless really any application

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.849 
it's limitless really any application
that's<00:03:53.450> on<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.720> iphone<00:03:54.079> why<00:03:54.260> cant<00:03:54.500> Siri
