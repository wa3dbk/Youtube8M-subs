00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
points sorry if the gameplay looks a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.340 
points sorry if the gameplay looks a
little<00:00:40.590> laggy<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.370> don't<00:00:41.670> know<00:00:42.079> why<00:00:43.079> my

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
little laggy I don't know why my

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.130 
little laggy I don't know why my
framerate<00:00:43.710> settings<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.360> working<00:00:45.750> but

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
framerate settings are not working but

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.970 
framerate settings are not working but
this<00:00:46.770> first<00:00:47.070> set<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.430> downs<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.789> crucial<00:00:48.980> first

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
this first set of downs is crucial first

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.069 
this first set of downs is crucial first
thing<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.730> check<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.180> full<00:00:51.420> back<00:00:51.600> dive<00:00:51.870> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
thing I do is check if full back dive is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.970 
thing I do is check if full back dive is
countered<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.280> goal<00:00:53.460> lines<00:00:53.730> set<00:00:54.320> so<00:00:55.320> this

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
countered and the goal lines set so this

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.520 
countered and the goal lines set so this
opponent<00:00:56.370> no<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> will<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.140> able

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
opponent no it is not so I will be able

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.729 
opponent no it is not so I will be able
to<00:00:58.620> use<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> two-point<00:00:59.969> conversion

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
to use that as a two-point conversion

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.640 
to use that as a two-point conversion
next<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.809> if<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.019> doesn't<00:01:04.350> work<00:01:04.439> I'll

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
next I go to if that doesn't work I'll

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.380 
next I go to if that doesn't work I'll
go<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> full<00:01:05.400> back<00:01:05.610> dive<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:07.280> formation<00:01:08.390> but

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
go to full back dive in I formation but

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.030

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.920 
seven eight in the I formation too if
you<00:02:23.080> hit<00:02:23.230> your<00:02:23.380> tight<00:02:23.620> end<00:02:23.650> over<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.250> top

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
you hit your tight end over the top

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.180 
you hit your tight end over the top
majority<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.110> timing<00:02:26.470> catches<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:26.980> over

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
majority of the timing catches it over

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.050 
majority of the timing catches it over
the<00:02:27.310> safeties<00:02:27.959> but<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:28.989> full<00:02:29.650> bag<00:02:29.830> dive<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.640> not

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the safeties but a full bag dive is not

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.640 
the safeties but a full bag dive is not
countered<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:31.840> I'll<00:02:31.930> use<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.380> as<00:02:32.620> a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
countered so I'll use that as a

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.550 
countered so I'll use that as a
two-point<00:02:33.250> play<00:02:33.660> yeah<00:02:34.660> seems<00:02:35.019> six<00:02:35.319> seven

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
two-point play yeah seems six seven

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.740 
two-point play yeah seems six seven
eight<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.860> great<00:02:36.280> play<00:02:36.549> but<00:02:37.390> I'm<00:02:37.480> gonna<00:02:37.569> go

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
eight is a great play but I'm gonna go

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.009 
eight is a great play but I'm gonna go
with<00:02:37.870> halfback<00:02:38.290> costs<00:02:38.860> let's<00:02:39.459> see<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.180> then

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
with halfback costs let's see and then

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.140 
with halfback costs let's see and then
cut<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.560> middle<00:02:41.860> oh<00:02:42.040> oh<00:02:42.930> let's<00:02:43.930> go<00:02:45.150> see

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
cut in the middle oh oh let's go see

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.699 
cut in the middle oh oh let's go see
that<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.630> how<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.810> win<00:02:47.799> head<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.670> head<00:02:48.850> mostly

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
that is how I win head to head mostly

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.770 
that is how I win head to head mostly
that's<00:02:50.709> my<00:02:50.890> strategy<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.790> I'm<00:02:52.330> about<00:02:52.600> to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
that's my strategy and I'm about to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.479 
that's my strategy and I'm about to
grind<00:02:53.049> so<00:02:53.349> I<00:02:53.380> can<00:02:53.650> get<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.010> ninety<00:02:54.340> nine

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
grind so I can get that ninety nine

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.289 
grind so I can get that ninety nine
overall<00:02:54.900> Odell<00:02:55.900> Beckham<00:02:56.349> jr.<00:02:57.060> which<00:02:58.060> will

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
overall Odell Beckham jr. which will

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.370 
overall Odell Beckham jr. which will
take<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.510> while<00:02:58.810> because<00:02:59.579> seasons<00:03:01.380> they're

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
take a while because seasons they're

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.949 
take a while because seasons they're
gonna<00:03:02.500> take<00:03:02.739> forever<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.720> think<00:03:04.720> there's<00:03:04.900> a

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
gonna take forever I think there's a

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.840 
gonna take forever I think there's a
thing<00:03:05.200> where<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.500> can<00:03:05.650> like<00:03:05.799> forfeit<00:03:06.340> some<00:03:06.760> of

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
thing where you can like forfeit some of

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.449 
thing where you can like forfeit some of
the<00:03:06.940> games<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.950> still<00:03:08.950> be<00:03:09.070> in<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.250> playoffs

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
the games and still be in the playoffs

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.470 
the games and still be in the playoffs
so<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:11.380> may<00:03:11.769> make<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.010> video<00:03:12.340> on<00:03:12.489> that<00:03:12.519> to<00:03:13.269> get

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
so I may make a video on that to get

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.770 
so I may make a video on that to get
done<00:03:13.690> faster<00:03:14.430> see<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:15.940> do<00:03:16.060> fullback<00:03:16.480> dive

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
done faster see you can do fullback dive

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.190 
done faster see you can do fullback dive
