people<00:00:21.240> pick<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.660> build<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.109> way<00:00:22.230> they<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.470> so

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
people pick and build the way they do so

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.890 
people pick and build the way they do so
first<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.400> all<00:00:23.519> you've<00:00:23.789> got<00:00:23.820> three<00:00:24.300> main<00:00:24.600> paths

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
first of all you've got three main paths

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.290 
first of all you've got three main paths
to<00:00:25.410> Bill<00:00:25.619> Thresh<00:00:25.920> they<00:00:26.310> differ<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.000> early

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
to Bill Thresh they differ in the early

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.700 
to Bill Thresh they differ in the early
game<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:27.539> end<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:27.960> being<00:00:28.199> finished<00:00:28.500> pretty

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
game but end up being finished pretty

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.470 
game but end up being finished pretty
much<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.070> same<00:00:29.189> way<00:00:29.400> you've<00:00:29.880> got<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> relic

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
much the same way you've got the relic

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.359 
much the same way you've got the relic
shield<00:00:30.510> ancient<00:00:31.289> coin<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.830> spell<00:00:32.099> thief's

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
edge paths so here's the explanation

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.010 
edge paths so here's the explanation
behind<00:00:34.890> each<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.940> those<00:00:36.059> picks<00:00:36.390> some

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
behind each one of those picks some

behind each one of those picks some
Thresh<00:00:37.320> players<00:00:37.620> usually<00:00:37.980> start<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.550> relic

shield<00:00:39.000> now<00:00:39.690> Thresh<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.290> range<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.860> he<00:00:40.950> doesn't

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
shield now Thresh is range so he doesn't
