00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.720 
wear it alone or under makeup to refine
where<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.449> found<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.469> didn't<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.160> much<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.550> my

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
where I found this didn't do much to my

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.720 
where I found this didn't do much to my
skin<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.239> didn't<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.289> big

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
skin I didn't really see a big

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.060 
skin I didn't really see a big
difference<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.719> kind<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
difference so I kind of think this is a

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.899 
difference so I kind of think this is a
waste<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.610> money<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.450> tried<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.830> did<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.369> like

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
waste of money I tried it I did not like

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.350 
waste of money I tried it I did not like
it<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.750> thin<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.979> consistency<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.150> it's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it this is thin and consistency and it's

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.390 
it this is thin and consistency and it's
not<00:01:12.659> oily<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> doesn't<00:01:13.560> make<00:01:13.650> me<00:01:13.830> feel<00:01:13.860> greasy

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
not oily it doesn't make me feel greasy

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.690 
not oily it doesn't make me feel greasy
but<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.479> drying<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.100> formulation

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
but it's not drying so the formulation

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.510 
but it's not drying so the formulation
is<00:01:18.119> very<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.869> good<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> feel<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.220> it

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
is very very good I like the feel of it

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.749 
is very very good I like the feel of it
I<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.720> don't<00:01:21.960> think<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.439> does<00:01:22.860> what<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.729> says

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I just don't think it does what it says

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.140 
I just don't think it does what it says
it's<00:01:24.479> supposed<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.229> next<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.430> blur<00:01:26.790> and

it's supposed to do next is the blur and

it's supposed to do next is the blur and
redness<00:01:27.900> control<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.829> supposed<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
redness control this is supposed to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.880 
redness control this is supposed to
visually<00:01:30.329> blur<00:01:30.600> skin<00:01:31.020> tone<00:01:31.200> imperfections

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890

and smooth fine lines supposed to prime

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.260 
and smooth fine lines supposed to prime
skin<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.799> control<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> look<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.640> redness<00:01:36.090> for

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

side<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.940> more<00:02:33.210> covered<00:02:33.780> up<00:02:33.810> than<00:02:34.320> this<00:02:34.500> side

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
side is more covered up than this side

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.100 
side is more covered up than this side
just<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.730> blur<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.180> smooth<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.720> found

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
just like the blur and smooth I found

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.340 
just like the blur and smooth I found
this<00:02:37.350> one<00:02:37.620> was<00:02:37.860> not<00:02:38.250> greasy<00:02:38.970> not<00:02:39.000> oily<00:02:39.810> didn't

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
this one was not greasy not oily didn't

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.640 
this one was not greasy not oily didn't
make<00:02:40.530> me<00:02:40.710> feel<00:02:40.740> like<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:42.270> at<00:02:42.720> all<00:02:42.930> or<00:02:43.260> didn't

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
make me feel like the at all or didn't

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.550 
make me feel like the at all or didn't
make<00:02:43.800> me<00:02:43.890> feel<00:02:43.950> dry<00:02:44.520> at<00:02:44.850> all<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:46.110> very

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
make me feel dry at all so that is very

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.060 
make me feel dry at all so that is very
good<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.160> last<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:47.910> not<00:02:48.030> least<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:49.350> blur

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
good and last but not least is the blur

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.610 
good and last but not least is the blur
and<00:02:50.180> illuminate<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.540> when<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.050> first<00:02:52.410> tried

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
and illuminate and when I first tried

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.150 
and illuminate and when I first tried
this<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.160> immediately<00:02:53.970> thought<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.900> max<00:02:55.350> strobe

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
this I immediately thought of max strobe

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.490 
this I immediately thought of max strobe
cream<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.090> was<00:02:57.270> like<00:02:57.420> could<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.840> be<00:02:58.170> a

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
cream and I was like could this be a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.850 
cream and I was like could this be a
drugstore<00:02:58.890> dupe<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.910> I<00:02:59.940> try<00:03:00.480> them<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:01.470> side

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
drugstore dupe so I try them this side

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.550 
drugstore dupe so I try them this side
has<00:03:02.340> Mac<00:03:02.670> strobe<00:03:03.090> cream<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.960> side<00:03:04.230> has

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
has Mac strobe cream and this side has

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.150 
has Mac strobe cream and this side has
the<00:03:04.670> Maybelline<00:03:05.670> primer<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:07.020> if<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.710> can<00:03:07.890> see

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
the Maybelline primer so if you can see

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.540 
the Maybelline primer so if you can see
which<00:03:08.760> side<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.330> more<00:03:09.660> dewy<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:12.150> can<00:03:12.330> see<00:03:12.540> that

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
which side is more dewy you can see that

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.090 
which side is more dewy you can see that
like<00:03:14.550> you<00:03:14.700> can<00:03:14.850> compare<00:03:15.300> but<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.810> find<00:03:16.200> strobe

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
like you can compare but I find strobe

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.640 
like you can compare but I find strobe
cream<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> little<00:03:18.120> bit<00:03:18.300> more<00:03:18.960> of<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.350> thinner

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
cream is a little bit more of a thinner

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.600 
cream is a little bit more of a thinner
formula<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.840> this<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:23.040> thicker<00:03:23.310> one

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
formula and this one is a thicker one

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.140 
formula and this one is a thicker one
but<00:03:24.000> has<00:03:24.240> more<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:25.050> pink<00:03:25.640> illuminated<00:03:26.640> base

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
but has more of a pink illuminated base

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.980 
but has more of a pink illuminated base
so<00:03:27.810> when<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.710> tried<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:29.790> was<00:03:29.970> like<00:03:30.150> because

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
so when I tried this I was like because

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.640 
so when I tried this I was like because
it<00:03:31.320> has<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:32.010> hint<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.550> pink<00:03:33.240> illumination<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:34.230> I

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
it has a hint of pink illumination and I

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.320 
it has a hint of pink illumination and I
don't<00:03:34.740> really<00:03:34.950> like<00:03:35.070> that<00:03:35.460> and<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:35.820> find<00:03:36.030> this

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
don't really like that and I find this

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.270 
don't really like that and I find this
one<00:03:36.660> dries<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:37.980> clear<00:03:38.820> clear<00:03:40.280> illuminating

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
one dries to a clear clear illuminating

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.580 
one dries to a clear clear illuminating
base<00:03:41.520> so<00:03:41.970> I<00:03:42.360> definitely<00:03:42.810> like<00:03:42.990> strobe<00:03:43.380> cream

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
base so I definitely like strobe cream

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.390 
base so I definitely like strobe cream
more<00:03:43.980> if<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.610> can't<00:03:44.910> afford<00:03:45.150> strobe<00:03:45.720> cream

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
more if you can't afford strobe cream

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.699 
more if you can't afford strobe cream
definitely<00:03:47.400> definitely<00:03:48.060> definitely<00:03:48.840> get

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
definitely definitely definitely get

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.270 
definitely definitely definitely get
this<00:03:50.070> one<00:03:50.400> because<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.570> is<00:03:51.630> very<00:03:52.560> very<00:03:52.890> similar

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
this one because it is very very similar

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.240 
this one because it is very very similar
in<00:03:53.520> effect<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.260> was<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.560> quick<00:03:56.040> overview
