00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.710 
bus drivers truck drivers a lot of
people<00:06:08.100> are<00:06:08.220> going<00:06:08.400> to<00:06:08.520> be<00:06:08.640> displaced<00:06:08.970> and

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
people are going to be displaced and

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.830 
people are going to be displaced and
it's<00:06:10.350> gonna<00:06:10.500> happen<00:06:10.800> very<00:06:11.160> quickly<00:06:11.840> it's

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
it's gonna happen very quickly it's

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.370 
it's gonna happen very quickly it's
coming<00:06:13.410> because<00:06:14.030> the<00:06:15.030> technology<00:06:15.630> is<00:06:15.660> here<00:06:16.200> is

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
coming because the technology is here is

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.620 
coming because the technology is here is
just<00:06:16.740> making<00:06:17.070> sure<00:06:17.340> that<00:06:17.640> it<00:06:18.030> could<00:06:18.210> be<00:06:18.360> more

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
just making sure that it could be more

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.470 
just making sure that it could be more
widespread<00:06:18.900> because<00:06:19.650> you<00:06:20.430> know<00:06:20.580> for<00:06:21.300> years

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
widespread because you know for years

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.880 
widespread because you know for years
you've<00:06:21.810> had<00:06:21.990> that<00:06:22.110> technology<00:06:22.350> where<00:06:22.770> your

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
you've had that technology where your

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.670 
you've had that technology where your
car<00:06:23.160> could<00:06:23.310> parallel<00:06:23.850> park<00:06:24.150> it's<00:06:25.080> driving

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
car could parallel park it's driving

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.270 
car could parallel park it's driving
itself<00:06:26.040> already<00:06:26.550> once<00:06:27.479> they<00:06:27.600> get<00:06:27.750> the<00:06:27.919> GPS<00:06:28.919> the

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
itself already once they get the GPS the

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.760 
itself already once they get the GPS the
navigation<00:06:29.820> everything<00:06:30.180> else<00:06:30.390> and<00:06:30.630> the<00:06:31.530> grid

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
navigation everything else and the grid

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.050 
navigation everything else and the grid
together

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
together

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.980 
together
it's<00:06:33.240> going<00:06:33.540> to<00:06:33.630> be<00:06:33.720> crazy<00:06:34.700> so<00:06:35.700> if<00:06:36.240> you're<00:06:36.750> like

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
it's going to be crazy so if you're like

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.640 
it's going to be crazy so if you're like
training<00:06:37.710> for<00:06:38.100> something<00:06:38.520> like<00:06:39.300> that

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
training for something like that

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.430 
training for something like that
understand<00:06:40.650> you<00:06:41.190> got<00:06:41.370> maybe<00:06:41.580> 10<00:06:42.480> 15<00:06:43.020> maybe<00:06:43.230> 20

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
understand you got maybe 10 15 maybe 20

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.880 
understand you got maybe 10 15 maybe 20
years<00:06:43.950> and<00:06:44.570> it's<00:06:45.570> not<00:06:45.810> it's<00:06:46.380> going<00:06:46.560> to<00:06:46.620> be<00:06:46.710> gone

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
years and it's not it's going to be gone

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.130 
years and it's not it's going to be gone
because<00:06:47.070> one<00:06:47.970> of<00:06:48.000> the<00:06:48.150> reasons<00:06:48.270> this<00:06:48.810> is<00:06:48.960> going

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
because one of the reasons this is going

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.930 
because one of the reasons this is going
to<00:06:49.230> happen<00:06:49.530> is<00:06:49.710> when<00:06:50.250> you<00:06:50.550> could<00:06:50.700> have<00:06:50.910> a

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
to happen is when you could have a

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.440 
to happen is when you could have a
vehicle<00:06:51.270> that<00:06:51.690> isn't<00:06:52.560> under<00:06:52.770> OSHA<00:06:53.330> there<00:06:54.330> is

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450 
vehicle that isn't under OSHA there is

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.880 
vehicle that isn't under OSHA there is
no<00:06:54.600> such<00:06:54.780> thing<00:06:54.990> as<00:06:55.110> this<00:06:55.290> driver<00:06:55.590> can<00:06:55.770> only

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
no such thing as this driver can only

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.390 
no such thing as this driver can only
try<00:06:56.130> oh<00:06:56.280> no<00:06:56.850> pension<00:06:57.240> benefits<00:06:58.280> it's<00:06:59.280> a

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
try oh no pension benefits it's a

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.790 
try oh no pension benefits it's a
no-brainer<00:06:59.580> yeah<00:07:00.210> that's<00:07:00.360> going<00:07:00.600> to<00:07:00.690> happen

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
no-brainer yeah that's going to happen

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.620 
no-brainer yeah that's going to happen
it's<00:07:01.800> going<00:07:01.950> to<00:07:02.220> happen<00:07:02.460> so<00:07:03.180> I'm<00:07:03.240> just<00:07:03.420> letting

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630
