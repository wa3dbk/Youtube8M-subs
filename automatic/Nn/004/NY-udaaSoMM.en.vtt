00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.129
 So you go half the ship is saved and so you have to imagine 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:05.040
 that this holding 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.230
 He also sat there 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.860
 and then the point steven balls has stood on it about to this high 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.749
 and these shelves stood there 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.749
 so against it 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.050
 the nose of the ship you have some imagination for it 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.140
 needed and at first glance it doesn't seem so exciting it's nothing more than 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.310
 two old boards anyway that it is here to make you one of the most important 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.310
 ship archaeological finds in our country for weed 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.449
 bean shelf 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.900
 except for the already prohibited so actually from the ship 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.060
 right 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.180
 is also fallen board so that the side of the ship 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.949
 You see a number of trusses that is that they are not cross connections 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.890
 and further nail torque juts 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.030
 the board board banned a board 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.410
 the frames were attached to 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.300
 this wreck of a roman punter is already the third unique find in a short time 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.010
 and ten years ago archeology started Leiden Rhine for the first time 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.510
 on the roman ship 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.630
 that cargo ship was only excavated and transported in 2003 six years later 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.320
 and a few weeks after the special transport the archaeologists found one 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.680
 second cargo ships and this time a punt 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.620
 yes this is already 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.220
 the number three 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.370
 all 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.440
 may seem a surprise more but on the other hand you look like that 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.270
 Shipping lied about not being crazy about it 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.700
 the Rhine in Roman times as a transport artery of a great soldier 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.670
 system the border of the roman empire it was a supply route and it 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.980
 was just teeming with transport ships 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.330
 we already knew the larger ones and the moors in the ships from drachten were also an exciting one 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.250
 is that we now also get to know a smaller buddy, well known, so to speak 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.460
 we know large cargo ships so the trucks are already from Roman times 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.530
 there are more vans from the Roman period so that smaller freight in 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.520
 The region could be delivered and then you just have to think about it 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.000
 lots of willows or not picks that could be a local farmer going to the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.280
 market at the castellum 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950
 so smaller local freight
