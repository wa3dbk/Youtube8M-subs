00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.679 
that station
one<00:01:09.869> little<00:01:09.990> trick<00:01:10.170> though<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> fence

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
one little trick though with the fence

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.270 
one little trick though with the fence
fence<00:01:12.689> comes<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.140> segments<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.100> you'll

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
fence comes in segments and you'll

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.260 
fence comes in segments and you'll
notice<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.960> these<00:01:15.960> signals<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.500> fit<00:01:16.680> nicely

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
notice that these signals are fit nicely

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.630 
notice that these signals are fit nicely
for<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.360> long<00:01:18.630> segment<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.400> too<00:01:20.400> short<00:01:20.610> for

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
for this long segment here too short for

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.399 
for this long segment here too short for
the<00:01:20.909> entire<00:01:21.150> distance<00:01:21.479> Christian<00:01:22.229> another

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the entire distance Christian another

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.880 
the entire distance Christian another
long<00:01:22.590> segment<00:01:23.420> that's<00:01:24.420> -<00:01:24.750> there's<00:01:25.470> too<00:01:25.740> long

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
long segment that's - there's too long

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.810 
long segment that's - there's too long
so<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> actually<00:01:26.189> cut<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.680> with<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> knife<00:01:28.820> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
so you actually cut it with a knife to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.300 
so you actually cut it with a knife to
get<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> fit<00:01:30.439> thought<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.680> wrong<00:01:31.890> but

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
get it to fit thought that was wrong but

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.429
