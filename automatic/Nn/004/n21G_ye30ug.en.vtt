you acquire that makes it more difficult
for<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.530> just<00:03:48.310> up<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:48.820> travel<00:03:49.150> whenever

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
for you to just up and travel whenever

about<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.859> idea<00:03:57.160> of<00:03:57.310> settling<00:03:57.640> down<00:03:57.880> and

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
about the idea of settling down and

having a family to me at least anyway

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.580 
having a family to me at least anyway
that<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.700> impulse<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.510> just<00:04:01.870> up<00:04:02.079> and<00:04:02.290> travel

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
that that impulse to just up and travel

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.220 
that that impulse to just up and travel
has<00:04:03.100> been<00:04:03.489> growing<00:04:03.790> stronger<00:04:04.540> in<00:04:04.810> me<00:04:05.079> again

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
has been growing stronger in me again

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.890 
has been growing stronger in me again
but<00:04:05.890> that<00:04:05.980> also<00:04:06.190> seems<00:04:06.579> like<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.269> don't<00:04:07.510> think<00:04:07.690> I

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
but that also seems like I don't think I

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.590 
but that also seems like I don't think I
can<00:04:08.079> do<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.260> with<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.100> giant<00:04:09.400> tax<00:04:10.000> debt<00:04:10.389> on

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
can do that with this giant tax debt on

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.330 
can do that with this giant tax debt on

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
me I don't know I don't even really know

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.610 
me I don't know I don't even really know

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
talking the other day about how I

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.290 
talking the other day about how I
expected<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:17.979> hiring<00:05:18.250> an<00:05:18.550> editor<00:05:18.849> would<00:05:19.150> be

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
expected that hiring an editor would be

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.689 
expected that hiring an editor would be
this<00:05:19.449> like<00:05:19.750> rate<00:05:20.289> epiphanies<00:05:20.949> moment<00:05:21.460> where

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
this like rate epiphanies moment where

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.399 
this like rate epiphanies moment where
all<00:05:21.849> of<00:05:21.969> a<00:05:22.060> sudden<00:05:22.360> everything<00:05:22.509> just<00:05:22.840> worked

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:23.409 
all of a sudden everything just worked

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.439 
all of a sudden everything just worked
so<00:05:23.620> much<00:05:23.740> better<00:05:24.039> but<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.370> actually<00:05:24.699> don't<00:05:25.300> feel

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
so much better but I actually don't feel

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.100 
so much better but I actually don't feel
like<00:05:25.930> we<00:05:26.620> are<00:05:26.830> much<00:05:27.159> further<00:05:27.639> ahead<00:05:27.969> we<00:05:28.870> might

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
like we are much further ahead we might

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.249 
like we are much further ahead we might
like<00:05:29.550> in<00:05:30.550> terms<00:05:30.759> of<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.060> vlog<00:05:31.270> at<00:05:31.509> least<00:05:31.690> we're

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
like in terms of the vlog at least we're

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.459 
like in terms of the vlog at least we're
further<00:05:32.560> behind<00:05:32.800> part<00:05:33.639> of<00:05:33.729> that<00:05:33.789> is<00:05:33.909> that<00:05:34.300> I<00:05:34.509> I
