00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 go to the brothers of minecraft ita mod io 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.359
 I am a piece and today I am here for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.490
 review the mod 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.870
 let's start immediately but let's go straight to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.730
 see what this new introduces us 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.410
 fashion this new fashion while there 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.630
 introduces this new animation for 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.029
 the water you will see that there will be a detachment 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.859
 color from dark blue to light blue 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.439
 these will be the waves 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.600
 we could discuss this with the chef 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.760
 board let's go up and show you 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.160
 this boat will not be destroyed because 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.689
 if we will use a normal boat 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.199
 then they will no longer be introduced with 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.090
 this fashion 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.770
 if the normal boat will break 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.930
 look look at what i can do with 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.820
 this boat wants everywhere it doesn't break 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.120
 not even going to earth 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.239
 see from this own animation of 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.340
 that is, wave will push us everywhere for this 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.320
 also had to come back now then 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.600
 introduces these two new items if the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.420
 tornado sirens that kraft with four 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.449
 pieces of iron one of gold and two of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.129
 redstone and will notify us when it is there 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.399
 it will be a tornado nearby us 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.619
 let's think about land near the tornado 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.580
 censor that crofts with four pieces of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.880
 iron one of gold and 4d redzone lo 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.860
 we think close and we when we hear 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.540
 is there when there is a tornado in the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 neighborhood will warn us just like that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.830
 will begin to play will make us understand that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.040
 we have a tornado near another item 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.979
 which adds are let's say so two 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.070
 Hammer then the shockwave item that you 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.920
 kraft with three feathers and drill the themes yes 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.710
 clear that it comes with the sticks put 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.570
 in the shape of more with the drill we succeed 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.270
 look by right- clicking 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.690
 on the ground or on a platform on a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.450
 any say so platform 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.660
 the item of that hole of that place is 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.340
 they will all move and go to another 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.590
 part however will not be held to form one 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.600
 new structure will just take off 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.390
 just look at the step 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.040
 look at how you saw us do this 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.610
 this step serves here as 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:10.619
 shelter and anti anti tornado facts 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.880
 not now I'll show you with this 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.000
 we do not for example on earth 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.920
 normal will create this sort of big one 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.930
 bleachers that will take us down into a 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.090
 level where the tornado will fail to 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.400
 then touch to destroy another 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.290
 item that introduces elo shockwave lo 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.320
 shocks I have already made to you 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.950
 see the crafting are we click with 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.600
 the right button on the ground will turn i 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.400
 block therefore what will be above nor 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.950
 in what will be only go under 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.930
 try another one very simply 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.810
 item that introduces the warm gun the award 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.490
 gun in the shape of a feather are who you are 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.290
 own kraft with three feathers months in 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.850
 oblique position by clicking on the button 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.330
 right on the ground now I have to 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.120
 stop ok will create these fireballs 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.700
 flying I did not understand the utility 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.680
 but I know they burn when they touch us 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.540
 they are just three fireballs that al 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.920
 touching the ground will set fire 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.590
 everything 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.900
 the pro item we say most important about 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.270
 which is based all this mode is the back 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.910
 dogan la tornado gramsci kraft with a 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.560
 on two strings and one stick returns it 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.739
 dogan now by right-clicking 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.390
 on earth, watch what happens 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:22.360
 suddenly there will be this strength 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:26.360
 kind of pushing us by I do n't know type 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.519
 let's get attracted to the tornado and there 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.760
 will bring with him let you see are in 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.760
 I can't get out of the tornado 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.920
 they just can't get out of goal I have to 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.599
 just use the creative no no nothing 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.370
 I can't really be inside guys 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.620
 when you center you ca n't do it anymore 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.790
 damn nothing 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.069
 ok maybe i did it maybe ok i have it 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.140
 made or even made two not 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.069
 only one therefore I am an emeritus big all 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.160
 8 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.010
 here and with the tornado it will destroy 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.120
 whatever it will meet practically 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.489
 all because it will bring and meanwhile with us 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.549
 will steal type let's say all the blocks 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.709
 nearby and then will cause a 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.730
 furrow where it passes about now vi 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.290
 I show how many blocks ok has 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.540
 practically destroyed a mountain 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.130
 so it must be very high yes and then it is 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.350
 difficult to get out of this coming back 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.669
 when he takes you inside 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.740
 in fact, as you can see, it will take on the color 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.979
 also of what who will succeed to 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.510
 to absorb that is now absorbed earth 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.450
 stone and then turned gray 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.110
 but now I let you hear the sound 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.289
 if not I can 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.360
 ok the sound is not making me attracts me 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.250
 their children is impossible here I 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.400
 I guess he plays in survival coast 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.990
 fashions how do you look guys can't 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.639
 do nothing seems there and tornado 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.830
 that is, when he is back, boys are ill 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.570
 but it will be enough to go out and come back 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.639
 will disappear we see the damage done by the two 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.539
 returned practically destroyed us 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:02.180
 totally the whole area has its own 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:04.100
 paved did not pick up all that 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.990
 that was in giving this way introduces 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.260
 also minecraft of the new sounds that 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.930
 they would be the sounds of the wind 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.880
 pretty nice i have to say i am 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.229
 really made these sounds good to me 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.990
 like them so much 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.940
 it will look like a wind continuum did 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.200
 very well now I don't know why to owe 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.370
 having shot him out are the ones I have 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.930
 shot out 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.340
 in fact, they must have formed an ok 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.260
 perfect they are not a reason for this 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.180
 ok anyway it took us all away 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.370
 what we had done that is all 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.110
 all the earth will take it away and not 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.030
 we know what could happen 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.220
 you see in fact also look at me now 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.300
 I noticed now that destroying 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.889
 these things 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.020
 will go to train an actor if they are 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.449
 enough if it doesn't meet strange things 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.340
 on the supercorso you see that it will spread 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.979
 to the blocks around if there are none 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.090
 caverns will fill the table below 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.380
 it must surely be a cave 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.820
 very much at the bottom 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.800
 however it assures us in fact there is the 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.970
 cave went to place blocks 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.860
 in fact in the cave 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.900
 so if you are only surface 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.970
 flat this will move you all 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.530
 objects however boys what 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.199
 within what introduces this fashion 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.360
 we mainly say the tornado yes 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.750
 based on the back but of the novelty that 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.479
 according to me we say a little introduce 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.150
 really so many choices because I can do 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:22.310
 this fashion is also very varied 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.070
 because with the issue of waves and 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.630
 puts more realism and minecraft at least 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.849
 from my point of view it is hurt 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.460
 water texture because you understand it 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:33.050
 well the waves if I don't know now 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.060
 concern the video if I can understand 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.440
 that these are waves however vi 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.240
 I assure you that they are reintroduced waves 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.169
 minecraft you can distinguish it well from 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.330
 color that varies 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:43.400
 so guys I remind you to put me 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.560
 like the 30 i like to publish a 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.360

 Hi everyone
