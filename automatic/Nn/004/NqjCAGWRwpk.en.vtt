00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hello everyone, Jagai, today we are 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.830
 further we press the game firewood with tics on 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.889
 this time we will try to go through this one 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.980
 the level is where all sorts of pirate flags 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:22.619
 drawn that give us at this level 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:26.070
 This key has a little Well take our 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.990
 gallant ax and go well of course these 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.090
 all the barrels we will not break on the very 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.830
 In fact, you need to break the kitchen with a tunic, but 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.630
 on this one 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:39.510
 and it seems the first barrel yes now you need 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.500
 Well, that's still broken ax already 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.739
 it's goodbye to his key 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.090
 open with the key is the key 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.600
 You can do anything at all. 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.840
 so important so open it this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:02.250
 called door tupanul stupid okay 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:07.140
 ax but just in case here we will break 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.280
 these two objects so after the explosion 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.040
 dynamite on my something else will 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.580
 one box number can destroy it too 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.939
 it is not it is not the essence of the taxi key now it 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.009
 the key 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.610
 need to develop a robot so that he looked in 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.270
 side here dom1no himself must go to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:29.579
 that side of the translation further expand then 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.450
 switch take it up it's not top it 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:40.310
 not the top is the top further on the remote need 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:43.049
 him to go up twice 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.470
 We look where he is she is now him 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.899
 need to deploy so that he probably is on 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.240
 yes no not seem you need to look 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.240
 side of the dynamite now we still believe 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.500
 this is when the speaker is not built, I do not 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.600
 I know and the last time we use already 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.050
 this remote robot should go to 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.790
 the side 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:08.789
 dynamite across the fire burning your daughter 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.740
 blew fine now we have 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.780
 control panel we have this one here 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.430
 the guard passes the bridge hiding the door 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.970
 stud it was a dragon probably and we 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.090
 we leave the next level and pirate 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.250
 flag it pores can ax there boats 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.530
 For example, when cutting a rope 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.100
 try the wire can it work out 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:36.030
 This is another question, but in the boat you can 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.540
 poking at the beginning prevents us from a barrel and 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:46.590
 I can take a boat somehow no like no 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:56.110
 well let's go and the boat sails sails 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:03:01.570
 where does it go like that 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.230
 we can take all the same color ok let's 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.380
 take color 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.150
 why no let's color come on 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.040
 smelled fine which doesn't forgive 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:18.250
 errors generally takes the poor ruby ​​here 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.780
 touch here as the armored long 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.890
 while you can live take the key with the key 11 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.540
 ready right 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.830
 Whose door is why robots 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:36.459
 to cases to recall upward we take an ax 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.290
 it’s not for us to reduce this box when 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.090
 which 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.540
 then use the remote control to control their robots 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.980
 up again go up now we we 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.769
 there we turn that looked left 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.880
 personally a bonfire on dynamite looks and 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.880
 control panel 2 is ready so that he 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.920
 came your fire and on the speaker with us 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.959
 still under control 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.040
 we dismantled the output aggressively from me 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.780
 dirty on here 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.490
 what are we here 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.300
 we will not draw the keys we are at first 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.630
 let's do this with an ax cut down the remote 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:17.549
 control from this box and the robot from 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:21.840
 this box that we throw them you 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.550
 need a key naturally and we move 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.870
 robot once in that direction 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.910
 which he did not stand that is right 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.120
 now we turn and looked down 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.190
 Now it happened and move it 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.080
 down so it passes through the fire 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.740
 ignites and ignites dynamite move away 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:43.470
 you never know that thing so much further 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.810
 further we go here nothing here then 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.419
 there is nothing in the barrels like we are 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.760
 take a hatchet chop down all the barrels that 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.590
 here inside the building which house here 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.979
 pirate flags here is unclear type from 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.790
 hands are pirates in what yes look 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.360
 I play a movie what questions can be so 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:06.650
 key is key and clear 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.650
 and we lower the bridge 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:15.419
 here is this bridge broke the key now to us 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:21.040
 you need to somehow control the robot somehow 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:24.550
 let him down so that he could call in 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:28.480
 on dynamite over the fire well yes we need 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.340
 the robot started well in general we can take 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:42.310
 here is this robot if there is one more 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:46.930
 Well, well, and here so with also I think 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.460
 these two times will come right true already 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.200
 fearing how he would burn but think 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:59.680
 will burn will not burn now we turn 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:04.060
 looked up well and directed up 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.740
 hand is fine now we turn to 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:15.030
 he looked towards the bridge that is 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:17.229
 right i like you don't eat it right on 1 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:25.740
 turned upside down so he looked 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:30.039
 up and up send it up and be quiet quiet 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.669
 further now somehow need it so 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:39.700
 neatly neat one more step and 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:44.130
 up try and see how much 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:46.600
 this step will be correct for almost 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:49.389
 let's put the remote here for simplicity 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:54.550
 management will manage it seems in 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:56.969
 this barrel or this one so 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:01.499
 let's get you up picking 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:08.669
 around it went up further 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:10.469
 hit this box here now send 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.389
 robot time probably so that 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:14.239
 looked like this 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:23.029
 to the right 

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:28.279
 go and right turn and down down 

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:28.279
 fine now turn it to the left and 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:40.639
 go to them respectively left here 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:46.739
 the chest has opened 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:48.179
 which Pavlenko is finally well 

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:50.429
 keep in mind here the slightest mistake in 

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:51.749
 broke the box is not there or I do not know something 

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:55.849
 happened the robot you have to move 

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:55.849
 level again which is not very fun and 

00:07:56.179 --> 00:08:01.469
 Here we have passed this level as it is there 

00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:05.179
 pirated and all found 

00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:05.179
 so what 's up puzzles yet
