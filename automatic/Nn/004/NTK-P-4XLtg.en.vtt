00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.920

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.250
 lots of people left a comment 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.979
 interesting here some pretty cool ideas 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:05.280
 well heeled is good and no longer wanted 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.950
 enjoy that I'm on this map here 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.640
 downtown harry who came in one of them 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.160
 and leave the w3 to tell you there of 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.470
 an easter egg that I ended up discovering 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.890
 it would have been clear here if this 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.470
 A lot of people already know that they have this already 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.079
 million videos there a bunch of video 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.950
 on youtube about this former sister 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:32.520
 map but I did not know and etah another day 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.600
 playing quietly and cursing at how it went 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.790
 on the day that we look at it 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:43.090
 and by chance and I went to meet a 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:54.100
 phone call and I laid on the side of that 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:57.520
 the fire here and the following happened already 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.460
 Did you hear that I saw you? 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.370
 This is where I was on the phone. 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.640
 the game sound of the game playing and I listened 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.480
 the background noise these beautiful children 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.490
 and I got shivered face a chill 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.060
 I did not know if I had come here from 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.800
 home and if in faro and in the horror movie 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.990
 then imagine this shit right 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.180
 I did not know if I came from the kyocera of the game. 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.330
 I even commented with the ph xv was playing 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.990
 together and he found it strange also 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.390
 other side he was on the other side of the 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.760
 map and said do not discuss anything do not 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.650
 made noise in was that in the game not there 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.770
 that got worse 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.510
 but then I went to search and found the 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.070
 videos talking about themselves easter egg and not 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.250
 there is only this noise that has no more 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.300
 three places here that have 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.300
 I'll show you 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.490
 there is one more here 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.370
 I do not know how you can activate me. 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.959
 I think you have to get here and 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.959
 to crouch down 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.920
 look that 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:25.580
 It's very strange here has another looks 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.350
 that these voices are of the can played the 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.350
 single player and it seems like a samba from a 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:35.270
 missions and the last one I'm not 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.660
 remembering where it's new that I came 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.660
 on here 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.950
 It's very cool, huh? 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.320
 The coolest of all is that I discovered 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.460
 by chance then you are not really 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.050
 played a trick on me is surprised but 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.950
 a pleasant surprise that no one was a 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.500
 scare but that 's it since that ball cagÃ£o 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.480
 here everyone says goodbye and even 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.870
 the next video guys said a hug 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.870
 too much
