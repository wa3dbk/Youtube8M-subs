so<00:00:00.989> we're<00:00:01.260> here<00:00:01.530> today<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.800> build<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.190> battery

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
so we're here today to build a battery

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.980 
so we're here today to build a battery
and<00:00:02.700> we're<00:00:02.820> building<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.179> wet<00:00:03.360> cell<00:00:03.629> battery

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
and we're building a wet cell battery

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.289 
and we're building a wet cell battery
and<00:00:04.350> if<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:04.920> read<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:05.220> page<00:00:05.430> eighteen<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.089> saw

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
and if you read on page eighteen you saw

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.550 
and if you read on page eighteen you saw
there's<00:00:06.600> two<00:00:06.779> different<00:00:06.899> types<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.410> batteries

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
there's two different types of batteries

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.940 
there's two different types of batteries
what<00:00:08.429> cell<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.000> dry<00:00:09.809> cell<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.800> brought

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
what cell and dry cell and I brought

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.070 
what cell and dry cell and I brought
with<00:00:11.160> me<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:11.969> demonstration<00:00:12.120> purposes

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
with me here for demonstration purposes

is working we also just want to see that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.679 
is working we also just want to see that
this<00:00:25.529> light<00:00:25.800> lights<00:00:26.130> off<00:00:26.400> okay<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.269> what<00:00:27.570> I'm

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
this light lights off okay so what I'm

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.900 
this light lights off okay so what I'm
gonna<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.109> just<00:00:28.230> apply<00:00:28.519> metals<00:00:29.519> metal<00:00:29.849> on

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
gonna do is just apply metals metal on

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.410 
gonna do is just apply metals metal on
this<00:00:30.090> side<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.449> positive<00:00:30.960> charge<00:00:31.279> and

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
this side of the positive charge and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.389 
this side of the positive charge and
metals<00:00:33.420> metal<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.710> negative<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.309> we're

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
metals metal on the negative and we're

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
metals metal on the negative and we're
gonna<00:00:35.489> make<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> closed<00:00:36.090> circuit<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.840> did<00:00:36.989> it

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
gonna make a closed circuit and did it

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.100 
gonna make a closed circuit and did it
light<00:00:37.230> up<00:00:37.850> it<00:00:38.850> sure<00:00:39.120> did<00:00:39.360> now<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.809> didn't

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
light up it sure did now if it didn't

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.110 
light up it sure did now if it didn't
light<00:00:40.260> up<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:41.100> could<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:42.000> are

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
light up what could we think what are

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.119 
light up what could we think what are
some<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> things<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.780> would<00:00:42.899> think<00:00:43.140> well

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
some of the things we would think well

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.680 
some of the things we would think well
some<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.820> them<00:00:44.940> would<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.390> maybe<00:00:45.570> we

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
some of them would be that maybe we

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.940 
some of them would be that maybe we
don't<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> good<00:00:46.170> connection<00:00:46.410> that's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
don't have a good connection that's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.200 
don't have a good connection that's
really<00:00:47.219> important<00:00:47.930> maybe<00:00:48.930> we've<00:00:49.530> run<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.829> of

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
really important maybe we've run out of

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.810 
really important maybe we've run out of
power<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.360> our<00:00:51.629> battery<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:53.100> lastly<00:00:53.489> we

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
power in our battery and then lastly we

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.189 
power in our battery and then lastly we
would<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.120> look<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.480> make<00:00:54.660> sure<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
would then look and make sure that the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.720 
would then look and make sure that the
light<00:00:55.350> bulb<00:00:55.500> actually<00:00:55.890> works<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.640> this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
light bulb actually works but in this

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.939 
light bulb actually works but in this
case<00:00:56.910> everything<00:00:57.120> works<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.829> this

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
case everything works so for this

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.560 
case everything works so for this
demonstration<00:00:59.160> and<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.300> you're<00:01:00.449> watching

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
demonstration and if you're watching

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.080 
demonstration and if you're watching
this<00:01:00.870> online<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.320> would<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.730> order<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
this online you would see in order to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.490 
this online you would see in order to
make<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> battery<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:04.049> need<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> following

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
make a battery we need the following

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.530 
make a battery we need the following
pieces<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.400> need<00:01:05.610> zinc<00:01:07.250> we<00:01:08.250> also<00:01:08.400> need<00:01:08.850> copper

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
pieces we need zinc we also need copper

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
pieces we need zinc we also need copper
and<00:01:09.750> these<00:01:10.229> represents<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> negative<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and these represents the negative and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.700 
and these represents the negative and
positive<00:01:11.490> sides<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:13.200> also<00:01:13.350> want<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
positive sides of it we also want to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.249 
positive sides of it we also want to
have<00:01:13.860> some<00:01:14.189> sort<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.520> separation<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.990> some

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
have some sort of separation so in some

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.100 
have some sort of separation so in some
cases<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.740> use<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.979> blotter<00:01:17.400> paper<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:18.990> I'm

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
cases we use a blotter paper but I'm

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.660 
cases we use a blotter paper but I'm
just<00:01:19.229> gonna<00:01:19.380> use<00:01:19.650> some<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.549> we

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
just gonna use some of this and all we

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
just gonna use some of this and all we
want<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.970> able<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.600> separate

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
want to be able to do is just separate

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.890 
want to be able to do is just separate
the<00:01:22.229> two<00:01:22.439> metals<00:01:23.220> from<00:01:23.430> each<00:01:23.520> other<00:01:23.780> but<00:01:24.780> we

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the two metals from each other but we

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
the two metals from each other but we
want<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> make<00:01:25.259> sure<00:01:25.549> that<00:01:26.549> they're<00:01:26.729> also

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
want to make sure that they're also

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.580 
want to make sure that they're also
interconnected<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.200> use<00:01:28.380> them

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
interconnected so that we can use them

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.149 
interconnected so that we can use them
as<00:01:28.740> well

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
as well

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.310 
as well
and<00:01:29.369> because<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> dry<00:01:30.630> cell<00:01:30.960> battery

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and because this is a dry cell battery

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.410 
and because this is a dry cell battery
it<00:01:31.439> use<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> paste<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:32.909> our<00:01:33.030> wet<00:01:33.180> cell

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it use the paste but for our wet cell

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.929 
it use the paste but for our wet cell
battery<00:01:33.780> we're<00:01:33.960> using<00:01:34.110> copper<00:01:34.979> sulfate<00:01:35.490> so

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
battery we're using copper sulfate so

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.910 
battery we're using copper sulfate so
it's<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.180> liquid<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> kind<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it's a liquid and this is the kind of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.319 
it's a liquid and this is the kind of
thing<00:01:38.070> you've<00:01:38.220> seen<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.520> car<00:01:38.759> battery<00:01:39.000> if

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
thing you've seen your car battery if

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
thing you've seen your car battery if
you<00:01:39.420> had<00:01:39.570> an<00:01:39.659> opportunity<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.170> use<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.740> even

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
you had an opportunity to use it or even

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.840 
you had an opportunity to use it or even
if

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
if

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.999 
if
we<00:01:41.909> had<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.380> let<00:01:43.380> me<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.650> here<00:01:43.830> like<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
we had a let me think here like a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.490 
we had a let me think here like a
lawnmower<00:01:44.630> rider<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.720> lot<00:01:45.869> more<00:01:46.080> they<00:01:46.229> use<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
lawnmower rider a lot more they use the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.289 
lawnmower rider a lot more they use the
white<00:01:46.650> cell<00:01:46.860> batteries<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.090> we're<00:01:48.210> gonna

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
white cell batteries to so we're gonna

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.550 
white cell batteries to so we're gonna
bend<00:01:48.540> these<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.960> way<00:01:49.140> we're<00:01:49.320> gonna<00:01:49.380> make

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
bend these this way we're gonna make

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.870 
bend these this way we're gonna make
connections<00:01:50.100> we're<00:01:50.250> actually<00:01:50.369> gonna<00:01:50.580> connect

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
connections we're actually gonna connect

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.719 
connections we're actually gonna connect
it<00:01:50.940> with<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.270> tape<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> makeshift

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it with some tape so this is a makeshift

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.300 
it with some tape so this is a makeshift
battery<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.350> we're<00:01:55.470> gonna<00:01:55.530> connect<00:01:56.159> these

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
battery and so we're gonna connect these

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.499 
battery and so we're gonna connect these
pieces<00:01:56.549> here<00:01:56.880> cuz<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.180> don't<00:01:57.390> want

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
pieces here cuz we just don't want

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.850 
pieces here cuz we just don't want
things<00:01:57.630> flopping<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.259> over<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.470> place<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
things flopping all over the place and

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.960 
things flopping all over the place and
we<00:01:58.950> want<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.190> be<00:01:59.250> able<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.580> solid

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
we want to be able to have solid

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.639 
we want to be able to have solid
connections<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.080> I'm<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.320> using<00:02:01.500> some

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
connections so I'm just using some

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.529 
connections so I'm just using some
masking<00:02:01.979> tape<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.399> put<00:02:02.640> them<00:02:02.789> together<00:02:02.909> and

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
masking tape to put them together and

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.020 
masking tape to put them together and
this<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.560> all<00:02:04.710> found<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.100> our<00:02:05.220> book<00:02:05.399> as<00:02:05.580> well<00:02:05.759> so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this is all found in our book as well so

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.590 
this is all found in our book as well so
you<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.330> use<00:02:07.170> page<00:02:07.500> 14<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.310> 15<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.940> walk<00:02:09.390> us

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
you can use page 14 and 15 to walk us

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.699 
you can use page 14 and 15 to walk us
through<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.050> we're<00:02:10.170> actually<00:02:10.289> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> be

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
through so we're actually going to be

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.900 
through so we're actually going to be
creating<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.370> battery<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.489> next<00:02:14.760> thing

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
creating this battery so the next thing

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.759 
creating this battery so the next thing
we're<00:02:15.030> gonna<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.630> we've<00:02:16.200> got<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.500> put

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
we're gonna do is we've got this put

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.500 
we're gonna do is we've got this put
together<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.400> now<00:02:17.850> we<00:02:17.910> got<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.239> make<00:02:18.300> sure<00:02:18.360> our

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
together and now we got to make sure our

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.570 
together and now we got to make sure our
connections<00:02:19.050> are<00:02:19.200> correct<00:02:19.709> remember<00:02:20.280> we<00:02:20.370> said

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
connections are correct remember we said

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.550 
connections are correct remember we said
that<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.360> I'm<00:02:21.510> gonna<00:02:21.600> connect<00:02:21.959> our<00:02:22.170> negative

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
that so I'm gonna connect our negative

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.229 
that so I'm gonna connect our negative
and<00:02:22.680> positive<00:02:23.160> by<00:02:23.340> using<00:02:23.519> little<00:02:23.880> pieces<00:02:24.060> of

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
and positive by using little pieces of

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.360 
and positive by using little pieces of
tape<00:02:24.510> here<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.800> want<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.010> make<00:02:26.100> sure<00:02:26.130> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
tape here and I want to make sure that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.949 
tape here and I want to make sure that
my<00:02:26.550> metal-to-metal<00:02:27.360> ism<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.250> very<00:02:29.250> well<00:02:29.959> set

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
my metal-to-metal ism is very well set

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.140 
my metal-to-metal ism is very well set
so<00:02:31.709> I'm<00:02:31.800> pushing<00:02:32.100> really<00:02:32.459> hard<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:32.940> that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
so I'm pushing really hard on that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.479 
so I'm pushing really hard on that
do<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:33.390> see<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.980> I'm<00:02:35.040> making<00:02:35.190> sure<00:02:35.340> that

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
do you see that so I'm making sure that

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.059 
do you see that so I'm making sure that
my<00:02:35.610> metal<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.060> touching<00:02:36.330> my<00:02:36.630> metal<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.980> I'm

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
my metal is touching my metal and I'm

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.259 
my metal is touching my metal and I'm
gonna<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.430> same<00:02:38.580> thing<00:02:38.640> with<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.060> side

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
gonna do the same thing with this side

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.180 
gonna do the same thing with this side
because<00:02:39.450> I'm<00:02:39.540> creating<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.900> closed<00:02:40.200> circuit<00:02:41.010> I

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
because I'm creating a closed circuit I

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.890 
because I'm creating a closed circuit I
remember<00:02:41.819> we<00:02:41.910> said<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.420> doesn't<00:02:42.750> light<00:02:42.870> up

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
remember we said if it doesn't light up

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.390 
remember we said if it doesn't light up
it's<00:02:43.200> because<00:02:43.410> either<00:02:43.620> our<00:02:43.830> circuit<00:02:44.220> doesn't

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
it's because either our circuit doesn't

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.090 
it's because either our circuit doesn't
work<00:02:44.640> or<00:02:44.850> we<00:02:44.910> don't<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.180> enough<00:02:45.390> power

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
work or we don't have enough power

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.410 
work or we don't have enough power
usually<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.430> not<00:02:47.489> because<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.000> light<00:02:48.180> bulb

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
usually it's not because the light bulb

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.420 
usually it's not because the light bulb
isn't<00:02:48.750> working<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.470> usually<00:02:50.100> when<00:02:50.220> there's<00:02:50.370> a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
isn't working so usually when there's a

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.400 
isn't working so usually when there's a
problem<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.820> electricity<00:02:51.239> we<00:02:51.930> check<00:02:52.200> all<00:02:52.380> of

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
problem of electricity we check all of

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.470 
problem of electricity we check all of
our<00:02:52.590> steps<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.820> shouldn't<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.239> checking

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
our steps you shouldn't be checking

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.180 
our steps you shouldn't be checking
electricity<00:02:55.049> snaps<00:02:55.350> but<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> electrician

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
electricity snaps but the electrician

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.930 
electricity snaps but the electrician
would<00:02:56.340> be<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.630> I've<00:02:57.750> made<00:02:57.780> two<00:02:58.640> I've<00:02:59.640> made

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
would be and so I've made two I've made

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.699 
would be and so I've made two I've made
sure<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.269> it's<00:03:00.450> connected<00:03:00.870> really<00:03:01.019> well<00:03:01.170> you

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
sure that it's connected really well you

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.920 
sure that it's connected really well you
see<00:03:01.890> these<00:03:01.980> two<00:03:02.160> pieces<00:03:02.340> here<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:03.239> now<00:03:03.750> we've

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
see these two pieces here and now we've

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.780 
see these two pieces here and now we've
created<00:03:04.109> our<00:03:04.380> battery<00:03:04.709> now<00:03:05.280> this<00:03:05.459> isn't<00:03:05.670> the

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
created our battery now this isn't the

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.160 
created our battery now this isn't the
battery<00:03:06.120> yet<00:03:06.329> because<00:03:06.690> what<00:03:06.780> we<00:03:06.900> need<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.109> do

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
battery yet because what we need to do

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.080 
battery yet because what we need to do
is<00:03:07.290> drop<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.769> copper<00:03:08.010> sulfate<00:03:08.730> and

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
is drop it in the copper sulfate and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.750 
is drop it in the copper sulfate and
this<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.720> our<00:03:09.870> electrolyte<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.190> electrolyte

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
this is our electrolyte the electrolyte

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.390 
this is our electrolyte the electrolyte
is<00:03:11.910> going<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.269> corrode<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.870> zinc<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
is going to corrode the zinc and the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.160 
is going to corrode the zinc and the
chemical<00:03:14.850> reaction<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> corrosion<00:03:15.840> is

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
chemical reaction of the corrosion is

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.170 
chemical reaction of the corrosion is
going<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.560> send<00:03:16.829> power<00:03:17.150> through<00:03:18.150> our

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
going to send power through our

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.569 
going to send power through our
connection<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:19.320> this<00:03:19.470> side<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:20.190> we'll<00:03:20.400> know

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
connection to this side and we'll know

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.400 
connection to this side and we'll know
that<00:03:20.609> power<00:03:20.970> is<00:03:21.239> taking<00:03:21.630> place<00:03:21.840> because<00:03:22.109> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
that power is taking place because the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.830 
that power is taking place because the
light<00:03:22.590> bulb<00:03:22.829> will<00:03:23.100> light<00:03:23.430> up<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.660> light

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
light bulb will light up so the light

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.270 
light bulb will light up so the light
bulb<00:03:25.049> has<00:03:25.200> nothing<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.560> do<00:03:25.739> with<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.980> battery

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
bulb has nothing to do with the battery

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.520 
bulb has nothing to do with the battery
it<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:27.180> indicates<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.049> there<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.350> power

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
it just indicates that there is power

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.940 
it just indicates that there is power
taking<00:03:29.010> place<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:30.030> we're<00:03:30.209> creating<00:03:30.950> potential

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
taking place so we're creating potential

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.390 
taking place so we're creating potential
energy<00:03:32.870> by<00:03:33.870> having<00:03:34.140> stored<00:03:34.620> energy<00:03:34.829> working

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
energy by having stored energy working

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.020 
energy by having stored energy working
together

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
together

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.960 
together
we're<00:03:36.240> using<00:03:36.480> stored<00:03:36.960> energy<00:03:37.110> which<00:03:37.440> is

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
we're using stored energy which is

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.820 
we're using stored energy which is
potential<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.060> created<00:03:39.420> kinetic<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.710> we're

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
potential and created kinetic so we're

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.670 
potential and created kinetic so we're
gonna<00:03:40.920> put<00:03:41.130> it<00:03:41.250> into<00:03:41.400> our<00:03:41.630> electrolyte<00:03:42.680> and

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
gonna put it into our electrolyte and

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.960 
gonna put it into our electrolyte and
then<00:03:43.830> we'll<00:03:43.980> see<00:03:44.130> if<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.310> lights<00:03:44.490> up<00:03:44.670> ready

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
then we'll see if it lights up ready

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.940 
then we'll see if it lights up ready
here<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.210> go<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.850> see<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.090> light<00:03:48.270> up<00:03:48.950> so

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
here we go and you see it light up so

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.620 
here we go and you see it light up so
what's<00:03:50.160> happening<00:03:50.550> is<00:03:50.730> our<00:03:50.820> electrolyte<00:03:51.390> has

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
what's happening is our electrolyte has

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.780 
what's happening is our electrolyte has
allowed<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.709> chemical<00:03:53.340> reaction<00:03:53.550> to<00:03:53.730> take

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
allowed a chemical reaction to take

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.400 
allowed a chemical reaction to take
place<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.240> the<00:03:54.330> metals<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:55.110> running<00:03:55.380> through

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
place in the metals it's running through

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.030 
place in the metals it's running through
the<00:03:55.620> circuit

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
the circuit

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.640 
the circuit
everything<00:03:56.459> was<00:03:56.700> tight<00:03:57.240> and<00:03:57.510> if<00:03:58.020> we<00:03:58.170> had<00:03:58.350> even

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
everything was tight and if we had even

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.949 
everything was tight and if we had even
more<00:03:58.920> powerful<00:03:59.430> solution<00:04:00.000> we'd<00:04:00.540> have<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:00.720> more

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
more powerful solution we'd have a more

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.020 
more powerful solution we'd have a more
powerful<00:04:01.170> light<00:04:01.680> kind<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.550> like<00:04:02.670> when<00:04:02.820> we<00:04:02.850> use

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
powerful light kind of like when we use

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.020 
powerful light kind of like when we use
the<00:04:03.209> dry<00:04:03.420> cell<00:04:03.690> battery
