white<00:00:56.579> parts<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.149> don't<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:57.930> camera<00:00:58.289> can

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
white parts I don't think my camera can

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:08.990 
white parts I don't think my camera can
catch<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.859> but<00:01:00.859> right<00:01:01.859> there<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.670> B

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
catch it but right there so this is B

striker<00:01:10.130> he's<00:01:11.130> got<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> his<00:01:12.270> head<00:01:12.510> goes<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
striker he's got a his head goes in and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
striker he's got a his head goes in and
out<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.340> think<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.270> parts<00:01:15.540> for<00:01:15.720> closing<00:01:16.140> he's

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
out I think that parts for closing he's

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.270 
out I think that parts for closing he's
got<00:01:16.439> two<00:01:16.650> huge<00:01:17.159> wings<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.890> as<00:01:19.890> soon<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.100> he

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
got two huge wings and as soon as he

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.760 
got two huge wings and as soon as he
opens<00:01:20.610> up<00:01:20.759> yeah<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.080> little<00:01:22.290> stinger

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
opens up yeah I like this little stinger

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.810 
opens up yeah I like this little stinger
you<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.970> flip<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.830> he's<00:01:25.830> got<00:01:26.009> red<00:01:26.250> details

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
you just flip out he's got red details

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.410 
you just flip out he's got red details
and<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.689> stinger<00:01:28.049> part<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.759> think<00:01:29.759> they<00:01:30.060> made<00:01:30.299> him

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
and a stinger part I think they made him

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.179 
and a stinger part I think they made him
so<00:01:30.630> he<00:01:30.720> looked<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.049> he'd<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.409> ready<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.860> fly

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
so he looked like he'd be ready to fly

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.990 
so he looked like he'd be ready to fly
in<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.640> sting<00:01:33.030> something<00:01:34.430> his<00:01:35.430> eyes<00:01:35.729> look

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
in and sting something his eyes look

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.530 
in and sting something his eyes look
angry<00:01:36.829> but<00:01:37.829> his<00:01:37.979> head's<00:01:38.220> kind<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.610> small<00:01:41.540> but

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.480 
seen that video that one person made I
forget<00:02:03.390> their<00:02:03.570> name<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:04.950> called<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.369> a

custom<00:02:06.180> harm<00:02:06.540> annoyed<00:02:07.610> it's<00:02:08.610> actually<00:02:09.209> easy

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
custom harm annoyed it's actually easy

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.940 
custom harm annoyed it's actually easy
to<00:02:09.869> make

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
to make

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.559 
to make
all<00:02:12.950> you<00:02:13.130> have<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.310> do<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:13.790> take<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> bee<00:02:14.300> striker

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
all you have to do is take a bee striker

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.840 
all you have to do is take a bee striker
for<00:02:15.020> those<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.470> who<00:02:15.590> don't<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:15.890> and

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
for those of you who don't know and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.380 
for those of you who don't know and
place<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.209> like<00:02:17.330> this<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.209> basically

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
place it like this and this is basically

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.090 
place it like this and this is basically
all<00:02:20.660> they<00:02:20.959> did<00:02:21.110> for<00:02:21.319> one<00:02:21.590> away<00:02:24.910> that's<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.090> I

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
all they did for one away that's it I

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.660 
all they did for one away that's it I
think<00:02:28.100> it's<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.340> pretty<00:02:28.640> cool<00:02:28.910> customization<00:02:29.900> I

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
think it's a pretty cool customization I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.270 
think it's a pretty cool customization I
think<00:02:32.200> would<00:02:33.200> have<00:02:33.260> been<00:02:33.320> better<00:02:33.709> if<00:02:33.890> they

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
think would have been better if they

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.150 
think would have been better if they
were<00:02:34.340> somehow<00:02:34.820> able<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:36.080> put<00:02:36.260> like<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.470> magnet

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
were somehow able to put like a magnet

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.729 
were somehow able to put like a magnet
where<00:02:37.370> these<00:02:37.880> strikers<00:02:38.239> have<00:02:38.930> was<00:02:39.170> originally

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
where these strikers have was originally

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.040 
where these strikers have was originally
supposed<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.220> be<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.450> could<00:02:41.600> stay<00:02:41.810> like

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
supposed to be so you could stay like

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.110 
supposed to be so you could stay like
this<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:43.130> could<00:02:43.250> be<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:43.580> like<00:02:43.640> a<00:02:43.730> swap

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
this and it could be just like a swap

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.360 
this and it could be just like a swap
Bakugan<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:46.270> would<00:02:47.270> be<00:02:47.390> pretty<00:02:47.600> sweet

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
Bakugan that would be pretty sweet

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.610 
Bakugan that would be pretty sweet
