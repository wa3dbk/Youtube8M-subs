00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:10.899
 that does not let this happen 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:12.220
 they start from home 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.269
 Sometimes flat Schiller Celia speaks to cook 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.070
 they pull 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.460
 Chris Cool's Acorn Activity 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.069
 industrial production of many products used 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.969
 I do not want them to taste it and I'm just one 

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:26.999
 human 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.149
 Kulagin is unity 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.290
 How will the students actually be able to pull 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.480
 Hertie is made in a state of the art complicated process 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.300
 almost everything in a so-called closed systems 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.270
 Großburgwedel steel container and a lot of know-how and and wait for what value 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.159
 so that we understand better 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.850
 what's going on there 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.140
 Try to make Hill Hattingen yourself 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.600
 First of all, we need the starting material 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.210
 Timo Staffeldt, for example, we take a piece of pigs 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.290
 pork belly 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.100
 the rind is cut off from this because it contains the cool stuff 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.870
 consists of childish latif 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.850
 in pig skin and also in human skin is cool AG 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.510
 per title 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.320
 and right that's exactly what you need and every title to make 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.450
 but how do you get that color out of the slippers out the rind 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.409
 is cut into small pieces of about 3 millimeters 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.950
 and put in the water 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.679
 for this so Pröll 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.239
 is about to be returned and that cola go suddenly to make us use 

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.350
 easy here 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.800
 this area 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.670
 is now heated several times at different temperatures 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.200
 so that the cola dissolves better in the water 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.200
 there is still a great solution 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.090
 by warming up and the soldiers are left standing layers 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.899
 and now 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.740
 they are the solid parts 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.750
 with the help of this resolution and below 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.310
 a sounding layer 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.649
 but only the middle class matters 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.040
 the fat and solid ingredients 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.549
 are removed by a centrifuge 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.229
 and the coal fare solution is packed in Veit 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.259
 This process is called extraction 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.849
 Beijing an elaborate cleaning processes 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.469
 still the smallest parts in the Collective Sunset 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:30.780
 these for example 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.279
 over there Aachen 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:36.489
 so that one now clearly describes Inge gets evaluates this cloudy liquid 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.949
 was missing 

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.600
 to emphasize feat in the factory 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.449
 made a mistake 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.080
 this will be called 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.769
 Carrara mixer micro filter used 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.529
 with changes pressure 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.220
 the color will go solution 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.970
 pressed through the filter and through these tiny holes with the bare 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.849
 Eye are not visible at all 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:59.910
 then comes 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.689
 the clear solution out again 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.170
 by the way, the entire missing extends 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.559
 Zwicker 3000 meters were 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:12.239
 the cleaning process is still not complete it still is 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.829
 Salts in the solution and the water must still be made 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:17.379
 for this 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.180
 this liquid runs through these huge cauldrons 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.739
 the kettles are led with beads 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.909
 they almost look like brown sugar but they are 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.319
 has trains standing 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.429
 the Cola Gene solution flows through them 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.690
 and the salt still contained 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.439
 stay in the beads 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.330
 the solution 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.050
 Now go through these long each steel tubes and fight in point 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.330
 These huge tanks are heated until the water evaporates 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.770
 so stay of about 2 go to Cola go solution 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.959
 Noack was 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.359
 200 milliliters of honey Articus concentrate left over 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.059
 this process is called 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:01.749
 actually come 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:06.789
 now real latina note again heated very briefly 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.999
 to kill germs 

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:11.959
 to preserve the gelatin 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.529
 then the crew will not cool down finished solution and and one more 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.929
 Slice pressed while the so-called Gellert arise him the noodle 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.270
 which fall on a conveyor belt and then dried very slowly 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.879
 with warm voice again air 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.659
 Now Stone and the rest of the water from the modeling is due 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.529
 every teen star Getty 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.390
 come out on the other side 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.520
 has crushed and 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.150
 to pole-setter times 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.210
 the powder 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.380
 then in the big so-called 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.319
 BK at 1 2 1000 kg 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.639
 stored 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.590
 every customer who signs Inge for his products orders 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.969
 has very specific requirements 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.939
 which must meet these goals and plump 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.430
 I would like to be able to reorder the same variety over and over again 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.180
 So there are no standards in Rtg 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.569
 Every customer he keeps owns his own custom-made Chile Taiji 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.809
 Among other things, they are then the beautiful pictures by 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:19.809
 to make the reclassification 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:24.440
 something else 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.440
 it is in the making and said Chad active this is just important 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.530
 every single sheet always has the same characteristics 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:37.800
 to do this i was pretty cool was the data water solved 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.819
 and on a so-called 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:41.960
 Cytonet applied 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.469
 This creates a three-way fight 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.469
 Hamilton Massa is arguing with the narrow Bender 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.860
 I remember Bender 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.840
 because laid on a net which slowly through a about 150 meters long 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.979
 dryness 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.650
 At the end, the foundations become stripes 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.650
 Write a report 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.680
 from here tricks the swat Latina of their journey into the kitchens of the world 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:14.440
 On all continents she says the time is running her team 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.379
 many goodies jello 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:18.900
 so must Schuler 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.869
 or Panna Cotta 

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:23.619
 and that would land then 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:24.539
 be here 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.199
 End of August will be 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.910
 to be in the run-up to the game
