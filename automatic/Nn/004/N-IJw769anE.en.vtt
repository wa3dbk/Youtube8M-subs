00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360

high-speed sync for a different reason

high-speed sync for a different reason
with<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> portrait<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.250> because<00:00:17.550> we<00:00:17.670> wanted<00:00:17.940> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
with the portrait is because we wanted a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.420 
with the portrait is because we wanted a
shallow<00:00:18.240> depth<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.720> field<00:00:18.960> for<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.920> action

photography<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:21.449> need<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.840> freeze<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.619> action

photography we need to freeze the action
you<00:00:23.699> may<00:00:23.939> think<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.510> 250th<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.380> second

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
you may think that a 250th of a second

you may think that a 250th of a second
at<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> standard<00:00:26.670> sync<00:00:26.970> speed<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.449> plenty<00:00:28.140> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
at a standard sync speed is plenty to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
at a standard sync speed is plenty to
freeze<00:00:28.560> action<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.640> often<00:00:30.060> times<00:00:30.269> especially

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
freeze action but often times especially

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.939 
freeze action but often times especially
with<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> little<00:00:31.199> bit<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> telephoto<00:00:31.830> lens

with a little bit of a telephoto lens

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.610 
with a little bit of a telephoto lens
it's<00:00:32.399> not<00:00:32.610> nearly<00:00:33.030> fast<00:00:33.480> enough<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.350> freeze

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it's not nearly fast enough to freeze

it's not nearly fast enough to freeze
the<00:00:34.800> action<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.700> need<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.030> shoot<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> faster

here<00:00:50.399> we're<00:00:50.700> going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:50.940> an<00:00:51.030> action<00:00:51.449> shot<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
here we're going to do an action shot of

here we're going to do an action shot of
Mitch<00:00:51.989> fly<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> off<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.949> jump<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.780> a

Mitch fly and off this jump if we do a

Mitch fly and off this jump if we do a
straight<00:00:55.680> ambient<00:00:56.219> exposure<00:00:56.539> we've<00:00:57.539> got<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
straight ambient exposure we've got a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.119 
straight ambient exposure we've got a
pretty<00:00:57.989> dramatic<00:00:58.140> sky<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.859> you're<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
pretty dramatic sky but you're going to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.040 
pretty dramatic sky but you're going to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
see that he's pretty dark if we expose

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.660 
see that he's pretty dark if we expose
for<00:01:01.320> him<00:01:01.530> we're<00:01:01.770> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.949> lose<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> drama<00:01:02.520> in

for him we're going to lose the drama in
the<00:01:02.699> sky<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.960> expose<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> sky<00:01:05.189> we're

the sky if we expose for the sky we're
going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> lose<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> detail<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.720> him<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.200> we're

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
going to lose the detail on him so we're

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.660 
going to lose the detail on him so we're
going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> bring<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> best<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.159> both<00:01:08.280> worlds

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
together we're going to have him jump up

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.960 
together we're going to have him jump up
in<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> air<00:01:10.950> we're<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.340> keep<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> sky

dark and we're going to bring the speed
lights<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.210> pop<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:15.960> light<00:01:16.409> into

falling<00:01:46.920> off<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> ramp<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:48.049> great<00:01:49.049> in

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
falling off the ramp there great in

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.649 
falling off the ramp there great in
order<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> make<00:01:50.549> sure<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.820> camera<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.509> going

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
order to make sure the camera is going

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.179 
order to make sure the camera is going
to<00:01:51.720> communicate<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> speed<00:01:52.649> lights<00:01:52.890> I'm

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
to communicate with the speed lights I'm

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.910 
to communicate with the speed lights I'm
in<00:01:53.430> commander<00:01:53.820> mode<00:01:54.000> got<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> pop<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.590> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
in commander mode got to pop this up so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.230 
in commander mode got to pop this up so
the<00:01:56.040> sensor<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.549> communicating<00:01:57.210> with

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the sensor is communicating with

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.030 
the sensor is communicating with
everything<00:01:57.810> Ted<00:01:58.590> you're<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:58.890> going<00:01:59.009> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
everything Ted you're just going to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.429 
everything Ted you're just going to
track<00:01:59.369> him<00:01:59.549> as<00:01:59.670> he<00:01:59.759> comes<00:02:00.000> through<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.990> when

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
track him as he comes through and when

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:13.150 
track him as he comes through and when
you're<00:02:01.590> ready

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.980 

on<00:02:14.160> our<00:02:14.280> first<00:02:14.460> couple<00:02:14.850> passes<00:02:15.330> here<00:02:15.570> with<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
on our first couple passes here with the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.980 
on our first couple passes here with the
diffusion<00:02:16.470> on<00:02:17.040> our<00:02:17.760> softbox<00:02:18.300> we're<00:02:18.570> still<00:02:18.840> not

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
diffusion on our softbox we're still not

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.660 
diffusion on our softbox we're still not
getting<00:02:19.140> enough<00:02:19.500> power<00:02:19.740> output<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.310> really

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
getting enough power output to really

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.310 
getting enough power output to really
creating<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.180> dramatic<00:02:21.630> lighting<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.140> we've

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
creating a dramatic lighting so we've

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.050 
creating a dramatic lighting so we've
pulled<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.710> diffusion<00:02:23.220> off<00:02:23.370> we're<00:02:23.910> going<00:02:24.000> to

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
pulled the diffusion off we're going to

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.610 
pulled the diffusion off we're going to
end<00:02:24.240> up<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.540> little<00:02:24.840> more<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.200> specular

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
end up with a little more of a specular

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.410 
end up with a little more of a specular
light<00:02:25.860> source<00:02:26.160> but<00:02:26.550> at<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.940> end<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.240> day

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
light source but at the end of the day

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.880 
light source but at the end of the day
it's<00:02:27.660> more<00:02:27.810> important<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.320> get<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.470> lighting

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
it's more important to get the lighting

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.890 
it's more important to get the lighting
you<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.510> sometimes<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.780> to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
you want and sometimes you just have to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.510 
you want and sometimes you just have to
compromise<00:02:31.380> with<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.830> tools<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.250> on

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
compromise with the tools you have on

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.190 
compromise with the tools you have on
location<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.300> we're<00:02:33.780> going<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.930> try<00:02:34.140> this

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
location so we're going to try this

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
location so we're going to try this
again

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
again

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.010 
again
we're<00:02:35.670> in<00:02:35.760> commander<00:02:36.150> mode<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.600> we<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
we're in commander mode and we just the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.600 
we're in commander mode and we just the
only<00:02:37.140> difference<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.830> we<00:02:38.250> don't<00:02:38.460> have

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
only difference here is we don't have

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.980 
only difference here is we don't have
the<00:02:38.880> diffusion<00:02:39.330> on<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.660> front<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
softbox when you're ready an important

softbox when you're ready an important
thing<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.150> keep<00:02:51.270> in<00:02:51.420> mind<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.840> you're<00:02:51.960> going<00:02:52.080> to

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
thing to keep in mind if you're going to

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.960 
thing to keep in mind if you're going to
try<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.350> use<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.770> technique<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.580> if

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
try to use this technique is that if

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.240 
try to use this technique is that if
you're<00:02:54.120> only<00:02:54.390> using<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:55.140> single<00:02:55.770> speed<00:02:56.040> light

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
you're only using a single speed light

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.210 
you're only using a single speed light
in<00:02:56.460> high<00:02:57.030> speed<00:02:57.390> sync<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.260> may<00:02:58.680> not<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:59.130> able

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
in high speed sync you may not be able

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.830 
in high speed sync you may not be able
to<00:02:59.370> get<00:02:59.550> enough<00:02:59.850> light<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.330> your<00:03:00.600> subject

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
to get enough light on your subject

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.250 
to get enough light on your subject
matter<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:02.010> override<00:03:02.430> or<00:03:03.030> even<00:03:03.450> meet<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
matter to override or even meet the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.200 
matter to override or even meet the
ambient<00:03:04.770> exposure<00:03:04.890> if<00:03:05.490> you're<00:03:05.670> only<00:03:05.880> working

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
ambient exposure if you're only working

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.050 
ambient exposure if you're only working
with<00:03:06.480> one<00:03:06.540> speed<00:03:06.990> like<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:08.130> we're<00:03:08.310> using<00:03:08.610> a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
with one speed like so we're using a

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.930 
with one speed like so we're using a
softbox<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.170> we<00:03:10.680> have<00:03:10.890> four<00:03:11.280> speed<00:03:11.670> lights

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
softbox and we have four speed lights

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.240 
softbox and we have four speed lights
inside<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.750> there<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.530> reason<00:03:13.920> why<00:03:14.070> we

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
inside of there and the reason why we

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.130 
inside of there and the reason why we
need<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.550> have<00:03:14.700> four<00:03:15.060> speed<00:03:15.360> lights<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:15.870> for

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
need to have four speed lights is for

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.699 
need to have four speed lights is for
two<00:03:16.320> reasons<00:03:16.350> one<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.420> want<00:03:18.660> more<00:03:19.050> coverage

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
two reasons one is we want more coverage

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.680 
two reasons one is we want more coverage
a<00:03:19.920> single<00:03:20.400> light<00:03:20.550> sources<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.030> small<00:03:21.450> light

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
a single light sources a small light

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.420 
a single light sources a small light
source<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.590> it's<00:03:22.739> going<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.920> be<00:03:23.040> more<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.370> a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
source so it's going to be more of a

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.729 
source so it's going to be more of a
pinpointed<00:03:24.330> type<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.660> light<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.080> it's<00:03:25.590> going

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
pinpointed type of light and it's going

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.470 
pinpointed type of light and it's going
to<00:03:25.800> be<00:03:25.920> very<00:03:26.100> contrasting<00:03:26.970> as<00:03:27.090> we<00:03:27.300> add<00:03:27.450> more

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
to be very contrasting as we add more

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.330 
to be very contrasting as we add more
light<00:03:28.080> we're<00:03:28.320> actually<00:03:28.440> making<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:29.130> bigger

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
light we're actually making a bigger

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.830 
light we're actually making a bigger
light<00:03:29.640> source<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.239> that's<00:03:30.390> going<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.600> give<00:03:30.720> us

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
light source and that's going to give us

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.110 
light source and that's going to give us
a<00:03:30.959> little<00:03:31.170> softer<00:03:31.860> quality<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.400> light<00:03:32.640> coming

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
a little softer quality of light coming

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.260 
a little softer quality of light coming
out<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.390> that<00:03:33.660> softbox<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:35.100> second<00:03:35.730> reason<00:03:35.910> is

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
out of that softbox the second reason is

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.720 
out of that softbox the second reason is
when<00:03:36.540> we<00:03:36.690> shoot<00:03:37.080> at<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.380> high<00:03:37.770> shutter<00:03:38.130> speed<00:03:38.250> in

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
when we shoot at a high shutter speed in

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.199 
when we shoot at a high shutter speed in
high-speed<00:03:39.270> sync<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.470> power<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:41.400> those<00:03:41.730> speed

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
high-speed sync the power of those speed

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.510 
high-speed sync the power of those speed
lights<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:42.750> really<00:03:43.470> diminished<00:03:44.070> if<00:03:44.400> you're

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
lights is really diminished if you're

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.280 
lights is really diminished if you're
trying<00:03:44.880> this<00:03:45.000> technique<00:03:45.450> with<00:03:45.600> only<00:03:45.780> one

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
trying this technique with only one

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.199 
trying this technique with only one
speed<00:03:46.770> light<00:03:47.040> there's<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.520> to<00:03:47.580> be<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.730> series

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
speed light there's going to be a series

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.240 
speed light there's going to be a series
of<00:03:48.239> continuous<00:03:48.989> pulses<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.680> are<00:03:49.739> coming<00:03:50.130> out

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
of continuous pulses that are coming out

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.070 
of continuous pulses that are coming out
of<00:03:50.280> that<00:03:50.430> speed<00:03:50.820> light<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.660> has<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.930> be<00:03:52.050> a

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
of that speed light that has to be a

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.380 
of that speed light that has to be a
very<00:03:52.440> fast<00:03:52.860> recycle<00:03:53.550> time<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.000> in<00:03:54.090> order<00:03:54.360> for

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
very fast recycle time and in order for

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.870 
very fast recycle time and in order for
the<00:03:54.630> speed<00:03:54.870> light<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.200> do<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:56.100> power<00:03:56.519> of

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
the speed light to do that the power of

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.400 
the speed light to do that the power of
that<00:03:57.030> speed<00:03:57.300> light<00:03:57.450> has<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.780> come<00:03:57.989> down<00:03:58.200> in

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
that speed light has to come down in

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.170 
that speed light has to come down in
order<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.680> be<00:03:58.830> able<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.160> achieve<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.820> effect

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
order to be able to achieve that effect

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.470 
order to be able to achieve that effect
and<00:04:00.989> when<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.410> happens<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.340> get<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.519> very<00:04:03.060> low

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
and when that happens you get a very low

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.110 
and when that happens you get a very low
power<00:04:03.930> output<00:04:04.140> with<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> single<00:04:05.640> speed<00:04:05.910> light

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
power output with a single speed light

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.360 
power output with a single speed light
so<00:04:06.780> in<00:04:06.930> order<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.260> compensate<00:04:07.530> for<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.010> we've

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
so in order to compensate for that we've

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.370 
so in order to compensate for that we've
added<00:04:08.610> multiple<00:04:09.180> speed<00:04:09.570> lights<00:04:09.810> into<00:04:10.200> that

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
added multiple speed lights into that

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.170 
added multiple speed lights into that
box<00:04:10.650> which<00:04:11.100> are<00:04:11.250> all<00:04:11.400> working<00:04:11.700> in<00:04:11.970> conjunction

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
box which are all working in conjunction

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.110 
box which are all working in conjunction
and<00:04:12.840> then<00:04:13.440> we're<00:04:13.980> bringing<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.370> exposure

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
and then we're bringing that exposure

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.720 
and then we're bringing that exposure
from<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.690> softbox<00:04:16.470> up<00:04:16.709> by<00:04:17.190> having<00:04:17.370> multiple

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
from that softbox up by having multiple

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.860 
from that softbox up by having multiple
sources

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
sources

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.569 
sources
and<00:04:18.989> that's<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.350> reason<00:04:19.500> in<00:04:19.769> this<00:04:19.889> case<00:04:19.949> we

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
and that's the reason in this case we

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.530 
and that's the reason in this case we
used<00:04:20.820> four<00:04:21.269> speed<00:04:21.570> lights<00:04:21.840> as<00:04:22.079> our<00:04:22.290> main<00:04:23.540> now

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
used four speed lights as our main now

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.340 
used four speed lights as our main now
when<00:04:24.690> you're<00:04:24.780> ready<00:04:24.930> we've<00:04:25.080> got<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.199> little

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
when you're ready we've got a little

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.680 
when you're ready we've got a little
wardrobe<00:04:25.740> change<00:04:26.310> here<00:04:26.669> put<00:04:27.150> mitch<00:04:27.300> in<00:04:27.419> a<00:04:27.510> red

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
wardrobe change here put mitch in a red

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.740 
wardrobe change here put mitch in a red
shirt<00:04:27.960> let's<00:04:28.770> get<00:04:28.979> a<00:04:29.010> different<00:04:29.160> look<00:04:32.750> killer

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
shirt let's get a different look killer

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.850 
shirt let's get a different look killer
that's<00:04:34.110> great<00:04:34.440> one<00:04:35.870> tell<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:36.900> Sun<00:04:37.320> streaking

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
that's great one tell the Sun streaking

00:04:37.860 --> 00:05:08.990 
that's great one tell the Sun streaking
out<00:04:38.010> looking<00:04:38.850> good<00:05:05.090> cool<00:05:06.090> think<00:05:06.600> they<00:05:06.690> got<00:05:06.810> it
