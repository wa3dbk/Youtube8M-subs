what<00:00:41.070> I'm<00:00:41.190> doing<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.020> hope<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.350> guys

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

what I'm doing so I hope you guys
enjoyed<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.129> play

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.500 

so<00:00:57.230> what<00:00:57.800> did<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:58.040> really<00:00:58.430> do<00:00:58.610> on<00:00:58.820> that<00:00:59.030> clip<00:00:59.270> I

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
so what did I really do on that clip I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.080 
so what did I really do on that clip I
started<00:00:59.930> off<00:01:00.080> with<00:01:00.500> throwing<00:01:01.130> my<00:01:01.340> wrench<00:01:01.790> that

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
started off with throwing my wrench that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.110 
started off with throwing my wrench that
throws<00:01:02.510> your<00:01:02.780> wrench<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.370> it<00:01:04.519> returns<00:01:04.879> to

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
throws your wrench and so it returns to

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.290 
throws your wrench and so it returns to
you<00:01:05.239> and<00:01:05.600> it's<00:01:05.840> rice<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.380> foals<00:01:06.650> twice<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.210> it

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
you and it's rice the foals twice so it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.420 
you and it's rice the foals twice so it
goes<00:01:08.479> through<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:09.080> PO<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:09.290> back<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.190> and

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
goes through the PO and back to you and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.350 
goes through the PO and back to you and
it's<00:01:10.610> pretty<00:01:11.240> easy<00:01:11.479> to<00:01:11.630> avoid<00:01:12.820> when<00:01:13.820> it's<00:01:14.030> on

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
it's pretty easy to avoid when it's on

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.840 
it's pretty easy to avoid when it's on
the<00:01:14.900> way<00:01:15.080> back<00:01:15.320> that's<00:01:16.130> why<00:01:16.280> I'm<00:01:16.400> using<00:01:16.640> my

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
the way back that's why I'm using my

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.930 
the way back that's why I'm using my
overcharge<00:01:17.720> shops<00:01:18.590> that's<00:01:19.160> on<00:01:19.430> my<00:01:19.610> for

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
overcharge shops that's on my for

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.080 
overcharge shops that's on my for
ability<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:21.350> launches<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.220> fall<00:01:22.490> back<00:01:22.760> and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
ability that launches the fall back and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.120 
ability that launches the fall back and
so<00:01:23.810> do<00:01:24.229> i<00:01:24.260> and<00:01:25.210> that's<00:01:26.210> why<00:01:26.600> i<00:01:26.930> use<00:01:27.260> my<00:01:27.560> utility

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
so do i and that's why i use my utility

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.999 
so do i and that's why i use my utility
goggles<00:01:28.580> also<00:01:28.970> deaths<00:01:29.240> breaks<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.840> stun<00:01:30.140> from

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
goggles also deaths breaks the stun from

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.540 
goggles also deaths breaks the stun from
the<00:01:31.310> overcharge<00:01:32.300> shop<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:33.290> i<00:01:33.320> can<00:01:33.680> get<00:01:34.130> back<00:01:34.520> on

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
the overcharge shop so i can get back on

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.480 
the overcharge shop so i can get back on
my<00:01:34.759> feet<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.330> start<00:01:36.080> dealing<00:01:36.350> more<00:01:36.920> damage<00:01:36.979> to

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
my feet and start dealing more damage to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.930 
my feet and start dealing more damage to
and<00:01:38.300> here's<00:01:39.290> another<00:01:39.350> trick<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.729> clip<00:01:40.910> is

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
and here's another trick and the clip is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.410 
and here's another trick and the clip is
very<00:01:41.570> short<00:01:41.840> but<00:01:41.960> i'm<00:01:42.860> using<00:01:43.280> my<00:01:43.310> alexei<00:01:44.060> or<00:01:44.180> s

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
very short but i'm using my alexei or s

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.710 
very short but i'm using my alexei or s
that<00:01:45.520> shrinks<00:01:46.520> yourselves<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.210> recovers

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
that shrinks yourselves and recovers

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.770 
that shrinks yourselves and recovers
from<00:01:47.930> stun<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.560> Vader<00:01:49.100> text<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.210> its<00:01:50.390> really

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
from stun and Vader text and its really

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.020 
from stun and Vader text and its really
good<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.080> use<00:01:51.770> when<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.280> are<00:01:52.310> trying<00:01:52.729> to

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
good to use when you are trying to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.480 
good to use when you are trying to
finish<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.720> enemy<00:01:54.110> or<00:01:54.350> you're<00:01:54.890> trying<00:01:55.250> to

rest your from the target without
