almost did at the same time or something
but<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.960> didn't<00:01:33.960> really<00:01:34.079> hear<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.500> well

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
but I didn't really hear so well

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.380 
but I didn't really hear so well
yes<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:36.090> deaf<00:01:36.329> now<00:01:36.540> okay<00:01:36.869> everybody<00:01:37.320> so

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
yes I'm deaf now okay everybody so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.149

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
that's what happened first but then I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
that's what happened first but then I
guess<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.880> wasn't<00:01:42.060> fully<00:01:42.450> deleted<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
guess it wasn't fully deleted like the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.539 
guess it wasn't fully deleted like the
memory<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.950> Google<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:45.180> wasn't<00:01:45.420> fully<00:01:46.549> done

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
memory on Google like wasn't fully done

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.109 
memory on Google like wasn't fully done
for<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.780> Julian<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> simply<00:01:50.100> logged<00:01:50.490> back<00:01:50.850> on

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
for so Julian to simply logged back on

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.139 
for so Julian to simply logged back on

though at the same time she's like he
deserved<00:03:50.419> it<00:03:50.659> but<00:03:50.840> then<00:03:51.049> just<00:03:51.799> 45<00:03:52.579> minutes

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909

so I guess 'sir is her FAS I don't know

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.619 
so I guess 'sir is her FAS I don't know
what<00:03:58.939> it<00:03:59.000> stands<00:03:59.209> for<00:03:59.359> but<00:03:59.540> um<00:04:00.939> did<00:04:01.939> that<00:04:02.180> she

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
what it stands for but um did that she

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.629 
what it stands for but um did that she
said<00:04:02.810> if<00:04:03.139> she<00:04:03.199> had<00:04:03.379> like<00:04:03.769> 20<00:04:04.099> more<00:04:04.250> minutes<00:04:04.400> to

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
said if she had like 20 more minutes to

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.149 
said if she had like 20 more minutes to
think<00:04:04.790> about<00:04:04.909> it<00:04:05.290> because<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.650> all<00:04:06.769> happened

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159
