00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.850
 I'm going to explain the spear a projectile 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:18.250
 the magic year and go back to the position 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.250
 of area then let's say we do not throw 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.179
 and it's coming here 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.179
 I'm like this but now it's the same 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.720
 now what three games ago 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.850
 no one 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.329
 to the enemy 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.000
 It can also be what we 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.850
 we want 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.840
 do not 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.180
 the passive 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.720
 what it does is that when you have 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.910
 credibility 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.000
 stand out 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.330
 this the passive and what does that when 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.330
 come 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.790
 let say 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.790
 to gas plus life robbery with the facts 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.060
 one 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.299
 and then for example if you are in phase 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.299
 line and you want to have the massive 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.770
 since the passive is regenerated more 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.340
 quickly the water is marked 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.340
 3 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.100
 as it is only a shell of anything because 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.100
 it's going to be lonely 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.439
 and now 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.900
 what makes him instantly 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.170
 look at a jump 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.180
 not this 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.799
 and in the next 100 seconds you can 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.799
 throw the jumps more 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.340
 now let's move 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.310
 with ari 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:28.060
 you could choose magical penetration 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:31.570
 for the runes with these and good the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.480
 glyphs that I could choose resistance 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.290
 magical although good if you have 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.300
 quite a page of moons and you make maine 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.110
 with ari you can have for example against 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:48.340
 to then choose this armor 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.530
 and with the stamps you can take life by 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.770
 level or simply life that I do not know if 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.430
 that was good if and if not then you can 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.990
 I take only ap ap 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.590
 so 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.590
 in essences you can catch or 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.760
 armor penetration 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.760
 how can life be 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.920
 power abilities basically for in 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.920
 the first levels can do more 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.109
 damage and ability power by level 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.130
 wait when you're at level and cios or 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:24.850
 you do more damage 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:27.430
 a lot more damage then masters 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.870
 the beasts and now I'm going to go 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.870
 explaining it while I put it 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.200
 it could be like this normal 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.230
 and then it also depends on against 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.540
 who are you going but basically you can do 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.500
 what you want 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.170
 this 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.200
 this this 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.260
 this and this now 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.180
 I repeat it depends on whom you are going against 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:01.380
 you get 21 90 or 21 09 now I prefer 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.130
 go for utility 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.130
 as 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.900
 is more than for example is not more like 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.480
 tank and type bleachers that is thrown and not 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.910
 you can escape not she is thrown and 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.970
 can escape again with the last 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.370
 then I prefer to go but yes 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.020
 that the additional towards defense could 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.060
 choose type these two these 2 this this 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.910
 and this 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.650
 and if you can not come here I 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.250
 basically something like this 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.820
 I know and I know what I have 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.979
 to ar and that is custom mine 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.280
 You can take this but if you want 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:49.120
 see how the pros do I take myself 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.759
 1802 for this that gives me more red 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.249
 life with the spells and also this that 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.639
 the 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:58.699
 many times I need it 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.680
 and this therefore things because when I 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.390
 shot to the normally some car is 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.350
 here then this makes 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.680
 ok but I still got involved but yes 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.890
 basic attacks making magic year 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.200
 then this for me is what I like 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.270
 not what I like but if 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.590
 you want as you are beginning which 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:26.060
 with ar and all 2109 would be the best 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:29.090
 and if not 21 new 0 but always with 621 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:35.340
 here since she is a murderer and all that 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:38.520
 to take this to teach and it's worth it 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.100
 is a character that is judged on the line 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.400
 of mid place you as you put here is a 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:48.270
 little hard to use the principle but 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.760
 that you put pulsas hosts or put here that 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:55.970
 power of life 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:58.010
 it is more or less has good support but not 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.050
 thanks to the passive also but not 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.569
 much 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.780
 smith was going with a faith then the attack 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:09.229
 we leave it to another side I've already said is 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:12.259
 magician then uses the spells as damage 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:14.690
 and it's murderous thanks to his kit 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:18.409
 hours skills I'll go back to 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.749
 explain and as well as some combos and such 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:25.789
 you when you throw yourself with the last you 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:28.279
 strips the w then the qo the e 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:31.099
 it depends if they are far away you will decide 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:35.449
 line to make you throw the cv and 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:39.510
 the ignite then you leave them 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:42.180
 flipping and then 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:46.420
 the summoner spells me what 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:49.570
 normally lame would be flash and turn on 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.550
 it depends on who you're going against, 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:55.270
 set or very I assume that it does a lot of damage 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.430
 there instantaneously then you can 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.180
 catch barrier normally I catch me ignite 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:03.100
 and the combos going well you 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.420
 do what you want simply this 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.340
 is to give us a little idea 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.600
 I hope you have helped a little 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.600
 guide and goodbye
