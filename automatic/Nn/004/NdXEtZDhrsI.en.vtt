welcome to another black ops 2 nucular

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.089 
welcome to another black ops 2 nucular
so<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:06.629> nuclear<00:00:07.170> isn't<00:00:07.529> really<00:00:07.740> focused

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
so this nuclear isn't really focused

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.160 
so this nuclear isn't really focused
around<00:00:08.250> how<00:00:08.700> great<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.300> gameplay<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.929> it's

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
around how great the gameplay it is it's

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.540 
around how great the gameplay it is it's
more<00:00:10.320> focused<00:00:10.650> around<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.010> class<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.490> I'm

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
more focused around the class and I'm

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.970 
more focused around the class and I'm
using<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.750> class<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.139> I'm<00:00:13.230> using<00:00:13.559> is

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
using so this class that I'm using is

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.730 
using so this class that I'm using is
basically<00:00:14.490> my<00:00:14.910> like<00:00:15.299> biggest<00:00:15.690> tryhard<00:00:16.440> class

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
basically my like biggest tryhard class

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.410 
basically my like biggest tryhard class
so<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.279> see<00:00:17.430> somebody<00:00:17.789> that's<00:00:17.910> actually

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
so if I see somebody that's actually

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.359 
so if I see somebody that's actually

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
pretty good in the lobby then this is

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.920 
pretty good in the lobby then this is
the<00:00:20.490> class<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.699> I'll<00:00:20.939> pull<00:00:21.240> out<00:00:21.270> just<00:00:21.390> try<00:00:21.869> to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the class that I'll pull out just try to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.960 
the class that I'll pull out just try to
beat<00:00:22.140> them<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> class<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.279> I'm<00:00:23.369> using<00:00:23.670> is

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
beat them so the class that I'm using is

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.910

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.140 
quick-draw then for my perks I'm using
flak<00:00:28.320> jacket<00:00:28.769> toughness<00:00:29.340> scavenger<00:00:29.939> and

tactical mask when using this class
you're<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.369> very<00:00:32.850> quick<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.450> you're<00:00:33.540> more<00:00:33.660> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you're not very quick but you're more of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.870 
you're not very quick but you're more of
just<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.110> tank<00:00:34.469> flak<00:00:35.160> jacket<00:00:35.489> makes<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
just a tank flak jacket makes it to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.040 
just a tank flak jacket makes it to
where<00:00:35.910> explosives<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.540> pretty<00:00:36.719> much<00:00:36.780> never

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
using flak jacket and then I use

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.979 
using flak jacket and then I use
tactical<00:00:53.489> mass<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.210> course<00:00:54.420> flashes

tactical mass because of course flashes
and<00:00:55.140> stuns<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.160> affect<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.610> either

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and stuns don't really affect you either

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.819 
and stuns don't really affect you either
do<00:00:56.940> shock<00:00:57.180> charges<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.629> think<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.500> video

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
do shock charges I think in this video

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.560 
do shock charges I think in this video
at<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.190> point<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.640> just<00:00:59.850> complete<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.329> run

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
at one point I do just complete like run

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.880 
at one point I do just complete like run
through<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> shock<00:01:01.020> charge<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.590> doesn't

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
through a shock charge and it doesn't

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
through a shock charge and it doesn't
affect<00:01:02.250> me<00:01:02.430> whatsoever<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.210> then<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.600> course

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
affect me whatsoever and then of course

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.450 
affect me whatsoever and then of course
I<00:01:03.960> use<00:01:04.170> toughness<00:01:04.650> actually<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> don't<00:01:05.280> think

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
I use toughness actually I don't think

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.149 
I use toughness actually I don't think
I've<00:01:05.700> ever<00:01:05.869> not<00:01:06.869> used<00:01:07.260> toughness<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
I've ever not used toughness like the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.670 
I've ever not used toughness like the
game<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.360> hard<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.840> kill<00:01:10.170> people<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
game it is so hard to kill people and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.530 
game it is so hard to kill people and
gunfights<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.400> you're<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.729> using<00:01:11.970> toughness

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
gunfights if you're not using toughness

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.570 
gunfights if you're not using toughness
your<00:01:13.049> flinch<00:01:13.380> will<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.710> go<00:01:13.830> crazy<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.490> your

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
your flinch will just go crazy and your

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.399 
your flinch will just go crazy and your
aim<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.150> way<00:01:15.360> off<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.900> person<00:01:16.320> that

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
aim will go way off the person that

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.810 
aim will go way off the person that
you're<00:01:16.530> trying<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.799> shoot<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.220> then<00:01:17.250> of

you're trying to shoot and then of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
you're trying to shoot and then of
course<00:01:18.030> I'm<00:01:18.180> using<00:01:18.270> scavengers<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> can

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
course I'm using scavengers so I can

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.200 
course I'm using scavengers so I can
stick<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.189> my<00:01:20.310> scar-h<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:21.030> all<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
stick with my scar-h with all the

stick with my scar-h with all the
attachments<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:22.860> easily

attachments I like on it I would easily
have<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> most<00:01:23.970> nuclear's<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.810> class

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
have the most nuclear's with this class

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.020 
have the most nuclear's with this class
it's<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.590> um<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.220> don't<00:01:26.610> use<00:01:26.729> this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it's just um I actually don't use this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.609 
it's just um I actually don't use this
class<00:01:27.299> very<00:01:27.330> often<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.409> it's

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
class very often just because it's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.859 
class very often just because it's
boring<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.759> class<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.119> good<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.600> me

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
boring like this class is so good for me

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.120 
boring like this class is so good for me
that<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.170> pretty<00:01:31.320> much<00:01:31.470> easy<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that it's pretty much easy to get a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.010 
that it's pretty much easy to get a
nuclear<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.240> kind<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
nuclear with it it's kind of like the a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.780 
nuclear with it it's kind of like the a
in<00:01:34.350> class<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.860> pretty<00:01:35.040> much<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> same<00:01:35.490> exact

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
in class it's pretty much the same exact

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.219 
in class it's pretty much the same exact
thing<00:01:35.970> except<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.270> don't<00:01:36.450> use<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> silencer<00:01:37.200> I

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
thing except I don't use a silencer I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
or anything but I get nucleus with it

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.670 
or anything but I get nucleus with it
pretty<00:01:41.700> easily<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.299> becomes<00:01:42.720> boring<00:01:43.110> but

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
