lithium<00:00:10.590> battery<00:00:11.010> as<00:00:11.570> you<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.750> see<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.950> a

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
lithium battery as you can see it's a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.250 
lithium battery as you can see it's a
flat<00:00:14.340> prismatic<00:00:15.089> here's<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.049> different<00:00:16.289> cells

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
flat prismatic here's a different cells

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.540 
flat prismatic here's a different cells
not<00:00:19.260> much<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.520> but<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.660> works<00:00:22.400> but<00:00:23.400> there's

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
not much to it but it works but there's

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.550 
not much to it but it works but there's
two<00:00:23.699> reasons<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.420> buy<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> battery<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
two reasons to buy a battery one is the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.560 
two reasons to buy a battery one is the
capacity

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
capacity

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.669 
capacity
one<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> cranking<00:00:28.260> amps<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.779> if<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.050> have

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
one is the cranking amps so if you have

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.490 
one is the cranking amps so if you have
a<00:00:31.710> list<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.669> match<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.270> bike<00:00:33.989> with<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
a list to match your bike with the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.220 
a list to match your bike with the
battery<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:35.040> fine<00:00:35.570> but<00:00:36.570> really<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:37.140> are

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
battery that's fine but really what are

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.130 
battery that's fine but really what are
you<00:00:37.320> buying<00:00:37.590> you're<00:00:38.070> buying<00:00:38.390> capacity<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
you buying you're buying capacity and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.510 
you buying you're buying capacity and
cranking<00:00:41.100> amps<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.350> one<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> shows<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
cranking amps so on this one it shows a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.709 
cranking amps so on this one it shows a
14<00:00:45.329> number<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:47.120> it's<00:00:48.120> called

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
14 number and it's called

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.290 
14 number and it's called

that<00:01:27.270> sure<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.869> came<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.650> couple<00:01:28.950> of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
that sure I came up with a couple of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.710 
that sure I came up with a couple of
years<00:01:29.220> ago<00:01:29.960> it<00:01:30.960> means<00:01:31.229> absolutely<00:01:31.470> nothing<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
years ago it means absolutely nothing I

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.760 
years ago it means absolutely nothing I
don't<00:01:33.720> even<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.930> why<00:01:34.079> they<00:01:34.140> put<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.619> there

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
don't even know why they put it on there

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.160 
don't even know why they put it on there
well<00:01:34.950> it's<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> sales<00:01:35.400> gimmick<00:01:35.930> you<00:01:36.930> might<00:01:37.110> as

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
well it's a sales gimmick you might as

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.800 
well it's a sales gimmick you might as
well<00:01:37.259> put<00:01:37.820> mm<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.119> know<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.329> sounds<00:01:39.659> better

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
well put mm you know that sounds better

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.340 
well put mm you know that sounds better
than<00:01:39.930> 14<00:01:41.360> okay<00:01:42.680> capacity<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.710> 3.5<00:01:44.460> amp<00:01:44.759> power

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
than 14 okay capacity is 3.5 amp power

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.770 
than 14 okay capacity is 3.5 amp power
the<00:01:46.350> other<00:01:46.500> number<00:01:46.860> cranking<00:01:47.520> amps<00:01:47.880> that's<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the other number cranking amps that's a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.030 
the other number cranking amps that's a
little<00:01:48.930> that's<00:01:49.170> more<00:01:49.380> important

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
little that's more important

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.399 
little that's more important
how<00:01:50.820> much<00:01:50.970> cranking<00:01:51.479> amps<00:01:51.720> as<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.020> battery

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
how much cranking amps as this battery

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.340 
how much cranking amps as this battery
put<00:01:52.619> out<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> start<00:01:53.159> your<00:01:53.340> engine<00:01:54.200> well<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
put out to start your engine well it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.139 
put out to start your engine well it
says<00:01:55.590> 210<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.930> with<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.399> accuracy<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> 14

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
says 210 and with the accuracy of the 14

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.469 
says 210 and with the accuracy of the 14
I<00:02:00.180> think<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.899> better<00:02:01.049> test<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.360> we're

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
I think we better test this so we're

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.310 
I think we better test this so we're
gonna<00:02:03.570> use<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.860> load<00:02:05.280> tester<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:06.320> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
gonna use this load tester here and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.290 
gonna use this load tester here and
we've<00:02:07.500> got<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.680> voltmeter<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.459> we<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.090> way

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
we've got a voltmeter and we get a way

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.620 
we've got a voltmeter and we get a way
to<00:02:09.330> rid<00:02:09.660> overly<00:02:10.080> read<00:02:10.920> precisely<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.760> current

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
to rid overly read precisely the current

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.140 
to rid overly read precisely the current
on<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:13.840> meter<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:15.370> should<00:02:15.580> be<00:02:15.760> able<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.910> see

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
on this meter you should be able to see

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.410 
on this meter you should be able to see
it<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.870> we're<00:02:17.710> gonna<00:02:17.800> find<00:02:18.070> out<00:02:18.160> precisely

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
it and we're gonna find out precisely

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.060 
it and we're gonna find out precisely
the<00:02:19.420> cranking<00:02:19.900> amps<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.290> sucker<00:02:20.560> can<00:02:20.890> put

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
the cranking amps this sucker can put

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.990 
the cranking amps this sucker can put
out<00:02:21.480> we're<00:02:22.480> gonna<00:02:22.570> drop<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:24.130> voltage<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.760> nine

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
out we're gonna drop the voltage to nine

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.670 
out we're gonna drop the voltage to nine
volts<00:02:25.450> which<00:02:25.600> is<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.780> typical<00:02:26.020> cranking

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
volts which is a typical cranking

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.030 
volts which is a typical cranking
voltage<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.880> an<00:02:28.060> engine<00:02:28.420> for<00:02:29.260> about<00:02:29.800> two

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
voltage of an engine for about two

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.250 
voltage of an engine for about two
seconds<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:31.420> we're<00:02:31.510> gonna<00:02:31.600> do<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.810> about<00:02:32.020> two

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
seconds and we're gonna do it about two

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.740 
seconds and we're gonna do it about two
times<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.820> we'll<00:02:34.510> see<00:02:34.720> exactly<00:02:35.170> what<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.190> does

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
times and we'll see exactly what it does

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:57.949 
times and we'll see exactly what it does
here<00:02:37.750> we<00:02:37.900> go<00:02:48.930> here's<00:02:49.930> your<00:02:50.110> 14

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.449 

and<00:02:58.409> you<00:02:58.500> should<00:02:58.739> be<00:02:58.920> able<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.099> read<00:02:59.310> that

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
and you should be able to read that

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.809 
and you should be able to read that
meter<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.420> here<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:03.959> go<00:03:04.170> it's<00:03:05.159> fully<00:03:05.430> charged

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
meter so here we go it's fully charged

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.860 
meter so here we go it's fully charged
battery<00:03:07.879> we'll<00:03:08.879> just<00:03:09.090> see<00:03:09.269> what<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.569> amps

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
battery we'll just see what the amps

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.910 
battery we'll just see what the amps
here<00:03:09.959> we're<00:03:10.079> gonna<00:03:10.170> take<00:03:10.349> it<00:03:10.439> down<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.620> nine

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
here we're gonna take it down to nine

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:21.140 
here we're gonna take it down to nine
volts

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.900 

1:22

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.089 

1:22

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.500 

well

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
well

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.170 
well
in<00:03:36.020> case<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.349> don't<00:03:36.500> believe<00:03:36.770> your<00:03:36.980> eyes

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
in case you don't believe your eyes

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.660 
in case you don't believe your eyes
we're<00:03:38.180> gonna<00:03:38.300> do<00:03:38.480> this<00:03:38.630> again

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.070 

maybe<00:03:44.160> we<00:03:45.160> were<00:03:45.250> in<00:03:45.400> a<00:03:45.600> time<00:03:46.600> war<00:03:46.840> for

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
maybe we were in a time war for

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.949 
maybe we were in a time war for
something<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:48.880> know<00:03:49.000> maybe<00:03:49.300> it's<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.540> parallel

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
something you know maybe it's a parallel

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.470 
something you know maybe it's a parallel
universe<00:03:49.990> that<00:03:50.880> something<00:03:51.880> happened<00:03:52.270> here

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
universe that something happened here

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.390 
universe that something happened here
let's<00:03:52.990> go<00:03:53.140> back<00:03:53.319> down<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.530> nine<00:03:53.800> volts<00:03:54.190> we're

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
let's go back down to nine volts we're

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.160 
let's go back down to nine volts we're
starting<00:03:54.760> our<00:03:54.850> bike<00:03:55.030> again<00:03:56.010> here<00:03:57.010> we<00:03:57.130> go

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
starting our bike again here we go

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:12.089 
starting our bike again here we go
127<00:04:02.040> 127<00:04:03.300> so<00:04:04.300> we've<00:04:04.450> got<00:04:04.630> 122<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:07.770> 127

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.020 

actual<00:04:12.999> cranking<00:04:13.749> amps<00:04:14.170> for<00:04:14.469> the<00:04:14.560> shore<00:04:14.859> I<00:04:15.030> LFX

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
actual cranking amps for the shore I LFX

actual cranking amps for the shore I LFX
14<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:19.090> claims<00:04:20.160> 210<00:04:22.169> well<00:04:23.169> there<00:04:23.440> are<00:04:23.500> only

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
14 it claims 210 well there are only

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.240 
14 it claims 210 well there are only
about<00:04:23.800> 90<00:04:24.789> cranking<00:04:25.509> amps<00:04:25.960> off<00:04:26.199> that's<00:04:26.860> almost

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
about 90 cranking amps off that's almost

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.969 
about 90 cranking amps off that's almost
50<00:04:27.520> percent<00:04:28.889> discrepancy<00:04:30.570> but<00:04:31.620> hey<00:04:32.620> if<00:04:32.830> it

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
50 percent discrepancy but hey if it

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.529 
50 percent discrepancy but hey if it
makes<00:04:33.009> a<00:04:33.340> sale<00:04:33.660> it<00:04:34.660> doesn't<00:04:35.169> matter

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
makes a sale it doesn't matter

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.750 
makes a sale it doesn't matter
good<00:04:37.539> luck
