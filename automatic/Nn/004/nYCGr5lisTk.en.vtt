00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 Hey 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.870
 now i have a lot of my life 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.700
 connector blue 2015 but this is nonetheless 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.650
 a very nice specimen what is the 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.590
 this is the name also the ff say good 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.800
 challenging you the bluetooth 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.170
 multi-device keybord from logitec and then 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.820
 the k480 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.380
 correct and well you give up on it 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.090
 wire break but now we really have 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.410
 hands it is the keyboard 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.029
 what via bluetooth connect with three 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.830
 second devices and then you can go on 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.900
 any time with the you button 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.129
 switch between these three apparatus and 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.140
 then you can still type on that device 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.910
 handy but dennis market and the scan 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.500
 problem and cam problem because this is 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.820
 android and this is aos and this is windless 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.260
 which have been or perhaps buttons and 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.090
 operating menu hours and structures and such 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.649
 and what you got there is all of them 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.239
 thought it is incredible hopes 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.579
 make your windows computer more natural and 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.399
 ctrl and alt key have but when you press 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.140
 if your mac is sitting then you don't have that no 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.700
 and you don't have such a problem 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.000
 great that you get fat on that 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.879
 release 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.680
 indeed he recognizes he recognizes and with 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.869
 which product you are connected to 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.159
 and then the al does not change 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.560
 button in the command button if you have a mac 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.749
 and if you are on an android that is sitting by 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.590
 then the home button becomes active and the 

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:13.450
 back button 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.420
 You did n't solve anything and it cost 50 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.009
 euros that is it you can not in money anyway 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.909
 got into the tommy teleshopping completely 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.319
 keep it here and wait if you are not 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.319
 you also get ordered for free 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.090
 no no just kidding i want one 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.789
 give a critical note and that is 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.450
 the fact that I don't like one 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.069
 He is a man with your toy plastic 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.659
 play-doh duplicate like it 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.770
 eplan nice they just got me anyway 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.869
 a nice typed on yes I know 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.579
 say keys have good ones 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.979
 feedback 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.659
 yes okay and what a no-no mouse 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.429
 he is a conscious choice 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.799
 they want the same thing for consumers 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.139
 let you choose which mouse it self 5 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.310
 in so you have to buy it with you 

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:56.229
 nasty comment 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.729
 I had a bad question to you 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.689
 namely that bridge because this is 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.079
 android 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.689
 this is arjo s and this is windows i miss 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.579
 yet another thing namely the 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.060
 smart tv 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.469
 yes you have your smarttv bluetooth no 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.180
 yes then you can not use this 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.200
 devices with your smartphone makes that 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.510
 also made a conscious choice 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.700
 for that time because they think the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.590
 Smart TV interface is not suitable 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.989
 are for keyboard but more for 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.610
 trackpad and that rational bed then 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.209
 you just need a separate device 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.099
 to sell 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.830
 they think that is better okay that sounds 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.360
 good lions den 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.650
 I like it I think we are up and running 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.819
 the execution is also at st ik ik 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.260
 just don't know or very fast and very 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.330
 user will soon 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.130
 no yes how often to switch that is the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.450
 very often ask me how much trouble is 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.120
 it to pick up your phone and then 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.019
 the same stripe that is more mine 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.580
 ask 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.620
 this actually seems to be a problem 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.090
 solving that the real problem is that we 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.110
 where good good nice try 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.110
 to let logitec data
