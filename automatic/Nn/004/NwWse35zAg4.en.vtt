work<00:00:31.710> really<00:00:31.859> well<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.250> clan<00:00:32.489> wars<00:00:32.520> so

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
better against lower levels obviously at

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.929 
better against lower levels obviously at
townhall<00:01:28.560> 8<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.070> isn't<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.759> work

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
townhall 8 this isn't going to work

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
super well because there are just so

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.230 
super well because there are just so
many<00:01:31.500> more<00:01:31.860> defenses<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.579> walls<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> it's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
many more defenses and walls that it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
many more defenses and walls that it's
difficult<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.560> through<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> base<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
difficult to get through the base the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.880 
difficult to get through the base the
same<00:01:35.549> way<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> townhall<00:01:36.540> 7

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
right guys well here we go um so this is

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.840 
right guys well here we go um so this is
the<00:01:46.680> base<00:01:46.829> we're<00:01:47.009> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.189> attack<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.700> is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the base we're going to attack this is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.020 
the base we're going to attack this is
probably<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.450> pretty<00:01:49.430> common<00:01:50.430> base<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.909> you

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
probably a pretty common base that you

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.899 
probably a pretty common base that you
would<00:01:51.149> see<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.960> clan<00:01:52.259> war<00:01:52.530> um<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:53.700> kind<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
would see in a clan war um it's kind of

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.340 
would see in a clan war um it's kind of
the<00:01:54.000> more<00:01:54.180> Arrowhead<00:01:54.689> shape<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> see

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the more Arrowhead shape that you see

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.920 
the more Arrowhead shape that you see
with<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> lot<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.009> townhall<00:01:56.430> 7<00:01:56.460> bases<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.450> I'm

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
with a lot of townhall 7 bases so I'm

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.569 
with a lot of townhall 7 bases so I'm
going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.200> ahead<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.530> attack<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.009> guy<00:01:59.250> um

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
going to go ahead and attack this guy um

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.910 
going to go ahead and attack this guy um
again<00:02:00.329> remember<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.290> clan<00:02:01.530> war<00:02:01.740> you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
again remember that in a clan war you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.630 
again remember that in a clan war you
will<00:02:02.070> have<00:02:02.250> clan<00:02:02.460> castle<00:02:02.850> troops<00:02:02.880> as<00:02:03.240> well<00:02:03.270> so

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
will have clan castle troops as well so

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.589 
will have clan castle troops as well so
again<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.030> am<00:02:06.149> by<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.500> am<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.459> extremely<00:02:09.300> good

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
again I am by I am not extremely good

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.360 
again I am by I am not extremely good
with<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.899> attack<00:02:10.679> strategy<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.160> I'm<00:02:11.220> just

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
with this attack strategy so I'm just

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.680 
with this attack strategy so I'm just
going<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.580> drop<00:02:11.700> one<00:02:11.760> giant<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> see<00:02:12.510> if<00:02:12.569> their

I'm<00:03:43.180> really<00:03:43.390> not<00:03:43.540> even<00:03:43.600> going<00:03:43.960> to<00:03:43.990> need

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
I'm really not even going to need

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.340 
I'm really not even going to need
anything<00:03:44.380> else<00:03:44.740> but<00:03:45.400> um<00:03:45.870> yeah<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.020> I<00:03:47.050> do<00:03:47.140> think

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
anything else but um yeah so I do think

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.840 
anything else but um yeah so I do think
this<00:03:47.410> is<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.560> really<00:03:47.710> good<00:03:47.890> attack<00:03:48.130> strategy<00:03:48.610> um

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
this is a really good attack strategy um

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.430 
this is a really good attack strategy um
I<00:03:49.270> would<00:03:50.730> definitely<00:03:51.870> go<00:03:52.870> ahead<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.110> use<00:03:53.320> this

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
I would definitely go ahead and use this

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.930 
I would definitely go ahead and use this
one<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.680> clan<00:03:53.860> wars<00:03:54.070> it's<00:03:54.220> really<00:03:54.400> strong<00:03:54.670> I

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
one in clan wars it's really strong I

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.670 
one in clan wars it's really strong I
don't<00:03:55.270> think<00:03:55.690> it's<00:03:55.840> quite<00:03:55.960> as<00:03:56.050> strong<00:03:56.410> as<00:03:56.560> the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
don't think it's quite as strong as the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.190 
don't think it's quite as strong as the
masked<00:03:56.890> dragon<00:03:57.070> raid<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:58.810> because<00:03:59.050> there

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
masked dragon raid just because there

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.500 
masked dragon raid just because there
are<00:03:59.290> a<00:03:59.320> lot<00:03:59.500> more<00:04:00.090> things<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.240> can<00:04:01.360> go<00:04:01.480> wrong

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
are a lot more things that can go wrong

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.600 
are a lot more things that can go wrong
with<00:04:01.900> this<00:04:02.050> with<00:04:02.260> spring<00:04:02.590> traps<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.220> giant

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
with this with spring traps and giant

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
with this with spring traps and giant
bombs<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:04.030> things<00:04:04.180> like<00:04:04.270> that

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
bombs and things like that

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.510 
bombs and things like that
but<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.140> is<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.260> very<00:04:05.500> powerful<00:04:05.710> attack<00:04:06.220> and<00:04:06.430> if

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
but it is a very powerful attack and if

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.890 
but it is a very powerful attack and if
you're<00:04:06.640> looking<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:07.060> save<00:04:07.240> some<00:04:07.300> elixir<00:04:07.810> in

use<00:04:09.550> this<00:04:09.670> attack<00:04:10.000> definitely<00:04:10.540> instead<00:04:10.810> of

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
use this attack definitely instead of

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.460 
use this attack definitely instead of
the<00:04:11.140> mass<00:04:11.860> dragon<00:04:12.340> attack<00:04:12.640> but<00:04:13.270> um<00:04:13.480> yeah
