00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
abandoned at that level I would say so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.660 
abandoned at that level I would say so

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and enough and enough on everybody's

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.220 
and enough and enough on everybody's
schedule<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.729> two-person<00:01:33.090> job
