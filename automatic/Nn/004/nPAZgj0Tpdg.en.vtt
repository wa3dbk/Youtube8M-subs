this<00:00:13.980> map<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.519> probably<00:00:15.059> about<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.570> seven<00:00:16.160> I'd

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
this map is probably about a seven I'd

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060 
this map is probably about a seven I'd
say<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:18.330> not<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.480> best<00:00:18.930> really<00:00:19.289> hiding<00:00:19.650> it's

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
say it's not the best really hiding it's

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.220 
say it's not the best really hiding it's
more<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.730> sitting<00:00:21.029> there<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.630> killing

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230

almost live the whole match here if lots

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.190 
almost live the whole match here if lots
of<00:01:21.810> people<00:01:22.020> don't<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.200> about<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.939> yeah

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
of people don't know about it so yeah

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.690 
of people don't know about it so yeah
this<00:01:25.200> one's<00:01:25.470> kind<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:25.860> common<00:01:26.280> last

glitch

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.750 

will<00:01:49.220> be<00:01:49.810> this<00:01:50.810> glitch<00:01:51.140> now<00:01:51.440> for<00:01:52.220> beginners

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
will be this glitch now for beginners

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.740 
will be this glitch now for beginners
this<00:01:53.630> would<00:01:53.870> not<00:01:54.020> be<00:01:54.080> a<00:01:54.350> good<00:01:54.410> spot<00:01:54.830> because<00:01:55.750> it

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
this would not be a good spot because it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.390 
this would not be a good spot because it
is<00:01:56.960> quite<00:01:57.440> hard<00:01:57.650> to<00:01:57.740> get<00:01:57.890> used<00:01:58.010> to<00:01:58.220> what<00:01:58.280> we

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
is quite hard to get used to what we

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.550 
is quite hard to get used to what we
want<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.700> again<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:58.970> barrel<00:01:59.420> sprint<00:02:00.350> jump

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
crouch and as you can see how probably

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.360 
crouch and as you can see how probably
fail<00:02:02.510> a<00:02:02.540> few<00:02:02.810> times<00:02:03.280> um<00:02:05.410> there<00:02:06.410> we<00:02:06.500> go<00:02:06.590> oh<00:02:06.770> yeah

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
fail a few times um there we go oh yeah

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.040

okay one idea well you can get in this

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.559 
okay one idea well you can get in this
corner<00:03:51.180> but<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.390> have<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.569> defend<00:03:51.900> more<00:03:53.569> so

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
corner but you have to defend more so

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.940 
corner but you have to defend more so

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
yeah that's a pretty hard glitch for a

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.979 
yeah that's a pretty hard glitch for a
last<00:03:56.159> resort<00:03:56.489> if<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.849> know<00:03:56.970> how<00:03:57.150> get<00:03:57.720> on<00:03:57.840> the
