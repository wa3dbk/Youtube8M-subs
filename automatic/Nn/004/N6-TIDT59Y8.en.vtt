the ball rolling this was our third game
that<00:02:14.680> we<00:02:14.770> have<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.950> try<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.220> first<00:02:15.580> time<00:02:15.880> and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
that we have to try the first time and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.660 
that we have to try the first time and
the<00:02:17.530> lightning<00:02:17.770> just<00:02:18.130> wouldn't<00:02:18.430> strike

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
the lightning just wouldn't strike

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.100 
the lightning just wouldn't strike
because<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.270> would<00:02:19.540> lacked<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.960> bit<00:02:20.080> too

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
because it would lacked it a bit too

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.370 
because it would lacked it a bit too
long<00:02:20.440> after<00:02:20.860> we've<00:02:21.580> got<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:22.120> cleaver<00:02:22.780> second

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380

what what do needs tech Noir is

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.230 
what what do needs tech Noir is
if<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.520> run<00:04:24.520> out<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.670> them<00:04:24.850> off<00:04:25.000> with<00:04:25.180> a

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
if you run out of them off with a

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.290 
if you run out of them off with a
cleaver<00:04:25.540> go<00:04:26.020> down<00:04:26.410> drop<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.430> cleaver<00:04:27.730> somehow

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
cleaver go down drop the cleaver somehow

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.630 
cleaver go down drop the cleaver somehow
and<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.590> will<00:04:29.830> have<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.220> start<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.610> process

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
and you will have to start the process

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.150 
and you will have to start the process
again<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.570> that's<00:04:31.810> not<00:04:32.050> just<00:04:32.110> simply<00:04:32.560> finding

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
again and that's not just simply finding

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.960 
again and that's not just simply finding
another<00:04:33.400> cleaver<00:04:33.790> and<00:04:34.320> going<00:04:35.320> back<00:04:35.470> onto<00:04:35.680> the

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
another cleaver and going back onto the

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.460 
another cleaver and going back onto the
sign<00:04:36.970> on<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.270> floor<00:04:37.480> you<00:04:37.870> actually<00:04:38.020> have<00:04:38.320> to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
sign on the floor you actually have to

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.060 
sign on the floor you actually have to
quit<00:04:38.890> the<00:04:39.010> game<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:40.680> it's<00:04:41.680> highly

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
quit the game and it's highly

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.800 
quit the game and it's highly
recommended<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.700> back<00:04:42.970> out<00:04:43.180> all<00:04:43.420> the<00:04:43.630> way<00:04:43.750> to

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
recommended to back out all the way to

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.190 
recommended to back out all the way to
the<00:04:44.020> main<00:04:44.200> menu<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:45.490> then<00:04:46.060> set<00:04:46.420> set<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:46.990> whole

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
the main menu and then set set the whole

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.420 
the main menu and then set set the whole
thing<00:04:47.230> up<00:04:47.590> again<00:04:47.710> and<00:04:47.980> do<00:04:48.070> the<00:04:48.190> thing<00:04:48.340> from

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
thing up again and do the thing from

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.750 
thing up again and do the thing from
scratch<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:52.180> know<00:04:52.530> cuz<00:04:53.530> obviously<00:04:53.650> to<00:04:54.250> get<00:04:54.670> it
