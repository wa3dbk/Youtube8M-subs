00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:28.540 

to<00:00:17.859> place<00:00:18.099> running<00:00:18.550> stitches<00:00:18.880> in<00:00:19.390> the<00:00:19.750> top

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.620 

and<00:00:29.550> pull<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.119> through

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.990 

you<00:00:37.630> leave<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.990> tail<00:00:38.290> so<00:00:39.070> I<00:00:39.130> cannot<00:00:39.550> it<00:00:39.820> in<00:00:39.940> a

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
you leave the tail so I cannot it in a

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.569 
you leave the tail so I cannot it in a
minute

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:53.050 

and<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.270> go<00:00:44.480> back<00:00:44.719> to

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.470 

and<00:00:53.600> this<00:00:53.750> time<00:00:54.020> I'm<00:00:54.170> just<00:00:54.320> gonna<00:00:54.530> go<00:00:55.480> straight

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
and this time I'm just gonna go straight

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.200 
and this time I'm just gonna go straight
through

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:12.709 

and<00:01:01.920> hopefully<00:01:02.920> come<00:01:03.100> out

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:19.260

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:29.280 

so<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:20.020> knot<00:01:20.229> doesn't<00:01:20.560> pull<00:01:20.950> through

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.450

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.110 

then<00:01:53.530> I'm<00:01:53.650> gonna<00:01:53.770> put<00:01:53.980> my<00:01:54.160> thumb<00:01:54.790> on<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.090> top

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
then I'm gonna put my thumb on the top

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.870 
then I'm gonna put my thumb on the top
and

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.260

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.470 

and<00:02:08.749> then<00:02:09.700> you<00:02:10.700> spread<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.420> top<00:02:11.719> out<00:02:13.480> push

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480

and<00:02:28.870> go<00:02:29.200> inside

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.580
