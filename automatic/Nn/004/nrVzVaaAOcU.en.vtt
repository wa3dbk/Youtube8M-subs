you see we got all the connections you
need<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.390> wondering<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.840> had<00:00:33.989> an

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
need in here I was wondering I had an

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.540 
need in here I was wondering I had an
idea<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.559> don't<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:34.800> if<00:00:34.890> anyone<00:00:35.160> wants<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.399> do

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
idea I don't know if anyone wants to do

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.610 
idea I don't know if anyone wants to do
it<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.760> another<00:00:36.239> thread<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:37.469> thinking

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
it in another thread but I was thinking

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.500 
it in another thread but I was thinking
is<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.700> light<00:00:38.940> right<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.180> for

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
is you can see this light right here for

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.780 
is you can see this light right here for
the<00:00:39.570> bottom<00:00:39.930> which<00:00:40.469> only<00:00:40.829> turns<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:41.340> you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the bottom which only turns on when you

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.729 
the bottom which only turns on when you
turn<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> handle<00:00:42.180> over<00:00:42.660> here<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.590> see

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
turn the handle over here as you can see

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.610 
turn the handle over here as you can see
I<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.879> thinking<00:00:45.180> instead<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.600> adding<00:00:46.320> another

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
I was thinking instead of adding another

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.180 
I was thinking instead of adding another
fuse<00:00:47.010> compartment<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:48.559> actually<00:00:49.559> wiring<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
fuse compartment if actually wiring it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.220 
fuse compartment if actually wiring it
through<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.850> put<00:00:51.030> LEDs<00:00:51.480> underneath<00:00:52.050> my

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
through here to put LEDs underneath my

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.459 
through here to put LEDs underneath my
seats<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.399> front<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.030> back<00:00:54.469> just

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
seats in the front and in the back just

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.110 
seats in the front and in the back just
drain<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.039> way<00:00:56.250> they<00:00:56.489> would<00:00:56.640> only<00:00:56.760> turn

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
drain it that way they would only turn

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.450 
drain it that way they would only turn
on<00:00:57.360> when<00:00:57.690> my<00:00:57.870> headlights<00:00:58.260> are<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.469> which<00:00:59.309> is

late as you can see I do live in the
house<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:47.460> much<00:01:47.610> easier<00:01:47.909> my<00:01:48.899> garage<00:01:49.439> as

stacked if not I would have my car
inside<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.530> I'm<00:01:54.070> probably<00:01:54.250> I'm<00:01:54.490> going<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.729> end

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
inside and I'm probably I'm going to end

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.070

can see look how dirty it is look look
at<00:02:03.790> look<00:02:03.820> look<00:02:04.180> at<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.390> edges<00:02:04.780> I<00:02:05.020> took

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
at look look at the edges I took

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.710 
at look look at the edges I took
everything<00:02:05.440> apart<00:02:05.650> already<00:02:06.330> all<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.570> sockets

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
everything apart already all the sockets

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.880 
everything apart already all the sockets
the<00:02:10.720> back<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:12.250> front<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:13.270> gauges

the back the front the gauges

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.950 
the back the front the gauges
pretty<00:02:15.550> basic<00:02:15.760> once<00:02:16.240> you<00:02:16.360> get<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.600> first<00:02:16.780> one

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
pretty basic once you get the first one

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.000 
pretty basic once you get the first one
out<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.230> way<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.710> hang<00:02:17.860> of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
out of the way and you get the hang of

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.870 
out of the way and you get the hang of
it<00:02:18.100> it's<00:02:18.310> pretty<00:02:18.490> much<00:02:18.550> easy<00:02:18.910> after<00:02:19.150> that

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
it it's pretty much easy after that

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.440 
it it's pretty much easy after that
everything<00:02:21.880> else<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.150> pretty<00:02:22.330> much<00:02:22.569> set

with the four corners right here on
everything<00:03:13.370> just<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.239> take<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.450> out<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.920> way

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
everything just to take it out that way

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.920 
everything just to take it out that way
when<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.250> sand<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.790> when<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:16.940> paint<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:17.390> it'll

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
when I sand it and when I paint it it'll

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.449 
when I sand it and when I paint it it'll
give<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.320> much<00:03:18.470> more<00:03:18.500> natural<00:03:19.070> look<00:03:19.100> and<00:03:19.400> I

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
give it a much more natural look and I

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:20.770 
give it a much more natural look and I
don't<00:03:19.520> have<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.790> worry<00:03:19.970> about<00:03:20.120> taping<00:03:20.660> or
