00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.620 
don't think he had extended mags on it
but<00:01:22.979> either<00:01:23.430> way<00:01:23.729> guys<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> comes<00:01:24.299> free

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

silence<00:01:25.080> which<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.380> definitely<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> huge

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
silence which is definitely a huge

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
silence which is definitely a huge
advantage<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.360> know<00:01:27.390> staying

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
advantage because we all know staying

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.630 
advantage because we all know staying
off<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.080> radar<00:01:28.320> especially<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> silencer

just for leveling up because then going

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.530 
just for leveling up because then going
really<00:02:43.490> hard<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.820> leveling<00:02:44.120> up<00:02:44.240> right<00:02:44.420> now

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
guys I would say cranked it's definitely

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.560

the<00:02:46.190> best<00:02:46.400> game<00:02:46.580> mode<00:02:46.760> for<00:02:46.940> leveling<00:02:47.210> up<00:02:47.360> but

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
the best game mode for leveling up but

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.790 
the best game mode for leveling up but
that's<00:02:47.960> not<00:02:48.140> really<00:02:48.350> what<00:02:48.500> we're<00:02:48.650> talking

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800

about<00:02:49.010> right<00:02:49.190> now<00:02:49.490> but<00:02:49.700> either<00:02:49.850> way<00:02:50.090> guys<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.630> do

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900

think<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.470> domination<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.220> really<00:02:52.430> good

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580

quite<00:03:12.770> too<00:03:13.010> often<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.490> gameplay<00:03:13.760> which<00:03:14.030> i

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
quite too often this gameplay which i

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.700 
quite too often this gameplay which i
think<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.360> a<00:03:14.420> really<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.870> really<00:03:15.020> smart<00:03:15.590> way<00:03:15.620> of

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
think is a really a really smart way of

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.560 
think is a really a really smart way of
getting<00:03:15.980> lots<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.250> kem<00:03:16.580> strikes<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.150> don't<00:03:17.390> run

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
getting lots of kem strikes is don't run

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.480 
getting lots of kem strikes is don't run
around<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:18.320> know<00:03:18.440> you<00:03:18.500> can<00:03:18.950> run<00:03:19.130> around<00:03:19.220> you

completely<00:03:32.420> insane<00:03:32.750> guys<00:03:33.050> but<00:03:33.410> either<00:03:33.860> way

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
completely insane guys but either way

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.650 
completely insane guys but either way
that<00:03:34.280> also<00:03:34.520> means<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.790> kill<00:03:35.060> pretty<00:03:35.270> fast<00:03:35.540> so

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660

aggressive<00:03:38.270> that<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.870> definitely<00:03:39.200> I<00:03:39.260> think

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
aggressive that that definitely I think

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.290 
aggressive that that definitely I think
that<00:03:40.100> gives<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.370> really<00:03:40.580> the<00:03:40.760> overall

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
that gives you really the overall

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.820 
that gives you really the overall
advantage<00:03:41.720> maybe<00:03:41.930> even<00:03:42.080> post<00:03:42.320> up<00:03:42.500> at<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.650> head

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
advantage maybe even post up at a head

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.410 
advantage maybe even post up at a head
glitch<00:03:43.040> sometimes<00:03:43.460> a<00:03:43.580> head<00:03:43.730> glitch<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.330> know

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
glitch sometimes a head glitch you know

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.790 
glitch sometimes a head glitch you know
a<00:03:44.450> head<00:03:44.600> glitch<00:03:44.810> can<00:03:44.990> really<00:03:45.200> save<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.620> when

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
a head glitch can really save you when

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.050 
a head glitch can really save you when
you're<00:03:45.980> in<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.130> one-on-one<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.760> gun<00:03:46.850> fight
