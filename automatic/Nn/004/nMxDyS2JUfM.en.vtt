00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the crap that's in the way all these

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.660 
the crap that's in the way all these
throttle<00:00:34.170> cables<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.340> would<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.520> your

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
throttle cables this one would be your

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.549 
throttle cables this one would be your
cruise<00:00:35.910> control<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.840> snap<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
cruise control so just snap that on the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.280 
cruise control so just snap that on the
way<00:00:37.680> off<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> PCV<00:00:38.790> take<00:00:39.540> off<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.870> over<00:00:40.110> there

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
way off the PCV take off that over there

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.430 
way off the PCV take off that over there
and<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.550> also<00:00:41.760> needs<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.719> snap<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.410> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and this also needs to just snap out of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
and this also needs to just snap out of
place<00:00:43.739> that's<00:00:44.340> basically<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.910> after<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.750> you

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
place that's basically it after that you

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.619 
place that's basically it after that you
just<00:00:46.020> take<00:00:46.350> out<00:00:46.500> all<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> bolts<00:00:47.450> some<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.539> them

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
just take out all the bolts some of them

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.389 
just take out all the bolts some of them
are<00:00:48.809> studs<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.620> some<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.039> them<00:00:50.160> are<00:00:50.250> regular

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
are studs and some of them are regular

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.389 
are studs and some of them are regular
bolts<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.780> make<00:00:52.230> note<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> know

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
bolts so make note of that so you know

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.270 
bolts so make note of that so you know
where<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> put<00:00:53.910> them<00:00:54.350> also<00:00:55.350> back<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
where to put them also back there on the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
where to put them also back there on the
newer<00:00:56.430> models<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> ground<00:00:57.360> cable<00:00:57.710> one<00:00:58.710> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
newer models as a ground cable one of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.500 
newer models as a ground cable one of
the<00:00:58.859> reader<00:00:59.039> bolts<00:00:59.370> make<00:00:59.940> sure<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.180> put<00:01:00.359> that

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the reader bolts make sure to put that

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.740 
the reader bolts make sure to put that
back

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.780 

one<00:01:07.290> end<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.680> always<00:01:07.890> easier<00:01:08.340> than<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> other

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
one end is always easier than the other

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.610 
one end is always easier than the other
end<00:01:09.290> they<00:01:10.290> smell<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.620> really<00:01:10.860> isn't<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.220> away

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
gasket material off sometimes trunk so

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.550 
gasket material off sometimes trunk so
that<00:03:37.220> will<00:03:37.340> come<00:03:37.459> at<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.640> time<00:03:38.140> usually<00:03:39.140> not

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
that will come at a time usually not

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.130 
that will come at a time usually not
should<00:03:40.190> be<00:03:40.310> no<00:03:40.430> material<00:03:40.940> on<00:03:41.060> here

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.570 

fortunately<00:03:45.140> my<00:03:45.500> gasket<00:03:45.980> came<00:03:46.160> out<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.400> one

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
fortunately my gasket came out in one

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.660 
fortunately my gasket came out in one
piece<00:03:47.140> because<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:48.379> metal<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:49.489> should

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
piece because it is metal so it should

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.880 
piece because it is metal so it should
come<00:03:49.819> out<00:03:49.849> one<00:03:50.120> piece<00:03:50.360> unless<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.900> tears<00:03:51.170> and

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
come out one piece unless it tears and

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.069 
come out one piece unless it tears and
rips<00:03:52.220> then<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.549> got<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.760> scrape<00:03:52.940> it<00:03:53.120> off<00:03:53.269> but

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
rips then you got to scrape it off but

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.720 
rips then you got to scrape it off but
once<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:54.349> get<00:03:54.470> that<00:03:54.650> out<00:03:54.860> make<00:03:55.099> sure<00:03:55.129> to<00:03:55.400> clean

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
once you get that out make sure to clean

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.270 
once you get that out make sure to clean
around<00:03:55.879> the<00:03:56.090> area<00:03:56.450> where<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.780> was<00:03:57.159> or<00:03:58.159> else

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
around the area where it was or else

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.440 
around the area where it was or else
you'll<00:03:58.459> have<00:03:58.610> leaks<00:03:58.849> and<00:03:59.120> this<00:03:59.209> will<00:03:59.329> be<00:03:59.420> a

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
you'll have leaks and this will be a

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.660 
you'll have leaks and this will be a
pointless<00:03:59.810> job<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.470> also<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.220> new<00:04:01.340> one<00:04:01.489> goes

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
pointless job and also the new one goes

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.390 
pointless job and also the new one goes
in<00:04:01.819> a<00:04:01.910> certain<00:04:02.209> way<00:04:02.390> those<00:04:03.260> holes<00:04:03.620> go<00:04:04.220> on<00:04:04.310> the

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
in a certain way those holes go on the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.839 
in a certain way those holes go on the
left<00:04:04.549> side<00:04:05.049> basically<00:04:06.049> just<00:04:06.379> get<00:04:06.920> some<00:04:07.099> wd-40
