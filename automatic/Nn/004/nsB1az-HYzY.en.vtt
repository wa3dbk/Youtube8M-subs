I<00:02:34.260> agree<00:02:34.590> thing<00:02:34.739> one<00:02:34.889> another<00:02:35.310> thing<00:02:35.430> we

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
I agree thing one another thing we

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.280 
I agree thing one another thing we
didn't<00:02:35.849> mention<00:02:35.999> is<00:02:36.329> that<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.900> Dolphins<00:02:37.200> are

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
didn't mention is that the Dolphins are

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.080 
didn't mention is that the Dolphins are
now<00:02:37.379> having<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.769> bunch<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.129> eye<00:02:38.249> injury<00:02:38.700> issues

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
now having a bunch of eye injury issues

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.360 
now having a bunch of eye injury issues
on<00:02:39.359> defense<00:02:39.989> which<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.409> which<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.069> good<00:02:41.280> at

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
on defense which is which is not good at

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.800 
on defense which is which is not good at
all<00:02:41.430> yeah<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.909> mean<00:02:42.180> I'm<00:02:42.329> thinking<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.719> the

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
all yeah I mean I'm thinking that the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.360 
all yeah I mean I'm thinking that the
Saints<00:02:43.079> have<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.379> have<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.739> know<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.859> big<00:02:44.189> edge

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
Saints have to have you know a big edge

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.890 
Saints have to have you know a big edge
here<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:44.700> question<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.090> just<00:02:45.269> is<00:02:45.480> six<00:02:45.719> and<00:02:45.840> a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
here the question is just is six and a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.720 
here the question is just is six and a
half<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.439> know<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.769> there<00:02:46.920> still<00:02:47.099> value<00:02:47.489> with

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
half you know is there still value with

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.250 
half you know is there still value with
that<00:02:47.939> line<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.359> think<00:02:48.420> there<00:02:48.719> is<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.079> seems

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that line I think there is and it seems
