00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.289
 Holland and in the front Jonathan Travel Danny 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.029
 koevermans and and nordin amrabat but the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.099
 first chance of the competition is one 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.740
 for the Germans who becomes marcello 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.320
 played out and it is art here 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 is operated and the ball enters 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.899
 ronnie curly red spire wise traveling 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.899
 and puts his team ahead 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.250
 with some luck in the mess with audio 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.280
 castro 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.170
 and he himself but the best curly led on 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.170
 and puts his team ahead 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.180
 oh yes rounds as right back but once 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.320
 Here risen far along is this purple 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.260
 good at stef nijland 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.300
 but it just can't get there and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.010
 piss to ripping pison the goalkeeper from 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.119
 oberhausen takes the ball off his foot 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.770
 here the bank many young people on it 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.659
 they may remain seated for the time being 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.340
 they are also very beautiful 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.930
 dieptepass on danny koevermans and that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.500
 of course you should not give such a bag 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.330
 and he passes such a well and it is here 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.439
 so after half an hour of playing 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.439
 balanced again 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.170
 of course there is always a rush 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.080
 nice to score that doesn't matter 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.550
 in whatever competition and wherever you are 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.400
 wuytens is played on its own 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.440
 birthday with the long ball on nordin 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.270
 amrabat starting this run from the left 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.610
 has been viewed 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.050
 service had never been there but 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.050
 it all goes right beyond its goal 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.070
 bakkal because PSV takes matters in hand 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.080
 that first half jonathan nice move 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.520
 the legs of captain you more 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.710
 ipad will look for the crowds again 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.009
 jonathan is taken care of by had to a2 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.229
 just ran away from sichem 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.340
 gives corner kick for PSV and therefore none 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.740
 free kick 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.270
 all was not too bad with jonathan 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.450
 outside behind buildings 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.250
 what ports recorder looks like an amrabat 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.840
 quick that ball on jonathan then with the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.430
 chance the shot is wait but also goes 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.230
 for along 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.970
 normally scores frequently 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.489
 this field jonathan journey with the promise 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.690
 but here just not there on the left 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.160
 Harry van Raaij 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.560
 one of the few spectators on the 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.600
 herdgang he sees Stanislaw Manolev 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.230
 makes his comeback in the second half 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.430
 The team at PSV almost recovered from 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.930
 his groin injury 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.610
 and so ready for the first minutes 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.769
 the purple you play here is a bit too 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.120
 short and thus the chance for your browser only 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.560
 the rescue of bram castro he does well 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.269
 the Belgian goalkeeper 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.269
 on that dot he saves with one hand 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.790
 manolev now better at bakkal grab all that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.290
 supplier since the entrance of 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.280
 manolev because angel is to the side 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.660
 gone 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.950
 here an amrabat cuts inside 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.230
 naturally looking for his judge 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.760
 looks like slept small 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.010
 now sometimes passes for the second time 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.320
 Another thing this goal deserves was 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.269
 the whole race worked 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.859
 a blow in the round and is therefore now 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.130
 rewarded with a goal and nice 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.130
 goal 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.670
 oh yes he is now also in midfield on the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.560
 place of angel 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.290
 Jonathan with an excellent record stef 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.400
 The Netherlands can only go for pison 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.400
 but now with the goalkeeper well 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.640
 here jeffrey van nuland player of young 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.740
 psv he sees that psv is the better team 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.200
 in the second half 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.180
 jonathan ooyyo 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.520
 manolev psv makes the ball go round nicely 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.200
 and Jonathan decides to open 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.660
 the ball has been on the road for a long time, but is still coming 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.070
 to where you mean we are nordin 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.330
 Amrabat who had re-entered 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.120
 now served stef nijland 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.190
 well now then nijland on the pole he comes 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.540
 ever closer to stef nijland 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.890
 because I always keep it at zero 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.890
 hits are in this competition 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.590
 manolev again in the final phase of the 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.590
 contest 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.590
 bakkal 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.709
 it is dropped off by the ball 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.030
 cleaner 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.740
 by the legs of marcello it is 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.940
 all happily tinkering 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.760
 abuses ball in the back is it 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.140
 captain ipad but he misses and so wins 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.140
 psv with two one
