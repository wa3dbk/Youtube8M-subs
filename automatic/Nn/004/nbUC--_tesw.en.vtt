00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.690
 Hello everyone and welcome back to my penalty 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.869
 today I talk about a foundation then in 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.059
 video review I speak of the L'Oreal 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.580
 24 hours but that has a foundation that is 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.080
 a bit of a hit on the web and therefore has 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.140
 decided to buy it from whom I of 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.900
 try it with you I have it 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.140
 purchased in the shade 22 beach club 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.320
 then I tell you right away that the range 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.730
 in short, the shades available for 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.160
 this type of background dyes a lot 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.860
 restricted indeed they have only created 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.310
 if toned and the thing sent me a 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.739
 a little 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.630
 in short, because if you do a 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.430
 foundation at least make some colors 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.680
 even for those a little clearer between 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.980
 the other me is not that it is very white there 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.010
 they are a medium shade however it has one 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.230
 Mediterranean complexion I had 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.180
 difficulty finding the foundation not 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.280
 I imagine that is the coloring of the 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.410
 much whiter skin than mine 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.360
 this should be the third one short 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.129
 coloring because the first it should 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.750
 be the clearest ones actually have 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.880
 a pink undertone once applied 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.530
 on the hand it is impossible to take them at least 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.959
 that have not been done are not one 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.709
 fifteen or so lamps have not been 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:16.179
 two months in the sun so here I have been 

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:19.060
 a long time before deciding the 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:21.039
 coloring the one that said to me was 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.499
 this from here the song 2 that however 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.659
 once it is spread a little it oxidizes 

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:28.950
 so he will have to wait for color weapons a 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.530
 little before wearing it 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.439
 because a sweater maybe with the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.780
 high neck still still and wearable 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.549
 but now that we go without a scarf 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.740
 I will not use it again before 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.049
 summer season I have to tell you the price 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 the price of this knit foundation 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.520
 because I took it from this poses from 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.009
 this posed 12 euros for 90 euros 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.560
 I don't know if it was a launch price though from 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.500
 sephora noted that it costs much more 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.170
 we are around 19 20 euros 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.170
 honestly it is a difference rather 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.240
 obvious so buy not where 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.950
 find the lowest price here is this 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.780
 maybe the thing that will advise you there 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.610
 I say my opinions are rather 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.530
 positive about this foundation 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.690
 but I leave you to the application like this 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.390
 in short, you see the result on a skin 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.010
 like mine that early dilated some 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.670
 perfection so you see a little like it 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.670
 leads 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.330
 then as you have seen in short 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.730
 from the application of the foundation I have it 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.580
 applied a little at a time because otherwise 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.650
 in fact it dries a foundation that one 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.569
 once placed on the face tends to 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.550
 dry quickly to not leave 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.680
 track was formulated this way 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.000
 because it lasts for several hours 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.250
 fine as you may have noticed later 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.349
 application has no coverage 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.330
 completely the pimple that I had them 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.069
 here because still a fresh pimple 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.440
 the rest of the is not a stain 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.540
 stains the covers rather well and al 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.610
 adjustable foundation then based on 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.739
 how much it applies then it will tend to 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.720
 increase its opacity and if so 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.150
 apply too abundantly tends to 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.680
 do some mask effect can 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.130
 then use the foundation or 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.180
 however in the genus therefore without 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.360
 piled up because Anna is one 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.000
 rather creamy but fluid texture 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.100
 so if you maybe go to 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.959
 tapping with hands, however, for 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.850
 have a slightly higher coverage vi 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.950
 I recommend this kind of dignity fund 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.260
 it is used several times since 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.900
 immediately, however, I liked it 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.669
 a lot because the sun goes on was as if 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.640
 I didn't do it for the complexion of 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.490
 porcelain so I recommend it that is 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.880
 if you have the case policy anyway 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.160
 professions that are not much but a lot 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.700
 evident as with a foundation that can 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.479
 do for you tends to get polished though later 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.900
 a few hours then maybe after two or three 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.460
 hours 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.810
 you have very oily skin like 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.240
 in short, he will kill here in the area 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.490
 of the banks a little on the chin e 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.150
 on the forehead therefore in the area t but I have 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.350
 folded a veil of powder and go 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.110
 let's say that currently the foundation 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.800
 which I liked more if you want the 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.320
 My opinion 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.050
 definitely a suitable foundation also for 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.980
 who politi boys because he is not 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.780
 sincerely I have some 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.000
 criticism to make towards these great ones 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.800
 companies that send in products to 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.980
 youtuber who do not have a skin type 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.570
 suitable for that product because then 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.930
 first of all note that it is a foundation 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.639
 that if applied daily tends 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.350
 to dry the skin so it is not a 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.080
 foundation suitable for those with skin 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.270
 dry or whoever has the skin e 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.700
 say normal because if the written 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.790
 every day will tend a little to sugar 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.310
 thence the display of medicines then 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.290
 if you have normal skin or have one 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.870
 mixed leather I recommend you apply it 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.229
 maybe on big occasions or not 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.419
 I know twice a week 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.820
 because every day it tends to ad just 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.190
 dry the skin while it is full of 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.160
 very oily if applied under a base 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.870
 in short, a moisturizing cream behaves 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.490
 rather good to having recommended 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.460
 then this foundation of the orÃ©al 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.200
 April 24th Mar 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.229
 so of this line I know there is one 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.550
 I have not tried anything else but this one 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.190
 I'm 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.840
 the super good for which that advice 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.340
 however for this video everything but not 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.340
 see you in the next hello video
