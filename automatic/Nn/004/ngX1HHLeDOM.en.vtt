that we can see that when the north is

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.789 
that we can see that when the north is
pointing<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.870> that's<00:02:30.989> your<00:02:31.140> plan<00:02:31.349> pressure

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
where it's kind of God so you know you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.720 
where it's kind of God so you know you
think<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.709> might<00:02:34.890> be<00:02:34.920> cutting<00:02:35.280> around<00:02:35.430> this

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
think you might be cutting around this

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.600 
think you might be cutting around this
way<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.959> you're<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.769> spoil<00:02:38.129> you<00:02:38.250> he<00:02:38.459> else

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
way but you're not spoil you he else

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.400 
way but you're not spoil you he else
that<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:38.970> sleep<00:02:39.239> that's<00:02:39.750> what's<00:02:39.989> kind<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.230> got

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
that you sleep that's what's kind of got

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.619 
that you sleep that's what's kind of got
you<00:02:40.950> always<00:02:41.129> push<00:02:41.400> couple<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.819> things<00:02:42.030> you

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
you always push couple of things you

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.979 
you always push couple of things you
don't<00:02:42.840> pull<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.799> I<00:02:44.790> think<00:02:45.150> that's<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.450> bit<00:02:45.660> you

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
don't pull and I think that's a bit you

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.710 
don't pull and I think that's a bit you
can<00:02:46.049> use<00:02:46.200> them<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.560> scoff<00:02:46.890> as<00:02:47.129> well<00:02:47.510> you<00:02:48.510> wanna

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
can use them to scoff as well you wanna

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.599 
can use them to scoff as well you wanna
Scavo<00:02:49.560> things<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:49.950> usually<00:02:50.069> do<00:02:50.310> this<00:02:50.370> on<00:02:50.519> the

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
Scavo things I usually do this on the

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.420 
Scavo things I usually do this on the
edge<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.910> bench<00:02:51.049> let's<00:02:52.049> go<00:02:52.349> well<00:02:52.829> I<00:02:53.040> can't

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
edge of the bench let's go well I can't

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.849 
edge of the bench let's go well I can't
they<00:02:53.549> stopped<00:02:53.819> this<00:02:53.970> using<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.359> straw<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.859> every

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
they stopped this using a straw so every

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.759 
they stopped this using a straw so every
few<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.660> don't<00:03:00.660> know<00:03:00.780> I'll<00:03:00.989> do<00:03:01.140> if<00:03:01.260> he<00:03:01.379> cuts<00:03:01.650> the

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
I just do this I'm a bit of I don't know

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.050 
I just do this I'm a bit of I don't know
how<00:03:07.260> great<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.769> just<00:03:07.799> works<00:03:08.459> just<00:03:08.790> fine<00:03:08.910> it

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
how great it is just works just fine it

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.750 
how great it is just works just fine it
works<00:03:09.180> abused<00:03:09.599> and<00:03:10.140> then<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.500> side<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.549> in

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
works abused and then on the side and in

works abused and then on the side and in
a<00:03:11.819> way<00:03:11.970> okay<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.540> don't<00:03:12.989> keep<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.799> really

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
a way okay I don't keep it really

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.949 
a way okay I don't keep it really
accurate<00:03:14.579> ending<00:03:14.879> it<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.180> works<00:03:15.390> like<00:03:15.720> that

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
accurate ending it just works like that

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.960 
accurate ending it just works like that
you<00:03:16.799> can<00:03:16.980> cut<00:03:17.540> beveled<00:03:18.540> edges<00:03:18.660> if<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.079> want<00:03:19.290> to

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
you can cut beveled edges if you want to

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.339 
you can cut beveled edges if you want to
so<00:03:20.970> for<00:03:21.150> your<00:03:21.239> knife<00:03:21.450> bolts<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.049> kind<00:03:22.290> of

the<00:03:31.020> Beagle<00:03:31.440> ones<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.400> let's<00:03:32.610> see<00:03:32.700> all<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.850> that

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the Beagle ones so let's see all of that

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.430 
the Beagle ones so let's see all of that
tape<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.450> angle<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.050> just<00:03:34.080> close<00:03:34.350> the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
tape and angle and just close the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.750 
tape and angle and just close the
practice<00:03:34.830> you'll<00:03:34.980> get<00:03:35.100> more<00:03:35.220> accurate<00:03:35.700> with

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
practice you'll get more accurate with

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.800 
practice you'll get more accurate with
it<00:03:35.910> as<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.090> got<00:03:36.710> I<00:03:37.710> think<00:03:38.130> that's<00:03:38.460> about<00:03:38.580> it

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810
