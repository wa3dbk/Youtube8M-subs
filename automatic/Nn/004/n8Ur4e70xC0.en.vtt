00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
while they're sleeping and then it kind

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.760 
while they're sleeping and then it kind

grabbing a bunch of their bedding and

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.800 
grabbing a bunch of their bedding and
just<00:01:29.219> kind<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.549> moving<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.149> around<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.659> your

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.980 
just kind of moving it around in your
hands<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.850> your<00:01:32.850> hands<00:01:33.119> kind<00:01:33.539> of<00:01:33.659> smell

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.250 

the<00:01:57.250> best<00:01:57.550> way<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:58.240> hamsters<00:01:58.750> heart<00:01:59.050> is

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
the best way to a hamsters heart is

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.140 
the best way to a hamsters heart is
through<00:01:59.530> his<00:01:59.710> or<00:01:59.890> her<00:02:00.010> stomach<00:02:00.550> that's<00:02:00.880> what<00:02:01.120> I

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
through his or her stomach that's what I

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.330 
through his or her stomach that's what I
always<00:02:01.420> say<00:02:01.870> and<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.290> totally<00:02:02.770> works<00:02:02.980> because

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
always say and it totally works because

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.610 
always say and it totally works because
pip<00:02:03.580> and<00:02:03.760> peanut<00:02:04.090> always<00:02:04.870> come<00:02:05.080> into<00:02:05.230> my<00:02:05.410> hands

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
pip and peanut always come into my hands

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.730 
pip and peanut always come into my hands
if<00:02:05.830> there's<00:02:06.040> food

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
if there's food

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.889 
if there's food
some<00:02:08.740> hamsters<00:02:09.250> will<00:02:09.670> bite<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.240> in<00:02:10.420> this<00:02:10.600> case

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
some hamsters will bite and in this case

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.020 
some hamsters will bite and in this case
it<00:02:11.170> probably<00:02:11.350> wouldn't<00:02:12.010> be<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.250> best<00:02:12.280> idea<00:02:12.850> to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
it probably wouldn't be the best idea to

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.120 
it probably wouldn't be the best idea to
give<00:02:13.150> them<00:02:13.270> food<00:02:13.600> at<00:02:14.050> least<00:02:14.380> right<00:02:14.770> off<00:02:14.950> the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
give them food at least right off the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.890 
give them food at least right off the
bat<00:02:15.310> because<00:02:15.700> then<00:02:15.970> they'll<00:02:16.180> think<00:02:16.690> your

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
bat because then they'll think your

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.070 
bat because then they'll think your
hands<00:02:17.230> are<00:02:17.350> food<00:02:17.590> but<00:02:18.400> for<00:02:19.300> most<00:02:19.480> hamsters

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
hands are food but for most hamsters

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.220 
hands are food but for most hamsters

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.770 
robo's especially food definitely helps
and<00:02:23.440> by<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.010> way<00:02:24.280> when<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.550> say<00:02:24.940> food<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.569> mean

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
and by the way when I say food I mean

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.590 
and by the way when I say food I mean
