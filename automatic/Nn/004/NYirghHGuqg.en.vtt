 what is more important than our ruling class and seize it 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.189
 spirit of the times 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.759
 in the quality of a two-room economy in which places relate 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.039
 directly with the globe and the Dolomites they must not become a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.789
 appendix of the Po valley metropolis 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.539
 the mountain must not be part of the tennis court network and watch the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.870
 ball played by others reserving itself as the only negative possibility of 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.020
 block the ball played from the plains 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.850
 south Europeans 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.380
 the mountain needs infrastructures that allow it to go online 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.340
 first of all within their own territories and their own valleys to be 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.340
 one of the strategic places in the game economy 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.059
 no infrastructure of the past but futuristic infrastructures 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.760
 intermodal mobility treating summer painters is not a solution 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.200
 unique but a mix of solutions 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.850
 from Venice to Milan 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.610
 . zurich the citizens of the world the 100 million Chinese tourists 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.140
 the inhabitants of the metropolis should hotel fully access the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 ancient with this futuristic medium 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.940
 we can try to attract investment in scientific resources 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:32.850
 and cultural 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.890
 are if we remain ourselves 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.109
 you don't say I love you 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.679
 our territorial originality by approving c to other models 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.970
 the cultural challenge that all individuals associations entrepreneurs 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.200
 institutions 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.729
 we must succeed in winning and that of transforming what has always been 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.320
 lived like. physical limit 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.480
 the mountains 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.490
 a great opportunity for open-mindedness 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.420
 the mountain as an opportunity to build an economy model 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.640
 long-term sustainable through an integrated and non-sectoral vision 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.640
 of productive activities 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:22.509
 at 5:45 pm greetings with the availability of the engineer for 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:27.339
 any kind of technical support in favor of miss actions and monsters 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.339
 territories 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.679
 certain section he gave us 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:42.679
 which will therefore allow us to grasp 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:48.359
 in particular, which perhaps without this exposition we would not have been able to 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.059
 I have to thank him for the name of the group working on the streets 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.829
 not only 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.279
 for having organized this day 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.629
 not just for 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.079
 the friendship that now has channels since he knows ours very well 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.349
 and as we have also said on the bus 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.899
 you give me are now far from 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.869
 action of the Belluno area 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.899
 but above all because 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.899
 in this way it allows us to have dreams 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.509
 and if you don't have dreams you don't go on 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.559
 while growing, women are sought 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.349
 he had said that the whole province of Bolzano 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.629
 may have been 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.969
 what we have just seen the penultimate slide 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.669
 for me it's a dream from 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.669
 from a thousand and one night 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.799
 let's imagine ours 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:42.759
 area 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:46.449
 if we could also dream of having something like that 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.769
 but dreams cannot even be realized 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.349
 we must begin by believing if we have the political will to do so 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.349
 obviously looking for the necessary resources 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.019
 but they are not enough 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.339
 we need teeth 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:02.329
 so here I live for her 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.279
 opportunist and once again a friend of ours 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.649
 because he gave us Berlusconi 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.699
 on behalf of the group I wanted somehow thanks 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.729

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.049

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.639

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.270

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.270

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.800
 book our old railway 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.159
 the dream that we put in a drawer but we hope to be able to 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.819
 withdraw out 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.909
 I would ask you vasco zeiss 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.909

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.520

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.389
 computer 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:24.889
 re-do the good morning test you see from the morning must be 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.460
 and I go for courtesy sepia I go to your mother's face 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.009
 I was told 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.969
 I thought I was spelled on the bus 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.479
 padova -7 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:38.919

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.120
 it's important 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.430
 beautiful and exciting railways 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.849
 and that the

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.949
 improving italy 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.550
 last July 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.909
 hm cre tattoo that the railroad 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:06.930
 they pull if he dies and then he also treats them if he dies 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.279
 define it as a world heritage site 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:16.429
 this is the third railway that takes on this characteristic, the first was 

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:18.059
 that of going down into the 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:22.579
 activated in 1454 a deca holiday 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:27.889
 that 2 to reunite rm unite vivienna with the port of trieste 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.710
 the first mountain railways 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.080
 heritage of humanity a second railway always a World Heritage Site 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.119
 one for an Indian whose name I don't remember 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:39.259
 and now this is the third 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.849
 the consolation for us is that 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.309
 and I must say that they are considered a world heritage site 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:46.849
 the highways now 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:49.849
 they never are 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.389
 to make porchetta 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:04.710
 ahhh mainstay of the usg group for other roads for the fauna of charity 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.419
 it's true 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.419
 giovanna private torrent card data 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.220
 a book one day when the rivers pass the farewell of link beppe 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.470
 TV trips will be abandoned 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.520
 like after a pestilence day when you stretched the rain they will stop falling 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.780
 the migratory birds mistaken were hey juss i'm season no longer enter 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.990
 in hibernation 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.160
 there will also come a time when men will be deaf to all this 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.759
 they will forget the grass 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.520
 plants the animals with which they lived for millennium 

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:45.550
 they look like the wounds of Egypt 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.729
 instead it is today's Italy 

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:52.560
 think that one tells us all this a solitary prophet met on the street 

00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:54.419
 we will give him telma 

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:57.840
 or we will be silent for the shame of admitting that it has already happened 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.550
 and to have done nothing to prevent it 

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:07.359
