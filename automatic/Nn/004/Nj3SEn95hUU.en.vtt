00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.170 
brief overview of what it is it's kind
of<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.100> same<00:00:35.309> vein<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.730> couple<00:00:36.030> other

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
of in the same vein as a couple other

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.670 
of in the same vein as a couple other
apps<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.600> we've<00:00:36.719> seen<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.140> terms<00:00:37.380> of

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
apps that we've seen in terms of

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.470 
apps that we've seen in terms of
offering<00:00:38.070> sort<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.610> retro<00:00:39.059> effects

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
offering sort of retro effects

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.100 
offering sort of retro effects
functionality<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.360> guess<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.989> good

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
functionality and I guess it's a good

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.930 
functionality and I guess it's a good
way<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> start<00:00:43.739> actually<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.309> offers<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> lot

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
way to start actually this offers a lot

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.430 
way to start actually this offers a lot
more<00:00:45.270> than<00:00:45.420> some<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> other<00:00:45.809> apps<00:00:46.020> we've<00:00:46.230> seen

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
more than some the other apps we've seen

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.619 
more than some the other apps we've seen
because<00:00:46.590> most<00:00:47.010> tend<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.760> stick<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.149> vinyl

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
because most tend to just stick to vinyl

three<00:02:14.280> different<00:02:14.550> scratch<00:02:14.820> tracks<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.420> have

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
three different scratch tracks that have

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.660 
three different scratch tracks that have
been<00:02:15.630> recorded<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.470> use<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.610> can

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
been recorded for you to use and you can

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.250 
been recorded for you to use and you can
actually<00:02:17.850> change<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.270> volume<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:19.050> those

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
actually change the volume of those

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.620 
actually change the volume of those
scratch<00:02:19.560> tracks<00:02:19.950> within<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> mix<00:02:20.700> obviously

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
scratch tracks within the mix obviously

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.750 
scratch tracks within the mix obviously
it<00:02:21.690> goes<00:02:21.750> from<00:02:21.900> 1<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.350> 11<00:02:22.440> nice<00:02:23.310> little<00:02:23.580> pun

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
it goes from 1 to 11 nice little pun

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.610 
it goes from 1 to 11 nice little pun
there<00:02:24.030> all<00:02:24.780> right<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.960> guess<00:02:25.170> that's<00:02:25.320> just<00:02:25.410> a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
there all right I guess that's just a

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.960 
there all right I guess that's just a
joke<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.160> know<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> nice<00:02:26.490> little<00:02:26.520> joke<00:02:26.940> there

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
joke you know a nice little joke there

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.200 
joke you know a nice little joke there
and<00:02:27.980> either<00:02:28.980> way<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.340> works<00:02:29.520> very<00:02:29.820> very<00:02:29.970> well

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
and either way it works very very well

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.090 
and either way it works very very well
so<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:30.780> fine-tune<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.710> amount<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
so you can fine-tune the amount of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.740 
so you can fine-tune the amount of
scratching<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.850> actually<00:02:33.060> want<00:02:33.480> in

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
scratching that you actually want in

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.910 
scratching that you actually want in
your<00:02:34.560> mix<00:02:34.950> we're<00:02:35.820> going<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> set<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.390> about

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
your mix we're going to set it to about

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.470 
your mix we're going to set it to about
five<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.460> if<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.670> can<00:02:38.820> actually<00:02:39.120> get<00:02:39.240> there

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
five or so if I can actually get there

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.810 
five or so if I can actually get there
there<00:02:40.020> we<00:02:40.110> go<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.530> there's<00:02:41.400> also<00:02:41.550> two

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
there we go and there's also two

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.370 
there we go and there's also two
different<00:02:42.150> skins<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:42.660> worth<00:02:42.840> noting<00:02:43.020> we've

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
different skins it's worth noting we've

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.740 
different skins it's worth noting we've
got<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.740> sort<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.340> 70's<00:02:44.760> look<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.150> then<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.270> 60s

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
got a sort of 70's look and then a 60s

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.210 
got a sort of 70's look and then a 60s
look<00:02:45.930> we<00:02:46.170> happen<00:02:46.410> like<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.710> 60s<00:02:47.100> look

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
look we happen like the 60s look

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.160 
look we happen like the 60s look
slightly<00:02:47.460> more<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.600> because<00:02:48.720> we're<00:02:49.020> kind

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
slightly more I just because we're kind

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.350 
slightly more I just because we're kind
of<00:02:49.200> more<00:02:49.350> partial<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.920> era<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:51.150> otherwise

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
of more partial to the era but otherwise

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.120 
of more partial to the era but otherwise
you<00:02:51.750> know<00:02:51.870> they're<00:02:52.020> both<00:02:52.110> fantastic<00:02:52.380> so

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
you know they're both fantastic so

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.890 
you know they're both fantastic so
actually<00:02:53.670> go<00:02:53.880> ahead<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.030> swap<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.480> and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
actually go ahead and swap to that and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.750 
actually go ahead and swap to that and
of<00:02:55.170> course<00:02:55.380> here's<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> master<00:02:56.040> switch<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.550> turn

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
of course here's a master switch to turn

it another thing you're noticing you or
maybe<00:03:34.950> noticing<00:03:35.520> is<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.730> fact<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:36.180> have

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
maybe noticing is the fact that we have

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.120 
maybe noticing is the fact that we have
to<00:03:36.420> go<00:03:36.540> through<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.750> playlist<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.950> have<00:03:38.070> to

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
to go through this playlist you have to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.500 
to go through this playlist you have to
create<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.370> new<00:03:38.400> playlist<00:03:38.610> each<00:03:39.030> time<00:03:39.330> you

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
create a new playlist each time you

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.060 
create a new playlist each time you
cannot<00:03:39.930> actually<00:03:40.170> go<00:03:40.410> straight<00:03:40.770> from<00:03:40.920> your

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
cannot actually go straight from your

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.970 
cannot actually go straight from your
ipod<00:03:41.460> which<00:03:42.300> is<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.450> bit<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.720> drag<00:03:42.960> but<00:03:43.290> not<00:03:43.710> so

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
ipod which is a bit of a drag but not so

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.770 
ipod which is a bit of a drag but not so
bad<00:03:44.160> as<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.430> drm<00:03:44.850> actually<00:03:45.300> so<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:45.570> means

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
bad as the drm actually so this means

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.030 
bad as the drm actually so this means
that<00:03:45.870> if<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.080> have<00:03:46.320> any<00:03:46.500> songs<00:03:46.770> that<00:03:46.980> were

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
that if you have any songs that were

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.040 
that if you have any songs that were
downloaded<00:03:47.190> from<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.730> era<00:03:47.970> they<00:03:48.630> will<00:03:48.870> not

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
downloaded from that era they will not

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.690 
downloaded from that era they will not
work<00:03:49.320> which<00:03:49.980> means<00:03:50.250> they'll<00:03:50.370> have<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:50.550> get

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
work which means they'll have to get

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.830 
work which means they'll have to get
them<00:03:50.850> from<00:03:50.970> somewhere<00:03:51.330> else<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.630> somehow

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.400 
to do it all stopped abort here really
quick<00:04:28.890> so<00:04:29.850> we<00:04:29.970> didn't<00:04:30.330> have<00:04:30.360> that<00:04:30.840> happen<00:04:31.200> too

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:41.500 
window which is actually quite nice that
sounds<00:05:35.100> a<00:05:35.430> unique<00:05:35.850> sound<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.300> it

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.820 

and<00:05:42.510> of<00:05:42.600> course<00:05:42.630> you<00:05:42.960> can<00:05:43.080> cause<00:05:43.290> this<00:05:43.560> at<00:05:43.710> any

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
and of course you can cause this at any

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.860 
and of course you can cause this at any
point<00:05:44.100> in<00:05:44.340> played<00:05:44.669> using<00:05:44.910> these<00:05:45.150> controls<00:05:45.600> or

point in played using these controls or

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.240 
point in played using these controls or
stopped<00:05:46.139> entirely<00:05:46.440> or<00:05:46.680> even<00:05:46.830> skip<00:05:47.100> to<00:05:47.190> the

next track in your playlist so that's

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.189 
next track in your playlist so that's
pretty<00:05:50.430> much<00:05:50.669> what<00:05:51.030> a<00:05:51.060> auto<00:05:51.449> valve<00:05:51.780> has<00:05:52.020> to

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
pretty much what a auto valve has to

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.960 
pretty much what a auto valve has to
