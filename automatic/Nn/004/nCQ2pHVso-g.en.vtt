 pots are great can within an hour 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.660
 I had recently made it to be 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.100
 just super to see even though 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 the game play we immediately go our first 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.580
 wisdom and stop completely brazilian 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.050
 team that wrinkles here my whole or d 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.699
 went out and the special was bad 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.380
 to get such a roll of tape 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.969
 also view us back here because fredje 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.340
 finnbogason as I have a prediction the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.140
 call whole blessing that scores a piece of cake 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.280
 why I did not want to bow down alfred 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.020
 was called I have no idea 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.640
 but fresh finnbogason the circle and so 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.320
 such a character from any disney 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.579
 series and then know it and I like it 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.899
 it sounds nice so then i go to him 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.640
 just call them unless everyone wants 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.230
 found now you need a peach government their 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.789
 bows so call in your fall in the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.350
 meanwhile scope mentees then one 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.460
 goal out that's how this match if 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.989
 end will come 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.670
 so a one two defeat which is very bad 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.649
 sin is but what makes it so natural 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.149
 only stronger just like that you hare 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.039
 strong stomach like one until it is telling 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.539
 make or defeat on hyves too 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.489
 stronger and we head our 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.290
 Second band I was full of courage to again that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.000
 grab three points and come up against the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.310
 chladni an earth and has a sewer pipe 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.170
 they now buy 1000 team and drift on their own 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.030
 a reason can be playful in it and then 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.070
 I came mate has called the sweaty 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 louis chemistry what this competition contains 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.850
 actually pretty little action because the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.590
 only action is this and allah's not me 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.000
 my all who throws everything out what 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.590
 he has the end score is in one 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.049
 ethically minute very dirty and foil 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.250
 it was about the same as the manure 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.140
 no proportions because I was already the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.670
 better player mini I always fall silent 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 my dirty de la suite still winning 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.369
 goal or a figure of the loss in the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.540
 goal tea 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.189
 so that's why I don't do anything best with one 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.140
 Noord-Holland in small tufts but yes 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.920
 with luckily you also have to come to you 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.240
 end goal 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.710
 so of course we take those points 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.570
 just go straight in our third 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.159
 with again and in this third match 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.869
 I had a few problems with begging 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.450
 him eventually you come against this 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.210
 guest on with his team united and this is 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.350
 again personlized 10442 family and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.180
 premier league team of course always 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.009
 bother us playing but we start 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.570
 fully strong again and this competition 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.549
 especially since the corner here is second 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.810
 goal in the series and it was best 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.969
 quite the wingsuit with his left 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.990
 leg for the rest if you are really extreme 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.250
 poor shooting 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.200
 I thought nothing bad could shoot 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.599
 matsuko the much worse than narsingh 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.150
 should not leave scored twice with 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.829
 I think 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.659
 fresh frits from brushes it too good 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.370
 seen look like you have a single piece 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.470
 by making a nice pass with a couple 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.360
 plenty of banos arabes jordi gyme 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.349
 pieces and there is still a fresh portion 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.000
 with AIDS 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.709
 I want to go headers since when 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.510
 in and out of the impossible corner 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.650
 that city ​​was surprised by what 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.420
 is this again 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.099
 martijn so buy the three here 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.900
 sizes beautiful couple of natural calling 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.189
 the beast because peeling and linking 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.109
 actually start for two words 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.790
 hear that belong together montale 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.560
 they headers are really abnormal 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.060
 well i do have a constructor with 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.650
 sturridge via a pretty nice google 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.720
 to bath a nice pass 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.340
 eventually i will come back with 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.260
 another goaltje because if so hot more 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.579
 for adding and but defending from 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.349
 after a guy who can't get the ball right 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.329
 play away and spell it off 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.859
 barcelona and fresh finnbogason that 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.659
 you actually never score in 4 2 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.730
 which makes me end up with a 4 2 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.379
 bol.com no shima t is but in the end 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.400
 now just looks at number of chances under goal 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.049
 get struct 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.909
 these are big but that country too bad 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.290
 Enough for him to hit the bar and find click 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.180
 enough for me and after that it will 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.829
 your side you back from above so you come 1 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.299
 on 1 with the keeper and hand is actually 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.010
 have to score but yes for the honor of it 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.370
 Finnbogason ones could really just do not 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.169
 walk 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.879
 I can do it almost every rush then I can 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.470
 run your score with company with van boris and 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.120
 looks for not for each other afterwards 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.709
 he still gets a chance in the final minute 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.480
 just another beautiful van der 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.220
 hooves that keeps his goal 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.389
 eventually it comes there are 4 2 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.220
 Buy a victory for me of course 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.540
 another great result because I had 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.159
 a few nice goals comes with actually 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.989
 is also for 10 victory despite one 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.190
 few chances on his part and therefore 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.870
 means we are promoted again 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.010
 to the for the vision so that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.389
 going pretty well 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.889
 i honestly never fought in it 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.909
 would do so well mount the that system 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.280
 are actually not that good at all 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.900
 for one reason the team plays 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.729
 so well together that I finally made it 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.409
 win best film competitions 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:53.109
 but this one was coming against a huge one 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.639
 good team 433 premier league my takes 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.049
 all ' will be the one who's best or how 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.669
 the match scores the first goal 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.840
 I defend very badly on my part 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.349
 that should not come true with 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.909
 elevate 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.319
 because i want you to do it as standard and 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.090
 I really have to unlearn that because it gets 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.650
 against so many unnecessary cabbage again 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.209
 but namely weeded up and down 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.590
 finnbogason that scotty so also one 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.269
 penalty shot by the middle of the middle 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.500
 shoot because yes they are penalties 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.030
 actually a goals that everything must 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.250
 score and tit if it goes through the middle 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.539
 then the opponent doesn't see it and now I 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.859
 I said that I have to go through the counter 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.780
 subscribers know a lot about them so now 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.769
 an always what I do with tights 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.090
 So I should not do the 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.810
 mean score of the chosen 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.190
 narsingh 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.330
 which is very nicely released and the effect is 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.380
 pretty fine the ball in the left corner 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.910
 shoot 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.620
 that's really awful benefits of it 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.630
 my side to get them from thomas 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.560
 where I divide really huge stupid 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.090
 Photo create 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.800
 gets 2 gets 2 but actually flows 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.360
 here the three two with 4 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.920
 of course a rippling yes I said 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.540
 it just now but let that happen best 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.530
 something stupid I pastilles the ball and 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.550
 what I disconnect from the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.010
 iis service 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.390
 I had kicked off like people 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.310
 best or stripped think he occasionally 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.690
 just the service going out as i am now 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.860
 the same therefore I have this one 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.720
 game lost while I actually 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.490
 just be on Berkel Smith 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.080

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.280
 at disney end from the living 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.450
 scopes liked him 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.890
 of course if you do a like on 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.840
