far corner I'm going to talk about the
height<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.590> team<00:02:56.829> because<00:02:57.040> just<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.450> a

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
height of this team because just this a

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.180 
height of this team because just this a
Bundesliga<00:02:59.290> team<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.680> are<00:02:59.799> basically

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
Bundesliga team you are basically

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.099 
Bundesliga team you are basically
getting<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.639> for<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.000> head<00:03:01.150> as<00:03:01.299> I<00:03:01.420> think

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
getting it for the head as I think

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.780 
getting it for the head as I think
because<00:03:02.409> if<00:03:02.680> you've<00:03:02.799> got<00:03:02.889> levendusky<00:03:03.220> up<00:03:03.549> from

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
because if you've got levendusky up from

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.460 
because if you've got levendusky up from
you<00:03:04.420> can<00:03:04.569> expect<00:03:04.810> them<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.019> do<00:03:05.139> that<00:03:05.290> as<00:03:05.440> well

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
you can expect them to do that as well

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.399 
you can expect them to do that as well
