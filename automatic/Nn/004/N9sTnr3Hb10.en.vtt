00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.160
 godfather we are now at papendal 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.350
 and the journey is over and to what extent 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.200
 everyone's button is gone 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.200
 and now focused on heracles we minute 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.599
 flared and in that sense actually still 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.070
 what ran out of competition 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.430
 so that button that really comes from 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.260
 tomorrow yes actually since arrived here 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.960
 have recovered to be imprisoned 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.310
 rule that have played and the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.500
 substitutes just have it 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 trained and go to the wave button 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.570
 and be fit for next Sunday 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.630
 how are you from an incoming in terms of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.850
 injuries at kakuta have therefore failed 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.510
 wait and see how that looks like 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.329
 see 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.920
 and for the rest it was already known 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.690
 boys who were not there so for 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.190
 nothing else is shown with the rest 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.260
 yes of course what was tiring then 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.480
 spicy match in a high 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.550
 temperatures and also really looking european 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.449
 competition that is heavier than it is 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.850
 most competitions here one year one 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.350
 number of injuries I hope the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.199
 most when they are fit is that we are without 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.540
 just fine for art must be special 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.470
 for you and henry that match against 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.790
 heracles tomorrow Sunday Sunday 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.189
 well that part is special because we are there 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.619
 I can be five years and three of them many 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.850
 have worked many times longer and in that 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.920
 sense it is also special because it is now 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.540
 still reasonable versus a month ago 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.210
 we were proof of speech still active 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.939
 in at heracles so in that sense it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.619
 the team from a special competition 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.840
 heracles has largely remained intact 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.640
 has been changed 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.070
 have you here I read recently featured 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.650
 play yes we are myself against it 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.630
 rejected look and is a whole different 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.700
 team are playing they are all 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.310
 things that are otherwise they go along with 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.869
 last year after in detail of course 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.649
 another train your home country day 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.600
 are to lie 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.520
 duarte played right winger that was 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.740
 quite surprising of course because it is one 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 real midfielder is just for the rest 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.369
 is it the way of playing it is 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.149
 remained intact they want to put them busy 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.560
 want to play football 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.240
 I do n't know much about the new 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.799
 team of heracles of course knows that the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.720
 trainer us has come a number 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.150
 boys are gone 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.770
 so it will have to wait how 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.330
 you think it's important to be such a first 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.130
 contest 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.560
 very important especially because the home is 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.060
 give a more equal good signal 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.590
 to the rest of the clips and also to the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.760
 supporters of course 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.340
 I 'd rather start with a victory 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.480
 of course so that the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.830
 that goes without saying no we have 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.690
 of course we go tomorrow for or and 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.940
 Sunday full for the win 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.120
 and then we have to look where we are 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.120
 Hatch
