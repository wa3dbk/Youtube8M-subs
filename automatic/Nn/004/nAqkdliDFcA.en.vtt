but I think a lot of people think of

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.770 
but I think a lot of people think of
gray<00:03:58.290> as<00:03:58.650> such<00:03:59.010> as<00:03:59.190> very<00:04:00.060> much<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.239> winter<00:04:00.570> color

gray as such as very much a winter color

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.980 
gray as such as very much a winter color
and<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.290> isn't

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990

and it isn't
you<00:04:02.080> know<00:04:02.230> if<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:02.800> think<00:04:03.100> how<00:04:03.250> beautiful<00:04:03.850> it

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
you know if you think how beautiful it

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.630

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.340 
looks with white crisp white and and
gray<00:04:06.910> together<00:04:07.180> it's<00:04:07.600> really<00:04:07.840> versatile<00:04:08.290> I

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
gray together it's really versatile I

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.200 
gray together it's really versatile I
think<00:04:08.680> black<00:04:08.830> especially<00:04:09.160> in<00:04:09.430> clothes<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:10.090> can

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
think black especially in clothes it can

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.940 
think black especially in clothes it can
tend<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.480> fade<00:04:10.660> very<00:04:10.690> quickly<00:04:11.140> in<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:11.770> so

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
tend to fade very quickly in it and so
