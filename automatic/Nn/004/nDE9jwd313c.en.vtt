for<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:50.790> interests<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> our<00:00:51.180> sport<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.809> think

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
for the interests of our sport I think

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.590

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
it's nice to give back the community

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.770
