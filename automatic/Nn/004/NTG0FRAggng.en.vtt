00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.390
 hello to all friends of multiplayer.it e 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:04.990
 welcome 29 episodes of is not stuff to 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.260
 women 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.260
 today we will talk about mmo hope first acronym 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:20.919
 today's episode more than a zoom 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.169
 technician on the genre will be a series of 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.039
 reflections aloud that I would like to do 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.659
 with all of you 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.460
 When I think of the son from the massive 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:30.149
 I can think of online multiplayer 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.640
 so many adjectives to describe it discussed 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:36.989
 then a risky chameleon intimate 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.989
 let's start with the considerations immediately 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.120
 the adjective discussed is explained by the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.030
 fact that mmo generates around itself a 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.010
 lots of discussions a lot of users 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.260
 more than on other genres it dives not 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.480
 only on the various features e 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.250
 types that this genre offers one 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.170
 of the most heated debates that usually 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.449
 they always appear when we talk about the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.710
 new title is that of the subscription 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.420
 as we have seen in the episodes 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.550
 precedents when player comes 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.650
 touched in the meta pockets 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.119
 particularly susceptible to the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.550
 axes subscription solution e 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.080
 supporters that opponents as I said 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.750
 before her I more than anything for me 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.759
 another genre can be a type of 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.680
 camaleontic video games that hurt today 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.960
 because if you always adapt and 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.410
 evolve and renew itself in all its 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.820
 phases 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.440
 this is obviously the strong point 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.390
 of the kind that allows one 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.280
 extreme longevity and it is here that 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.619
 the adjective chameleon finds its own 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.619
 meaning a typology of video games 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.259
 so long-lived and so iridescent needs 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.180
 of constant adjustments you think up 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.490
 to allow the player to take advantage 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.709
 in the most enjoyable way of the product 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.569
 obviously all these adjustments 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.679
 then they cost a certain amount of pennies 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.479
 the subscription at the time ai 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.050
 developers to have an albeit 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.060
 minimum 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.649
 a flow of funds continues for the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.830
 because if we want to see the other face 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.810
 of the medal when you bought 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.060
 inside we always find the game is 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.130
 one month free subscription 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.930
 you have to understand what for players and 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.280
 developers agree more and better 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.380
 spend most of ours 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.640
 funds all immediately or sipped 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.470
 within a subscription 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.970
 on the subject I have to declare myself a little 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.320
 undecided faces because I don't know 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.450
 actually what is better 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.340
 probably as the saying goes in 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.140
 average stat virtus so maybe it would be 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.700
 the case of finding a balance with 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.010
 reasonable figure between the price of 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.840
 purchase process and of course for 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.840
 reasonable practices do not mean the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.120
 vectors dc billion of the commitment of the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.890
 elder scrolls show online while 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.660
 instead an appealing solution 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.330
 could be what it was 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.700
 proposal for the outgoing wine star 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.040
 shortly then talking about elder 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.590
 online scrolls for which to spend all 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.200
 that money for an action figures for one 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.300
 map to be friends with everyone a horse 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.220
 white probably with all those 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.610
 money a horse we make a private one for 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.410
 to heaven another reasoning that me 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.420
 comes to mind when talking about what it really is 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.280
 that you but mine is a genre that you don't 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.380
 marries very well with the platform of 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.510
 game console and this always for one 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.610
 issue of bad TV subscriptions ai 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.950
 services that the console offers then gold 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.690
 of xbox and the plastic playstation 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.130
 maybe this is why mmo not 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.570
 never take root in a manner 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.850
 convincing on consoles 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.650
 perhaps but certainly a more reason 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.350
 important is given by the fact that su 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.959
 console has never been proposed a mmo 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.570
 with a convincing game interface 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.980
 referring to mmo development i reconnect 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.040
 to another goal I used 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.060
 at the beginning of the episode, ie 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.640
 risky in fact I like the feeling 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.709
 that mmo are one of those genres a 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.690
 risk of extinction the development of 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.730
 these games is very difficult in 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.200
 primis as we said before for the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.510
 such complexity 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.959
 and then because the mmo are at the level of 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.970
 production a very very expensive kind 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.709
 and it was no coincidence that we were talking about first 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.450
 subscriptions of the continuous patches that 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.250
 are released for these games 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.230
 also another sensation I have 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.209
 always had regard to this particular 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.190
 kind and that this is a kind a bit 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.739
 closed a sort of very exclusive club 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.720
 inside which it is very difficult to enter 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.370
 for development issues per issue 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.349
 of public tastes and above all 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.599
 because you have to ask permission to 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.500
 boss on duty or world of warcraft 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.720
 world war is one of the mmo if not mmo anymore 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.640
 famous of the entire planet and therefore for 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.419
 the new and less in turn who launch themselves 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.430
 on the market 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.320
 It is a difficult time to fight against a 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.850
 big guy like this last 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.820
 consideration I would like to return for a moment 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.590
 on the word closed in fact in my opinion 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.040
 the word there is use could also be 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.380
 interpreted with the exception of underwear e 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.510
 not this kind of underwear any more 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.780
 of any other kind mmo in 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.970
 particularly the mm rpg or a dead person who does not 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.580
 I never really understood how it is produced 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.530
 what a very long and composed theme 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.419
 long series of features that 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.610
 at the moment a hundred times yes 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.110
 they shape the player's preferences 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.820
 and here it is enough to think of course 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.510
 early stages of the game or editing of the 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.030
 character 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.560
 the choice of the faction of the class 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.419
 of the physical characteristics of the 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.889
 character not to mention the 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.510
 party choice of tactics 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.729
 fighting of inventing are 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.590
 really many features e 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.570
 so it is normal for lovers players 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.370
 of this kind not only are they a lot 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.560
 more attentive to the dynamics of development e 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.840
 of playing the game but are also 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.320
 tend to be a little more demanding 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.820
 compared to the other demanding ones 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.100
 is to be understood in a positive sense 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.960
 of the term or those players who 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.060
 I'm always looking for something 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.770
 new to stimulating and here it is in 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.600
 this moment doesn't even become it 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.090
 mirror in which we can see the 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.650
 differences but the differences between what 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.780
 the differences I'm talking about are 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.730
 those of market preferences 6 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.920
 The most common kind of quotes are 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.930
 went to a universal audience for i 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.080
 Online multiplayer media is worth the 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.160
 rule country that go mmo that just the 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.710
 differences between the western market 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.560
 therefore europe america and market 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.480
 Eastern China Japan Korea is abysmal 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.580
 and one of the genres that shows us in 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.650
 most obviously it is a mmo 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.290
 and that's why despite a game like 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.310
 black belt proves extremely 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.020
 appealing especially from the point of 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.930
 view graph leaves however i 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.520
 Western players a bit perplexed 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.110
 so this is the conclusion of mine 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.280
 reasoning aloud that I have you 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.570
 done on trees 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.550
 I'm curious to know what it is 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:12.200
 think to let me know your point 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.700
 of view you can of course leave a 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.230

 Hello
