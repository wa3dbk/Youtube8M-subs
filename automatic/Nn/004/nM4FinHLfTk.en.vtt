come especially not you he did it's at

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.260 
come especially not you he did it's at
this<00:01:26.800> point<00:01:27.070> we<00:01:27.220> realized<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.910> grapes<00:01:28.150> were

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
this point we realized the grapes were

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.260 
this point we realized the grapes were
ripening<00:01:28.660> at<00:01:28.960> different<00:01:29.320> speeds<00:01:29.730> one<00:01:30.730> parcel

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
ripening at different speeds one parcel

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.940 
ripening at different speeds one parcel
would<00:01:31.390> mature<00:01:31.600> completely<00:01:32.320> differ<00:01:32.560> from<00:01:32.710> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
would mature completely differ from the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.240 
would mature completely differ from the
parcel<00:01:33.340> next<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.760> it<00:01:33.850> don't<00:01:34.570> you<00:01:34.720> be<00:01:34.930> able<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
parcel next to it don't you be able to

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.460 
parcel next to it don't you be able to
clip<00:01:36.400> excitement<00:01:37.030> when<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.630> parcel<00:01:37.990> was<00:01:38.260> in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
clip excitement when the parcel was in

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.500 
clip excitement when the parcel was in
and<00:01:38.710> everybody<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.250> remember<00:01:39.510> compartment

and everybody to remember compartment
don't<00:01:41.200> good<00:01:41.530> at<00:01:42.040> this<00:01:42.220> point<00:01:42.580> my<00:01:42.670> colleagues

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
don't good at this point my colleagues

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.060 
don't good at this point my colleagues
and<00:01:43.360> I<00:01:43.450> regularly<00:01:43.780> walked<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.500> vineyards<00:01:44.860> to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
and I regularly walked the vineyards to

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.460 
and I regularly walked the vineyards to
see<00:01:45.250> how<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.520> grapes<00:01:45.820> were<00:01:45.940> evolving<00:01:46.570> we

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
see how the grapes were evolving we

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.530 
see how the grapes were evolving we
always<00:01:47.620> tasted<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.340> berries<00:01:48.700> to<00:01:48.940> determine

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
always tasted the berries to determine

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.420 
always tasted the berries to determine
the<00:01:49.690> most<00:01:49.900> accurate<00:01:50.110> time<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.740> harvest<00:01:50.950> it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
the most accurate time to harvest it

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.240 
the most accurate time to harvest it
became<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.390> tricky<00:01:52.780> process<00:01:53.050> because<00:01:53.680> as<00:01:54.220> a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
became a tricky process because as a

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.550 
became a tricky process because as a
harvest<00:01:54.670> began<00:01:55.030> we<00:01:55.750> would<00:01:55.840> have<00:01:55.870> to<00:01:56.020> move<00:01:56.320> the

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
harvest began we would have to move the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.410 
harvest began we would have to move the
Pickers<00:01:56.980> from<00:01:57.010> one<00:01:57.430> end<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.880> estate<00:01:58.210> to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
Pickers from one end of the estate to

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.420 
Pickers from one end of the estate to

harvested<00:02:00.940> at<00:02:01.060> precisely<00:02:01.480> the<00:02:01.690> right<00:02:01.840> time

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
harvested at precisely the right time

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.719 
harvested at precisely the right time
