than the 1530s a lot of kits and stuff

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.690 
than the 1530s a lot of kits and stuff
come<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.140> those<00:01:34.259> carbon<00:01:34.650> fiber<00:01:34.829> 50<00:01:35.189> 30s<00:01:35.549> of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
come with those carbon fiber 50 30s of

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.569 
come with those carbon fiber 50 30s of
the<00:01:35.759> movie<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.299> those<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.500> bit<00:01:37.680> naff<00:01:37.920> these

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
the movie and those are a bit naff these

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.190 
the movie and those are a bit naff these
are<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.850> lately<00:01:39.150> provide<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> lot<00:01:39.810> more<00:01:39.840> thrust

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
are on lately provide a lot more thrust

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.510 
are on lately provide a lot more thrust
so<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> point<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.280> these<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so that's that's the point of these the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.740 
so that's that's the point of these the
idea<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.000> make<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.420> quick<00:01:42.570> as

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
idea is just to make this as quick as

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.859 
idea is just to make this as quick as
possible<00:01:42.930> there's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.040> full<00:01:44.340> day's<00:01:44.880> 32<00:01:45.509> it's

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
possible there's a full day's 32 it's

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.380 
possible there's a full day's 32 it's
not<00:01:46.020> an<00:01:46.140> acro<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> again<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.030> just<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> give

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
not an acro so again it's just to give

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.179 
not an acro so again it's just to give
you<00:01:48.479> upgrade<00:01:48.899> paths<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.159> a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
you upgrade paths so that this is a

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.710 
you upgrade paths so that this is a

one of these in testing replacement
parts<00:02:25.209> will<00:02:25.390> be<00:02:25.420> easily<00:02:26.080> available<00:02:26.680> at<00:02:26.950> low

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
parts will be easily available at low

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.960 
parts will be easily available at low
price<00:02:27.489> that's<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.060> major<00:02:28.450> boon<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.520> goes

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
to every single parts on here so there's

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.960 
to every single parts on here so there's
nothing<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:32.830> here<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:33.160> you<00:02:33.430> can't<00:02:33.670> break<00:02:33.850> the
