00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.479
 Hello everyone and the moment arrived the 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:06.310
 at which point I will say what 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:10.480
 everyone was waiting and that is 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:13.000
 I hate gta 5 good is not coÃ±a did not give the 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.680
 gta 5 or just disappointed but 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.969
 with the passage of time I have learned that 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.610
 I like the game I have learned to love 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.680
 to the game and now even though it's not my people 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.930
 favorite gta favorite is still the 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.460
 4 right now the 5 is one of my games 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.100
 favorites because it's very well done 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.930
 has a lot of good things and what 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.270
 I wanted to say in this video it was about 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.430
 this past time of a year ago that 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.050
 Stop making videos and it's good that 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.000
 it turns out that I did not make videos because 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.840
 I wanted to pursue my dream of being a 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.480
 famous and a respected hollywood actor 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.210
 ok not that, it's also simply 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.739
 I did not want to make it more videos 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.480
 I said in many comments too but 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.579
 as people kept telling me and 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.130
 asking and all this well then what 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.930
 I say in this video 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.460
 I went through a time when I did not have 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.380
 desire to make videos and without any desire 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.910
 to make videos I 'm not going to do them and 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.620
 simply summarized as it is that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.510
 lately I have wanted again 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.790
 make videos especially with the output 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.800
 of getafe inco I started with the editor of 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.770
 sequences and all this is very well 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.330
 since I've started doing videos and I 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.510
 thought to keep making videos about the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.330
 gta 5 mostly commented videos 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.740
 they have also asked me and neither 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.470
 is that they really want to make them 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.780
 I like making videos with stories 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 videos with the mode this sequence the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.970
 gta 5 moving the cameras or videos 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.259
 action or humor of laughter like that of 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.000
 trevor burning his house because he 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.580
 find a bug so my videos 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.950
 favorites are that kind of videos more than 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.950
 the commented ones that another commented 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.500
 I'll just make a lot less commented 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.970
 than the others what I wanted to say with 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.979
 this video was also a little about the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.229
 future of the channel on these videos that 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.940
 I'm going to do about when I'm going to do 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.619
 videos I will not put a date for 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.360
 videos, much less I'm not going to 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.860
 do for example a video a week 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.470
 I will not make a video when I want 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.030
 can some video be a day later 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.560
 from another video that he has made 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.600
 and then be two weeks without doing 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.610
 video because maybe in those two 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.170
 weeks I do not think what to do 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.209
 I just want to upload videos that I like and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.670
 I like how they are and make them 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.760
 seeing already talked about this I would like 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.360
 say one thing about gta 5 and it's that 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.190
 the sequence editor is a bit bad 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.620
 I liked it a lot more 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.060
 editor of gta 4 sequences because 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.160
 for example when something happened to you in the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.810
 gta 4 as I was always recording what 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.610
 what has happened to you in the whole game 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.350
 we hit a button and then we save it 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
 what happened to you and then you could 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.370
 edit the camera and all that 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.530
 instead in elgeta 5 this mode 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.720
 repetition is often disabled 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.420
 only every time you change your character or 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.100
 that you change so that you die 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.110
 you find that it has been deactivated and 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.239
 you have to remember to activate it again 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.550
 so I can record it for you and then 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.890
 be able to save those minutes and many 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.780
 Sometimes I've found that when 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.209
 something happens to me in the game I give to 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.280
 recover this that has happened to me and I 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.930
 I find that it is disabled and 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.060
 then I had to record it with a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.070
 screenshot looks as if 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.490
 I was playing directly using with 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.220
 the H 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.990
 with the minimap and all this and I can not 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.370
 change the site cameras or any 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.710
 of these good things that is what 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.720
 has the pc then my videos of 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.700
 acrobatics failures and weird things the great 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.470
 most things that appear in those 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.730
 videos are going to keep seeing like this 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.200
 while I play it 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.760
 I will not be able to change the cameras or 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.409
 these things 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.209
 I hope this is fixed with a 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.849
 future patch because also every time 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.860
 that you die and if it was activated, not 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.530
 you can recover because when you go back to 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.329
 appear alive that counter has 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.980
 restarted and then you do not have in 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.409
 repeat the way you have 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.940
 dead and when you die you can not give 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.579
 button because it no longer works to save 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.560
 the repetition that thing in 4 if 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.390
 it worked because when I died I told you if 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.000
 you wanted to save it and I let you save it 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.069
 in 5 I would also not like 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.530
 tell you that if you are going to use modes in 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.560
 the gta 5 that you are careful because it is 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.120
 that there is a wave of fussiness in which 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.519
 just use them in story mode 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.799
 they are bathing a lot of people I have 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.099
 used in history almost every day the 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.739
 I used and luckily I have survived 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.720
 I still have not been banned but there is a 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.180
 many people to which without using them in 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.100
 online and without being hackers or anything they have 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.039
 summer they have bathed the multiplayer 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.269
 of gta 5 and therefore that you have care 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.320
 with what you do because you can 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.750
 drive 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.330
 and that 's another thing I do not know why they handle 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.980
 why is it that motorcycles are the host 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.500
 the bikes for now that have been doing 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.960
 in less than a month already to the mountains that 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.160
 for gta 5 are very good and then not 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.230
 I can imagine what they are going to do 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.610
 within a year within two years and not 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.820
 I'm talking about graphic modes 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.580
 as lnb and these things I'm not talking 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.140
 for example a zombie boat a type 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.630
 of iceta are going to make a way 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.960
 multiplayer good indeed I already have 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.480
 cast your eye to two multiplayer modes 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.450
 mt type and amp types that were for san 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.180
 andreas as energy 5 I've already seen 2 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.440
 in news they are doing and so 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.450
 I want to see what they can do 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.010
 with that to see if they can for example 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.040
 put animals already in the multiplayer 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.530
 thing that I started is not in consoles either 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.120
 bad old in play 3 and that I think 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.980
 that they had not put animals because 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.770
 due to limitations of the console 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.660
 they left but being pc because they have not 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.490
 put animals in multiplayer as 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.850
 I hope that in these modes they allow 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.580
 animals or what to jump and give to the circle 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.310
 to fall down doing the tent what is that 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.260
 to put the physics and throw you head 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.000
 and well, many other things that 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.310
 I would like to see in the multiplayer of 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.310
 gta online or in the multiplayer of the 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.140
 gta 5 in this mode because for example a 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.480
 server kind of iceta they did it 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.340
 also for san andreas in mt and 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.050
 they were very good because I want to 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.360
 see if they can do that in Algeria 5 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.460
 because one day I did it is on the map and in 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.800
 the world of gta 5 could be very 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.380
 good and good because this I think is 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.580
 everything for now the video is a bit more 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.710
 length of which I have been up to 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.770
 now but hey I wanted to talk a little 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.050
 about all this that counted here and then 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.460
 that little is had with videos or not 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.900
 I will continue with good videos and I will continue with 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.360
 means because in my head I already have 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.920
 some of us think what to do and well 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.050
 what until then 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.050
 goodbye forget bye bye
