 I did not find much information in 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.850

 four-stroke 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.619
 I occupied him before they can occupy the 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.210
 another not necessarily the same ay give me 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.390
 good results that's why I buy it 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.010

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.600
 the oil change but in a next 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.610
 video we can see how the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.970
 cleaning the air filter that this 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.210
 it's here 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.390
 super easy has two in one takes us out and 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.870
 is cleaning that filter if the motorcycle 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 has a lot of time of use one can 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.230
 take out that piece and buy the new good 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.230
 what we are here 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.890
 one has to come down 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.100
 and you will see a bolt that is here 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.100
 because they look 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.020
 that's where it is 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.110
 the motorcycle oil good one pulls out is 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.090
 eternal has to be careful because if 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.830
 the motorcycle already walked a long time and the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.440
 nation the change existence and oil 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.620
 it's going to come out very hot they can burn 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.260
 they have to do it with care 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.540
 once that poison is made it goes to 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.150
 begin to occur the oil 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.930
 it 's important that the bike is 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.530
 right 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.580
 I do not have my dressing gown on so I do not know 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.650

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.420
 good also matter the type of oil 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.280

 remains of dirt 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.970
