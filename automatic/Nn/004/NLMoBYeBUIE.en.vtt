then you know you have a certain amount

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.140 
then you know you have a certain amount
of<00:01:05.460> space<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.909> your<00:01:05.970> computer<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.040> what<00:01:08.040> a

of space in your computer and what a
defragmentation<00:01:09.150> does<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.619> takes<00:01:10.890> all<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
defragmentation does is it takes all the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.820 
defragmentation does is it takes all the
gaps<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.090> been<00:01:12.240> created<00:01:12.869> by<00:01:12.900> by<00:01:13.770> you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
gaps that have been created by by you

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.499 
gaps that have been created by by you
deleting<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.460> programs<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.000> reinstalling

deleting your programs and reinstalling
new<00:01:15.750> ones<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.140> deleting<00:01:16.500> those<00:01:16.710> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
new ones and then deleting those and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.770 
new ones and then deleting those and
reinstalling<00:01:17.460> other<00:01:17.880> video<00:01:18.299> clips<00:01:18.630> or

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
reinstalling other video clips or

whatever it is

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.910 
whatever it is
it<00:01:20.970> takes<00:01:21.270> those<00:01:21.390> gaps<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.439> moves<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it takes those gaps and and moves the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.030 
it takes those gaps and and moves the
files<00:01:23.100> around<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.610> close<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> gaps<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
files around to close the gaps and

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.499 
files around to close the gaps and
basically<00:01:26.040> makes<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.700> easier<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.270> your

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
defragmentation right here what I like

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.359 
defragmentation right here what I like
to<00:01:45.149> do<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.930> free<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.799> space<00:01:47.070> on

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to do is I like to do a free up space on

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.740 
to do is I like to do a free up space on
your<00:01:47.399> hard<00:01:47.520> disk<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.329> here<00:01:48.479> first

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
your hard disk which is right here first

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.210 
your hard disk which is right here first
what<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.110> does<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.530> gets<00:01:49.860> rid<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> any

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
what that does is that gets rid of any

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.889 
what that does is that gets rid of any
unnecessary<00:01:50.670> files<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.630> don't<00:01:51.780> need

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
least holes in your computer systems so

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.780

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
could mean that you need to defragment

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.190 
could mean that you need to defragment
your<00:02:17.580> computer<00:02:17.910> if<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.780> scroll<00:02:19.020> down<00:02:19.080> here

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.610 
defragmentation on a weekly basis I
actually<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:26.840> about<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.960> weekly<00:02:28.140> basis

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
actually do it on about a weekly basis

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.320 
actually do it on about a weekly basis
if<00:02:28.740> not<00:02:28.920> twice<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.250> week<00:02:29.490> just<00:02:29.670> because<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.060> have

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.560 
and so my computers seem to get bogged
down<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.740> they<00:02:35.220> run<00:02:35.400> really<00:02:35.640> slow<00:02:35.880> if<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.450> go

down and they run really slow if you go

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.060 
down and they run really slow if you go
up<00:02:36.690> here<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.930> where<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.200> says<00:02:37.320> rearrange<00:02:37.860> items

you can tell on our C Drive we don't

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.070 
you can tell on our C Drive we don't

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
that we don't move the red is the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.150 
that we don't move the red is the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
of and as you can see there's quite a

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.449

bit<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.750> red<00:03:57.870> space<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.830> bigger<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.250> chunk

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
bit of red space the bigger the chunk

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.630 
bit of red space the bigger the chunk
means<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.480> bigger<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.989> file<00:04:01.290> that

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
means the bigger the file that

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.759 
means the bigger the file that
originally<00:04:02.640> occupied<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.299> space<00:04:03.769> most

originally occupied that space most

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.820 
originally occupied that space most
likely<00:04:05.100> it<00:04:05.190> was<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.310> video<00:04:05.610> clip<00:04:05.850> or<00:04:06.030> something

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
likely it was a video clip or something

likely it was a video clip or something
this<00:04:07.830> is<00:04:08.040> your<00:04:08.130> estimated<00:04:08.549> disk<00:04:08.760> usage<00:04:08.970> before

this is your estimated disk usage before

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.240 
this is your estimated disk usage before
your<00:04:09.720> defragmentation<00:04:10.410> so<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.769> shows<00:04:11.010> you

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
your defragmentation so it shows you

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.400 
your defragmentation so it shows you
what<00:04:12.000> your<00:04:12.150> disk<00:04:12.540> space<00:04:12.600> looks<00:04:13.079> like<00:04:13.230> you've

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
what your disk space looks like you've

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.310 
what your disk space looks like you've
got<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> lot<00:04:13.799> of<00:04:14.060> fragmented<00:04:15.060> files<00:04:15.360> and<00:04:15.780> barely

got a lot of fragmented files and barely

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.140 
got a lot of fragmented files and barely
any<00:04:16.470> disk<00:04:16.829> space<00:04:17.010> so<00:04:17.549> what<00:04:17.640> we're<00:04:17.820> going<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:17.970> do

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
any disk space so what we're going to do

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.090 
any disk space so what we're going to do
is<00:04:18.329> we're<00:04:18.479> going<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.690> click<00:04:18.989> defragment<00:04:19.950> and

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
is we're going to click defragment and

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.500 
is we're going to click defragment and
under<00:04:20.640> here<00:04:20.910> it's<00:04:21.060> going<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.239> show<00:04:21.390> our

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
under here it's going to show our

estimated disk usage after the
defragmentation<00:04:24.120> so<00:04:24.870> after<00:04:25.140> the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
defragmentation so after the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.970 
defragmentation so after the
defragmentation<00:04:25.470> runs<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.970> once<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.419> click<00:04:27.570> on

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
defragmentation runs so once we click on

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.030 
defragmentation runs so once we click on
fragment<00:04:29.140> it<00:04:30.140> goes<00:04:30.350> into<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.710> like<00:04:30.890> I<00:04:30.920> said

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
fragment it goes into the like I said

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.770 
fragment it goes into the like I said
the<00:04:31.220> analyzation<00:04:31.820> mode<00:04:32.180> again<00:04:32.480> where<00:04:32.660> it's

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
going to analyze your system now it's

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.300 
going to analyze your system now it's
saying<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.020> we<00:04:36.170> don't<00:04:36.440> have<00:04:36.680> enough<00:04:36.950> free

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
saying that we don't have enough free

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.700 
saying that we don't have enough free

space in order to read front to run the
defragmentation<00:04:39.980> because<00:04:40.760> technically<00:04:41.450> you

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
defragmentation because technically you

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.720 
defragmentation because technically you
have<00:04:41.720> to<00:04:41.780> have<00:04:41.870> at<00:04:41.960> least<00:04:42.020> 15%<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.860> space<00:04:43.550> on

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
have to have at least 15% of space on

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.710 
have to have at least 15% of space on
the<00:04:43.820> computer<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.210> run<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.480> defragmentation

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
the computer to run the defragmentation

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.490 
the computer to run the defragmentation
and<00:04:45.410> we<00:04:45.950> have<00:04:46.070> 12<00:04:46.370> but<00:04:46.640> 12%<00:04:47.240> but<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.260> says<00:04:48.470> that

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
and we have 12 but 12% but it says that

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.930 
and we have 12 but 12% but it says that
you<00:04:48.680> can<00:04:48.770> only<00:04:48.830> use<00:04:49.010> 7%<00:04:49.640> for<00:04:49.700> the<00:04:49.790> disk

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
you can only use 7% for the disk

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.060 
you can only use 7% for the disk
Defragmenter<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:50.750> technically<00:04:51.590> we<00:04:51.800> shouldn't

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
Defragmenter so technically we shouldn't

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.640 
Defragmenter so technically we shouldn't
be<00:04:52.130> running<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.400> disk<00:04:53.350> defragment<00:04:54.350> or<00:04:54.440> anyway

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
be running the disk defragment or anyway

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.450 
be running the disk defragment or anyway
but<00:04:54.770> I'm<00:04:54.830> going<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:54.980> show<00:04:55.070> you<00:04:55.130> how<00:04:55.220> to<00:04:55.250> do<00:04:55.400> it

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
but I'm going to show you how to do it

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.040 
but I'm going to show you how to do it
I'm<00:04:55.790> going<00:04:55.880> to<00:04:56.000> click<00:04:56.180> yes<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:56.630> go<00:04:56.720> ahead<00:04:56.840> and

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
I'm going to click yes to go ahead and

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.990 
I'm going to click yes to go ahead and
run<00:04:57.200> it<00:04:57.230> so<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:57.500> can<00:04:57.650> see<00:04:57.830> what<00:04:57.950> happens<00:04:58.370> see

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
run it so you can see what happens see

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.850 
run it so you can see what happens see
what<00:04:59.240> happens<00:04:59.600> is<00:04:59.780> now<00:05:00.110> we<00:05:00.170> have<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:00.590> bar

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
what happens is now we have this bar

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.500 
what happens is now we have this bar
down<00:05:01.040> at<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.220> bottom<00:05:01.610> that<00:05:01.640> says<00:05:01.880> estimated

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
down at the bottom that says estimated

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.480 
down at the bottom that says estimated
disk<00:05:02.690> usage<00:05:02.900> after<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.560> defragmentation<00:05:03.860> so

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
disk usage after the defragmentation so

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.520 
disk usage after the defragmentation so
as<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:05.120> computer<00:05:05.510> is<00:05:05.540> being<00:05:05.750> defragment<00:05:06.410> at

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
as the computer is being defragment at

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.770 
as the computer is being defragment at
these<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:07.220> red<00:05:07.460> spots<00:05:07.970> should<00:05:08.360> begin<00:05:08.720> to

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
these the red spots should begin to

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.410 
these the red spots should begin to
disappear<00:05:09.350> now<00:05:09.970> because<00:05:10.970> of<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.180> lack<00:05:11.390> of

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
disappear now because of the lack of

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.000 
disappear now because of the lack of
space<00:05:11.780> on<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.080> system<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.560> don't<00:05:12.620> want<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:12.890> run

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
space on the system I don't want to run

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.770 
space on the system I don't want to run
this<00:05:13.160> too<00:05:13.310> long<00:05:13.460> because<00:05:13.730> I<00:05:13.790> don't<00:05:13.970> know<00:05:14.180> it's

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
this too long because I don't know it's

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.780 
this too long because I don't know it's
really<00:05:14.930> going<00:05:15.140> to<00:05:15.200> do<00:05:15.350> much<00:05:15.560> or<00:05:15.740> not<00:05:15.860> that<00:05:16.670> just

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
really going to do much or not that just

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:17.980 
really going to do much or not that just
means<00:05:17.000> I<00:05:17.060> need<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.210> clear<00:05:17.480> off<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.660> few<00:05:17.900> more

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
means I need to clear off a few more

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.900 
means I need to clear off a few more
files<00:05:18.260> but<00:05:18.590> basically<00:05:19.220> in<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.430> end<00:05:19.520> what<00:05:19.820> you

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
files but basically in the end what you

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.300 
files but basically in the end what you
should<00:05:20.060> see<00:05:20.240> down<00:05:20.390> here<00:05:20.420> is<00:05:20.930> no<00:05:21.320> red<00:05:21.650> no<00:05:22.280> red

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
should see down here is no red no red

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.910 
should see down here is no red no red
marks<00:05:22.910> at<00:05:23.210> all<00:05:23.420> and<00:05:24.280> mostly<00:05:25.280> all<00:05:25.430> white
