 I'll cut the potatoes like this 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.170

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.920

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.629

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.530
 a maximum of six 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:38.420

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:47.489

 here the cabbage is all waiting when it boils 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.370

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.850
 then not ready if gently means 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.250
