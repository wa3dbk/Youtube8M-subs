hardware I think hardware stores that's
what<00:04:19.800> I'm<00:04:19.860> trying<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> say<00:04:20.250> it's<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.400> hardware

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
store and looks like we're right in the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.950 
store and looks like we're right in the
middle<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.490> parking<00:04:23.850> lots<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.420> we're

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
middle of the parking lots and we're

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.100 
middle of the parking lots and we're
it's<00:04:25.380> like<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:26.610> looks<00:04:26.670> like<00:04:26.850> it's<00:04:27.090> dawn<00:04:27.360> not

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
it's like it looks like it's dawn not

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.750 
it's like it looks like it's dawn not
dawn<00:04:28.410> but<00:04:28.650> dust<00:04:28.920> because<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:29.340> see<00:04:29.520> some

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
dawn but dust because I see some

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.220 
dawn but dust because I see some
lightness<00:04:30.150> still<00:04:30.390> in<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.600> sky<00:04:30.870> but<00:04:31.170> the

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
lightness still in the sky but the

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.380 
lightness still in the sky but the
lights<00:04:31.650> are<00:04:31.770> on<00:04:31.920> so<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:33.060> leads<00:04:33.240> me<00:04:33.300> to

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
lights are on so that leads me to

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.550 
lights are on so that leads me to
believe<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.780> it's<00:04:34.110> nighttime

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
believe that it's nighttime

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.980 
believe that it's nighttime
which<00:04:35.130> is<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.370> very<00:04:35.670> dangerous<00:04:36.120> situation<00:04:36.960> to

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
which is a very dangerous situation to

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.980 
which is a very dangerous situation to
be<00:04:37.140> facing<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.710> horde<00:04:37.890> because<00:04:38.280> these<00:04:38.460> walkers

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
be facing a horde because these walkers

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.200 
be facing a horde because these walkers
they<00:04:39.990> can<00:04:40.170> see<00:04:40.290> in<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.440> dark<00:04:40.680> okay<00:04:41.580> they<00:04:41.850> they

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
they can see in the dark okay they they

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.910 
they can see in the dark okay they they
don't<00:04:42.360> need<00:04:42.510> light<00:04:42.750> we<00:04:43.110> need<00:04:43.290> light<00:04:43.530> so<00:04:43.800> they

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
don't need light we need light so they

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.560 
don't need light we need light so they
can<00:04:44.100> attack<00:04:44.520> us<00:04:44.700> from<00:04:44.790> all<00:04:44.970> angles<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.480> we

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
can attack us from all angles and we

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.700 
can attack us from all angles and we
don't<00:04:45.690> know<00:04:45.780> where<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.050> hell<00:04:46.200> they<00:04:46.290> come<00:04:46.500> from

and imma get out of it now Sarah on the
other<00:04:52.620> hand<00:04:52.920> this<00:04:53.700> may<00:04:54.000> be<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.270> decision<00:04:54.840> you

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
other hand this may be a decision you

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.600 
other hand this may be a decision you
have<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.230> make<00:04:55.260> you<00:04:55.830> could<00:04:55.950> probably<00:04:56.160> either

have to make you could probably either

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.530 
have to make you could probably either
save<00:04:57.060> Sarah

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
save Sarah

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.540 
save Sarah
or<00:04:57.750> maybe<00:04:58.320> Sarah's<00:04:58.680> gonna<00:04:58.830> die<00:04:59.070> in<00:04:59.130> this<00:04:59.280> scene

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
or maybe Sarah's gonna die in this scene

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.580 
or maybe Sarah's gonna die in this scene
one<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.420> those<00:05:00.570> two<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:00.780> think<00:05:01.230> it's<00:05:01.380> definitely

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
one of those two I think it's definitely

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.180 
one of those two I think it's definitely
gonna<00:05:01.860> happen

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
gonna happen

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.670 
gonna happen
and<00:05:02.340> it<00:05:02.790> may<00:05:03.090> actually<00:05:03.120> be<00:05:03.540> reliant<00:05:04.260> on<00:05:04.410> your

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
and it may actually be reliant on your

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.680 
and it may actually be reliant on your
choice<00:05:04.950> in<00:05:05.130> Episode<00:05:05.550> two<00:05:05.640> where<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:06.360> decide

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
choice in Episode two where you decide

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.690 
choice in Episode two where you decide
whether<00:05:06.960> or<00:05:07.020> not<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.200> teach<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.590> get<00:05:07.770> Sarah<00:05:08.130> how

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
whether or not to teach to get Sarah how

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.550 
whether or not to teach to get Sarah how
to<00:05:08.760> shoot<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.120> gun<00:05:09.150> even<00:05:09.870> though<00:05:10.020> Sarah<00:05:10.320> doesn't

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
to shoot a gun even though Sarah doesn't

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.530 
to shoot a gun even though Sarah doesn't
have<00:05:10.770> any<00:05:11.040> weapons<00:05:11.580> in<00:05:11.700> our<00:05:11.850> hands<00:05:12.090> right<00:05:12.180> now

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
have any weapons in our hands right now

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.870 
have any weapons in our hands right now
I<00:05:12.830> think<00:05:13.830> that's<00:05:14.070> gonna<00:05:14.250> actually<00:05:14.340> go<00:05:14.580> come<00:05:14.790> up

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
I think that's gonna actually go come up

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.910 
I think that's gonna actually go come up
into<00:05:15.030> place<00:05:15.330> somehow<00:05:15.810> I'm<00:05:16.230> just<00:05:16.440> not<00:05:16.650> sure<00:05:16.890> how

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
into place somehow I'm just not sure how

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.400 
into place somehow I'm just not sure how
but<00:05:17.700> Sarah's<00:05:17.970> life<00:05:18.210> is<00:05:18.450> on<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.720> line<00:05:18.870> in

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
but Sarah's life is on the line in

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.260 
but Sarah's life is on the line in
episode<00:05:19.890> three<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.310> I'm<00:05:20.670> guessing<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.060> this

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
episode three and I'm guessing that this

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.930 
episode three and I'm guessing that this
scene<00:05:21.480> takes<00:05:21.750> place<00:05:21.900> after<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:23.280> fact<00:05:23.640> when

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
scene takes place after the fact when

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.970 
scene takes place after the fact when
Carver<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:24.510> Clementine<00:05:25.020> see<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.590> herd<00:05:25.830> of

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
Carver and Clementine see the herd of

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.670 
Carver and Clementine see the herd of
walkers<00:05:26.310> approaching<00:05:26.820> them<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.240> a<00:05:28.230> little

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
walkers approaching them and a little

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.810 
walkers approaching them and a little
bit<00:05:28.770> later<00:05:28.950> after<00:05:29.130> that<00:05:29.280> because<00:05:29.430> car<00:05:29.670> was

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
bit later after that because car was

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.660 
bit later after that because car was
compounding<00:05:30.480> isn't<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.170> most<00:05:31.350> fortified

so<00:05:33.660> some<00:05:33.930> walkers<00:05:34.230> find<00:05:34.500> their<00:05:34.650> way<00:05:34.800> in<00:05:35.130> and

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
so some walkers find their way in and
