00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.210 
simple to make you don't need a lot of
ingredients<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:32.060> let's<00:01:32.090> begin<00:01:32.840> by<00:01:33.110> adding<00:01:33.410> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
ingredients so let's begin by adding the

ingredients so let's begin by adding the
sugar<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.880> two<00:01:38.810> eggs

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:02:01.070 

can<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:48.970> see<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.210> whisk

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.380 

next<00:02:01.890> we're<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.550> dissolve<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.090> baking

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390

next we're going to dissolve the baking
soda<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.900> water

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.160 

then<00:02:24.340> we<00:02:24.610> can<00:02:24.760> add<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.690> egg<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.080> sugar

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
going to gradually sift them into the

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:53.059 
going to gradually sift them into the
mixture

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:04.080 

we're<00:02:53.370> gonna<00:02:53.489> go<00:02:53.670> ahead<00:02:53.849> and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.300 

we're<00:03:04.630> going<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.020> let<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.290> mixture<00:03:05.590> rest<00:03:05.739> for

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
whole beans

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.350 
whole beans
like<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:22.019> or<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.769> mash<00:03:24.069> mine<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:28.150> the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
like this or I like to mash mine so the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.360 
like this or I like to mash mine so the
batter<00:03:28.569> has<00:03:28.900> been<00:03:29.110> resting<00:03:29.290> for<00:03:29.500> 30<00:03:29.890> minutes

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
batter has been resting for 30 minutes

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.140 
batter has been resting for 30 minutes
and<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.959> found<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:32.470> be<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:33.220> little<00:03:33.489> thick

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
and I found it to be a little thick

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.620 
and I found it to be a little thick
at<00:03:34.660> first<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.310> added<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.880> tablespoon<00:03:37.330> of

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
at first so I added a tablespoon of

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.380 
at first so I added a tablespoon of
water<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.069> consistency<00:03:39.489> should<00:03:40.000> be<00:03:40.269> like

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
water so the consistency should be like

00:03:40.390 --> 00:04:33.170 
water so the consistency should be like
this

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.740 

so<00:04:34.180> the<00:04:34.630> bubbles<00:04:35.050> are<00:04:35.350> starting<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.010> come<00:04:36.190> out

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
so the bubbles are starting to come out

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.330 
so the bubbles are starting to come out
that<00:04:37.750> we're<00:04:38.170> going<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.350> wait<00:04:38.560> for<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:38.920> few<00:04:38.980> more

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
that we're going to wait for a few more

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.000 
that we're going to wait for a few more
minutes<00:04:39.930> until<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.260> bubbles<00:04:41.620> are<00:04:41.800> going<00:04:41.920> to

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
minutes until the bubbles are going to

00:04:42.010 --> 00:05:09.170 
minutes until the bubbles are going to
prominent
