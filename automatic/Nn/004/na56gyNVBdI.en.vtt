00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.709
 I still one 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.630
 There hung a tool or a script ever 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.430
 after how one likes to call this 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.170
 pen with the two balls on the ends 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.970
 a big a little ball 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.590
 but you can also just one 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.940
 use toothpicks that works 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.260
 of course very good for that 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.880
 must now not separately song tinkloh 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.380

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.900

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.880
 like that and next time I use 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.560
 baracke further normal of it from 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.900
 evelyn yes i could talk about anyone 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.819
 Any and of course cotton pads like that 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.989
 My nail is clean as you are now 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.239
 I can see my nails 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.709
 rounded and that I do that 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.630
 that's because or I have 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.190
 that's why I'm stiletto 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.569
 wanted to do nails but my nails so 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.300
 Loading is still too short is a bit more 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.530
 grow a bit 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.000
 but now it's actually like that 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.280
 I also wanted to tell you that I am 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.500
 no nail designer so if I 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.230
 do something or do it differently 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.420
 thus the nail care or with the base 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.340
 code or whatever you let it all 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.420
 So really let me do that 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.600
 as I want it 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.489
 so is best for me and have been there 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.730
 no problems with it and i know i am 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.000
 not the perfect nail designer or 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.200
 perfect girl that can do it all 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.579
 So you also see that I am not color 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.019
 the vespa has solved a bit and 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.390
 looking so good but looking 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.560
 can not be perfect so i can do it 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.630
 not really perfect 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.530
 I can conjure it up like it's good 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.600
 looks and yes that looks like this 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.360
 So first I use the base 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.430
 coach the paint a nail my 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.350
 nature nail or 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.730
 Angela Gelich attacks and yes you can 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.350
 have applied nail polish on the nails 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.750
 I also asked a lot of people it is not 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.310
 problem 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.050
 so if your base dried well 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.430
 is you then take your subject 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.170
 you want used, I now know 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.940
 Of course you can also turquoise 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.380
 take or take money there will be 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.790
 Flowers are simply beautiful 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.510
 Can you turn flowers on natural yellow 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.480
 or I do not know how to make pink or 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:24.410
 in blue but make blue pants well 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:25.669
 or red depending on how you want it 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.560
 It is best if the first layer 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.910
 let it dry and then another 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.970
 layer over it then that's nice 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.160
 cover and then also better so 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.530
 when the nail polish is dried take 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.010
 you then your colors and I take that 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.820
 now first the pink roses to the 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.050
 to draw 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.060
 just take the brush for that 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.229
 nail polish brush you do not have to 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.850
 take somebody cotton swabs or 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.800
 but what else is it trying? 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:56.840
 possible to deny it with not as 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:59.210
 looks so on away and indeed take 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.860
 I now upper corner and raging so 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.860
 on it with the point 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.760
 with that thorough but not exactly 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.760
 I have 33 form now 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.729
 so when your points have dried 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.160
 Then you just take the green one 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:28.160
 nail polish I always do it that way 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.060
 I increase others and then that way 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.380
 then I can trickle on it 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.080
 just take it better and later 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.630
 you can not do anything to make it turn, too 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.039
 not bad because it has to be yes 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:44.910
 anyway not then namely the doping 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:47.539
 tool small, making it the 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.539
 leaves on 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:08.400
 do not have to be so perfect hobby came 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:12.690
 a children splatter are the leaves 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.610
 next is theirs 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.380
 words patch and makes the tip of the 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.750
 Doping tools clean it with you the same 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.820
 can use again next step 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.670
 then use them your brighter pink 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:27.510
 then do it again 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:31.590
 Same principle here a bit of it 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:35.540
 on the lid then user again 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.540
 doping tool little tip 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:41.379
 and make small semicircles in the rose 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:46.119
 purely 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:46.119
 so may I already a little 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:07:02.360
 so that looks a bit more real 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:02.360
 and just does not look so perfect 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:10.050
 if your rose are dried use 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:12.339
 Just give your finish top coat and 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.080
 Just jack her with the simple ones 

00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:23.199
 get a nice shine and that's it 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:25.469
 simply beautiful looks like the water 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.059
 actually too 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:31.120
 So that was already disturbing me 

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:33.520
 I said I only takes a moment to 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.949
 thing of five minutes maybe or 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.539
 also every ten minutes from now on two 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:38.710
 Things were done on my thumb and so on 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:40.960
 on my ring finger I think that it 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.520
 most beautiful my two yes and me 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.990
 Hope my world is also trying 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.370
 and I can be assured at 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.479
 every case arrives very well when I 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.839
 really have my girlfriend with it 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:52.899
 enthusiastic and yes it is a very easy 

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:54.669
 style and does not go fast and the 

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:56.589
 mega nice and you can always again 

00:07:54.669 --> 00:08:01.210
 make new and any other color 

00:07:56.589 --> 00:08:03.039
 take advantage of red or yellow orange now 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.990
 yes in any case, I hope you have that 

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:07.499
 I would like to video until then 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.499
 next time
