00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hey my dear yes i was very hardworking 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.589
 Train in shopping 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.530
 some things are already real 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.059
 from the end of March even but I have 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.950
 look up most of the stuff gets 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.780
 yes in any case online in the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.400
 loading is that always a matter of course 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.289
 you can get different ems 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.119
 different things so in Karlsruhe 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.949
 For example, there is a grazed and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.439
 then there's normal haren ems and stuff 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.300
 that's why you can have a look 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.890
 they still have it online 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.109
 you have a lot of things on everyone 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 fall from it and I have now too 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.340
 still waiting for a few order 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.340
 That's why this wood took longer 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.739
 and for one, these shorts are here 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.899
 I already have some with instagram 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.579
 uploaded so if you are on the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.530
 Current state wants to be followed then 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.510
 it's best to instagram because there 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.070
 I take the most snapshots 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.989
 Of the most beautiful things in the last 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.579
 bought it and then it is 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.680
 usually very up to date and then get it 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.379
 you almost always the things 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 and certainly not this anymore 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.100
 brought these shorts here and then has 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.110
 So sweet little embroidery embroidery 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.400
 punch outs more in there and that are 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.290
 so flowers and hearts and down here 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.630
 again, so small flowers 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.920
 flower pattern and I find something to me 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.170
 probably love that a bit 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.330
 fancier shorts that too loose 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.150
 are sitting so cut and continue 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.460
 I thought it was super nice and the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.310
 I just had to have it then we do it 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.320
 continue with these shorts here sometimes 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.600
 a little something has turned out so 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.610
 black white so my thing that suits you 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.250
 also super pure and that has such a 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.170
 bit of a uniaxial style i think so 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.570
 That's what it's called and that's it again 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.280
 little cute little hearts in there then 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.430
 this row are wrong, for example 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.310
 herzchen and the right rome and so on 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.020
 triangles and dashes and yes I like that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.219
 I like to think it's really great 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:58.799
 made and discovered japan attracted 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.610
 tried on and is bought then come 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.229
 we turn to a neon pink nazis so coral 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.759
 pink but a little bit more after 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.350
 pink, here I think she looks pretty 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.580
 pink from the always while editing 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.520
 looks different, I've heard 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.960
 that's why it radiates several pink 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.630
 pink but that is really the case 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.390
 right with neon colors, I found great 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.250
 super nice and then I have that 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.310
 I think that's the same model 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.810
 bought another with color yes 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.390
 is that you have to be the same 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.940
 fabric, yes, and round it all off 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.210
 easily frayed and just the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.000
 I still bought my son 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.590
 then I bought this bikini 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.630
 oh my god I immediately got into him 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.630
 he really loves it 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.750
 that is so bandow moderately so like one 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.550
 bandeau bra top and then it has just here 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.710
 still so stone in it and that looks like that 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.840
 beautiful from the borders and 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.340
 such a little bit and sparkle 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.870
 really really great 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.900
 I think that's the last one 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.300
 summer at have in green in coral and so on 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.990
 and yes, they bring something similar 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.180
 again and again out and I thought so 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.750
 beautiful and yes in black fits 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.120
 again to everything and therefore ilike 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.460
 then I have this very whole 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.830
 Thin sweater bought its small 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.840
 a little bit longer and also summer 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.310
 Pulli will call it so not if it is 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.740
 But it is really hot when you are in the evening 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.000
 go away again and I like it all 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.640
 wants to wear thin or something to 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.470
 over it or it is just times 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.910
 how a bit colder then have 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.980
 I just bought this and he is 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.620
 in very soft pink and on even 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.420
 steger and yes then already has a few 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.550
 to the really nice far from the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.310
 quality really really great 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.020
 then I have more such a top here 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.590
 Order again on such a sweet 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.170
 delicate pink forward a bit like that 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.510
 around moderately down and back 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.000
 But it is the same form 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.570
 in the back as in the front and here on the collar I 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.820
 Hope you realize that's it 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.830
 so intertwined turns into each other 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.630
 so tender and that is just as well 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.150
 always a little bit more special 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.670
 do not tell us so boring then 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.850
 I once and year fans beckons 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.139
 especially side chest pocket and 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.859
 rosé also absolutely 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.229
 quite unspectacular just like that 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.060
 sweet longer or yes normal long tops 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.259
 as well to the under 10 or general 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.099
 now in the summer you can do it that way 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.319
 attract 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.020
 but how then to the pink I have determined 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:33.099
 five different rosanna such tanktop 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.759
 But are things all 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:40.029
 different courses of pink and yes 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:42.340
 the same then again in so nem june 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.300
 sound brown tone too to put on 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.999
 or sometimes over it 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.879
 and I'm just so pink nude 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:51.099
 Everything in this direction and if it is 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:54.669
 no news rosé black and white is then 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:56.050
 it is similar in summer mintál and 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.590
 I already have very tender ones here 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.629
 kadi kindes really long and just as well 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.520
 very hard fabric has a bit like that 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.699
 wider fret as nearly as such a 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.589
 kimono he is cut and also mega 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.360
 sweet so just put on over it 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:12.219
 so that does not have a bit 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.259
 really warm so really just for 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.819
 the summer thought so or so 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.310
 beefed up because it is just such a 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:21.789
 beautiful color and yes I found a lot 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.969
 sweet then i got a laser 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.250
 in black quite classic but simple 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:29.259
 that 's so soft so that's right 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.740
 here you could crumple so is 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:35.229
 So exactly thin a summer blazer 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.330
 open also has no button bar and 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.789
 I just find really nice because we 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.770
 so smashed and had a collar 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.899
 on the other side too and that 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.810
 simply flatters the figure and he is 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:48.789
 also nice long i like longer ones like that 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.449
 jackets and the like and blazer easy 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.039
 much more 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.449
 and then he still has such bags 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.490
 and I would not order that 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.349
 because I think he looks weird then 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.349
 but so just from the cut 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.870
 Made her super super nice and yes 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.550
 a little sweet summer blazer what 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.110
 take it with you in the evening or in general 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.870
 so that looks a bit nicer 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.210
 Thank you to a garment that 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.889
 I also fell in love with something like that and 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.110
 I think many people are talking now too 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.279
 understand why such a pretty 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.839
 little dress 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:21.310
 So the fastest is gorgeous 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:24.090
 just so beautiful 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.070
 it's covered with lace up here and 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.740
 then a heart-shaped cutout on 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.780
 decollete so easily in the middle 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.330
 it's there again over the belly button 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.040
 so free cut and with 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.800
 lace covered and then just this 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.850
 beautiful rock part down here where 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:45.090
 super nice swinging and behind it is 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.350
 completely out of lace so the shows 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.630
 It's best for you so it is 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.389
 completely a lace trim her behind 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.430
