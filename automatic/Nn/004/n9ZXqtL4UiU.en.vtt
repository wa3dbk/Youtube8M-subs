 would mark of course on this video and 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.520
 I will actually make a draw 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.759
 via the site random.org and 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.670
 and then here is the winner how 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.130
 will be quoted on a video as in 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.729
 presenting the results of this contest 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.799

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.939
 mp youtube to be able to actually have 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.659
 how is a means of communication more 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.579
 simple as skype and we will discuss all 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.289
 both or if it's a string 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.750
 community or if it is a chain 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.049
 with several people who care 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.849
 of the channel actually discuss a little bit of 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.079
 what he wants or what they want 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:55.239
 want for how for their chains 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.420
 so to know already the logo discuss at 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:59.679
 about how the theme forms and 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.649
 all this so it will be really something 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.200
 really personalized thing and after 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.369
 we also discuss what it namely 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.569
 what they will want is a 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.450
 background be an intro and 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.989
 I will use the fact how the logo 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.480
 on the background or the intro here is 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.459
 it will already be a pretty good thing because 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.350
 that as I already said about my other 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.410
 contest I had recently organized 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.489
 a logo that can follow you enough 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.000
 a long time and it can do 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.820
 how a little more about your channel 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.220
 because it attracts many more people I 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.320
 think and do it a little bit more pro than 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.240
 to have a basic text 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.790
 how for example on your background 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.200
 or on your to find a logo this is 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.620
 really a little more compared to 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.130
 your chain and that's so I wanted 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.280
 specify something else of course so 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.260
 if ever the person chosen an intro 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.060
 know that I could use my 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.770
 new plugin that was 3d elements 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.800
 which you could see my last 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.239
 template or even my intro so this 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.340
 would be nice enough because I'm good 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.530
 really begins to discover how this 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.209
 plugin on after effects and there are 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.130
 really huge opportunities for 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.480
 to be able to create a hole and renders 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.800
 are fast enough besides so that's 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.860
 really not bad and who lay that makes 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.140
 much more realistic I find that 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.050
 4d cinema is less boring to do in 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.670
 do so so so bah I do not know 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.760
 after that will be the person to choose 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.760
 we'll see we'll see that how when I 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.360
 would contact her this person who 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.250
 will win this contest and that's good bahs 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.540
