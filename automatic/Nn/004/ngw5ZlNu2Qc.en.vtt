00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
sometimes it's difficult because you

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.900 
sometimes it's difficult because you
need<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.410> cut<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:03.190> it's<00:02:03.460> very<00:02:03.670> difficult

for the rider but I'm preparing and next
day<00:02:06.580> I<00:02:06.670> win<00:02:07.030> time<00:02:07.300> I<00:02:07.830> think<00:02:09.899> trusting<00:02:10.899> in<00:02:11.050> our

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
day I win time I think trusting in our

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.230 
day I win time I think trusting in our
with<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.280> fitness<00:02:12.970> wear<00:02:13.570> for<00:02:14.050> gainful<00:02:14.290> from

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
with a fitness wear for gainful from

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.590 
with a fitness wear for gainful from
so<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.900> think<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:16.500> would<00:02:16.650> buy<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.910> least<00:02:17.910> six<00:02:18.450> or

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
so I think we would buy the least six or

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.440 
so I think we would buy the least six or
seven<00:02:18.930> stage<00:02:19.320> two<00:02:19.590> remaining<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.250> be<00:02:20.450> more

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
seven stage two remaining to be more

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.230 
seven stage two remaining to be more
