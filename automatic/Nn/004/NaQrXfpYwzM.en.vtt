00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.670
 time of day dear lovers 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.600
 sun berries and vines 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.539
 but also on one of the most important issues 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:25.820
 For growers this when open 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.619
 Itâ€™s hard to call a certain date 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.550
 discovery of grapes 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:36.930
 depends on some factors one of 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.140
 Smoking is the major ways and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.910
 features of the pachino climate zone 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.010
 which is your vineyard if 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.559
 you harbor grapes with earth 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.870
 how to do one of these simple 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.050
 ways 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.629
 the link will be at the end of the video abstract 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:06.030
 You can click to see something of course 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.740
 it is necessary to open early here as soon 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.860
 average daily temperature 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:18.750
 will reach 10 about 10 degrees already possible 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 work in the vineyard can be opened 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:27.150
 bushes well if of course yours you know what 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.680
 your grape is in the area where 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.100
 no high probability returnable 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.320
 spring frosts if the sooner you 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.390
 will open 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.030
 Of course vegetation a little earlier 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.299
 start but still do n't think that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.890
 as soon as you discovered you will start right away 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.659
 grow shoots while in the main zone 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.649
 root locations temperature not 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.280
 will reach 10 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:02.219
 about 10 degrees sap flow will begin 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.259
 victory will not sprout well of course 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.489
 If you cover it with a film, it's easier 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:11.370
 fathers raised he aired and even know 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.970
 he opens a familiar grape not 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.780
 vineyard located below 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.870
 there often in the spring there are frosts even in 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.350
 May and he opens the grapes already 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.930
 covered with a film as it turns out 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.110
 she is such a steel color 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.320
 and it opens when it starts to grow 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.590
 victory immediately tied up and holds 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.250
 green operations on them like that he doesn't 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.700
 He risks in the lowland grapes like me 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:48.300
 talked and participated reverse frosts 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.300
 here is this way shelter wakes up 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.600
 covered with bags of such 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:00.610
 polypropylene sweat soil apparatus 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:03.670
 eyes and began to drink so as 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.150
 more likely she will kick it out 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.630
 if the heat will be more rains go 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.250
 why fighter from the frost if you are sure 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.050
 that in your region will not be until -10 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.380
 you can already open here you can work 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.500
 pretty soil dry temperature yesterday 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.709
 it was already up to 15 degrees we are also a little bit 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.860
 back but still very much 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.959
 we processed made sincere schyu 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.280
 processing 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.950
 what and how can you some do it 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.920
 restore them to do the processing to 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.340
 eyes less quality 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.040
 preserved with such a decomposition that this 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.420
 the way is pretty though laborious 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.530
 but, no less reliably, does it cover such 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.620
 way who is not difficult to put likes 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.400
 share in the comments will write me 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.600
 very nice 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.420
 discovering quite easily this soil is slightly 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.799
 bends like here with us 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:11.460
 bags are covered with soil and then 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.310
 takes the edge of the bear 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:18.930
 called the vine we get already 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:25.980
 will you be seen here after you 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:27.420
 opened take took the studs when was 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.900
 what was la eagle owl tomorrow 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.990
 let it be you will rise to spread 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.590
 says the wings do not immediately tie up and 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:42.210
 since now the eyes are very brittle 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:44.790
 especially in places where annual 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.360
 Escape from two years old 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.700
 fragile can crack and then be 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.330
 you have a much smaller crop 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.930
 sap flow is no longer so 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.710
 let her have such a condition 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.820
 can sincere and make processing 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:08.520
 then do a dry garter when 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.560
 already it will sap flow is not a pub 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.140
 how about high motion then vine 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.410
 becomes flexible and plastic and you can 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.440
 and 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:20.580
 the wife he has such of advice from 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.840
 it's time to open us 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.110
 Whether in your speaking I do not know write 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.330
 comments 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:34.460
 good luck to all and stable yields and will 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.460
 write questions to the comments
