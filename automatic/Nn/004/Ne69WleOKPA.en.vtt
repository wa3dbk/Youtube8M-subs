00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.020
 when 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.360
 hello to all of you i hope you like a month it's going very well 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.810
 and today we find ourselves on a poet still typed on modern 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.759
 warfare 2 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.779
 finally that modern infrabel yves while no I did not take some elements 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.769
 positive on the walls 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.669
 so I found about the price and the trash 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.769
 so watch here 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.199
 I make the plasma mistake that the dead so that I arrive late at this 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:33.870
 spot 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.210
 and that she knows she was already waiting for them that I had in normal times 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.190
 relaxes this info the surplus stock 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.020
 so that's been done for three weeks 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.650
 that we have not made videos anymore 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.920
 we are both on vacation for my part I am there oxford 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.960
 to know maybe cox forte it's a university city in 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.250
 England 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.949
 but the summer she transforms herself 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.290
 between cities and English classes 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.550
 and that I write because I was never that English of my life 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.430
 I took options 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.780
 or that there was no envy but it's time to get started I think the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.870
 staff 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.230
 so she can be with someone else other than say yes and so I 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.880
 do 16 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.070
 only seven common pasquier this editing with the software 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.790
 windows under the nose that did not come back 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.940
 2 sony mean on this laptop 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.160
 I was hoping that it will still give a good quality I do not know 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.990
 if I realize if I can put it in hd 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.330
 what is sure is that i would not be honest of colorcon inc 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.090
 but I hope you enjoy it because I will do my best to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.090
 you still give a performance on the board 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.409
 whereas you will see that during these common paris I do my technique 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.780
 is not expensive favelas 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.930
 m i think i'm going to do at 1 28 to 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.860
 why a technique emphasized that on every match 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.780
 so I give you what I call my unique technique 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.490
 on this master stage to stay in this building sis 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.240
 and see in this room three years ago Palestinian cars a window 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.270
 and then the second quarter the group 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.070
 in 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.340
 the other building the one where the suicidal to the scale the door and the window 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.629
 satisfied with these openings 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.590
 I repeat to you around six kilos virtus limousine recipes the excellent idea 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.499
 on that mark a lot of your toques and a lot of people 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:21.909
 and see here I am already at six who is then we have who like and 700 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.769
 points that goes very fast 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.959
 and it goes even faster in domination even if steve would be a little less afp 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.129
 but in my opinion what these documents this document will do more 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.269
 it is a building I am extremely tired comfortable without more we have courses 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.039
 packed room for the holidays to have classes 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.079
 but even having to 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.080
 I am not good 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.529
 he is old school 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:46.309
 not so good 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.309
 after I'm not really on vacation done either ditt passing to near in 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:52.079
 full load by acts on vacation so no time to make us 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:52.889
 videos 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.699
 at home if I still make a video you will 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.219
 for sure again from those pc or so maybe I'll go 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.709
 what do we want to do 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.239
 from home if he is at home 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.759
 I do not know in any case of purchase will not resume 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:10.009
 its normal course of the end of the holidays that is to say in just two 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:11.389
 weeks 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.069
 so I took my head my war machine technique matt is a machine 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.309
 war is rather the technique well 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.469
 how did this other english actually i came i learned 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.699
 head right out of the unpublished game of Angolan store remote control that has 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.269
 makes a youtube video 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.580
 but now it goes without saying nothing has much more sad than 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.379
 sir 8 12 or at loretteville blast 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.540
 she means that this space put bella center m 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.729
 there is so much to give his fall after Islam 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.309
 so I want to show the fangs with the object of approached it should 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.519
 to go except that someone master the support 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.649
 you saw him on the right 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:51.169
 so today I wanted to talk to you about our team 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.649
 sometimes I bought a helmet of the brand whiskey to their number or s 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.049
 it's not that shy that metal 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.909
 yes she was clamoring I hope you know anyway 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.879
 it's also a very good base of yesterday's helmets I hesitated between these 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.239
 wesc helmets and another helmet maybe the bike doctor t the 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.689
 biscione not know 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.519
 it's a headset that has low causes and so for example on a game such as 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.529
 collective we hear the paws of enemies 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.229
 so why did I take these wesc helmets 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.580
 because we actually 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.130
 so that in cases what for example maps uicc the smart winger 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.949
 key sharkoon 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.949
 I get along the best is not because there is their attention 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.680
 it hurts worse 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.810
 it is not serious 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.400
 I got it back nine as it was good this year 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.169
 I'll see on the headphones turtle bitchy inter small amplifier 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.180
 it accentuates the bass and therefore the prices not enemies 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.210
 now the web i have an amplifier homsys hands 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.580
 I told myself that I did not need this little amplifier what it 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.150
 are in these helmets turtle spades and so also buy a belgian helmet that I 

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:02.499
 could also be used on my ipod so it's not worse 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:04.909
 tell me what you think of my purchase 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.309
 in the comments if I would have done better to take the head of the beep according to the 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:09.199
 group not 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.199
 I do not know at all the team will ultimately give the best performance 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.000
 anyway to get around the apple patents 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.990
 it's not what I care about the most it's sad to listen to 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.339
 music 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.110
 why a little star 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.129
 while intel club who dreads 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.389
 thank you very much for the 100000 view for all the Swiss victims 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:29.139
 since we have 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.860
 for the moment 60 this video it's more or less all the same but the hiv 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.110
 are seen by video I have not made any calculations or not to turn around that 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.630
 for each video which is pretty good after six months but on May 6th the 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.610
 more in view 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.339
 very contemporary 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.509
 thank you all thank you to the cicr 2300 subscribers 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:53.120
 so if subscribers stagnate growth because there is a lot 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.379
 subscribers 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:57.919
 because the commentator joffrey jean was part of our values 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.270
 That's why 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.560
 sastre and has moved back a little some devices that have no value 

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:07.269
 so you may have seen the light in - to make videos 

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:09.080
 sponsored so 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.720
 heyer for who he is 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.720
 advertising on your for your videos on youtube 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:16.349
 I find that a little 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:17.849
 abuse 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.619
 I think that 16 dec 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:22.229
 Well, it's a bit of a classic abuse 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.150
 now 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.699
 to be successful on youtube do not make good videos anymore but 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.210
 you also have to pay 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.280
 so it's clear that we will not pay in cash and your expenses 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.689
 but it's a little disgusting for those who make good videos and then 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.129
 now and with whom will make bad 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.349
 but who will know the possible success yes for an advertisement 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.080
 I have nothing a final point before activating not the end of this video 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.240
 it's the tactical insertion report but it's for the two strong tickets 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.729
 rise 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.440
 never ask his tactical insertion and discoveries attention the eyes 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.770
 what did I say yes you do not find it's because of the developers and 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.589
 no community if the trend 

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:04.889
 not very catholic on the live and psn 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.870
 I'm doing this alto thinking what I noticed that nothing in the 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.050
 default classes 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.389
 we already found fan ump a heart sensor 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:15.909
 and by potato launcher so I wonder if with a girl who sees that does not have 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:17.080
 regular players 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.979
 from the beginning of the game 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:22.770
 he used his weapons by putting him in the classrooms by choices 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.990
 in any case I let you meditate on it I hope that in the past a good 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.940
 day club 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.139
