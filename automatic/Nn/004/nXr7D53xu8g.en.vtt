 OPEC, we are focused on this 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:19.020
 I played well there on Sunday and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.930
 flora and that's not cool and then you 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:29.939
 Tell me again, I'm talking a lot. 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:33.600
 with johnny johnny leoni I remembered that I 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.399
 I sang when I was little and I decided 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.969
 let the keyboard go a little further 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.739
 a little not only because it will stop the boy and 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:46.980
 no not you know that does not stop 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.770
 but I set aside to remember to sing 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:57.809
 these things when I was little my 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:59.910
 grandmother also sings on the choir before being 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:07.020
 kicked out 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.930
 the teacher also but so now a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.610
 new time is decided to resume this data 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:18.380
 You will not like it. You'll like what I go. 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:25.560
 to sing a new heartburn now to 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 now when you release it release it is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.530
 It's hard to thrill just like this. 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.600
 Let's see, then, come back a little bit. 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.400
 It just happened because I like 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.040
 work a little, the voice is any 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.040
 thing that works 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:52.950

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:52.950
 helena who are team ale 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.250
 And then I liked it 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:26.810
 the pastor that this will be beautiful and mine 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:36.540
 too many churches flow and who can 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.320
