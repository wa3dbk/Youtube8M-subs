00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 hasan to 2014 on crimi puntoit we give the 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.860
 welcome to a pasta girl who is a 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.679
 of members of old days a franchise 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.560
 true but not only 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.220
 it is not so reductive just 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.109
 absolutely yes 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.529
 let's say it's a project that is born 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.949
 from the production experience of 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.500
 a historic organic farm with bio 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.550
 which produces tofu seitan and ready meals 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.920
 bio and vegetables from 98 and another 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.710
 this is also an entrepreneurial experience 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.309
 twenty years in the world of franchising 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:45.559
 of travel agencies where precisely 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.839
 combining these two experiences and we have 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.879
 let's say caught the 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:55.329
 the opportunity to fill what was 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.420
 a hole in Italian restaurants, that is 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.079
 the 360 degree vegan offer 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.479
 ie from the time of breakfast 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.909
 then cafeteria and passing by the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.600
 classic fast food then the chance 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.479
 to have a sandwich that is not only 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.890
 one hundred percent vegan but also 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.439
 built to have completeness 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.950
 nutritional so we have a burger 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.840
 vegetable a wholemeal bread in all 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.080
 our sandwiches are oil seeds 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.740
 and a hundred percent vegan mayonnaise 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.700
 of which we hold the secret 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.420
 absolutely the recipe that 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.869
 we'll find out in a while I really hope so 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.000
 then we get to the restaurant 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.290
 so it's a real vegan menu 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.880
 from appetizer to dessert is the right time 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.270
 ludico we say that of the aperitif 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.490
 where we have selected wines 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:58.060
 specifically to be suitable for the world 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:02.409
 these are also vegan and cocktails 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.979
 studied and always having the goal 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.319
 precisely to adhere to what the 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.269
 our world the world of 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:14.260
 vegetable food but of living 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.690
 let's say 360 degree franchise vegan 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.150
 which then must be done in the round for the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.980
 well-being of people and animals 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.870
 but also the environment because everything 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.090
 biological 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.900
 what are the next meals the next 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.280
 openings where you already do business we are 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.950
 operating in desenzano del garda e 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.870
 soon in the opening the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.489
 in the next two weeks we have 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.489
 Cesena and Pesaro and then we will get it right away 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:50.470
 after Rome until October 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:54.489
 Milan in 2015 and Florence at the end of 2014 e 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.590
 how a franchise day opened there are 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.739
 let's say several steps the first is 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.840
 clearly informative and therefore 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.710
 we get in touch 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.210
 let's tell you what 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.970
 not only clearly the concept 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:15.770
 catering and but also 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.830
 the investment behind it too 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.470
 why 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.350
 it really is about how to say 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.600
 become entrepreneurs of themselves and 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.050
 get involved in an activity 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.880
 restaurant so it is very important 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.280
 explain all very detailed way 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.470
 the steps that lead from the signature of the 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.590
 contract at the opening of the store 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:43.140
 how to open a franchise day 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.440
 then first of all there is a meeting 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.650
 informative in which precisely we tell 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.480
 all that is the content of 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.640
 our project but also 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.740
 the entrepreneurial project then 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.380
 the investment plan all 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.240
 information needed to evaluate the 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.000
 own commitment and once we say 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.520
 signed and the contract then 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.740
 within the network we pass say 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.110
 the next stage that the part of 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.880
 training that is very important to us 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.950
 and where an information is and a 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.400
 training not only 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.390
 we say theoretical in which precisely 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.419
 tell you everything you need from 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.430
 let's say the permissions until 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.699
 what it means to do the closing of the house 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:39.150
 for instance but also the 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:43.479
 the practical part that lasts a week 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.930
 where it is actually taught let's say 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.240
 in practice, for example, composing the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.050
 sandwich of the gods 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:55.470
 so even those who don't have a sense 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.699
 experience in the field is possible 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.480
 accompanying him on this journey is also 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.950
 switch from a conventional 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.210
 conventional administration one 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.850
 true biological catering 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.700
 absolutely we have already had gods 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:13.400
 cases for example rome where there is a 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:16.170
 conversion practically and I am really 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.810
 enthusiastic to see how right from the 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:25.320
 traditional catering come 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:28.440
 requests for interest to enter 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.050
 part to know however open up to 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.000
 vegan world not only nutrition but 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.100
 also in the broad sense of the world 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.170
 vegan and this gives the measure of how much 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.290
 this message is expressing in 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.720
 this moment its strength and becomes a 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:49.230
 essential message for the future 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:53.760
 of the planet and if we work too 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:58.940
 wanting to make a row of an investment 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.960
 type serves to then open a franchise 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.020
 what figures are we talking about 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.940
 indicatively it is very varied 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:09.360
 clearly depends on the composition 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.060
 of the various modules and we say that we are leaving 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.490
 from the 60 thousand euros therefore an investment 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.240
 all in all content if we think of the 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.280
 complexity of catering and up 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.250
 very small sizes so let's talk 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.430
 of 60 square meters for example a fast 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.160
 food for example 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:31.610
 from here we start to build in a manner 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:35.120
 custom what we say the 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:39.460
 customized project for a specific one 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.090
 location a certain idea of 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.340
 Restaurants 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:48.370
 we hope to see so much around 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.370
 italy for now from fano and all thanks
