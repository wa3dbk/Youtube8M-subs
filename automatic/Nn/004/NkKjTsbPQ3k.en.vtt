underwater environment whether it's
snorkeling<00:03:36.750> diving<00:03:37.280> they<00:03:38.280> then<00:03:38.730> become

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
snorkeling diving they then become

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.940 
snorkeling diving they then become
ambassadors<00:03:39.780> for<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.650> underwater

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950

them<00:03:43.410> what's<00:03:43.620> going<00:03:43.860> on<00:03:43.980> in<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.160> world<00:03:44.310> about

know things like that pollution and when

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.070 
know things like that pollution and when
we<00:03:50.069> teach<00:03:50.760> them<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.060> they<00:03:51.540> can<00:03:51.720> take<00:03:51.930> that

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
we teach them that they can take that

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.330 
we teach them that they can take that
and<00:03:52.290> share<00:03:52.440> that<00:03:52.590> with<00:03:52.620> people<00:03:53.040> who<00:03:53.190> don't
