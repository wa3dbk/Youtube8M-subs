00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
shift these around according their like
how<00:01:43.979> close<00:01:44.250> I'm<00:01:44.460> zooming<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> camera

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
how close I'm zooming in on the camera

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.370 
how close I'm zooming in on the camera
work<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.799> figure<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.579> know<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:49.170> just

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
work on the figure you know so you just

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
work on the figure you know so you just
adjust<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.100> lighting<00:01:50.340> as<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.759> want<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.329> as

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
adjust the lighting as you want it to as

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.300 
adjust the lighting as you want it to as
you<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.259> difficult<00:01:52.770> for<00:01:52.979> white

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
you go on it's difficult for white

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.399 
you go on it's difficult for white
figures<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.360> get<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> lot<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.960> glares

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
figures because you get a lot of glares

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.870 
figures because you get a lot of glares
so<00:01:55.680> sometimes<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.159> end<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.399> pulling<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> back

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so sometimes I end up pulling it back

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.819 
so sometimes I end up pulling it back
more<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.079> see<00:01:58.259> my<00:01:58.380> red<00:01:58.560> alert

picture<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> back<00:01:59.790> looks<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.270> it's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
picture like the back looks like it's

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.120 
picture like the back looks like it's
