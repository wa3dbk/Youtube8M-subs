an<00:00:51.630> honest<00:00:52.050> answer<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.590> playing<00:00:52.920> possum<00:00:53.250> at

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
an honest answer not playing possum at

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.570 
an honest answer not playing possum at
all<00:00:54.560> and<00:00:55.560> I<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> things<00:00:56.220> that's

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
all and I think one of the things that's

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.010 
all and I think one of the things that's
different<00:00:56.700> from<00:00:57.059> me<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> coach<00:00:57.660> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
different from me as a coach is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.990 
different from me as a coach is
generally<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.830> teams<00:00:59.220> that<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.520> done<00:00:59.700> well

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
generally the teams that have done well

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.780 
generally the teams that have done well
that<00:01:00.570> I've<00:01:00.750> coached<00:01:01.080> rather<00:01:01.920> be<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.220> Xavier<00:01:02.640> or

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
that I've coached rather be at Xavier or

type<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.240> feel<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.810> even<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.650> our<00:01:10.860> best

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700

Mark Lyons losing them although I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.389

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
believe we've replaced them with talent

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.940 
believe we've replaced them with talent
it's<00:01:36.149> different<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.869> me<00:01:37.080> especially<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.830> that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
it's different for me especially at that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.430 
it's different for me especially at that
type<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.220> high<00:01:38.520> expectations<00:01:39.330> because<00:01:39.750> you

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
type of high expectations because you

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.990 
type of high expectations because you
know<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.680> you're<00:01:40.800> doing<00:01:41.160> drills<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.580> saw<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
know what you're doing drills you saw it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.480 
know what you're doing drills you saw it
today<00:01:42.149> and<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.069> explain

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
today and it's like you have to explain

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.070 
today and it's like you have to explain
the<00:01:44.729> drill<00:01:44.970> because<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.539> a<00:01:45.569> number<00:01:45.929> of

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
the drill because we have a number of

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.419 
the drill because we have a number of
players<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.500> haven't<00:01:46.740> ever<00:01:46.979> been<00:01:47.130> here

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
players that haven't ever been here

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.010 
players that haven't ever been here
before<00:01:47.459> and<00:01:47.789> have<00:01:48.090> never<00:01:48.300> done<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> drill

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
before and have never done the drill

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
before and have never done the drill
before<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.709> I<00:01:49.950> think<00:01:50.399> we're<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:50.819> team<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.270> will

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
before so I think we're a team that will

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.609 
before so I think we're a team that will
get<00:01:51.539> better<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.959> better<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.319> the<00:01:52.440> year<00:01:52.590> goes

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
get better and better as the year goes

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
get better and better as the year goes
on<00:01:52.950> especially<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.729> health<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> don't

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
on especially with health but I don't

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.169 
on especially with health but I don't
necessarily<00:01:55.740> know<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.009> we'll<00:01:56.130> start<00:01:56.490> off<00:01:56.670> with

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
necessarily know if we'll start off with

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.330 
necessarily know if we'll start off with
that<00:01:57.300> team<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.229> was<00:01:58.709> in<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> Final

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that team that you know was in the Final

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.580 
that team that you know was in the Final
Four<00:01:59.490> last<00:01:59.700> year<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.270> returns<00:02:00.660> everybody<00:02:01.319> and

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
Four last year and returns everybody and

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.960 
Four last year and returns everybody and
you<00:02:01.679> just<00:02:01.830> know<00:02:02.069> what<00:02:02.399> you're<00:02:02.429> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> get

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
you just know what you're going to get

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.840 
you just know what you're going to get
before<00:02:03.240> we<00:02:03.810> even<00:02:03.929> play<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:04.619> think<00:02:04.979> some<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.399> what

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
before we even play I think some of what

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
before we even play I think some of what
we<00:02:06.000> hope<00:02:06.209> is<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.600> happen<00:02:06.959> is<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.800> that

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
we hope is going to happen is just that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.830 
we hope is going to happen is just that
we're<00:02:08.429> optimistic<00:02:08.849> we<00:02:09.300> hope<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
we're optimistic we hope it's going to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.500 
we're optimistic we hope it's going to
happen<00:02:09.990> but<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.340> don't<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.640> evidence<00:02:12.060> or

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
happen but we don't have evidence or

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.480 
happen but we don't have evidence or
proof<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.080> happened<00:02:13.470> before<00:02:13.560> like<00:02:14.040> in

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
proof that it's happened before like in

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.339 
proof that it's happened before like in

other words that experience to me isn't

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:24.790 
other words that experience to me isn't
necessarily<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.220> place

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.720 

very<00:02:25.460> athletic<00:02:25.640> team<00:02:26.260> very<00:02:27.260> tall<00:02:27.800> team<00:02:28.250> maybe

very athletic team very tall team maybe

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.190 
very athletic team very tall team maybe
the<00:02:28.940> potential<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.570> be<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.720> deep<00:02:29.960> team

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
the potential to be a deep team

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.060 
the potential to be a deep team
depending<00:02:30.710> on<00:02:30.860> on<00:02:31.900> how<00:02:32.900> things<00:02:33.170> shake<00:02:33.410> out<00:02:33.620> you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
depending on on how things shake out you

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.320 
depending on on how things shake out you
want<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.310> try<00:02:34.460> to<00:02:34.520> get<00:02:34.730> out<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.000> run<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.180> little

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
want to try to get out and run a little

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.730 
want to try to get out and run a little
bit<00:02:35.480> more<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.810> year<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.140> generate<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.680> kind

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
bit more this year to generate that kind

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.770 
bit more this year to generate that kind
of<00:02:36.980> offense<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.670> take<00:02:38.120> advantage<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.600> those

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
of offense and take advantage of those

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.930 
of offense and take advantage of those
assets<00:02:39.620> yeah<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.220> think<00:02:40.490> we<00:02:40.580> have<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.700> lot<00:02:40.910> of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
assets yeah I think we have a lot of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.760 
assets yeah I think we have a lot of
versatility<00:02:41.510> in<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.900> group<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.230> seven<00:02:42.590> or<00:02:42.680> eight

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
versatility in a group of seven or eight

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.740 
versatility in a group of seven or eight
players<00:02:43.100> you<00:02:43.520> know<00:02:43.640> if<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.060> look<00:02:44.180> at<00:02:44.300> even<00:02:44.630> the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
two freshmen of our three aaron gordon

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.420 
two freshmen of our three aaron gordon

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
and rondae jefferson you know what makes

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.190 
and rondae jefferson you know what makes
them<00:02:49.640> good<00:02:49.850> as<00:02:50.000> they<00:02:50.150> can<00:02:50.210> do<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> lot<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.780> things

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
them good as they can do a lot of things

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.140 
them good as they can do a lot of things
they're<00:02:51.620> very<00:02:51.920> good<00:02:52.130> defensively<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:52.940> why

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
they're very good defensively and why

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.480 
they're very good defensively and why
they're<00:02:53.360> good<00:02:53.540> defensively<00:02:54.020> there<00:02:54.860> multiple

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
they're good defensively there multiple

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.060 
they're good defensively there multiple
position<00:02:56.360> defenders<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.170> offensively<00:02:57.860> it's

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
position defenders and offensively it's

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.400 
position defenders and offensively it's
the<00:02:58.250> same<00:02:58.490> they<00:02:58.760> they<00:02:59.180> can<00:02:59.390> pass<00:02:59.630> they<00:02:59.990> rebound

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
the same they they can pass they rebound

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.230 
the same they they can pass they rebound
they<00:03:00.590> can<00:03:00.740> push<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.100> ball<00:03:01.220> in<00:03:01.370> transition<00:03:01.550> so

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
they can push the ball in transition so

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.330 
they can push the ball in transition so
yes<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.110> think<00:03:03.320> with<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.530> we<00:03:03.740> have<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.130> be<00:03:04.250> an

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
yes I think with that we have to be an

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.180 
yes I think with that we have to be an
outstanding<00:03:04.640> defensive<00:03:05.540> team<00:03:05.720> we<00:03:06.710> have<00:03:06.740> to<00:03:07.040> be

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
outstanding defensive team we have to be

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.130 
outstanding defensive team we have to be
an<00:03:07.370> outstanding<00:03:07.660> rebounding<00:03:08.660> team<00:03:08.900> on

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
an outstanding rebounding team on

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.290 
an outstanding rebounding team on
offense<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.680> defense<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.910> think<00:03:10.970> some<00:03:11.270> of

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
offense and defense and I think some of

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.720 
offense and defense and I think some of
the<00:03:11.420> points<00:03:11.660> we<00:03:11.930> have<00:03:11.960> to<00:03:12.170> generate<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:13.400> get<00:03:13.610> us

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
the points we have to generate to get us

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.820 
the points we have to generate to get us
in<00:03:13.910> transition<00:03:14.540> have<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.810> come<00:03:15.080> off<00:03:15.320> of<00:03:15.650> those

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
in transition have to come off of those

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.060 
in transition have to come off of those
things<00:03:16.130> right<00:03:16.310> there<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.260> every<00:03:18.260> coach<00:03:18.530> you

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
things right there and every coach you

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.980 
things right there and every coach you
know<00:03:19.190> has<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.520> adapt<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.120> personality<00:03:20.840> and

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
know has to adapt to the personality and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.870 
know has to adapt to the personality and
talents<00:03:21.410> within<00:03:21.620> within<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.310> team<00:03:22.460> they<00:03:22.670> have

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
talents within within the team they have

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.750 
talents within within the team they have
that's<00:03:23.540> where<00:03:23.870> our<00:03:24.020> talent<00:03:24.560> lies<00:03:24.740> and<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.460> think

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
that's where our talent lies and I think

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.420 
that's where our talent lies and I think
the<00:03:25.910> size<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.660> maybe<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.590> versatility<00:03:28.190> of

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
the size and maybe the versatility of

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.760 
the size and maybe the versatility of
our<00:03:28.640> players<00:03:28.940> if<00:03:29.600> we<00:03:29.840> walk<00:03:30.050> it<00:03:30.260> up<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.560> just<00:03:30.680> go

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
our players if we walk it up and just go

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.520 
our players if we walk it up and just go
half<00:03:31.040> court<00:03:31.340> versus<00:03:31.670> half<00:03:31.850> court<00:03:32.180> we<00:03:33.170> may<00:03:33.350> not

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
half court versus half court we may not

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.770 
half court versus half court we may not
be<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:34.220> team<00:03:34.459> that<00:03:34.489> everybody<00:03:35.060> hopes<00:03:35.360> we<00:03:35.600> can

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
be the team that everybody hopes we can

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.970 
be the team that everybody hopes we can
be<00:03:35.900> but<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.230> think<00:03:36.470> if<00:03:36.560> we<00:03:36.680> get<00:03:36.830> out<00:03:36.950> in

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
be but I think if we get out in

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.760 
be but I think if we get out in
transition<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.910> can<00:03:38.510> manufacture<00:03:39.260> baskets

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
transition and can manufacture baskets

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.290 
transition and can manufacture baskets
off<00:03:39.920> some<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.310> those<00:03:40.459> things<00:03:40.700> we<00:03:40.910> just<00:03:40.940> talked

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
off some of those things we just talked

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.510 
off some of those things we just talked
about<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:41.840> think<00:03:42.350> we'll<00:03:42.739> be<00:03:42.770> fine<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.340> most

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
about I think we'll be fine and most

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.949 
about I think we'll be fine and most
importantly<00:03:43.940> I<00:03:44.000> believe<00:03:44.300> will<00:03:44.540> improve<00:03:44.780> as

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
importantly I believe will improve as

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:57.020 
importantly I believe will improve as
the<00:03:45.020> year<00:03:45.290> goes<00:03:45.320> on

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.960 

step<00:03:57.780> back<00:03:57.959> for<00:03:58.620> me<00:03:58.830> Sean<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.640> just<00:03:59.790> give<00:03:59.910> me

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
kind of a big picture take on Arizona

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.790 
kind of a big picture take on Arizona
basketball<00:04:03.360> obviously<00:04:04.319> this<00:04:04.470> was<00:04:04.620> not<00:04:04.770> a

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
basketball obviously this was not a

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.020 
basketball obviously this was not a
program<00:04:05.220> that<00:04:05.400> needed<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.670> whole<00:04:05.850> lot<00:04:06.000> of

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
program that needed a whole lot of

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.640 
program that needed a whole lot of
rebuilding<00:04:06.420> when<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.900> got<00:04:07.080> here<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.410> was<00:04:07.440> one

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
rebuilding when you got here it was one

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.290 
rebuilding when you got here it was one
of<00:04:07.740> great<00:04:07.950> programs<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.670> country<00:04:08.850> thanks

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
of great programs in the country thanks

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.070 
of great programs in the country thanks
to<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:10.050> great<00:04:10.319> lute<00:04:10.890> Olson<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:12.120> left<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.720> great

to the great lute Olson you left a great

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.199 
to the great lute Olson you left a great
program<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.560> Xavier<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.400> come<00:04:14.610> here<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.120> you

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
program and Xavier to come here so you

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.129 
program and Xavier to come here so you
knew<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:15.859> but<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.130> sort<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.459> knew<00:04:17.780> maybe<00:04:18.780> in

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
knew that but you sort of knew maybe in

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.050 
knew that but you sort of knew maybe in
a<00:04:19.560> big<00:04:19.799> picture<00:04:20.160> way<00:04:20.310> that<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.639> program<00:04:21.030> has

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
a big picture way that the program has

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.900 
a big picture way that the program has
to<00:04:21.450> grow<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.930> evolve<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.530> improve<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:23.250> now

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
to grow and evolve and improve so now

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.600 
to grow and evolve and improve so now
that<00:04:24.120> this<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.270> your<00:04:24.480> fifth<00:04:24.720> year<00:04:25.430> chart<00:04:26.430> for

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
that this is your fifth year chart for

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.850 
that this is your fifth year chart for
me<00:04:26.700> sort<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:26.940> where<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.360> program<00:04:27.930> has<00:04:28.230> come<00:04:28.590> in

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
me sort of where the program has come in

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.800 
me sort of where the program has come in
these<00:04:29.310> last<00:04:29.580> five<00:04:29.880> years<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.419> what's<00:04:30.720> that

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
these last five years and what's that

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.830 
these last five years and what's that
next<00:04:31.290> step<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:31.800> as<00:04:31.950> a<00:04:31.980> program<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:33.570> need<00:04:33.720> to

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
next step that as a program you need to

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.180 
next step that as a program you need to
take<00:04:33.990> or<00:04:34.200> is<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.350> just<00:04:34.470> simply<00:04:34.680> a<00:04:34.860> matter<00:04:35.040> of

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
take or is it just simply a matter of

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.430 
take or is it just simply a matter of
continuing<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.000> recruit<00:04:36.300> guys<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.930> come<00:04:37.320> in

continuing to recruit guys that come in

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.790 
continuing to recruit guys that come in
a<00:04:37.470> lot<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.620> games<00:04:37.940> first<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.120> all<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.600> came<00:04:40.590> here

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
a lot of games first of all I came here

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.230 
a lot of games first of all I came here

program<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:58.919> think<00:04:59.190> was<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.400> best<00:04:59.639> you<00:05:00.540> say

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
program you think was the best you say

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.870 
program you think was the best you say
for<00:05:01.229> example<00:05:01.350> North<00:05:01.770> Carolina<00:05:02.190> needs<00:05:02.490> the

for example North Carolina needs the

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
last 20 years and put us against at

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.800 
last 20 years and put us against at
Arizona<00:05:07.700> you'll<00:05:08.700> be<00:05:08.850> astonished<00:05:09.180> at<00:05:09.570> like

Arizona you'll be astonished at like
some<00:05:10.200> of<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.320> team<00:05:10.500> pictures<00:05:10.919> you<00:05:11.070> marvel<00:05:11.520> at

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
some of the team pictures you marvel at

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.260 
some of the team pictures you marvel at
the<00:05:12.590> other<00:05:13.590> purpose<00:05:14.190> or<00:05:14.400> reason<00:05:14.430> that<00:05:15.000> I<00:05:15.090> would

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
the other purpose or reason that I would

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.279 
the other purpose or reason that I would
say<00:05:15.479> that<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.720> came<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.320> Arizona<00:05:16.380> is<00:05:17.390> it<00:05:18.390> was<00:05:19.169> in

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
say that I came to Arizona is it was in

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.830 
say that I came to Arizona is it was in
an<00:05:19.410> awkward<00:05:19.620> transition<00:05:20.039> I<00:05:20.700> think<00:05:21.660> if

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
an awkward transition I think if

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.800 
an awkward transition I think if
everything<00:05:22.440> is<00:05:22.590> just<00:05:22.800> absolutely<00:05:23.190> smooth<00:05:23.850> you

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
everything is just absolutely smooth you

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.719 
everything is just absolutely smooth you
know<00:05:24.840> coach<00:05:25.110> Olsen<00:05:25.320> kind<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:25.830> coached<00:05:26.520> his

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
know coach Olsen kind of coached his

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.670 
know coach Olsen kind of coached his
last<00:05:26.910> game<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.450> then<00:05:27.600> wrote<00:05:27.960> into<00:05:28.289> the<00:05:28.410> sunset

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
last game and then wrote into the sunset

last game and then wrote into the sunset
I<00:05:29.160> don't<00:05:30.120> know<00:05:30.210> if<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.390> was<00:05:30.479> necessarily<00:05:31.020> would

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
I don't know if it was necessarily would

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.040 
I don't know if it was necessarily would

because<00:05:44.839> of<00:05:44.990> kind<00:05:45.199> of<00:05:45.259> an<00:05:45.379> awkward<00:05:45.529> four-year

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:46.219 
because of kind of an awkward four-year

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.420 
because of kind of an awkward four-year
period<00:05:46.520> of<00:05:46.729> time<00:05:47.029> it<00:05:47.870> gave<00:05:48.259> me<00:05:48.830> a<00:05:48.860> chance<00:05:48.979> and

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
period of time it gave me a chance and

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.760 
period of time it gave me a chance and
our<00:05:49.580> staff<00:05:49.819> a<00:05:50.059> chance<00:05:50.330> on<00:05:50.839> the<00:05:51.349> negative<00:05:51.559> side

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
our staff a chance on the negative side

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.920 
our staff a chance on the negative side
there<00:05:52.669> was<00:05:52.849> a<00:05:52.879> little<00:05:53.210> rebuilding<00:05:53.689> you<00:05:53.809> know

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
there was a little rebuilding you know

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.689 
there was a little rebuilding you know
some<00:05:54.139> good<00:05:54.259> fortune<00:05:54.680> getting<00:05:55.400> Derrick

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
some good fortune getting Derrick

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.510 
some good fortune getting Derrick
Williams<00:05:55.879> and<00:05:56.240> Solomon<00:05:56.719> Hill<00:05:57.039> when<00:05:58.039> we<00:05:58.219> did

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
Williams and Solomon Hill when we did

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.659 
Williams and Solomon Hill when we did
allowed<00:05:59.509> us<00:05:59.719> to<00:05:59.749> have<00:06:00.110> an<00:06:00.529> elite<00:06:01.129> eight<00:06:01.309> in<00:06:01.550> our

allowed us to have an elite eight in our

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.820 
allowed us to have an elite eight in our
second<00:06:02.150> year<00:06:02.180> and<00:06:02.449> maybe<00:06:02.599> get<00:06:03.289> both<00:06:03.529> feet<00:06:03.770> on

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
second year and maybe get both feet on

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.559 
second year and maybe get both feet on
the<00:06:04.039> ground<00:06:04.189> sooner<00:06:04.669> than<00:06:04.789> we<00:06:04.999> maybe<00:06:05.419> thought

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569 
the ground sooner than we maybe thought

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.739 
the ground sooner than we maybe thought
we<00:06:05.930> could<00:06:06.169> have<00:06:06.580> and<00:06:07.580> then<00:06:08.240> on<00:06:08.389> the<00:06:08.509> flip<00:06:08.629> side

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:08.749 
we could have and then on the flip side

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:12.399 
we could have and then on the flip side
of<00:06:08.990> things<00:06:09.520> I<00:06:10.569> think<00:06:11.569> it<00:06:11.659> was<00:06:11.809> scary<00:06:12.139> at<00:06:12.319> the

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
of things I think it was scary at the

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:13.689 
of things I think it was scary at the
beginning<00:06:12.830> you<00:06:12.919> know<00:06:13.069> things<00:06:13.370> that<00:06:13.490> you<00:06:13.580> may

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
beginning you know things that you may

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:14.920 
beginning you know things that you may
have<00:06:13.819> thought<00:06:14.029> were<00:06:14.210> in<00:06:14.330> place<00:06:14.569> how<00:06:14.870> the

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
have thought were in place how the

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.649 
have thought were in place how the
locker<00:06:15.259> room<00:06:15.559> looked<00:06:15.860> how<00:06:16.669> you<00:06:16.729> traveled<00:06:17.389> from

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
locker room looked how you traveled from

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.019 
locker room looked how you traveled from
not<00:06:18.319> only<00:06:18.349> your<00:06:18.889> team<00:06:19.219> travel<00:06:19.729> but<00:06:19.879> eat

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:20.029 
not only your team travel but eat

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:22.839 
not only your team travel but eat
coaches<00:06:20.710> things<00:06:21.710> changed<00:06:22.159> around<00:06:22.249> the

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
coaches things changed around the

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.850 
coaches things changed around the
country<00:06:23.300> and<00:06:23.330> maybe<00:06:23.689> at<00:06:23.870> Arizona<00:06:24.289> during<00:06:24.740> that

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
country and maybe at Arizona during that

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.909 
country and maybe at Arizona during that
period<00:06:26.199> things<00:06:27.199> weren't<00:06:27.409> moving<00:06:27.740> in<00:06:27.830> that

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
period things weren't moving in that

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.249 
period things weren't moving in that
direction<00:06:27.979> so<00:06:28.699> from<00:06:29.479> our<00:06:29.599> perspective<00:06:29.809> we

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:30.259 
direction so from our perspective we

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.010 
direction so from our perspective we
have<00:06:31.219> tremendous<00:06:31.879> support<00:06:32.270> here<00:06:32.539> I<00:06:32.719> mean

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
have tremendous support here I mean

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.049 
have tremendous support here I mean
again<00:06:33.379> one<00:06:33.649> reasons<00:06:34.039> that<00:06:34.159> I<00:06:34.219> really<00:06:34.849> wanted

00:06:35.049 --> 00:06:35.059 
again one reasons that I really wanted

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:36.579 
again one reasons that I really wanted
to<00:06:35.149> come<00:06:35.300> to<00:06:35.449> Arizona's<00:06:35.899> I<00:06:36.050> played<00:06:36.319> in<00:06:36.499> the

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:36.589 
to come to Arizona's I played in the

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.249 
to come to Arizona's I played in the
kill<00:06:36.800> as<00:06:37.009> a<00:06:37.309> player<00:06:37.699> there's<00:06:38.449> very<00:06:38.779> few<00:06:38.870> places

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:39.259 
kill as a player there's very few places

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:40.869 
kill as a player there's very few places
that<00:06:39.529> give<00:06:39.800> you<00:06:39.949> the<00:06:40.069> feeling<00:06:40.249> that<00:06:40.580> mckale

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879 
that give you the feeling that mckale

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.299 
that give you the feeling that mckale
center<00:06:40.909> does<00:06:41.479> on<00:06:41.689> game<00:06:41.930> night<00:06:42.169> and<00:06:42.409> one<00:06:43.069> of<00:06:43.159> the

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:43.309 
center does on game night and one of the

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:45.869 
center does on game night and one of the
things<00:06:43.339> that<00:06:43.580> helped<00:06:43.939> us<00:06:44.089> initially<00:06:44.360> Seth<00:06:45.259> is

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:45.879 
things that helped us initially Seth is

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:48.610 
things that helped us initially Seth is
to<00:06:46.879> your<00:06:47.059> point<00:06:47.300> about<00:06:47.569> the<00:06:47.930> great<00:06:48.139> tradition

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
to your point about the great tradition

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.369 
to your point about the great tradition
people<00:06:49.069> understand<00:06:49.639> what<00:06:49.729> Arizona<00:06:50.209> is<00:06:50.379> the

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:51.379 
people understand what Arizona is the

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.559 
people understand what Arizona is the
name<00:06:51.649> still<00:06:52.219> had<00:06:52.399> great<00:06:52.639> significance<00:06:52.909> and

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:53.569 
name still had great significance and

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:55.749 
name still had great significance and
part<00:06:53.870> of<00:06:53.930> why<00:06:54.139> we<00:06:54.169> are<00:06:54.529> successful<00:06:55.249> recruiting

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 
part of why we are successful recruiting

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.480 
part of why we are successful recruiting
or<00:06:56.089> if<00:06:56.419> we've<00:06:56.599> had<00:06:56.629> success<00:06:57.189> believe<00:06:58.189> me<00:06:58.370> it's

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
or if we've had success believe me it's

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.279 
or if we've had success believe me it's
attributed<00:06:58.759> to<00:06:59.060> as<00:06:59.360> much<00:06:59.539> about<00:06:59.839> what's

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.289 
attributed to as much about what's

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.559 
attributed to as much about what's
happened<00:07:00.770> here<00:07:00.860> before<00:07:01.009> we<00:07:01.310> came<00:07:01.520> as<00:07:01.789> Who<00:07:02.389> I<00:07:02.449> am

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:02.569 
happened here before we came as Who I am

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:04.600 
happened here before we came as Who I am
on<00:07:02.930> we<00:07:03.110> walk<00:07:03.259> in<00:07:03.529> the<00:07:03.560> gym<00:07:03.830> is<00:07:04.039> the<00:07:04.189> new<00:07:04.310> staff

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
on we walk in the gym is the new staff

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.820 
on we walk in the gym is the new staff
so<00:07:04.969> i<00:07:05.180> think<00:07:05.839> it<00:07:06.050> was<00:07:06.110> almost<00:07:06.259> like<00:07:06.529> I<00:07:06.680> don't

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
so i think it was almost like I don't

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.860 
so i think it was almost like I don't
say<00:07:07.039> the<00:07:07.159> perfect<00:07:07.430> storm<00:07:07.879> but<00:07:08.120> I<00:07:08.149> think<00:07:08.419> it<00:07:08.569> it

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
say the perfect storm but I think it it

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.689 
say the perfect storm but I think it it
allowed<00:07:09.349> you<00:07:09.529> to<00:07:09.620> put<00:07:09.800> your<00:07:09.889> own<00:07:10.009> personality

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:10.699 
allowed you to put your own personality

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.659 
allowed you to put your own personality
on<00:07:10.819> the<00:07:10.909> program<00:07:11.330> get<00:07:12.020> credit<00:07:12.529> and<00:07:12.680> and<00:07:13.580> I

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669 
on the program get credit and and I

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:15.639 
on the program get credit and and I
think<00:07:13.879> having<00:07:14.120> a<00:07:14.330> fan<00:07:14.569> base<00:07:14.779> that<00:07:14.839> was<00:07:15.169> patient

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:15.649 
think having a fan base that was patient

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:17.949 
think having a fan base that was patient
because<00:07:15.979> of<00:07:16.099> that<00:07:16.279> awkward<00:07:16.490> period<00:07:16.969> but<00:07:17.779> no

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:17.959 
because of that awkward period but no

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:19.839 
because of that awkward period but no
doubt<00:07:18.139> about<00:07:18.349> it<00:07:18.499> that<00:07:18.680> tradition<00:07:19.339> still<00:07:19.610> is

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:19.849 
doubt about it that tradition still is

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:23.259 
doubt about it that tradition still is
the<00:07:20.240> backbone<00:07:20.449> of<00:07:20.689> what<00:07:20.930> we<00:07:21.080> have
