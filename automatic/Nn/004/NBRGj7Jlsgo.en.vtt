00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
the picture I used to Beckham was

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.319 
the picture I used to Beckham was
probably<00:02:23.130> when<00:02:23.280> he<00:02:23.370> got<00:02:23.489> his<00:02:23.670> MBE<00:02:23.970> because<00:02:24.239> he

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
probably when he got his MBE because he

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.780 
probably when he got his MBE because he
was<00:02:24.450> all<00:02:24.599> sooner<00:02:24.930> than<00:02:25.170> David<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.739> know<00:02:25.890> and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
was all sooner than David you know and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.819 
was all sooner than David you know and
his<00:02:26.940> hair<00:02:27.209> was<00:02:27.360> very<00:02:27.450> much<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.079> that<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.500> top

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.880 
his hair was very much like that on top
I<00:02:29.250> know<00:02:29.579> it's<00:02:29.849> not<00:02:30.030> now<00:02:30.269> guys<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.200> was

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.250 
I know it's not now guys but that was
the<00:02:32.040> one<00:02:32.190> I<00:02:32.220> thought<00:02:32.340> looked<00:02:33.150> most<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:33.690> bacon

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260

with<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.799> hairstyle<00:02:35.190> on<00:02:35.489> but<00:02:35.760> obviously

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
with that hairstyle on but obviously

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.270 
with that hairstyle on but obviously
there's<00:02:36.690> many<00:02:37.049> many<00:02:37.470> different<00:02:37.650> hairstyles

you<00:02:38.489> could<00:02:38.670> use<00:02:38.880> but<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.329> will<00:02:39.599> change<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.739> way

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
you could use but it will change the way

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.670
