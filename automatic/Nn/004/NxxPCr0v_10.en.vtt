against<00:00:29.180> United<00:00:29.570> but<00:00:30.440> I<00:00:30.470> think<00:00:30.650> the<00:00:30.770> answer<00:00:30.830> is

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
against United but I think the answer is

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.959 
against United but I think the answer is
is<00:00:32.329> probably<00:00:33.050> no<00:00:33.320> I<00:00:33.350> mean<00:00:33.860> you<00:00:34.429> know<00:00:34.550> he's<00:00:34.760> he

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
is probably no I mean you know he's he

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.079 
is probably no I mean you know he's he
scored<00:00:35.300> a<00:00:35.390> lot<00:00:35.510> recently<00:00:35.690> but<00:00:36.079> I<00:00:37.089> city's

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
scored a lot recently but I city's

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:39.759 
scored a lot recently but I city's
problem<00:00:38.420> this<00:00:38.510> year<00:00:38.570> hasn't<00:00:39.050> been<00:00:39.409> I<00:00:39.589> think

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
problem this year hasn't been I think

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.549 
problem this year hasn't been I think
the<00:00:40.069> absence<00:00:40.429> of<00:00:40.550> Tevez<00:00:40.940> it's<00:00:41.179> been<00:00:41.420> it's<00:00:42.350> been

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
the absence of Tevez it's been it's been

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.919 
the absence of Tevez it's been it's been
other<00:00:42.800> factors<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.460> also<00:00:43.789> facing<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.359> you<00:00:44.809> know

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
other factors and also facing a you know

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.770 
other factors and also facing a you know
United<00:00:45.409> side<00:00:45.649> which<00:00:45.999> which<00:00:46.999> i<00:00:47.149> think<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.539> shown

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
United side which which i think is shown

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.959 
United side which which i think is shown
tremendous<00:00:48.289> fortitude<00:00:49.219> this<00:00:49.429> year<00:00:49.699> so<00:00:49.940> don't

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
tremendous fortitude this year so don't

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.569 
tremendous fortitude this year so don't
put<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.510> on<00:00:50.569> Tevez<00:00:50.989> wouldn't<00:00:51.379> be<00:00:51.469> fair<00:00:51.649> checa

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
put it on Tevez wouldn't be fair checa

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.849 
put it on Tevez wouldn't be fair checa
get<00:00:53.089> for<00:00:53.239> it<00:00:53.269> well<00:00:53.569> I<00:00:53.960> know<00:00:54.139> God<00:00:54.379> is<00:00:54.409> not<00:00:54.710> going

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
get for it well I know God is not going

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.099 
get for it well I know God is not going
to<00:00:54.920> be<00:00:55.039> too<00:00:55.249> happy<00:00:55.519> with<00:00:55.850> me<00:00:55.909> here<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.690> yes<00:00:56.899> we

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
to be too happy with me here and yes we

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.809 
to be too happy with me here and yes we
are<00:00:57.229> assuming<00:00:57.559> that<00:00:57.769> Manchester<00:00:58.339> United<00:00:58.670> go

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
are assuming that Manchester United go

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:00.849 
are assuming that Manchester United go
on<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.120> win<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.690> title<00:01:00.049> I<00:01:00.199> will<00:01:00.409> say<00:01:00.530> Carlos

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
on and win the title I will say Carlos

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.759 
on and win the title I will say Carlos
Tevez<00:01:01.219> casa<00:01:01.549> me<00:01:01.789> title<00:01:02.120> not<00:01:02.600> once<00:01:02.929> but<00:01:03.229> twice<00:01:03.469> I

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
Tevez casa me title not once but twice I

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.860 
Tevez casa me title not once but twice I
think<00:01:03.799> if<00:01:04.070> he<00:01:04.159> was<00:01:04.309> there<00:01:04.549> for<00:01:04.580> man<00:01:05.059> Cheney<00:01:05.360> to

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
think if he was there for man Cheney to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.990 
think if he was there for man Cheney to
selected<00:01:06.440> for<00:01:06.590> him<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:06.830> play<00:01:06.980> a<00:01:07.070> part<00:01:07.430> city

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
selected for him to play a part city

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.760 
selected for him to play a part city
 you<00:01:08.480> had<00:01:08.570> been<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.810> stronger<00:01:09.140> position<00:01:09.290> no

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
 you had been a stronger position no

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.800 
 you had been a stronger position no
and<00:01:10.040> then<00:01:10.400> I<00:01:10.520> think<00:01:10.880> bringing<00:01:11.150> him<00:01:11.330> back<00:01:11.540> has

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
and then I think bringing him back has

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.290 
and then I think bringing him back has
had<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:11.990> knock-on<00:01:12.320> effect<00:01:13.090> discipline<00:01:14.090> wise

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
had a knock-on effect discipline wise

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.080 
had a knock-on effect discipline wise
for<00:01:14.660> manchester<00:01:15.170> city<00:01:15.410> that<00:01:15.800> again<00:01:16.340> has<00:01:16.640> cost

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
for manchester city that again has cost

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.780 
for manchester city that again has cost
them<00:01:17.290> janish<00:01:18.290> final<00:01:18.650> say<00:01:18.770> on<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:18.920> whoa<00:01:19.280> I

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
them janish final say on that whoa I

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.630 
them janish final say on that whoa I
think<00:01:20.360> at<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.810> very<00:01:20.840> least<00:01:21.470> he<00:01:22.010> was<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.310> big

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
think at the very least he was a big

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.480 
think at the very least he was a big

reason for disrupting the chemistry for

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.310

to win it and it was informed but of

to win it and it was informed but of
course<00:01:29.810> there<00:01:29.930> are<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.050> reasons<00:01:30.410> we<00:01:30.530> don't

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
lack of experience but I do think that

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.820 
lack of experience but I do think that
manchester<00:01:38.570> city<00:01:38.750> didn't<00:01:39.020> welcome<00:01:39.290> all<00:01:39.650> that

video replays is something that you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.720

we'll have the debate for now I'd be

we'll have the debate for now I'd be

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
very happy if we just solve this issue

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
that video is going to help in some way

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.270 
that video is going to help in some way
if<00:02:38.629> you're<00:02:38.840> able<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.349> look<00:02:39.470> three<00:02:39.890> plates<00:02:40.160> on

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
if you're able to look three plates on

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.830 
if you're able to look three plates on
like<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> decision<00:02:40.910> yeah<00:02:41.120> where<00:02:41.480> do<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.599> stand

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
like a decision yeah where do you stand

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.199 
like a decision yeah where do you stand
on<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.049> I<00:02:42.349> agree<00:02:42.709> with<00:02:42.739> gab<00:02:43.069> if<00:02:43.610> not<00:02:43.879> video

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
on this I agree with gab if not video

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.479 
on this I agree with gab if not video
certainly<00:02:44.660> technology<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.620> start<00:02:46.099> with<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
certainly technology and start with the

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.039 
certainly technology and start with the
black<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:46.970> white<00:02:47.120> with<00:02:47.390> whether<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.840> ball

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
black and white with whether the ball

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.559 
black and white with whether the ball
cross<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.620> line<00:02:48.799> no<00:02:49.099> it<00:02:49.250> didn't<00:02:49.549> then<00:02:50.000> as<00:02:50.390> we

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
cross the line no it didn't then as we

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.509 
cross the line no it didn't then as we
develop<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:51.110> technology<00:02:51.349> and<00:02:51.980> that<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.370> think

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
develop that technology and that I think

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.729 
develop that technology and that I think
will<00:02:53.120> have<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.329> positive<00:02:53.599> effect<00:02:53.959> on<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.560> game

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
will have a positive effect on the game

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.039 
will have a positive effect on the game
then<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.310> look<00:02:55.579> at<00:02:55.670> how<00:02:56.030> replay<00:02:56.840> or

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
then you look at how replay or

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.319 
then you look at how replay or
technology<00:02:57.620> play<00:02:58.130> please<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.459> wide<00:02:58.700> apart<00:02:59.060> but

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
technology play please a wide apart but

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:00.910 
technology play please a wide apart but
I<00:02:59.390> think<00:02:59.810> given<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.170> pace<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.739> game

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
I think given the pace of the game

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.949 
I think given the pace of the game
simply<00:03:01.579> to<00:03:01.730> leave<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.030> down<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.480> officials

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
simply to leave it down to the officials

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.069 
simply to leave it down to the officials
I<00:03:03.230> think<00:03:04.040> it's<00:03:05.030> taken<00:03:05.329> away<00:03:05.510> from<00:03:05.780> the

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
I think it's taken away from the

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.550 
I think it's taken away from the
officials<00:03:06.500> own<00:03:06.709> ability<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.310> do<00:03:07.610> their<00:03:07.790> job<00:03:08.090> in

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
officials own ability to do their job in

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.589 
officials own ability to do their job in
fairly<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.739> impartially<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:11.090> think<00:03:11.390> in

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
fairly and impartially and I think in

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.809 
fairly and impartially and I think in
the<00:03:11.930> end<00:03:11.959> mistakes<00:03:12.829> are<00:03:13.040> costing<00:03:13.549> teams

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
the end mistakes are costing teams

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.059 
the end mistakes are costing teams
dearly<00:03:14.420> at<00:03:14.629> one<00:03:14.870> area<00:03:15.079> of<00:03:15.379> course<00:03:15.650> that's<00:03:15.829> been

dearly at one area of course that's been

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.860 
dearly at one area of course that's been

see it goals are what we play this game
for<00:03:47.840> right<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:48.470> they<00:03:48.650> are<00:03:48.859> important<00:03:49.400> if<00:03:49.459> they

with automatic wage reductions if they
go<00:04:23.810> down<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:25.430> know<00:04:25.490> there's<00:04:25.669> some<00:04:25.849> guys<00:04:26.090> that

McCarthy<00:05:33.300> was<00:05:33.480> but<00:05:33.780> I<00:05:33.810> think<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.110> decision

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
McCarthy was but I think the decision

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.750 
McCarthy was but I think the decision
when<00:05:34.590> it<00:05:34.620> happened<00:05:34.980> I<00:05:35.010> didn't<00:05:35.280> like<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.460> and

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
when it happened I didn't like it and

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.790 
when it happened I didn't like it and
and<00:05:36.450> again<00:05:36.690> I<00:05:36.930> still<00:05:37.260> think<00:05:37.500> they're<00:05:37.590> paying

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
and again I still think they're paying

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.070 
and again I still think they're paying
the<00:05:37.890> price<00:05:38.040> for<00:05:38.100> it<00:05:38.460> so<00:05:38.700> yeah<00:05:39.690> you<00:05:39.750> need
