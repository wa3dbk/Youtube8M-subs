00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
lake is an easy 16 unfrozen but there's

still<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:13.070> know<00:01:13.220> a<00:01:13.549> lot<00:01:14.479> more<00:01:14.539> ice<00:01:14.899> to<00:01:15.110> be

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
still you know a lot more ice to be

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.440 
still you know a lot more ice to be
unfrozen<00:01:15.560> probably<00:01:16.159> about<00:01:16.549> an<00:01:16.850> inch<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.270> two

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
unfrozen probably about an inch to two

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.109 
unfrozen probably about an inch to two
inches<00:01:17.479> of<00:01:17.869> ice<00:01:17.990> left<00:01:18.649> to<00:01:18.799> freeze<00:01:19.100> but<00:01:20.000> the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
inches of ice left to freeze but the

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.180 
inches of ice left to freeze but the
interesting<00:01:20.149> thing<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:20.780> before<00:01:21.229> I<00:01:21.440> left<00:01:21.740> today

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
interesting thing is before I left today

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.790 
interesting thing is before I left today
I<00:01:22.429> looked<00:01:23.090> at<00:01:23.210> my<00:01:23.330> old<00:01:23.679> breaking<00:01:24.679> the<00:01:24.770> ice

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
I looked at my old breaking the ice

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.770 
I looked at my old breaking the ice
video<00:01:25.340> which<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.909> lot<00:01:26.119> alike<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.869> I<00:01:28.780> I

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
video which is a lot alike and I I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.779 
video which is a lot alike and I I
checked<00:01:30.770> on<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:30.979> eighth<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.460> when<00:01:31.550> that<00:01:31.700> was

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
checked on the eighth and when that was

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.999 
checked on the eighth and when that was
uploaded<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.509> when<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.720> film<00:01:32.929> was<00:01:32.990> taken<00:01:33.110> and

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
uploaded and when the film was taken and

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.190 
uploaded and when the film was taken and
it<00:01:34.130> was<00:01:34.280> taken<00:01:34.700> march<00:01:35.000> i<00:01:35.479> think<00:01:36.050> it<00:01:36.140> was

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
it was taken march i think it was

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.090 
it was taken march i think it was
marching<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.060> cool<00:01:38.240> thing<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.860> it's<00:01:39.860> just

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
marching so the cool thing is it's just

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.719 
marching so the cool thing is it's just
more<00:01:40.310> water<00:01:40.610> on<00:01:40.759> frozen<00:01:41.179> head<00:01:42.080> viewer<00:01:42.319> 18<00:01:42.799> and

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
more water on frozen head viewer 18 and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.539 
more water on frozen head viewer 18 and
it<00:01:43.850> was<00:01:44.060> in<00:01:44.390> marked<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:45.020> team<00:01:45.259> which<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:46.310> really

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
it was in marked a team which is really

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.980 
it was in marked a team which is really
great<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.030> which<00:01:47.119> means<00:01:47.179> i'll<00:01:47.600> probably<00:01:47.780> get

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
great so which means i'll probably get

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.990 
great so which means i'll probably get
out<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.319> fishing<00:01:48.610> probably<00:01:49.610> before<00:01:49.759> the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
out and fishing probably before the

and catch a few fish before that's ice
on<00:01:57.890> breezes<00:01:59.380> completely<00:02:00.380> but<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:03.140> know<00:02:03.259> I'm

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
on breezes completely but you know I'm

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.109 
on breezes completely but you know I'm
just<00:02:03.680> out<00:02:03.829> here<00:02:03.859> fooling<00:02:04.280> around<00:02:04.340> props<00:02:04.880> and

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
baits that usually work for the really

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.759 
baits that usually work for the really
really<00:02:07.640> cold<00:02:07.939> pre-spawn<00:02:08.600> conditions<00:02:09.229> they're

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
really cold pre-spawn conditions they're

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.259 
really cold pre-spawn conditions they're
