00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.179
 hello everyone how are you good today 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.340
 I come with the favorite video of 

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:12.130
 spring as you know not only do 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.470
 favorites every month because I do not have 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.510
 enough products to teach you well 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.089
 that now they touch the favorites of 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.519
 spring and let's go to it the first 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:24.279
 favorite is this Korean team cc of the 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.109
 mark albor since if you saw my son from 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.089
 sephora teaches it and I told you that 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.669
 I would use a full review of this product 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:33.309
 but I 'm going to do it after summer 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.810
 because I want to check if it really 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.450
 It adapts to my skin tone both in 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.960
 winter as in summer and that's why I 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.920
 I will do in after summer 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.920
 and tell you what 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:53.100
 well at 40 milliliters so that's the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.780
 pretty good quantity has 45 spf and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.059
 to this day what has used him 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.409
 I liked it a lot, it leaves you a 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.379
 very good looking and very natural aspect 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:05.190
 its price is a tad high of 38 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.380
 euros 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.460
 but I took it with a 20% discount as well 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.259
 that does not go so badly in price and I do not have 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.540
 much more to say because I do not want 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.910
 save for the review so I 've 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.580
 taken out because it really is a favorite and 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.360
 I was using it this spring and nothing 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.190
 more than saying 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.530
 the next favorite this bar 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.240
 lips that is of the slick brand that you 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.570
 I taught it recently my son the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.039
 boutique and it's in a coral color 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:39.509
 exactly is the coral reef 772 and good 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:41.280
 I will show you here a user and a zoom 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.869
 it's the lipstick that I wear right now but 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.850
 I have it blurred because to me these 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.670
 I do not like to wear the intense colors 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.220
 but I like to blur it 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.229
 and I have it quite blurred, I do not know 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.320
 you will notice a lot of color or not but good 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.680
 I'll leave the swatch here and nothing else 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.270
 say that it cost me five euros if I 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.979
 It seems a great color for this time and 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.270
 I liked it a lot, that's why 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.700
 I took out in my favorites 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.920
 the next favorite in which I 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.050
 You have been resting for a long time 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.640
 to see it but I could not miss in my 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.790
 list of spring favorites and it's 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.950
 this nail polish of the brand sally hansen 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.810
 that cost me to be four euros 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.209
 because its price was lowered 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.069
 original is 11 euros and it seems like a 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.030
 super nice color for this 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.580
 spring-summer I'll leave you here too 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.710
 a picture of how they are in the color in 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.720
 the nails 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.130
 and little more than saying that you already have 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.110
 seen a million times because the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.020
 truth is that I love the following 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.640
 favorite is this black of max factor is 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.210
 the first time he gets a black from this 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.090
 brand was looking for a coral color in 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.000
 blas because good since you know that I 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.120
 my makeup changes in spring-summer 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.280
 and I'm pulling to more coral tones had 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.400
 a winter blaze that was one color 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.560
 so pink and I wanted to throw more to a color 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.170
 coral 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.940
 It took me a while to get a blaster 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.530
 I did not have flashes and I would appear there 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.680
 that was full of glitter I do not know 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.260
 what has he given them now to put 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.060
 so many little glitter 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.730
 to the flashes I do not know why but 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.120
 well this is the one that had less 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.689
 Glitters and basically that's why I 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.180
 I took it later to try it I liked it in addition 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:31.810
 very much because it pigments a lot 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.340
 there are a lot of classes that you have to pass 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.849
 thank you very much the brush for really 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.760
 that pimentel and this with a pass already 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.340
 pigment very much I love the color and 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.220
 its price was 11 euros in a 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.440
 personality of I think it was Douglas the 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.000
 next favorite is this perfume that 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.400
 is already in the last as you can see 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.799
 it's from hollister I have it a couple or 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.019
 three years and I do not remember and then they are 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.290
 very much in this spring-summer time 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.810
 because it's a very very fresh smell, not very 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.540
 I know very well for this time because you know 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.400
 that describe odor is a by the 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.049
 camera is a bit difficult but good 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.190
 tell you that it is a very fresh smell that 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:14.349
 love to use at this time but I think that 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.530
 they do not do it anymore I do not know if they only have 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.639
 changed the packaging and the fragrance the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.419
 They maintain that I hope so because 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.190
 I want to go back and buy it if I can 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.040
 but this packaging no longer what 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.110
 you will find it is very similar but it is 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.440
 I think with a flower here in blue or 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.240
 something like that 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.460
 that nothing if I see it again 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.920
 I buy insurance and the price I do not know 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.330
 because it was a gift and nothing but 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.780
 say of this good product and now 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.760
 we went to the clothing favorites and in 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.570
 this case I will show you some shoes 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.430
 what are these fishing dancers that 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.760
 are from last year I bought them at 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.830
 rebates and they cost me 9 with 99 and for 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.960
 make you see that they are super super good 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.900
 They are very comfortable and what I like the most 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.700
 it is the design this part is like that in 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.920
 grid plan and has some flowers 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.250
 embroidered 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.170
 and then even though you see that they are 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.640
 white that are no longer very white but 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.430
 Well what gets dirty most are the 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.010
 tips and what I do is catch a cotton 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.260
 with a little alcohol and it really goes 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.300
 pretty dirt I find great 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.850
 to use them in spring-summer and 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.730
 yes and if you liked it you can find 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.370
 in this season you see that he has taken 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.640
 very very similar to these and nothing more than 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.800
 say comes finally we go with the 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.260
 favorite song this spring and it's 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.930
 a song that does not stop singing in 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.100
 the cap that puts it in the open a 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.380
 volume to stop because I love 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.330
 the song is called chinches the artist 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.750
 I do not remember but I'll leave you the link of 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.260
 YouTube video down here and the song 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.260
 He says 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.530
 no no no 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.470
 but no 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.570
 and well it's more my favorite song and 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.190
 this has been all for today I hope that you 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.750
 have liked the video we see ourselves as 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.750
 always in the next video bye bye
