you<00:02:19.180> need<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.420> short<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.840> jumper<00:02:20.260> which<00:02:21.010> is

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
you need to short the jumper which is

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.250 
you need to short the jumper which is
opposite<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.819> nucleus<00:02:22.300> where<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.110> need

opposite to the nucleus where you need

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.960 
opposite to the nucleus where you need
to<00:02:23.349> short<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.709> jumper<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.010> turn<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.400> LEDs<00:02:24.730> on

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
to short the jumper to turn the LEDs on
