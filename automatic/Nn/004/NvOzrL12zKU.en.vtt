00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 I happen not to try this 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.969
 I can read the last word that 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.400
 hero is the karachi raw tiff karas hero 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.450
 I dont know 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.480
 we are definitely playing shipyards 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.869
 from antigua and we are the same 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.390
 clear 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.010
 Well, currently we are as I said in 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.869
 While the in the phase where only our 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.309
 Note the picture and ours in jacks from the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.230
 queen of course you can do everything else 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.149
 but you have already done so 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.270
 I was almost there 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.610
 utilized to permanent insects and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.260
 That's not what I mean 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.410
 no hotkeys that i mean 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.120
 do not use the keyboard 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.579
 and without all that stuff that's that 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.860
 beautify and facilitate it is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.840
 almost fill me out and only 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.379
 my hands trickle and check coaches 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.510
 to build 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.129
 I would never have thought so if 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.050
 I normally play games I need for this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.909
 Act I've just done 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.700
 maybe five seconds per minute 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:12.180
 The keyboard for fast has the whole thing 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.010
 unbelievable that a huge profit is good 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.549
 second game is starting too 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.229
 finally all here threaten to take 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.330
 Minerals block send a drone 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.780
 send build with normal block 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.490
 overload direction enemy 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.320
 Gathering of henry on a minerals 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.079
 blog put right mouse button and once 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.159
 somewhere else up for units 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.740
 do not threaten are also a 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.180
 to have a collection point 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.860
 of course only have the zerg because 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.060
 all other races have something like that 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.950
 main building only the possibility 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.659
 to build a worker when he came 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.770
 of course the possibility of workers and 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.079
 thus to build 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.560
 the opponent slows down the game that is 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.560
 not so bad 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.939
 that does not matter to us we want here 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.979
 all dance play as 90 ps reached 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.399
 again the overlord like straight net ins 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.320
 game 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.850
 I want to play the next games 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.530
 be all relative engine side 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.360
 Do not try to convey much knowledge 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.729
 the time but as I said we want 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.459
 very small step but I learn that 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.629
 Know what you are trying to explain 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.030
 then you should try too 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.040
 that's it 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.420
 simply the abc builds on that 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.220
 complete game on I think many 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.870
 you know star wars and know that 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.420
 Yoga said that you have everything first 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.760
 forget what you have learned before 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.489
 you can learn new things in part and 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.920
 This is also true if you are the whole time 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.010
 pro streams look at the tricks 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.870
 and tips are from these tips and 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.130
 Unfortunately, at a level what tricks 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.950
 you maybe not at all 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.870
 I'm interesting if you have one 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.519
 it can be there for every player tip 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.110
 that for the player it is 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.720
 very suitable is 50 players 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.610
 not the other way or reason 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.190
 be careful with tips here it goes 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.709
 now really about bronze tips and here 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.600
 the end of the picture is 15 to stay 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.360
 a 15 holds guilty 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.150
 Place collecting points and then another one 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.040
 drone we each collect the copy 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.870
 create where and why opponents found 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.500
 he is terraner and he does not mean any 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:15.040
 Minerals yes, everything I tell him 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.810
 so far totally useless here 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.440
 i hate it in the wynn trader league too 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.790
 play 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.560
 i am now just changing everything 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.560
 must therefore resort to leave the game 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.810
 I'm happy if I'm from this group 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.180
 out but the people are only in the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.100
 pushing wind from a to b that is total 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.890
 ridiculous and i would be so people 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.910
 just i dont know she would just 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.590
 platform and locked and then you can 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.420
 They do it wherever they want 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.010
 I find it totally annoying or she 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.390
 make other league under bronze 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.859
 forest games really only ten seconds 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.359
 take or 15 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.709
 and then all people can come in 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.459
 which are active in what weird 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.739
 play along 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.609
 but the other people enjoy the game 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:05.840
 rob good next game 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:07.640
 zaz on metal opel is threatening to take 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.980
 in addition, minerals stuck drone build 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.220
 send here overlord direction 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.390
 send opponents send collecting points 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.430
 once on the minerals once here 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.169
 above 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.889
 and if we have 50 minutes 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.900
 again a drum 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.789
 just said I'm here for 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.520
 you oco I'm quality declarer here 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:30.270
 we speak of the school before 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.669
 we find ourselves in the first one 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.590
 class 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.990
 and yes i want to show you how to get in 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.900
 the industry league plays shows approximately 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.080
 learn that you just a little bit more 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.620
 has fun at the 92 bomb in 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.330
 second novella that flies to ours 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.879
 natural so and to our base with it 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.710
 is built against evil nothing 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:54.120
 okay we play against a quote us 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.080
 already briefly recognized at the mine 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.810
 even if that did not matter 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.039
 is not far from us 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.479
 that means we can try with 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.129
 our vacation , we just have the 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.229
 possibility to get a taste of what he is 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.370
 doing it is not important to want 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.330
 we do not want to concentrate 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.939
 Focus on us 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.330
 play our picture and that we 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:17.779
 Just our insect meet us 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.550
 improve our picture 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:23.460
 You know how I bomb at 15 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.900
 hedge or build I am not 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.159
 so sure that she made to 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.930
 maybe you play very early 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.599
 in the pool but we still want to meet 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.339
 our hatch no matter what happened he wanted 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.560
 a very early pool 1x pool 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:38.189
 actually, you should not do it sooner 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.899
 would have saved but we have our one 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:41.370
 bild we only have the one picture and it 

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:45.139
 no matter what the enemy does we 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.560
 consistently build our image through 15 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.560
 and 15 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:55.119
 so the enemy I do not know exactly what 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:57.699
 it was it was such a between six and 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:06:00.489
 Eleven pool somewhere like the elbe wants 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.079
 but we attacked at a very early stage 

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:03.999
 Just look what happens I have 

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:09.969
 just said as just said 15 mez 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:12.219
 15 poles more drone until 17 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.859
 and then an overlord comes the same 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:18.309
 Picture here still the collecting points lay 

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:19.659
 do not forget and we can 

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:21.789
 what happens then overload bochum 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:25.269
 march at 17 in overlord den 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:28.139
 fly somewhere so come the 

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:30.579
 left six pieces arrive there 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.959
 and of course all this is silly for us now 

00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:33.219
 we do not have any left we can 

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:36.099
 no left farmers here is ours 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:38.679
 polier is just 80 percent 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.819
 and there's something coming now 

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:44.039
 do we take now just all 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:44.039
 our threatening direction opponents 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:52.419
 greenbaum fourlings were, however 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:54.129
 his investors are dead all his 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.609
 things are dead we can medals 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:57.519
 collect 

00:06:54.609 --> 00:06:58.649
 build another queen and our picture 

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:00.639
 continues normally 

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:01.959
 now we have longer here too 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:05.709
 again a few threaten to press again 

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:09.269
 just lose lemon and so on 

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:09.269
 that was his amazing sex pool 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:16.089
 so she built the balinger and we 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:19.089
 have 6 poles with ours 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:21.719
 kept here and now we want 

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:24.819
 more drones as was planned 

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:26.439
 build more drugs and actually 

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:28.539
 We should have quasi in ours now 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:31.539
 pictorial picture have money for four 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:33.879
 queens, however, we have just seen 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:35.289
 the opponent has no chance to play the game 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:36.999
 win 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:38.369
 we had to threaten with ours once 

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:40.360
 kill his left 

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:42.279
 so now had no money for 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.549
 third and fourth queen but the game 

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:44.549
 was long ago
