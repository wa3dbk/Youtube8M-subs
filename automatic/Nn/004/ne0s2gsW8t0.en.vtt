odd shapes hideous to the the model
you're<00:01:43.439> actually<00:01:43.770> doing<00:01:44.209> because<00:01:45.209> of<00:01:45.359> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you're actually doing because of the

those lanes or it goes over those

those lanes or it goes over those
surface<00:01:50.880> features<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.429> very<00:01:53.429> nicely<00:01:53.789> rather

way<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:05.039> softens<00:02:05.819> up<00:02:05.999> and<00:02:06.270> disappears

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
way actually softens up and disappears

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:11.270 
way actually softens up and disappears
into<00:02:07.439> those<00:02:07.889> lanes<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.959> that's<00:02:10.649> really

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
into those lanes and so that's really

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.670

all you need to use a product you can

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.309 
all you need to use a product you can
