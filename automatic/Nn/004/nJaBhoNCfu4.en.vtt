00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
best friends with me England team is

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.530 
best friends with me England team is
extremely<00:03:45.490> strong<00:03:45.790> they've<00:03:46.090> got<00:03:46.330> three

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
extremely strong they've got three

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.480 
extremely strong they've got three
fabulous<00:03:46.750> horses<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.650> getting<00:03:47.920> huge<00:03:48.160> scores

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
fabulous horses and getting huge scores

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.340 
fabulous horses and getting huge scores
all<00:03:48.880> of<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.090> ability<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.570> make<00:03:49.810> individual

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
all of the ability to make individual

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.500 
all of the ability to make individual
medals<00:03:50.710> so<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:51.160> think<00:03:51.460> the<00:03:51.700> England<00:03:51.970> team<00:03:52.150> is

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
medals so I think the England team is

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.480 
medals so I think the England team is
very<00:03:52.840> strong<00:03:53.200> but<00:03:53.470> then<00:03:53.740> the<00:03:53.860> German<00:03:54.190> team<00:03:54.340> is

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
very strong but then the German team is

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.610 
very strong but then the German team is
young<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:54.940> fresh<00:03:55.209> we<00:03:55.840> serve<00:03:56.080> all<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.410> riders

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
young and fresh we serve all the riders

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.680 
young and fresh we serve all the riders
under<00:03:57.040> 30<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:57.580> they're<00:03:57.730> a<00:03:57.760> fantastic<00:03:58.090> team

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
under 30 and they're a fantastic team

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.360 
under 30 and they're a fantastic team
with<00:03:58.870> very<00:03:58.900> good<00:03:59.440> quality<00:03:59.590> horses<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:00.340> I

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
with very good quality horses so I

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.150 
with very good quality horses so I
wouldn't<00:04:00.790> underestimate<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.570> Germans<00:04:02.160> the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
wouldn't underestimate the Germans the

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.040 
wouldn't underestimate the Germans the
Dutch<00:04:03.370> are<00:04:03.580> a<00:04:03.610> little<00:04:03.760> bit<00:04:03.970> in<00:04:04.120> difficult

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
Dutch are a little bit in difficult

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.870 
Dutch are a little bit in difficult
process<00:04:05.470> right<00:04:05.680> now<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.860> finding<00:04:06.130> new<00:04:06.340> horses

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
process right now of finding new horses

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.820 
process right now of finding new horses
and<00:04:07.330> I<00:04:07.510> think<00:04:07.720> they're<00:04:07.930> struggling<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.740> little

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
and I think they're struggling a little

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.050 
and I think they're struggling a little
bit<00:04:08.980> but<00:04:09.250> they've<00:04:09.370> got<00:04:09.580> quality<00:04:09.970> and

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
bit but they've got quality and

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.760 
bit but they've got quality and
experience<00:04:10.510> on<00:04:10.660> their<00:04:10.780> side<00:04:11.020> and<00:04:11.230> fantastic

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
experience on their side and fantastic

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.620 
experience on their side and fantastic
riders<00:04:12.160> so<00:04:12.400> I<00:04:12.640> think<00:04:13.150> they're<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.420> three

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
riders so I think they're the three

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.720 
riders so I think they're the three
teams<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.080> be<00:04:14.200> keep<00:04:14.380> your<00:04:14.530> eye<00:04:14.680> out<00:04:14.890> but<00:04:15.100> as<00:04:15.459> far

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
teams to be keep your eye out but as far

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.460 
teams to be keep your eye out but as far
as<00:04:15.760> individual<00:04:16.390> is<00:04:16.480> concerned<00:04:16.840> then<00:04:17.049> life's<00:04:17.320> a

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
as individual is concerned then life's a

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.630 
as individual is concerned then life's a
little<00:04:17.680> bit<00:04:17.770> more<00:04:17.920> different<00:04:18.100> because<00:04:18.520> we

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
little bit more different because we

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.699 
little bit more different because we
have<00:04:18.670> so<00:04:18.940> many<00:04:19.120> good<00:04:19.450> individuals<00:04:20.170> from

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
have so many good individuals from

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.740 
have so many good individuals from
different<00:04:20.859> nations<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:22.060> that's<00:04:22.330> when<00:04:22.570> it's

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
different nations so that's when it's

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.360 
different nations so that's when it's
going<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.080> be<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.500> fight<00:04:23.770> for<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:24.070> medals

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
going to be a fight for the medals

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.190 
going to be a fight for the medals
within<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:24.790> individual<00:04:25.330> performances<00:04:25.960> but

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
within the individual performances but

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.020 
within the individual performances but
as<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.470> terms<00:04:26.710> of<00:04:26.860> Australian<00:04:27.370> performance

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
as the terms of Australian performance

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.700 
as the terms of Australian performance
we<00:04:28.540> have<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.690> really<00:04:28.930> good<00:04:29.050> chance<00:04:29.260> with<00:04:29.500> three

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
we have a really good chance with three

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.590 
we have a really good chance with three
good<00:04:29.980> horses<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.580> ability<00:04:30.910> for<00:04:30.940> two

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
good horses and the ability for two

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.360 
good horses and the ability for two
horses<00:04:31.870> at<00:04:32.050> least<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.380> score<00:04:32.620> over<00:04:32.800> 70<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
horses at least the score over 70 and

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.010 
horses at least the score over 70 and
then<00:04:33.430> one<00:04:33.669> to<00:04:33.850> be<00:04:33.940> in<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.120> high<00:04:34.240> 60s<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.960> I

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
then one to be in the high 60s and I

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.720 
then one to be in the high 60s and I
think<00:04:35.200> that's<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.470> situation<00:04:36.250> we've<00:04:36.370> never<00:04:36.550> had

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
think that's a situation we've never had

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.909 
think that's a situation we've never had
so<00:04:37.450> that's<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.810> great<00:04:38.080> opportunity<00:04:38.260> for<00:04:38.650> us<00:04:38.800> to

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
so that's a great opportunity for us to

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.860 
so that's a great opportunity for us to
finish<00:04:39.280> in<00:04:39.580> our<00:04:39.760> highest<00:04:40.120> ever<00:04:40.270> placing<00:04:40.750> at

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
finish in our highest ever placing at
