could also put a rubber band around this

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.460 
could also put a rubber band around this
if<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.800> want<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.180> thing

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
now you're trying to attract the fruit

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.289 
now you're trying to attract the fruit
flies<00:01:06.360> into<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.170> jar<00:01:07.939> basically<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
flies into your jar basically with the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.609 
flies into your jar basically with the
banana<00:01:09.930> faith<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> need<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> couple<00:01:13.350> holes

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
banana faith so you need a couple holes

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.289 
banana faith so you need a couple holes
so<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.060> little

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
so I'm just going to use this little

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.560 
so I'm just going to use this little
these<00:01:16.080> little<00:01:16.110> Spears<00:01:16.970> make<00:01:17.970> couple<00:01:18.420> holes

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
these little Spears make couple holes

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.920 
these little Spears make couple holes
make<00:01:18.990> them<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.259> little<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:20.250> little<00:01:20.729> big<00:01:21.689> enough

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
make them a little a little big enough

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.530 
make them a little a little big enough
for<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.290> fruit<00:01:22.470> flies<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.950> crawl<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.700> don't

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
for the fruit flies to crawl in I don't

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.850 
for the fruit flies to crawl in I don't
know<00:01:24.720> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.080> see<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.439> there's<00:01:25.799> two

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
know if you can see that there's two

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.980 
know if you can see that there's two
little<00:01:26.130> holes<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:27.420> make<00:01:27.570> sure<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
little holes here just make sure that

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.390 
little holes here just make sure that
they're<00:01:28.170> big<00:01:28.350> enough<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> little<00:01:28.950> fruit

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
they're big enough with a little fruit

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.719 
they're big enough with a little fruit
flies<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.880> come<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.750> they<00:01:31.680> will<00:01:31.860> smell<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
flies to come in and they will smell the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.600 
flies to come in and they will smell the
banana<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.540> fruit<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.829> holes<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.460> they

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
banana the fruit from the holes and they

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.760 
banana the fruit from the holes and they
will<00:01:35.820> actually<00:01:36.329> land<00:01:36.630> right<00:01:37.200> here<00:01:37.229> kind<00:01:37.710> of

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
will actually land right here kind of

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.670 
will actually land right here kind of
walk<00:01:37.979> around<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:39.150> into<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> holes<00:01:39.869> now

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
walk around and go into the holes now

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.380 
walk around and go into the holes now
when<00:01:40.979> they're<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> other<00:01:41.670> side<00:01:42.030> they

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
when they're in the other side they

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.749 
when they're in the other side they
really<00:01:42.689> don't<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.409> way<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.950> knowing<00:01:44.220> where

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
really don't have a way of knowing where

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.810 
really don't have a way of knowing where
the<00:01:44.909> holes<00:01:45.119> are<00:01:45.450> they<00:01:46.140> can<00:01:46.350> fly<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:47.369> crawl

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the holes are they can fly in or crawl

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.670 
the holes are they can fly in or crawl
in<00:01:48.090> because<00:01:48.570> they<00:01:48.720> smell<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> banana<00:01:49.259> but

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
in because they smell the banana but

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.490 
in because they smell the banana but
once<00:01:49.920> they're<00:01:50.100> inside<00:01:50.460> they<00:01:51.450> they<00:01:52.229> smell

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
once they're inside they they smell

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.170 
once they're inside they they smell
banana<00:01:52.860> everywhere<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.549> they<00:01:53.670> don't<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:54.030> how

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
banana everywhere so they don't know how

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
banana everywhere so they don't know how
to<00:01:54.240> get<00:01:54.420> back<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.259> don't<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.710> trapped<00:01:56.009> in

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
to get back out so don't get trapped in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.880 
to get back out so don't get trapped in
there<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.780> probably<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> swarm

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
there and probably if you have a swarm

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.999 
there and probably if you have a swarm
of<00:01:59.100> fruit<00:01:59.790> flies<00:01:59.939> you'll<00:02:00.930> find<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.469> whole<00:02:01.710> bunch

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
of fruit flies you'll find a whole bunch

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.340 
of fruit flies you'll find a whole bunch

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
put a couple holes in you can see how

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.970 
put a couple holes in you can see how
many<00:02:18.520> fruit<00:02:18.850> flies<00:02:19.120> are<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:19.750> there<00:02:19.990> is<00:02:20.200> just

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
swarming and so I'm just going to let

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.910 
swarming and so I'm just going to let
these<00:02:24.490> guys<00:02:24.730> outside<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:26.320> can<00:02:26.470> see<00:02:26.620> two
