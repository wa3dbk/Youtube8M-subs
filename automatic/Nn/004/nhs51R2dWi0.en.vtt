 Aachen 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.529
 the lips 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.999
 all together central product presentation of the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.949
 Lowepro

 almost Beck 250 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.110
 so he won in the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.720
 parked state off 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.130
 he is very well made 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.850
 Shoulder wear is a good upholstery with a net talk 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.620
 in front a little short 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.610
 for the belly that keeps the backpack very well on the back 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.470
 so were our bags 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.799
 that is the 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.790
 laptop bag 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.060
 for one in the last 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.460
 Med a size of 15 Trummer 4 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.100
 zol 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.930
 She is very well padded and showed the tram of my side 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.770
 pull out of foam 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.320
 this is a coup 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.590
 advances 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.750
 and other pieces of people risen protected 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.110
 on the side I have a Kuhlmann a attached a tripod 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.950
 Interpreters now half way up the grab handle and that one 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.410
 Human killed 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.830
 a very good solution helps to guide this 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.660
 well 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.690
 am 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.479
 so 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.539
 Roche was sometimes familiar to the backpack 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.010
 that is a small subject Mohrmann for example filter or objectively 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.090
 Covers five or have other papers 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.580
 Society 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.580
 The inside of the club said Soros 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.219
 but before that share this backpack for her it is 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.589
 not to take off the shoulder again when you take the camera out of the 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.249
 But take a bag 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.399
 Wintershall gained 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:26.099
 Connection of the backpack were used for the process are two maturity 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.090
 key market 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.090

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:37.510
 and that is again day 11 fast condition of the backpack is guest 3 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.240
 more 70 to 300 millimeters objectively revealed that the camera 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.539
 Be local 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.539
 "There's room for a bigger lens 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.590
 since I do not go out the times partition 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.469
 that is a jolt by the flood 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.469
 and behind it is still 1 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.429
 I have 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:06.539
 but the charger in these compartments in there I usually have the 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.539
 Record video camera and a few more days

 Grefrath 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.419
 twelve pieces 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.259
 that would have been the major subject more effectively 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.879
 Reisters the bank 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.540
 for traveling I have to take parts small so important 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:35.079
 she is not very big presents 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.829
 a for small things money 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.650
 there is my Kullmann group rehearsing performers turn up in prunn around there 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.849
 Silva is for the camera 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.989
 a good deed is hard because it has a hard bottom you can see it too 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:54.739
 in the pocket 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:55.749

 The Train is to be included in their life cover 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.099
 since next to you probably save another solution 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.520
 what we can take with us 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.319
 to say the UBS is very well padded and the Krombacher compartment 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.440
 Counter-attacks so you can easily understand the bit 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.479
 something happens without the drama 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.689
 At the front you still pull a bag for mp3-player on the right side around the 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:47.639
 is a 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.789

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.419

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.550
 to lug around things 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.550
 but finds a good solution 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.279
 not bad 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.389
