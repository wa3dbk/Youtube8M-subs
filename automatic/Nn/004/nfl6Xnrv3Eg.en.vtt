00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.469
 Hello, friends, how are you? I am a cell phone and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.660
 today we are in a test drive with 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.690
 the coach that I really love 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.060
 love it and let's give it a little bit 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.439
 extreme in the swamps obviously good 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.830
 here I am going through some places that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.840
 they are not very deep and well let's go like this 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.970
 from little to more and so to be 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.040
 trying to see if how good how much 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.630
 resistance has on the water 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.180
 obviously good here as you can see 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.129
 state is not not very deep not oceans 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.660
 it's not going to take the flow to us 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.730
 nothing will happen with the car but good 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.460
 The truth is that it does respond very well to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.379
 see let's give it a little more extreme 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 you have to be more extreme in this with 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.440
 this off-road car we are going to here 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 see come 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.829
 ok no problem I think that also because 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.239
 the speed I think that if I stay a lot 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.699
 time in the water I think if you got off 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.240
 of the ica the car the car to see we are going to 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.090
 give it here 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:09.100
 be a little more extreme no more extreme 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:12.250
 know that neither here nor now is perfect 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.160
 aguanto is 15 helps pablos this car 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.310
 he has a very good hand 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.050
 I do not know how to say maneuverability the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.370
 true that it is handled very well to see 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.680
 let's go here I think it's perfect it's not 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.330
 that really is great in the car 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.659
 fascinates to see let's go let's go to 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:36.109
 again extreme extreme 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.109
 come 77 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.479
 come to this see what I tell you this 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:48.829
 car is great to have let's go back 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.829
 more extreme more extreme submarine come 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.170
 without words I do not have more to say the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.560
 true and good then let's do something 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.570
 more extreme a little bit more slope 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.130
 inclined that it would be to see if the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.380
 we can climb come come and see 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.630
 I think I do not think I'm missing a little bit 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.030
 of impulse throw me very well so let's go 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:19.440
 to take a little more momentum and not 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:21.090
 a lot but let's go let's go then okay 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.300
 effect if it could 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.970
 and that is seriously handled very well is 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.890
 very well this car 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.690
 look like I'm going to do as a photo 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.959
 good as a picture postcard the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.670
 truth is that this car looks or fabulous 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:42.920
 running through the mountains or jet set 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.920
 jet set to see see 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.700
 Well, well, I turned myself in if you have 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.140
 some control the truth I do not know why 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.140
 I went down to see the uploaded 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.290
 well let's go now to do tests with 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.080
 these curves that are a bit more like that 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.700
 of dirt road and therefore more difficult to see 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.700
 how are you going to see us 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.370
 come that is a little bit perfect 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:17.610
 braking for we should not 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.540
 to stamp out there the rays I think 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.250
 I'm fucking him 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.110
 I am not totally modified to 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.330
 maximum can not modify it to the maximum 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.450
 Well, the truth is that the 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.110
 auto we are going to go here 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.700
 shit because I left no no no no 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.540
 no no 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.540
 I believe that 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.720
 Pasta 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.720
 I think he fucks it to see 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.710
 here 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:55.270
 and where is 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.270
 Where is my car? 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.220
 fuck is that way I get off good here 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.960
 the car is already seeing those guys 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.950
 they did not even flinch or is that there 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.470
 a car from a smoke hill did not fall and 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.800
 they did not flinch but hey here it is and 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.480
 I think that what is really good is the car 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.250
 the car to see we are going to do the tests 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.139
 here 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.829
 perfect set no no 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.829
 come on 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.130
 perfect or I think that's good what 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.570
 I said I think that yes I do jodi but good 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.300
 truth is that it did quite 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.530
 rather rudeness with what I tried 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.480
 of being that is not even has 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.250
 improved to the maximum at fault 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.560
 many improvements the truth is that it is a 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.540
 excellent car and good me later I 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.430
 here I leave you with my sunken car that 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.760
 I'm going to have to pay the insurance and here 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:52.160
 in the middle of nowhere we not only win 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.160
 we will see the sexy future
