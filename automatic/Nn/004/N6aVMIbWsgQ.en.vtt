00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 two 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.049
 hello and welcome again I am 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:14.880
 they bring a tutorial of the commando 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.580
 in general everything 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.950
 everything all the commanded is good 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.140
 At least I will try to teach you 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.720
 as it is done since previously 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.270
 I uploaded a tutorial from the command zone 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.599
 call of duty black ops' but what 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.850
 happened was that as the video was quite 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.370
 old and I used to explain a little 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.110
 bad and now I have a little more resources and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.329
 so I've decided to record it 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.060
 new and good because this we could 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.180
 consider it then the old days a 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.220
 small recording of all the tricks 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.900
 that I have so they look bad and such and 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.900
 Well, let's explain 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.160
 Well, to begin with, we'll start with 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.700
 the basics agree that it's going to be with 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.680
 only a weapon can be made simply 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.470
 shooting and stabbing at the same time 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.420
 agreement with I'm going to show you what with georg 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.550
 As you can see, it has gone wrong for me because 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.130
 stabbed you have to shoot and from 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.080
 give when stabbing is worth as well as 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.010
 you just saw right now now you will see 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.440
 that has gone perfectly 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.600
 I point him to knife and pum and I get the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.850
 command is a pretty simple thing 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.920
 This is one of the ways in which 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.470
 you can do the command in agreement there is 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.510
 many more variations of how 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.100
 doing it this is one of the most 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.400
 simple and without spending money 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.400
 agreement 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.240
 and well now I will show you with a 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.090
 zombie shot next to the far so that 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.700
 you see that when stabbing I get 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.020
 there we have it is very simple 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.840
 you just have to put the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.490
 Red crosspiece points jce but very 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.770
 near has to be very close to him already 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.109
 that if we will never agree and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.110
 a pretty important thing about these 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.909
 tricks is that if you have to do it 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.100
 always with the same zombie of agreement and 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.380
 good as you have just seen I bought it 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.330
 a secondary weapon as you see now 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.730
 I have two weapons what you have to do 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.290
 for you to come out is to put them in front 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.690
 from any zombie triangle and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.549
 slash quickly in front of the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.049
 zombie and you have already downloaded the 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.840
 commanded and you can do the command 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.690
 it's very simple, good, good, good 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.090
 well here I bring you the third method 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.459
 that would be with the play moore according 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.680
 we just have to go and buy 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.780
 well a klein moore according to 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.620
 monforte dead sorry call of the dead 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.390
 they are right here on the wall 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.220
 simply buying is something that you have 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.860
 what to do is look for the zombie with which 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.900
 go to do the trick and give the 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.520
 flechita and stabbing according is very 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.500
 simple and as you will see now 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.780
 the commander then I will also leave 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.300
 It's worth as you have seen there 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.650
 It is very simple arrow and stabbing of 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.049
 agreement 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.790
 can be done or saved the weather or 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.409
 teaching the climate is worth what I 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.260
 I recommend is with the one that reads very taken 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.430
 since it has more precision when it comes to 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.630
 stab agreement 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.360
 as you have seen there 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.820
 right button and quick stab to the 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.950
 once it's worth it's very simple wow wow wow wow 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.290
 now we are in the world and well then 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.970
 for this that I am going to teach you now that 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.350
 I do not know if I discovered it but 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.030
 I did not know this and it has been 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.470
 practicing and well then what 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.690
 I just have to do is take away 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.190
 the scuba we become and just 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.980
 when we are not going to put it we have to 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.420
 press to put on what would be the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.790
 date up and the stabbing of 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.830
 agreement and as well power and fer 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.390
 will work in agreement you put the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.670
 Scuba, as you see, you push the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.070
 slash and now blade and according 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.300
 and the command will be loaded and 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.670
 can do as you have seen is 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.210
 just put it on and stab it to the 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.970
 time of very simple agreement and as you see 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:57.750
 it works there it is and right here in moon 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.060
 we have another method that is going to be with the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.520
 hacking system according what 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.620
 we have to do is simply 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.060
 pick it up and it's basically like the other 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.470
 but this one has more freedom since 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.060
 you can do it when you hide it and 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.000
 when 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.950
 what you get is very simple 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.930
 we have to put on the zombie or the 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.370
 astronaut and press the little arrow and 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.199
 very simple stabbing 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.710
 it has to be both arrows for 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.479
 up and stabbing at the same time according 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.889
 to see how you will see now when the 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.889
 zombie here opposite I will 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.840
 little arrow up and stabbing the 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.220
 quickly agree and now 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.350
 we will have loaded the command ace as 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.120
 you will see right now what I recommend 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.090
 is doing it with the hack device 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.740
 removed since it will be easier at the time 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.510
 to point you to stab him in accordance 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.780
 fails less the aim and good then with 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.530
 this will end in moon now we will continue 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.650
 in derry s with betis agree and 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.560
 nothing let's continue here we are in 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.990
 riesch and good then basically as os 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.670
 I said this is going to be with the method of 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.620
 subscription without betty of agreement 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.020
 and one thing that I want to tell you before 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.120
 that you continue with this is that in the 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.800
 computer this will not work for 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.380
 agreement because I've already tried it 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.300
 previously on the pc and it does not work 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.190
 made many people told me in their day that 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.990
 it did not work on pc and it is true not 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.090
 works on the PC according 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.280
 and well I just wanted to tell you that 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.160
 for pc users that is not going to 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.320
 work only works on ps3 and on xbox 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.740
 360 which are the only two platforms 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.420
 that have this game more in wii I do not know 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.640
 yes it will work but I have not tried it 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.370
 really and I do not know if it will work but 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.430
 few tricks there in on the only map that 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.730
 there is good then we buy silveti lapone and 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.410
 basically with the right button and with 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.480
 the slash button at the same time 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.770
 you load the command with any 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.460
 zombie agree for example with a 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.949
 I catch you 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.020
 very simple as you have seen now 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:03.650
 blades and as you see is loaded 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.960
 forever 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.090
 I recommend you do a check 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.919
 so you can see that you do it well 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.440
 always because it does not always go to the 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.330
 first of agreement and good is one thing 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.340
 quite difficult to learn me in your 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.979
 day I was a lot of time to 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:23.000
 learn it I even had to ask for help 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:25.250
 to a Mexican that I knew because I did not 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.979
 understood what they did tutorials in 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:30.770
 English and I had no fucking idea and 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:34.039
 Well with this I leave you hope that 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.690
 I have served you is tutorial tutorial and 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:38.240
 hit like and subscribe for more 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.810
 videos until soon everything fits and now 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.810
 explode 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.650
 ah
