00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 welcome to androidworld.it friends today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.690
 we will see how to unlock the bootloader of 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.490
 a sony device 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.710
 taking our guinea pig as a guinea pig 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.710
 willing experian m2 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.699
 welcome friends from androidworld.it 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.789
 the one that is starting ahead of us 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.949
 is our ex pm 2 immaculate if so 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.939
 we want exactly how sony has it 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.010
 made the stock yet phone again 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.879
 blocked that now we will go to 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.360
 unlock before proceeding with 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.089
 unlocking the actual bootloader 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.040
 as sony also reminds us directly 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.480
 on his site 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.190
 we have to check a couple of 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.100
 conditions then first 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.530
 let's move on the sony e website for a moment 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.239
 let's look for our m2 for 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.359
 be sure that it is indeed among the 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.969
 devices unlockable and present in 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.829
 list and therefore no problem problem 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.320
 small tip when making the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.039
 search being xp from tm mark 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.490
 registered 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:12.070
 if you write xperia m2 you will not find it 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.679
 then go straight on 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.880
 to the extension of the device name 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:20.560
 leaving aside precisely xperia 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.630
 however, I received, we verify 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.700
 that the device is present that the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.580
 software version matches but then not 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.630
 enough is this please note here in 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.369
 bass that reminds us that it is possible 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.280
 unlock the bootloader only for some 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.319
 release and we say very specific and per 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.679
 do it we will have to take ours 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:44.819
 phone and go and run that 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.250
 long code you saw down there 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:56.470
 star asterisk asterisk 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:59.080
 stair gate 73 78 423 stair gate 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.149
 asterisk gate number asterisk part 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.890
 immediately alone to this other screen 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.119
 let's talk about the service info configuration 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.500
 and here below 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.440
 I think you can read it enough 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.180
 well bootloader a local house yes there is 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.920
 allowed to unlock the bootloader 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.840
 in our device 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.130
 but at this point then we can go 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.350
 forward feedback i love 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:26.550
 on pc we press on continue and insert 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.550
 a valid email address 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.660
 here is where to go to receive how 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.750
 see the code written above 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.410
 to unlock various devices that do 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.300
 beep beep this is the email we have 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.290
 received we just have to click here 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.970
 to proceed at this point we must 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.070
 enter the email of the device is 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.470
 clearly in the next part it comes to us 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.150
 also explained how to find the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.530
 ours of me 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.790
 so let's add it here on the side 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.950
 we then accept all the terms and conditions 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.540
 conditions we have to have the android sdk 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.680
 actually installed what matters 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.960
 more and have fastboot running e 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.980
 however in this house we already have 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.200
 created guides on how 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.070
 install the Android SDK sends you back 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.650
 directly to those otherwise followed 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.960
 directly the advice that comes 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.990
 shown above 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.120
 then at this point perhaps the only phase 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.700
 you can pay a little attention 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.560
 take our usb micro cable 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.330
 usb in this case probably the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.720
 because it is also known and that of one 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.880
 plus one if you can focus it 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.420
 here what they see he likes well 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.249
 let's move on 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:55.739
 we connect the end with the usb port 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:04:00.150
 to the PC and make sure we have turned off the 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:03.959
 our xp m2 and we hold volume up 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.090
 while we connect the usb cable to the 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.950
 device 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.319
 I don't know if you can appreciate it but the 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.590
 led here has changed color 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.569
 you saw it went from red to blue 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.479
 this means that you are in 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.150
 fastboot mode the phone and has 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:25.620
 black screen does not give any kind of input 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:29.280
 there is no way to understand it if not precisely 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.240
 I repeat from the LEDs above so do 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.190
 reliance on LEDs 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.380
 we are in a fairly dark environment from 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.870
 to be able to see it well and at this point 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.960
 know that your device is 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.060
 connected let's verify it with a 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.430
 fast food devices 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.880
 here it is so I would say that I am not there 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.009
 too many doubts and we continue precisely 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.630
 entering the unlock code that is there 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.630
 been given that this one 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:05.550
 sorry ops in this case had to 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:07.440
 add this here in front of dots of 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.620
 suspension that leave I have to say 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.669
 actually a lot of the suspense 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.599
 smartphone continues to remain black 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:22.050
 time 11 seconds and it's all over 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:23.970
 from what the sony website says you have 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.990
 unlocked your bootloader 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.000
 device 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.719
 let's check it out at this point is 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.110
 still connected as you see here 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:35.729
 succeed in led 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:38.449
 nothing we detach and restart ours 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.449
 xpm 2 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.810
 but little music that accompanies the launch of 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.540
 device is always the one keep in mind 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.170
 that precisely that at the first reboot of the 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.940
 device 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.160
 it could take some time indeed 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.930
 probably it will take but in short a 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.450
 this point your device will have 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.180
 the bootloader unlocked and will be ready 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:13.390
 precisely to start off a little healthy 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.970
 moting the example of spire m2 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.610
 is good or bad for all 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.010
 smartphones and xperia tablets whose 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.700
 bootloader can be unlocked via 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:27.400
 the sony site for this our say 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.020
 try is all a greeting from Nicola league 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.020
