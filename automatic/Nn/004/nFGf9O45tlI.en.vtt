she comes with and then talk about the
doll<00:00:39.449> itself<00:00:40.789> I'll<00:00:41.789> start<00:00:41.999> from<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.179> top<00:00:43.249> this

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249 
doll itself I'll start from the top this

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:45.319 
doll itself I'll start from the top this
girl<00:00:44.460> should<00:00:44.639> have<00:00:44.760> come<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:44.909> luggage

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
girl should have come with luggage

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.660 
girl should have come with luggage
because<00:00:45.749> she<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.769> has<00:00:46.889> so<00:00:46.920> much<00:00:47.190> stuff<00:00:47.489> with

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
because she just has so much stuff with

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.180 
because she just has so much stuff with
her<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.059> her<00:00:48.210> hair<00:00:48.649> I'll<00:00:49.649> start<00:00:49.859> with<00:00:49.920> her<00:00:50.010> hair

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.840 
I guess because it's part of the stock
her<00:00:53.039> wig<00:00:53.280> has<00:00:53.760> an<00:00:54.749> extension<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.729> I'll

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
like go on her maybe like that so when

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.310

she isn't wearing the additional hair
and<00:04:54.590> all<00:04:54.680> that<00:04:54.740> maybe<00:04:55.010> she<00:04:55.220> has<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.340> second<00:04:56.030> look
