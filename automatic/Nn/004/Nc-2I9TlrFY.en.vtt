00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.590 
i when we projected the feeling of love
and<00:01:34.979> thanks<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.430> water<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.940> made<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> most

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and thanks to water it made the most

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.820 
and thanks to water it made the most
beautiful<00:01:36.720> crystal<00:01:39.020> times<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.260> this<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
beautiful crystal times like this I

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.630 
beautiful crystal times like this I
think<00:01:41.130> butter<00:01:41.580> is<00:01:41.760> at<00:01:41.910> peace<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:46.580> is<00:01:47.580> a

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
