got some more I think most of these are
the<00:00:52.710> 70s<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.850> looks<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.239> there's<00:00:54.449> Alan

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.900 

technically<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.190> could<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:14.610> rolling

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
technically you could do the rolling

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.550 
technically you could do the rolling
stones<00:02:15.210> would<00:02:15.480> definitely<00:02:15.960> do<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:17.390> but<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.900> have

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
stones would definitely do it but I have

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.210 
stones would definitely do it but I have
a<00:02:19.590> few<00:02:20.660> classic<00:02:21.660> rolling<00:02:22.170> stones<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.740> 70s

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
a few classic rolling stones in the 70s

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.070 
a few classic rolling stones in the 70s
Powell<00:02:23.460> there<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.240> really<00:02:24.510> looked<00:02:24.690> like<00:02:24.960> I

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
Powell there that I really looked like I

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.580 
Powell there that I really looked like I
just<00:02:28.080> thought<00:02:28.290> it'd<00:02:28.670> take<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:30.230> some<00:02:31.230> time<00:02:31.410> to

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
just thought it'd take a some time to

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.830 
just thought it'd take a some time to
shoot<00:02:31.770> a<00:02:32.100> quick<00:02:32.880> little<00:02:33.120> video<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.540> this

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
shoot a quick little video of this

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.120 
shoot a quick little video of this
because<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.320> once<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.680> had<00:02:34.800> them<00:02:34.920> on<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
because that once I had them on the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.700 
because that once I had them on the
floor<00:02:35.310> I'm<00:02:35.490> like<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.910> guess<00:02:36.210> I'm<00:02:37.050> more<00:02:37.110> inclined

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
floor I'm like I guess I'm more inclined

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.380 
floor I'm like I guess I'm more inclined
to<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.070> 70s<00:02:39.030> rock<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.140> roll<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:41.390> there's
