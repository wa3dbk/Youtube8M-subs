00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
correctly my head and body my head and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.789 
correctly my head and body my head and
legs<00:01:36.240> are<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.630> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> be<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> mirrored

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.340 
legs are not going to be in the mirrored
position<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.909> example<00:01:39.329> my<00:01:39.840> head<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.110> here

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.960 
position so for example my head is here
my<00:01:40.560> feet<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.040> am<00:01:41.189> NOT<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.759> end

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
my feet are here I am NOT going to end

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.810 
my feet are here I am NOT going to end
up<00:01:42.210> exactly<00:01:42.960> like<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.590> again<00:01:44.399> when<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.640> head

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
up exactly like this again when I head

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.639 
up exactly like this again when I head
to<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.030> feet<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> same<00:01:45.630> position<00:01:46.079> that's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
to my feet in the same position that's

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.490 
to my feet in the same position that's
wrong<00:01:46.950> I've<00:01:47.850> got<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.180> bridge<00:01:48.450> explosively<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
wrong I've got a bridge explosively and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.520 
wrong I've got a bridge explosively and
over<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.310> an<00:01:50.430> angle<00:01:50.759> I'll<00:01:51.090> go<00:01:51.270> slow<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.259> am

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
over on an angle I'll go slow but I am

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.700 
over on an angle I'll go slow but I am
going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> bridge<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.250> way<00:01:53.520> up<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.810> over<00:01:55.409> now

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
going to bridge this way up and over now

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.490 
going to bridge this way up and over now
look<00:01:55.950> at<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> different<00:01:56.549> angle<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.259> at

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
look at the different angle that I'm at

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.490 
look at the different angle that I'm at
I<00:01:58.799> had<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> completely<00:02:00.479> different<00:02:00.689> angle

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
I had a completely different angle

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.999 
I had a completely different angle
when<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.040> finished<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:05.659> over<00:02:06.659> that's<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.860> key

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
when I finished and over that's the key

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.410 
when I finished and over that's the key
I'll<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.550> other<00:02:08.700> direction<00:02:08.910> for

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
I'll do it in the other direction for

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.370 
I'll do it in the other direction for
you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
you

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.550 
you
seizing<00:02:12.970> wizarding<00:02:14.290> 3d<00:02:15.290> pop<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.970> over<00:02:17.450> okay

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
seizing wizarding 3d pop and over okay

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.920 
seizing wizarding 3d pop and over okay
that's<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.100> secret<00:02:19.280> that's<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.420> key<00:02:20.600> when

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
that's the secret that's the key when

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.150 
that's the secret that's the key when
you're<00:02:21.080> drilling<00:02:21.260> by<00:02:21.440> yourself<00:02:21.890> when<00:02:22.040> you're

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
you're drilling by yourself when you're

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.980 
you're drilling by yourself when you're
practicing<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:22.850> this<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.450> what<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.690> have<00:02:23.840> to

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
practicing this this is what you have to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.470 
practicing this this is what you have to
do<00:02:24.140> now<00:02:24.650> little<00:02:24.950> subtleties<00:02:25.460> here<00:02:25.730> before<00:02:26.450> I

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
do now little subtleties here before I

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.310 
do now little subtleties here before I
bring<00:02:26.630> cost<00:02:26.900> again<00:02:28.900> when<00:02:29.900> I'm<00:02:30.020> doing<00:02:30.290> my

bring cost again when I'm doing my

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.280 
bring cost again when I'm doing my
bridge<00:02:31.030> kosta<00:02:32.030> once<00:02:32.240> again<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.690> not<00:02:32.840> going

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
bridge kosta once again is not going

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.160 
bridge kosta once again is not going
straight<00:02:34.070> up<00:02:34.450> kostas<00:02:35.450> going<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.720> be<00:02:35.810> coming

straight up kostas going to be coming

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.340 
straight up kostas going to be coming
forward<00:02:36.740> he's<00:02:37.640> going<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.940> be<00:02:38.060> lurching<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.750> as

forward he's going to be lurching and as

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.400 
forward he's going to be lurching and as
he's<00:02:39.680> moving<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.580> direction<00:02:40.660> i'm<00:02:41.660> going

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
he's moving in that direction i'm going

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.340 
he's moving in that direction i'm going
to<00:02:42.560> redirect<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.280> energy<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:44.450> way<00:02:44.660> it's<00:02:45.200> a

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
to redirect the energy that way it's a

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.070 
to redirect the energy that way it's a
timing<00:02:45.680> thing<00:02:45.890> it's<00:02:46.610> not<00:02:46.850> strength<00:02:47.390> its

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
timing thing it's not strength its

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.699 
timing thing it's not strength its
timing<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.790> using<00:02:50.030> science<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:51.440> i'm

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
timing and it's using science so i'm

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.570 
timing and it's using science so i'm
bridging<00:02:52.280> him<00:02:52.520> this<00:02:53.209> way<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:54.130> now<00:02:55.130> he's<00:02:55.370> going

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
bridging him this way and now he's going

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.890 
bridging him this way and now he's going
to<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.810> side<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.620> Jeavons<00:02:58.280> ultra<00:02:58.670> slow<00:02:58.970> like

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.490 
to the side and Jeavons ultra slow like
that<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.620> can<00:03:00.800> still<00:03:01.070> see<00:03:01.370> how<00:03:01.700> i<00:03:02.420> ended<00:03:02.660> up<00:03:02.930> in

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
that you can still see how i ended up in

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.910 
that you can still see how i ended up in
a<00:03:04.630> 90-degree<00:03:05.630> angle<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.470> I'm<00:03:06.560> gonna<00:03:06.680> bring

going to try to bridge him directly to

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.400 
going to try to bridge him directly to
the<00:03:51.380> side<00:03:51.820> he's<00:03:52.820> gonna<00:03:52.970> post<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:53.600> it's<00:03:54.260> not

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
gonna happen I'm gonna get stuck now the

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.100 
gonna happen I'm gonna get stuck now the
right<00:03:57.350> way

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.330 

and<00:04:02.110> as<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:02.350> can<00:04:02.470> see<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:03.390> ended<00:04:04.390> up<00:04:04.860> about<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:05.920> 90

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
and as you can see I ended up about a 90

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.950 
and as you can see I ended up about a 90
degree<00:04:06.640> angle<00:04:06.670> now<00:04:07.390> we're<00:04:07.540> going<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.690> go<00:04:07.780> very

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
degree angle now we're going to go very

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.330 
degree angle now we're going to go very
slow<00:04:08.260> cost<00:04:08.530> is<00:04:08.680> going<00:04:08.800> to<00:04:08.890> be<00:04:09.010> totally

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
slow cost is going to be totally

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.890 
slow cost is going to be totally
compliant<00:04:09.670> so<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:09.970> can<00:04:10.180> talk<00:04:10.360> my<00:04:10.570> way<00:04:10.720> through

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
compliant so I can talk my way through

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.120 
compliant so I can talk my way through
this<00:04:11.080> it's<00:04:11.290> a<00:04:11.320> little<00:04:11.410> difficult<00:04:11.950> on<00:04:12.010> the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
this it's a little difficult on the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.800 
this it's a little difficult on the
bottom<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.970> I'm<00:04:13.060> going<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.240> have<00:04:13.330> cost<00:04:13.600> to

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
bottom and I'm going to have cost to

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.410 
bottom and I'm going to have cost to
show<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.040> few<00:04:15.190> times<00:04:15.400> and<00:04:15.670> I<00:04:15.970> can<00:04:16.150> describe

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
show it a few times and I can describe

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.190 
show it a few times and I can describe
it<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:16.989> I'm<00:04:17.310> bridging<00:04:18.310> him<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.730> now<00:04:19.480> as<00:04:19.930> he's

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
it so I'm bridging him and now as he's

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.410 
it so I'm bridging him and now as he's
going<00:04:20.380> forward<00:04:21.010> I'm<00:04:21.430> going<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.850> try<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.090> shoot
