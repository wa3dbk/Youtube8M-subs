last night and talking sucks so I'm
going<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.410> make<00:00:13.559> another<00:00:13.769> tutorial<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.639> really

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
going to make another tutorial a really

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.019 
going to make another tutorial a really
quick<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> pulse<00:00:17.220> generator<00:00:17.730> with

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
quick one this is a pulse generator with

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
quick one this is a pulse generator with
an<00:00:18.150> awful<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.900> fuck<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:21.769> the<00:00:22.769> pulse

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
an awful to fuck with the pulse

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.870 
an awful to fuck with the pulse
generator<00:00:23.400> with<00:00:23.550> an<00:00:23.670> on/off<00:00:24.000> switch<00:00:25.789> here<00:00:26.789> we

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
generator with an on/off switch here we

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.479 
generator with an on/off switch here we
go<00:00:27.050> place<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> piston<00:00:29.480> place<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:31.130> with<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> thing

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
go place the piston place a with a thing

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.310 
go place the piston place a with a thing
and<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.750> holy<00:00:34.410> shit<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:36.320> medication

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and then you holy shit a medication

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.180 
and then you holy shit a medication
people<00:00:38.160> it'll<00:00:39.090> do<00:00:39.300> things<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.190> piston

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
people it'll do things to you piston

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.670 
people it'll do things to you piston

the repeater place a lever right there

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.950 
the repeater place a lever right there
okay<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.010> other<00:00:53.219> side<00:00:53.660> place<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.809> repeater

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
okay on the other side place a repeater

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.750 
okay on the other side place a repeater
facing<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.860> way<00:00:57.739> in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.980> direction<00:00:59.340> away

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
opposite direction line up wire connect

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.800 
opposite direction line up wire connect
on<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> wire<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.510> then<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.040> block<00:01:14.810> that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
on the wire and then on the block that

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.950 
on the wire and then on the block that
is<00:01:16.320> oh<00:01:16.950> not<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.119> block<00:01:18.299> what<00:01:18.479> am<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.630> saying

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
is oh not on the block what am I saying

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.679 
is oh not on the block what am I saying
connect<00:01:19.560> wire<00:01:20.310> behind<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.909> last<00:01:21.210> pissed<00:01:21.509> in

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
connect wire behind this last pissed in

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.649 
connect wire behind this last pissed in
here<00:01:23.240> you're<00:01:24.240> done<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:25.380> your

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
here you're done that's it that's your

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.090 
here you're done that's it that's your
the<00:01:27.659> pulse<00:01:28.080> generator<00:01:28.530> right<00:01:28.650> there<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:29.009> an

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the pulse generator right there with an

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.480 
the pulse generator right there with an
on/off<00:01:29.400> switch<00:01:30.530> there<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:34.009> did<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.250> did<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
on/off switch there you go did it did it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.179 
on/off switch there you go did it did it
did<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.140> did<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:38.369> did<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.390> okay<00:01:39.900> uh<00:01:40.040> also<00:01:41.040> if<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
did it did it did it okay uh also if you

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.710 
did it did it did it okay uh also if you
want<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> delay<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:44.479> there<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.570> go

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
want to delay it you can there you go

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.330 
want to delay it you can there you go
and<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.750> even<00:01:48.899> extend<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:50.840> like<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
and you can even extend it like so to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.190 
and you can even extend it like so to
make<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.520> last<00:01:53.790> even<00:01:54.360> longer<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:56.869> guess<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.049> is

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
make it last even longer I guess this is

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.719 
make it last even longer I guess this is
obvious<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.979> don't<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.189> about<00:01:59.430> these

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
obvious but you don't think about these

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.250 
obvious but you don't think about these
things<00:01:59.939> when<00:02:00.180> you're<00:02:00.270> sick

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.980 

so<00:02:04.640> that's<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:07.770> could<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.040> delay<00:02:08.430> this

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
so that's it you could also delay this

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.650 
so that's it you could also delay this
to<00:02:09.990> make<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.200> lasts<00:02:10.560> even<00:02:10.890> longer<00:02:11.570> when<00:02:12.570> it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
to make it lasts even longer when it

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.270 
to make it lasts even longer when it
comes<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.020> longer<00:02:13.820> longer<00:02:14.820> pulses<00:02:16.160> because<00:02:17.160> if

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
comes to longer longer pulses because if

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.570 
comes to longer longer pulses because if
we<00:02:17.340> do<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.490> it'll<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.150> slightly<00:02:18.570> faster<00:02:18.930> I

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
we do that it'll be slightly faster I

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.860 
we do that it'll be slightly faster I
lied<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.850> lied<00:02:24.890> okay<00:02:25.890> there<00:02:26.310> there<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.420> go<00:02:27.540> nope

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
lied I lied okay there there we go nope

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.190 
lied I lied okay there there we go nope
I'm<00:02:28.170> lying<00:02:28.500> again<00:02:28.710> well<00:02:29.490> there<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.700> go<00:02:30.200> there

I'm lying again well there you go there
you<00:02:31.230> go<00:02:31.380> quick<00:02:31.740> tutorial<00:02:32.160> thanks<00:02:32.610> guys<00:02:32.760> for
