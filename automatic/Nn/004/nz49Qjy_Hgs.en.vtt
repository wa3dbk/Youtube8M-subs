00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.699
 I am a big hello today we will be with you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.340
 probably do makeup and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.430
 out sick are healthy and because i 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.500
 a little sick and as usual illness 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.140
 immediately affects our face 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.669
 various rashes and general appearance 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.640
 already not ice 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.250
 So I will do makeup completely with 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.960
 lambre rai makeup and i need 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.480
 some tonal basis to 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.789
 blocked all my imperfections now 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.789
 skin so i'll be mating 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 let's probably remove the hair so they 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.420
 we no longer interfere see now 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.250
 a little on the face of the shadow is from my 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.910
 lens as a base under the shade 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:09.650
 I will also apply the same tonal tool 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:13.439
 a little forever do not forget about our ears 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.290
 further I will remove minor flaws and 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.909
 bruises under eyes hide pigment 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.979
 red spots of mineral glass 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.930
 I'm in color 01 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.079
 This we do not have any liquid 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.170
 concealer so keep in mind if you have 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.220
 suddenly dry skin and you need exactly 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.439
 liquid any correctors then he you 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.920
 may not work because enough 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.840
 so tight empty 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.869
 we will give a healthy glow to me 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.390
 second number 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.940
 pinkish color they are matte without 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.850
 any blotches 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.980
 I really like a little put on 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.720
 forehead 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.620
 of course we fix our entire makeup 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.750
 go to the powder I have this fifth number 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.600
 probably if I am not mistaken powder contains 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.080
 in itself reflecting particles therefore 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.450
 the skin of the face immediately becomes radiant but 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.800
 without any visible 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.130
 noticeable in the leaf if your skin 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.480
 fatty 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.760
 then maybe this glitter cherry 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.630
 absolutely nothing seems to me now 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.900
 It is well noticeable what really is 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.380
 a certain radiance due to the reflective 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.440
 particles 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.170
 face we have already drawn up and turn eyes 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.040
 I will use a neutral palette 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:48.570
 in t03 color I will put a light tone on everything 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.510
 our eyelids are mobile and immobile immediately 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.290
 under the brow they gave a shade a little darker 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.310
 as usual standard in our usual 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:03.690
 Make-up on the outer corner of the eye 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:08.030
 our century fold and the same color on our 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.030
 along the lower lash line 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:17.700
 neighbors hear and tass windows every day u 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.100
 we have some troubles there the darkest 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.400
 I put a shade on the outer corner 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.530
 our eyes once again all this 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.550
 shade a little bit on the edge 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.220
 external 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.050
 bottom corner Daria will put 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.040
 turquoise eyeliner to emphasize 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.360
 color of our eyes in color 01 she has 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.150
 thin felt 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.080
 so if you are always an amateur 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.680
 any 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.170
 very fat arrows who will she have 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.560
 very long work to achieve 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.190
 bold arrow the tip is sharp enough 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.680
 when pressed he 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.580
 where we do not go on drawing our 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.570
 arrows 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.730
 what an interesting turquoise green we have 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.880
 shade is obtained and put mascara on mascara 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.070
 I'm not lamb raylene carry my meybellin 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.210
 who already starts me a little 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.420
 dry out 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.360
 the final touch with the shadows I will put the corners 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:23.320
 eye the sixth number of cream shadows 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:25.030
 to give my eyes some black I am dark 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:34.390
 I will bring a shade now 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:36.670
 eyebrows the final touch is our lips gonna 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:45.880
 put a pencil on the color or inside and 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:48.700
 lipstick in color 09 lipstick at all 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.610
 has no smell and I won't say 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.070
 so that it moisturizes and lips or somehow 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.680
 not dried them too much 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.710
 neutral keeps good but me 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.250
 it seems if your lips are too problematic 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.110
 any scaly then she'll be you 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.390
 it's all underline let's try 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.290
 make a little bit lighter so that those are not 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.750
 so fell from the lens on the face here 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:17.050
 actually so now we look more 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.840
 less everything is disguised and no longer 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.180
 say you are too tired or 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.400
