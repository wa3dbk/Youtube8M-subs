00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
details on the back in multiple

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.649 
details on the back in multiple
languages<00:01:31.290> because<00:01:32.210> same<00:01:33.210> packaging

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
languages because same packaging

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.060 
languages because same packaging
probably<00:01:34.049> applies<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.500> multiple<00:01:34.920> countries

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
probably applies to multiple countries

like<00:02:21.930> those<00:02:22.080> ground<00:02:22.350> effects<00:02:22.590> lights<00:02:22.830> that

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
like those ground effects lights that

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.199 
like those ground effects lights that
used<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.280> see<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.430> Honda<00:02:24.090> Civics<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.690> 90s<00:02:25.080> a

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
used to see on Honda Civics in the 90s a

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.760 
used to see on Honda Civics in the 90s a
lot<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.330> component<00:02:27.900> crammed<00:02:28.290> into<00:02:28.500> their

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
lot of component crammed into their

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.340 
lot of component crammed into their
memory<00:02:29.430> on-off<00:02:30.390> switch<00:02:30.720> USB<00:02:31.709> power<00:02:32.160> cable<00:02:32.700> etc

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
memory on-off switch USB power cable etc

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.620 
memory on-off switch USB power cable etc
so<00:02:34.350> that's<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.120> see<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.420> camera

so that's it like you can see the camera

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.310 
so that's it like you can see the camera
