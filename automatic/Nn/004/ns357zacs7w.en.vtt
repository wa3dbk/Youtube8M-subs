00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
battlefields I've got these massive

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.950 
battlefields I've got these massive
full-scale<00:00:45.460> battle<00:00:45.699> fields<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.780> other

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
full-scale battle fields and the other

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.630 
full-scale battle fields and the other
is<00:00:47.199> that<00:00:47.440> because<00:00:47.650> you're<00:00:47.980> a<00:00:48.070> general<00:00:48.460> you're

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
is that because you're a general you're

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.160 
is that because you're a general you're
playing<00:00:49.150> the<00:00:49.300> whole<00:00:49.449> game<00:00:49.480> with<00:00:49.870> your<00:00:49.989> voice

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
playing the whole game with your voice

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.840 
playing the whole game with your voice
so<00:00:50.379> you're<00:00:50.530> giving<00:00:50.680> your<00:00:50.920> commands<00:00:51.610> to<00:00:51.820> your

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
so you're giving your commands to your

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.149 
so you're giving your commands to your
soldiers<00:00:52.839> replacement<00:00:53.790> unit<00:00:54.790> six<00:00:55.059> Foxtrot<00:00:58.079> so

00:00:59.149 --> 00:00:59.159 
soldiers replacement unit six Foxtrot so

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.290 
soldiers replacement unit six Foxtrot so
basically<00:01:00.159> just<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.519> controller<00:01:00.879> works<00:01:01.059> like

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
basically just the controller works like

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.700 
basically just the controller works like
a<00:01:01.329> walkie-talkie<00:01:01.720> you<00:01:02.170> hold<00:01:02.379> down<00:01:02.530> the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
a walkie-talkie you hold down the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.820 
a walkie-talkie you hold down the
trigger<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.339> speak<00:01:03.550> your<00:01:03.760> order<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:04.360> release

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
trigger you speak your order you release

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.590 
trigger you speak your order you release
and<00:01:05.830> that's<00:01:05.979> all<00:01:06.520> there<00:01:06.610> is<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:06.970> makes<00:01:07.450> it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
and that's all there is to it makes it

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.840 
and that's all there is to it makes it
very<00:01:07.900> very<00:01:08.080> easy<00:01:08.350> today<00:01:09.159> you<00:01:09.460> don't<00:01:09.640> have<00:01:09.759> to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
very very easy today you don't have to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.999 
very very easy today you don't have to
memorize<00:01:10.060> any<00:01:10.659> commands<00:01:11.140> at<00:01:11.320> all<00:01:11.409> because<00:01:11.650> I

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
memorize any commands at all because I

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.740 
memorize any commands at all because I
mean<00:01:12.189> if<00:01:12.280> you<00:01:12.400> hold<00:01:12.640> down<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.909> trigger<00:01:13.150> you

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
mean if you hold down the trigger you

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.540 
mean if you hold down the trigger you
can<00:01:13.930> see<00:01:14.200> all<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.560> available<00:01:14.830> orders<00:01:15.340> here

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.700 

so<00:01:20.550> you<00:01:21.360> don't<00:01:21.510> have<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.690> have<00:01:21.930> any<00:01:22.110> previous

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
so you don't have to have any previous

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.610 
so you don't have to have any previous
knowledge<00:01:22.740> basically<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:23.880> read

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
knowledge basically if you can read

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.060 
knowledge basically if you can read
you<00:01:25.010> could<00:01:25.220> learn<00:01:25.910> and<00:01:26.180> see<00:01:26.300> what<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.070> game

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
you could learn and see what the game

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.580 
you could learn and see what the game
it's<00:01:28.490> really<00:01:28.730> easy<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.360> we<00:01:29.480> have<00:01:29.660> full<00:01:30.320> series

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
it's really easy so we have full series

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.740 
it's really easy so we have full series
of<00:01:30.740> story<00:01:31.040> missions<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:31.670> sort<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.360> say<00:01:32.540> how

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
of story missions that sort of say how

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.090 
of story missions that sort of say how
the<00:01:32.810> war<00:01:33.050> breaks<00:01:33.350> out<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:33.890> steadily

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
the war breaks out so it's steadily

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.770 
the war breaks out so it's steadily
ramped<00:01:34.520> up<00:01:34.670> at<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.060> beginning<00:01:35.450> you've<00:01:35.600> just

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
ramped up at the beginning you've just

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.210 
ramped up at the beginning you've just
got<00:01:35.900> a<00:01:35.930> couple<00:01:36.140> of<00:01:36.380> units<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.010> you're<00:01:37.100> just

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
got a couple of units and you're just

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.800 
got a couple of units and you're just
learning<00:01:37.370> the<00:01:37.640> commands<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.390> on<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.690> then

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
learning the commands and so on and then

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.270 
learning the commands and so on and then
it<00:01:38.900> gets<00:01:39.020> bigger<00:01:39.320> as<00:01:39.590> you<00:01:39.740> progress<00:01:40.070> through

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
it gets bigger as you progress through

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.520 
it gets bigger as you progress through
the<00:01:41.000> story<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.630> game<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:41.990> its<00:01:42.140> world<00:01:42.380> war
