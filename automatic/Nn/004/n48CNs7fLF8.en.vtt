00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello and welcome ask u 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.350
 oksany 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.360
 I have accumulated a million interesting 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.790
 questions i'm still quietly on them 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.460
 answers today we are up to 5 3 very 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.090
 interesting questions in my opinion 1 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.160
 polls left on my blog hi 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.390
 Oksana I really like to run on 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.730
 lately a lot 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.340
 information about the dangers of bega how are you 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.260
 treat the statement that during 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.250
 running from shaking the body is severely cut off 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.300
 muster face 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.430
 Thanks for the answer Irina. I think that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.730
 many of you have heard yes and seen 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.250
 general runners and often runners look 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.260
 especially for long distances will allocate 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.329
 a little more so old yes seriously 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.480
 there may even be places on me as if 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.300
 they were a little worn out, I'm not trying to 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.270
 offend anyone seriously just if you 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.520
 see the pictures of the runners 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.320
 the feeling is that what 's the matter 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.270
 and how to help yourself 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.760
 when we run and especially for long 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.270
 distance we expose our skin 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.400
 pretty strong exposure 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.060
 the weather is not important when we run in the summer 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.909
 in winter we are affected by the sun the wind is rain 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.710
 polluted with the atmosphere and everything around 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.659
 everything is affecting us 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.830
 so first thing when we go 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.810
 running is very important to protect your face 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.710
 protect your skin from external 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.619
 impacts 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.750
 Your running style is also very important. 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.670
 surface on which you run if 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.439
 you run on asphalt you get 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.869
 greater effect on your body 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.290
 Naturally, everything is transmitted slowly to 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.810
 to face 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.920
 so i recommend if you go 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.890
 run it is best to run along the ground 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.740
 special flooring that help 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.280
 slightly reduce the impact of this 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.130
 hitting the foot on the ground in general use 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.250
 good cream protective face cream and 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.140
 choose good shoes 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.810
 which will protect the gesture and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.920
 we prefer to run for something more 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.480
 soft what asphalt or concrete next 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.300
 question about gadget 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.860
 catch oksana you had a bracelet before 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.569
 jawbone 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.340
 one shot a video now have what 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.560
 you do not wear it please tell me 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.300
 why what happened to him interests 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.160
 your opinion because I 'm going to 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.769
 I will buy very happy if you me 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.080
 reply for earlier thanks 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.209
 as you remember i shot a video about it 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.980
 bracelet if you have not seen it if 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.420
 you are interested then look here i am 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.100
 I will leave the video and also in this video I will give you 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.290
 talked about using tanks 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.620
 what are its pros and cons and more so 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.410
 not 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.830
 and so why don't I wear him now 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.560
 stopped wearing for several reasons 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.720
 it hasn't broken down and it still works just 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.109
 I do not wear it first I reviewed 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.890
 my dream and how I feel about everyone 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:05.340
 With the gadget, I decided that from my bedroom 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.709
 all that electronic and in 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.870
 Generally yes I was one of the reasons 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.660
 Why I'm not with him on the arm, plus I ' 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.690
 liked the tracks as I sleep on 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.090
 I can't really see what I see in 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.420
 reports how about i sleep on is 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.000
 perfect truth and can deduct 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.500
 correct my deep sleep and shallow 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.750
 about it go a little more 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.450
 stitch him then tell him when not 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.100
 I am a supporter of counting calories this 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.890
 functionality that rendered quite 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.530
 I didn’t need it at all 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.660
 so just wear a bracelet so 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:45.239
 to find out how much time i spent 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:48.060
 and look at the report of the snow cats which 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.450
 don't really believe me not seen as something 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.200
 interesting in his 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.750
 and abandoned if you were subscribed to 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.290
 my newsletter 14 days for the body of a dream then 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.989
 have you seen that in this list I am not 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.480
 recommend eating cornflakes and this one 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.450
 the question just the same arose in Katy 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.410
 who let me down on instagram 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.750
 cornflakes doesn’t refer to 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.670
 wrong product up corn here 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.290
 and the answer is wrong products by 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.829
 several reasons about the first reason 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.169
 the fact that corn itself is very often 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.630
 g but to the government 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.810
 state pays extra 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.540
 subsidies for farmers to grow 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.880
 and corn and the fact that we have this maize was 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.930
 sweet and i don't eat bugs 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.630
 so that it was a lot and every time big 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.200
 corporation you will be new new new 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.150
 new version of corn to 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.639
 match these requests corn 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.530
 who we eat now is completely wrong 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.810
 just which she used to be 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.150
 she was a different color and size 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.479
 even most likely I don't taste two 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.280
 I know but the fact that corn is so 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.620
 subsidies from modified by me 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.070
 Do not turn at all so I try 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.470
 don't recommend to your customers 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.690
 that i know that principle number two is why 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.130
 i recommend eating cornflakes it 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.710
 if we even forget that 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.570
 told about corn corn 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.150
 flakes and in the corner for the same two different 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.160
 product deal then what if you 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.350
 interested in how to do 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.840
 cornflakes How to achieve in 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:29.690
 date the airiness inside this 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:32.180
 corn corn flakes and how 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.360
 achieves so handle crisp then you 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.630
 understand that corn is different flakes 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.639
 very far away and 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.430
 principle number 3 why do they recommend 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.770
 eat cornflakes because more often 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.349
 all these flakes are not just made of 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.689
 corn they are made from malleable 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.879
 from corn 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:53.349
 not for example fruit syrup or 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:56.799
 any other 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.519
 sweet shit which they are 

00:05:56.799 --> 00:06:00.039
 they are covered 

00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:02.829
 and it turns out that this is not even a breakfast 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.649
 dessert and in general so much sugar 

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:07.839
 how much is added there does not 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:10.919
 nothing good except as it develops 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:14.679
 second level bodies and heart diseases 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:17.799
 so I recommend eating flakes here 

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:20.349
 I recommend to see and what made 

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:21.069
 what you want to eat if she doesn't 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:23.739
 grew 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:27.849
 flakes I did not see them somewhere 

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:29.800
 it grew already semi-finished or 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:33.699
 it is already so industrial products 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.419
 what really is far from what we 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.819
 want to eat 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:39.279
 this is my point of view and you yourself 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.639
 look experiment and learn 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:45.429
 how the copy is made is actually 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:47.949
 opens eyes to much for today is 

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:49.389
 all hope you were wondering if u 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.239
