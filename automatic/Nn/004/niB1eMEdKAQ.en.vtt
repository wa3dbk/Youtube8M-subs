00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.160
 a game 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.440
 the narrative that will go today 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.660
 shows us another round of struggle 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.970
 humanity against the dark forces a whole 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.699
 continent engulfed in turmoil and undead and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.430
 only you can return good to these 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.689
 land but how will i answer how 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.390
 fire and sword 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.269
 that is how they eradicate the enemy ardes 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.450
 evil just so from ordinary warriors grow 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.430
 heroes legendary epic will start for you 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.600
 game last keeper review on 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.170
 which I imagine will start for 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.690
 health 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.700
 before us lpg olya diablo stood with 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.379
 several distinctive moments 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.989
 there are a lot of differences 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.539
 but combines the abundance of heroes skills 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.120
 banks of mana and the life of the game itself also 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.850
 isometric representation with constant 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.800
 chopping crowds of enemies main task here 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.199
 clean the mainland from the forces of evil 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.989
 for this you have to go edaky 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.420
 the path of the hero and go through it several 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.640
 first go through the sword of Damocles 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.280
 only superficially on the easy level 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.280
 Difficulties as soon as it seems to us that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.979
 here's the enemy floor hydra it turns out that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.340
 the enemy is cunning and ready to fight with you already 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.320
 on medium and high difficulty mode 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.900
 so if the game is normal 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.850
 will seem like a cakewalk and hardly 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.880
 will cause a storm of emotions here's the bosses 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.369
 complex mode will be remembered for long 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.040
 Also in the game and declared online mode 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.299
 passing 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.520
 however let's talk now about 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.390
 sad though the game spreads 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.790
 is free 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.130
 and therefore has no in-game store 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.530
 she is deprived of another moment which 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 It is intended to translate even a small but 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.509
 still the amount at the expense of the developers i 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.880
 I speak classes even here and a few 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.700
 from sorcerer to assassin available to us by 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.469
 default only warrior and others 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.409
 classes are bought separately and costs 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.750
 about 40 rubles the amount of course funny 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.000
 so don't think 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.500
 it will be such a problem however 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.630
 back to the game 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.850
 why is there anyway you can ask 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.700
 you are its main purpose is 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.260
 use in inlays peculiar 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.600
 symbiosis of weapons in which you will 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.640
 I have a lot to put in here 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.680
 various manipulations with clothes and by the way 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.380
 the question is even different where these items 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.090
 take about to answer this question 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.120
 need to return to the battlefields 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.800
 each zone costs certain conditions 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.650
 destroy the n-th number of enemy 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.650
 beasts and at the end usually waiting for you 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.470
 the boss is just with the bosses most often 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.690
 items and fall out it is not necessary 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.790
 There may be items on your class like 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.890
 the rule drops anything and if u 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.080
 you are open characters or you plan 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.410
 buy in the future do not rush 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.510
 get rid of valuable drop as well 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.430
 stones inlays items you will be 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.550
 issue randomly when counting 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.130
 zone results on how fast and 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.920
 violently you save the location from the forces of evil 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:11.450
 directly depends on what you get by 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.910
 completion of all good deed in principle 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.250
 on the gameplay telling more and nothing 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.650
 everything is accessible and understandable and we like 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.440
 Seen in many projects and even crash and 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.420
 cut it you collect mod improving it i would 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.000
 I wanted to say a few words about graphics 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.910
 I will not hide a secret that we have a picture 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.250
 not from the category of masterpieces but in general on 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.980
 high level and shows excellent fps 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.260
 even she is a budget device a little 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.989
 pumped up sound design like 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.040
 would be more killer motives but this is from 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.860
 discharge quibbles 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.950
 But in general, I have always been for such 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.170
 projects because rpd is my favorite genre and if 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.360
 you don't want to bother with quests 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.410
 or labyrinths of levels 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.049
 Cruz and match 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.519
 has the right to exist and can 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.670
 delay for a long time 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.070
 strong rating 6 out of 7 I would like more 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.470
 Enjoy Russian translation and enhancement 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.110
 music but I think in the coming patches 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.180
 will correct on this all with you was kinat 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.040
 and video review of the game last keeper 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.629
 look 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.629
