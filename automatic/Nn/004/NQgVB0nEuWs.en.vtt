00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.450 
or something like that and the reason
for<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.049> i<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:20.009> think<00:01:20.040> i<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.250> give<00:01:20.430> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
for that i don't think i can give you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.450 
for that i don't think i can give you
guys<00:01:20.670> exact<00:01:21.330> specifics<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:23.040> given

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
guys exact specifics but they have given

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.640 
guys exact specifics but they have given
us<00:01:23.700> limitations<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> how<00:01:25.110> much<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.500> can

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
us limitations as to how much we can

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
us limitations as to how much we can
upload<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:26.310> are<00:01:26.369> only<00:01:26.430> three<00:01:26.820> maps<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.270> we

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
upload there are only three maps that we

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.569 
upload there are only three maps that we
can<00:01:27.540> upload<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:28.500> also<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> time

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
can upload and then also we have a time

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.880 
can upload and then also we have a time
limit<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.030> each<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.420> those<00:01:30.509> maps<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
limit on each of those maps so there is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.830 
limit on each of those maps so there is
a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> time<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.090> gameplay<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.600> i<00:01:33.689> can

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
a lot of time of gameplay that i can

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.630 
a lot of time of gameplay that i can
upload<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.710> there's<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.920> lot<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> stuff<00:01:35.400> i<00:01:35.490> want

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
upload but there's a lot of stuff i want

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.130 
upload but there's a lot of stuff i want
to<00:01:35.700> show<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.880> guys<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.750> lot<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> its

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
to show you guys and a lot of its

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.660 
to show you guys and a lot of its
unrelated<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.829> i<00:01:37.860> can't<00:01:38.100> really<00:01:38.159> put<00:01:38.490> two

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
unrelated so i can't really put two

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.920 
unrelated so i can't really put two
things<00:01:38.880> together<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:39.509> video<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:39.840> they're

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
things together in one video if they're

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.630 
things together in one video if they're
completely<00:01:40.290> unrelated<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.369> want<00:01:41.579> you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
completely unrelated so just want you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.920 
completely unrelated so just want you
guys<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.909> before<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.240> freaked<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.780> saw

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
guys know before you freaked out and saw

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.999 
guys know before you freaked out and saw
a<00:01:42.960> bunch<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.229> short<00:01:43.350> videos<00:01:43.439> tomorrow<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
a bunch of short videos tomorrow the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.350 
a bunch of short videos tomorrow the
reason<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:44.759> i'm<00:01:45.090> trying<00:01:45.240> to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
reason for that is because i'm trying to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.840 
reason for that is because i'm trying to
fit<00:01:45.479> as<00:01:45.600> much<00:01:45.630> information<00:01:46.399> into<00:01:47.399> my<00:01:47.430> allotted

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
fit as much information into my allotted

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.660 
fit as much information into my allotted
time<00:01:48.180> limit<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.570> i<00:01:48.659> possibly<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.520> yeah

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
time limit as i possibly can so so yeah

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.280 
time limit as i possibly can so so yeah
that's<00:01:50.909> that's<00:01:51.360> why<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.630> guys<00:01:51.810> will<00:01:51.990> see<00:01:52.020> that
