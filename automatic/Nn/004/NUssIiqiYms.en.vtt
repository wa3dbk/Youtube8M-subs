00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.819 
snapped into place that is basically it
it's<00:02:04.240> pretty<00:02:04.570> much<00:02:04.720> stuck<00:02:05.049> in<00:02:05.259> this<00:02:05.530> same

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
it's pretty much stuck in this same

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.889 
it's pretty much stuck in this same
position<00:02:06.790> so<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.030> don't<00:02:07.180> have<00:02:07.299> any<00:02:07.570> type<00:02:07.869> of

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
position so you don't have any type of

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.690 
position so you don't have any type of
modifications<00:02:08.799> or<00:02:08.950> movement<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.429> you<00:02:09.549> can

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
modifications or movement that you can

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.130 
modifications or movement that you can
make<00:02:09.880> you<00:02:10.060> can't<00:02:10.299> swivel<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.959> can't

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
make you can't swivel it you can't

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.840 
make you can't swivel it you can't
adjust<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.650> height<00:02:11.829> you<00:02:11.860> can't<00:02:12.280> adjust<00:02:12.670> the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
adjust the height you can't adjust the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.440 
adjust the height you can't adjust the
the<00:02:13.480> can't<00:02:13.780> or<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.410> angle<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.100> any<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.269> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
the can't or the angle of any of the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.300 
the can't or the angle of any of the
different<00:02:16.630> parts<00:02:17.079> once<00:02:17.620> it's<00:02:17.860> locked<00:02:18.129> into

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
different parts once it's locked into

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.089 
different parts once it's locked into
place<00:02:18.610> it's<00:02:18.819> locked<00:02:19.180> into<00:02:19.420> place<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.590> as<00:02:20.890> you

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
place it's locked into place so as you

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.380 
place it's locked into place so as you
can<00:02:21.220> see<00:02:21.430> it's<00:02:21.910> all<00:02:22.090> one

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
can see it's all one

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390 
can see it's all one
peace<00:02:22.569> it's<00:02:22.900> fairly<00:02:23.350> sturdy<00:02:23.740> it's<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.190> little

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
peace it's fairly sturdy it's a little

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.520 
peace it's fairly sturdy it's a little
bit<00:02:24.520> on<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.760> high<00:02:24.970> side<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.960> depending<00:02:26.440> on

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
bit on the high side so depending on

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.260 
bit on the high side so depending on
what<00:02:27.069> type<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.370> environment<00:02:27.880> you're<00:02:28.240> in

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
what type of environment you're in

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.300 
what type of environment you're in
you'll<00:02:28.630> want<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.870> make<00:02:29.319> sure<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.800> have<00:02:30.100> the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
you'll want to make sure you have the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.730 
you'll want to make sure you have the
right<00:02:30.490> height<00:02:30.760> adjustment<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:31.810> as<00:02:32.440> you<00:02:32.590> can

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
right height adjustment and as you can

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.040 
right height adjustment and as you can
see<00:02:32.950> when<00:02:33.160> we<00:02:33.190> use<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.520> with<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> laptop<00:02:34.209> it's

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
see when we use it with a laptop it's

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.780 
see when we use it with a laptop it's
really<00:02:35.410> good<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:35.830> just<00:02:35.860> holding<00:02:36.310> your<00:02:36.370> laptop

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
really good for just holding your laptop

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.210 
really good for just holding your laptop
in<00:02:36.940> place<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.540> for<00:02:37.990> looking<00:02:38.530> at<00:02:38.650> your<00:02:38.800> music

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
in place and for looking at your music

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.010 
in place and for looking at your music
and<00:02:39.430> for<00:02:39.670> checking<00:02:39.970> out<00:02:40.090> your<00:02:40.180> software<00:02:40.660> it'll

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
and for checking out your software it'll

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.750 
and for checking out your software it'll
work<00:02:41.170> just<00:02:41.440> fine<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:41.980> if<00:02:42.400> you're<00:02:42.520> one<00:02:42.670> of

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
work just fine but if you're one of

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.400 
work just fine but if you're one of
those<00:02:42.850> guys<00:02:43.060> that<00:02:43.120> really<00:02:43.660> needs<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.959> button

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
those guys that really needs to button

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.920 
those guys that really needs to button
mash<00:02:44.620> or<00:02:44.980> press<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.580> lot<00:02:45.760> on<00:02:45.970> your<00:02:46.120> laptop<00:02:46.510> you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
mash or press a lot on your laptop you

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.570 
mash or press a lot on your laptop you
can<00:02:47.080> see<00:02:47.260> there's<00:02:47.500> some<00:02:47.709> type<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:47.950> wobble

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
can see there's some type of wobble

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.729 
can see there's some type of wobble
still<00:02:48.910> left<00:02:49.510> in<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.810> stand<00:02:50.050> even<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:50.590> its

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
still left in the stand even in its

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.059 
still left in the stand even in its
fixed<00:02:51.130> position<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:52.650> pretty<00:02:53.650> good<00:02:53.830> for<00:02:54.040> a

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
fixed position so pretty good for a

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.100 
fixed position so pretty good for a
laptop<00:02:54.430> use<00:02:54.670> but<00:02:54.940> we<00:02:55.120> have<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.300> controller<00:02:55.750> here

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
laptop use but we have a controller here

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.810 
laptop use but we have a controller here
this<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.950> Vestax<00:02:57.459> VCI<00:02:58.260> 400<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.640> we'll<00:03:00.640> do

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
this is the Vestax VCI 400 and we'll do

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.440 
this is the Vestax VCI 400 and we'll do
a<00:03:01.860> quick<00:03:02.860> demonstration<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.000> can<00:03:04.209> see

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
a quick demonstration so you can see

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.680 
a quick demonstration so you can see
exactly<00:03:04.930> what<00:03:05.709> this<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.160> like<00:03:06.480> once<00:03:07.480> it's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
exactly what this is like once it's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.140 
exactly what this is like once it's
mounted<00:03:08.019> on<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.739> onto<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.250> stand<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:09.910> as

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
mounted on this onto the stand and as

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.199 
mounted on this onto the stand and as
you<00:03:10.300> can<00:03:10.420> see<00:03:10.480> it<00:03:10.900> works<00:03:11.590> understand<00:03:12.160> it's<00:03:12.489> not

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
you can see it works understand it's not

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.060 
you can see it works understand it's not
very<00:03:13.660> very<00:03:13.930> solid<00:03:14.440> though<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:14.769> if<00:03:14.860> you're<00:03:14.950> one

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
very very solid though so if you're one

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.410 
very very solid though so if you're one
of<00:03:15.160> those<00:03:15.220> DJ's<00:03:15.610> that's<00:03:15.790> doing<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.030> whole<00:03:16.209> lot

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
of those DJ's that's doing a whole lot

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.600 
of those DJ's that's doing a whole lot
of<00:03:16.450> drumming<00:03:16.989> finger<00:03:17.800> drumming<00:03:18.070> here<00:03:18.459> and

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
of drumming finger drumming here and

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.220 
of drumming finger drumming here and
there<00:03:18.730> on<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.970> pads<00:03:19.239> or<00:03:19.570> you're<00:03:19.870> doing<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.110> lot

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
there on the pads or you're doing a lot

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.020 
there on the pads or you're doing a lot
of<00:03:20.380> manipulation<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:21.160> can<00:03:21.190> see<00:03:21.550> there's

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
of manipulation you can see there's

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.360 
of manipulation you can see there's
quite<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.450> bit<00:03:22.750> of<00:03:22.780> wobble<00:03:23.470> with<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.769> stand<00:03:24.040> so

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
quite a bit of wobble with the stand so

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.340 
quite a bit of wobble with the stand so
there<00:03:24.790> are<00:03:24.970> some<00:03:25.239> other<00:03:25.390> stands<00:03:25.660> out<00:03:25.870> there<00:03:26.140> on

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
there are some other stands out there on

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.170 
there are some other stands out there on
the<00:03:26.470> market<00:03:26.829> that<00:03:27.070> do<00:03:27.310> not<00:03:27.459> have<00:03:27.790> as<00:03:28.000> much

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
the market that do not have as much

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.420 
the market that do not have as much
wobble<00:03:28.750> as<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.110> but<00:03:29.440> if<00:03:29.650> you're<00:03:30.040> really

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
wobble as this but if you're really

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.610 
wobble as this but if you're really
trying<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.880> get<00:03:31.480> your<00:03:31.630> performance<00:03:32.230> on<00:03:32.380> with

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
trying to get your performance on with

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.500 
trying to get your performance on with
this<00:03:32.799> on<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> controller<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:33.730> can't<00:03:34.269> really

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
this on a controller I can't really

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.270 
this on a controller I can't really
recommend<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.380> because<00:03:35.620> if<00:03:35.769> I'm<00:03:35.980> in<00:03:36.190> a

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
recommend it because if I'm in a

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.310 
recommend it because if I'm in a
performing<00:03:36.940> environment<00:03:37.510> I'm<00:03:37.810> going<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.140> want

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
performing environment I'm going to want

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.210 
performing environment I'm going to want
something<00:03:38.500> that's<00:03:38.709> a<00:03:38.769> little<00:03:38.799> bit<00:03:39.040> more

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
something that's a little bit more

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.759 
something that's a little bit more
stable<00:03:39.880> than<00:03:40.030> net<00:03:40.269> for<00:03:40.750> my<00:03:40.900> controller<00:03:41.410> so

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
stable than net for my controller so

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.460 
stable than net for my controller so
really<00:03:42.459> good<00:03:42.610> for<00:03:42.790> laptops<00:03:43.239> just<00:03:43.870> okay<00:03:44.440> for

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
really good for laptops just okay for

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.620 
really good for laptops just okay for
controller<00:03:45.400> use<00:03:45.700> especially<00:03:46.090> if<00:03:46.390> you're<00:03:46.510> the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
controller use especially if you're the

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.060 
controller use especially if you're the
type<00:03:46.840> that's<00:03:47.019> going<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.200> drum<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.650> mash<00:03:47.799> away

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
type that's going to drum and mash away

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.130 
type that's going to drum and mash away
a<00:03:48.100> lot<00:03:48.340> you've<00:03:48.790> seen<00:03:49.000> how<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.360> is<00:03:49.480> so<00:03:49.720> it'll<00:03:50.019> be

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
a lot you've seen how it is so it'll be

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.020 
a lot you've seen how it is so it'll be
up<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.500> you<00:03:50.620> your<00:03:50.950> call<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.489> make<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.730> final

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
up to you your call to make the final

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.670 
up to you your call to make the final
decision<00:03:52.480> whether<00:03:52.900> or<00:03:53.049> not<00:03:53.170> this<00:03:53.350> will<00:03:53.530> work

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
decision whether or not this will work

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.650 
decision whether or not this will work
for<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:53.980> controller<00:03:54.489> for<00:03:54.579> you<00:03:54.850> but<00:03:55.390> it's

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
for a controller for you but it's

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.410 
for a controller for you but it's
generally<00:03:55.900> labeled<00:03:56.500> as<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:57.070> DJ<00:03:57.310> laptop<00:03:58.150> stand

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
generally labeled as the DJ laptop stand

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.140 
generally labeled as the DJ laptop stand
so<00:03:58.780> it's<00:03:58.989> more<00:03:59.530> specified<00:04:00.010> for<00:04:00.310> laptop<00:04:00.700> use<00:04:00.940> in

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
so it's more specified for laptop use in

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.289 
so it's more specified for laptop use in
that<00:04:01.690> is<00:04:01.870> probably<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.680> reason<00:04:02.860> why<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:04.030> on

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
that is probably the reason why so on

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.440 
that is probably the reason why so on
the<00:04:04.420> downside<00:04:04.930> what<00:04:05.290> we<00:04:05.380> have<00:04:05.560> here<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.640> non

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
the downside what we have here is a non

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.810 
the downside what we have here is a non
adjustable<00:04:07.900> stand<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:09.100> also<00:04:09.250> has<00:04:09.549> that

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
adjustable stand and it also has that

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.580 
adjustable stand and it also has that
wobble<00:04:10.390> when<00:04:10.840> we're<00:04:10.959> using<00:04:11.079> it<00:04:11.350> for<00:04:11.500> like

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
wobble when we're using it for like

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.860 
wobble when we're using it for like
controller<00:04:12.070> it's<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.340> thai-style<00:04:12.549> use<00:04:13.150> on<00:04:13.420> the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
controller it's a thai-style use on the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.259 
controller it's a thai-style use on the
pros<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.410> have<00:04:14.620> that<00:04:14.890> really<00:04:15.370> cheap<00:04:15.640> price

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
pros you have that really cheap price

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.949 
pros you have that really cheap price
point<00:04:16.680> $35<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:18.160> also<00:04:18.340> have<00:04:18.669> all<00:04:19.000> steel<00:04:19.630> or

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
point $35 you also have all steel or

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.560 
point $35 you also have all steel or
all-metal<00:04:20.530> build<00:04:21.190> quality<00:04:21.489> so<00:04:21.970> it's<00:04:22.210> very

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
all-metal build quality so it's very

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.900 
all-metal build quality so it's very
very<00:04:22.870> durable<00:04:23.200> overall<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.100> it<00:04:24.400> also<00:04:24.580> can

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
very durable overall and it also can

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.200 
very durable overall and it also can
fold<00:04:25.150> down<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:25.990> small<00:04:26.410> form<00:04:27.250> factor<00:04:27.340> so

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
fold down to that small form factor so

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.890 
fold down to that small form factor so
it's<00:04:29.140> easy<00:04:29.410> for<00:04:29.530> storage<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.640> for<00:04:31.030> transport

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
it's easy for storage and for transport

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.540 
it's easy for storage and for transport
and<00:04:32.050> it's<00:04:32.650> pretty<00:04:32.830> much<00:04:32.979> locked<00:04:33.250> into<00:04:33.400> place

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
and it's pretty much locked into place

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.060 
and it's pretty much locked into place
once<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:33.970> have<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.300> there<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:35.229> over

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
once you have it there so over

you're going to get for the price
there's<00:04:39.760> another<00:04:39.970> brand<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.420> has<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:40.780> same

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
there's another brand that has the same

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.100 
there's another brand that has the same
exact<00:04:41.740> laptop<00:04:42.310> stand<00:04:42.520> that's<00:04:42.790> just<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.150> little

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
exact laptop stand that's just a little

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.930 
exact laptop stand that's just a little
bit<00:04:44.290> redesigned<00:04:45.040> but<00:04:45.340> it's<00:04:45.460> basically<00:04:45.850> the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
bit redesigned but it's basically the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.210 
bit redesigned but it's basically the
same<00:04:46.060> thing<00:04:46.300> overall<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.200> they<00:04:47.530> rebranded<00:04:47.860> it

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
same thing overall and they rebranded it

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.560 
same thing overall and they rebranded it
with<00:04:48.340> their<00:04:48.550> name<00:04:48.760> and<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.120> costs<00:04:49.480> about

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
with their name and it costs about

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.930 
with their name and it costs about
double<00:04:50.260> so<00:04:50.650> it's<00:04:50.980> essentially<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:51.910> same

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
double so it's essentially the same

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.090 
double so it's essentially the same
exact<00:04:52.480> stand<00:04:52.750> from<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.020> same<00:04:53.290> exact<00:04:53.650> factory

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
exact stand from the same exact factory

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.280 
exact stand from the same exact factory
but<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.640> mana<00:04:54.910> price<00:04:55.210> again<00:04:55.540> is<00:04:55.750> going<00:04:56.140> to<00:04:56.200> be

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
but the mana price again is going to be

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.980 
but the mana price again is going to be
a<00:04:56.590> lot<00:04:56.830> cheaper<00:04:56.910> because<00:04:57.910> they<00:04:58.270> don't<00:04:58.540> have<00:04:58.630> to

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
a lot cheaper because they don't have to

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.500 
a lot cheaper because they don't have to
keep<00:04:59.710> that<00:04:59.920> branding<00:05:00.430> up<00:05:00.550> as<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:01.330> other
