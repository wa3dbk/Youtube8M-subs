00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.250
 gamers and our video in which they 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.140
 I bring what would be the 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.330
 first impressions of the beta of 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.670
 software in what would be the 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.810
 remastering the first course so 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.670
 well let's try what will come 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.770
 being the beta how can we give ourselves 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.960
 account we are what would be in 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.500
 the lobby of this program that we sell 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.500
 the sale 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.600
 with this duty and most of the 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.250
 main characters we realize 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.949
 that as you are the beta have already been released 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.170
 two skins completely free that a 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.670
 once the full game is as 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.920
 we can enjoy what will come 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.079
 being these skins because what are we 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.670
 waiting is they enter in the lobby and 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.769
 how can we realize then a 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.019
 small variety of characters although it 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.699
 expected to be added 17 characters of what 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.889
 that would be the saga of gears of 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.289
 war 3 is now worth nothing anymore 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:55.600
 can play on two or three maps I 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.799
 it seems that every day what 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.959
 it had been the course of this 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.149
 week they will be releasing whatever comes 

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.260
 making a map and apparently it 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.180
 will celebrate 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.729
 maximum 5 maps although there is nothing 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.470
 confirmed but in the iker forums 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.420
 software have said that every day it 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.880
 will be drawing a map but not 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.100
 they mentioned until what day it's worth so 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.659
 nothing is simply planned until 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.090
 the moment in there seems to be two or three 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.820
 maps just meche what andres in 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.740
 this first game and a second part 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.840
 that I also enjoyed a lot and 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.369
 practically it will be the local 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.080
 making the impressions of choosing 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.630
 software we are on the map of each 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.920
 channels or channels as is in English and 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.640
 What I would be doing is one for 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.679
 quite was medium and short of certain 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.229
 way since then find with the 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.539
 enemy which the enemy to a certain 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.710
 considerable distance and also worth 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.990
 I'm going to talk about a very important topic 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.880
 maybe many of you loose have a 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.649
 problem and that is to all those who 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.479
 they have downloaded the beta and send them the 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.590
 other codes and have had the problem 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.659
 Regarding not being able to consider loading 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.369
 the game was the access pass that was 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.869
 a necessary complement to be able 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.119
 play what will be this beta 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.590
 what they have to do at the end is 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.370
 will be explaining it in the video for 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.020
 that can 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.450
 and download what will be the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.790
 access in case he is part of the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.370
 add on your download queue 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.870
 You can virtually stop Luis Cullen and 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.470
 can enjoy what will come 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.510
 the beta 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.700
 Once you have the game, it's worth 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.620
 account is told now many are a 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.450
 little stiff but we can realize 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.280
 that the game is pretty fluid though 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.320
 I had a little bit of the chs you can give 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.930
 account since it was loading others 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.760
 bodies the most important thing here as 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.310
 that we can breathe highlight some 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.020
 graphics really quite improved or 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.330
 we can realize the sound of the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.910
 night is a bit different but then this one 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.190
 will continue to remain what is not 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.890
 remaining the essence and still 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.720
 we can do active reloads 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.970
 and in the same way we can give ourselves 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.710
 that you can not do the same we 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.210
 what will come to be because if 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.570
 all the old school fans 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.060
 because in x-41 there was no one which came back 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.280
 besides that there is currently no 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.990
 great variety of weapons but if you have put 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.610
 then the main weapons and you have to 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.400
 play one as I was doing 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.950
 has returned the same way is out there 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.540
 the bow the sniper and you can realize 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.310
 here I got a mega spending on this 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.020
 departure since then as I have already 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.060
 mentioned was downloading some 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.890
 games but then in the other games 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.140
 maybe they can not it was a little better 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.290
 regarding what would be the 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.150
 deaths and casualties and how they can give us 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.520
 account in the friend of the sky but has 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.750
 changed considerably besides that 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.480
 now of changes of arms because I what 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.670
 I feel I do not know if a little bit more 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.250
 fast with more noise although you can not 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.170
 contribute very well since the first part 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.370
 what I had was pretty much the xxi 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.739
 can give an account 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.780
 and resuscitation that is something that they have 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.489
 activated so that now by pressing 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.500
 how strong even in this power 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.070
 reanimate since in the previous course 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.170
 place of pc or xbox 360 you can not 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.630
 reanimate you could simply be in 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.130
 bled from a chat or time and without a 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.530
 mate, I do not give you my mom 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.750
 you practically died now we 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.880
 The current lucidity of the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.650
 game is quite considerable since 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.989
 then you can realize one to simple 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.760
 view that has more luminosity and the 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.120
 same form is not a dark Bogota 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.180
 but 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.729
 still maintains the essence that a 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.370
 glance if you give tell the 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.440
 graphics are quite improved is 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.750
 can realize that there is a better 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.090
 gameplay style of gameplay to 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.770
 comparison of the first course ftc war and 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.919
 in the same way because as I have already 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.300
 mentioned then the essence remained 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.860
 currently nothing else is jazz respawn with 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.680
 a grenade from a wall that would come 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.570
 doing and also kept science 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.910
 regarding the change of weapons since 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.910
 you have what will be the essence 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.889
 of software 3 to be able to change 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.949
 weapons since you have mainly the 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.139
 Ian's release yesterday and it is unknown if something 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.289
 complete can select some other 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.539
 weapon by default or default as 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.850
 know practically everything not me 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.650
 I wanted to go without first rewinding the 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.130
 problem for all those who have 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.810
 the error in the one console that they have 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.090
 could not have downloaded the 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.400
 will come being the access that gives them the ex 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.800
 to the beta because practically here they 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.410
 I will show below on screen as 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.669
 revoke that error since it is an error that 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.360
 Well maybe a lot what is 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.580
 happening 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.009
 and can not play the beta is worth what 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.680
 have to do is simply go to 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.050
 your games applications once you 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.599
 have installed and do not show them what 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.419
 that will come making the tlc or the seems 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.680
 rather the access content then 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.689
 we're just going to give you here 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.550
 manage the game or manage the 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:44.400
 game and there will not be appearing what 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.050
 is doing the access phase in this 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.370
 case I have installed the but to 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.259
 you will appear to them that if you wish 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.259
 install it and you just have to 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:55.050
 install does not really weigh much then to 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:56.639
 8.8 megabytes I think but well 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.199
 it will be practically everything now its 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.240
 evolution before they write 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.490
 share this video with your friends that 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.529
 have this same problem and enjoy 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.569
 the beta what you see in the course of 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.979
 this week since it has not been 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:10.500
 confirmed nothing but I guess that 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.870
 would expand will extend forgiveness the days that 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.129
 will be available this great game see you 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.129
 in the next video bye bye
