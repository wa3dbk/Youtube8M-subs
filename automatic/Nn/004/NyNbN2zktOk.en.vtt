excited to have him in this comparison
video<00:00:07.319> we're<00:00:07.529> gonna<00:00:07.680> look<00:00:07.859> at<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.130> optimum

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
video we're gonna look at the optimum

400 slow juicer compared to a

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.770 
400 slow juicer compared to a
centrifugal<00:00:11.280> juicer<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.790> you<00:00:12.090> might<00:00:12.269> buy<00:00:12.450> at

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
centrifugal juicer that you might buy at

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.480 
centrifugal juicer that you might buy at
your<00:00:13.139> local<00:00:13.259> supermarket<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.250> we'll<00:00:14.340> have<00:00:14.460> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
your local supermarket and we'll have a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.240 
your local supermarket and we'll have a
look<00:00:14.639> at<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.849> pros<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.330> cons<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:16.039> well<00:00:17.039> both

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
look at the pros and cons of well both

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.670 
look at the pros and cons of well both
well<00:00:18.150> it's<00:00:18.449> time<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:18.900> us<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.020> juice<00:00:19.439> we've

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
well it's time for us to juice we've

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.109 
well it's time for us to juice we've
popped<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> centrifugal<00:00:20.550> right<00:00:20.789> up<00:00:20.910> here

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
popped the centrifugal right up here

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.599 
popped the centrifugal right up here
next<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> optimum<00:00:21.960> 400<00:00:22.560> juicer<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.250> we've

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
next to the optimum 400 juicer and we've

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.310 
next to the optimum 400 juicer and we've
got<00:00:23.820> exactly<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.359> same<00:00:24.449> things<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.109> plate

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
got exactly the same things on the plate

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.660 
got exactly the same things on the plate
now<00:00:25.439> all<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.890> those<00:00:26.039> ingredients<00:00:26.220> are<00:00:26.580> gonna

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
now all of those ingredients are gonna

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.490 
now all of those ingredients are gonna
go<00:00:26.880> through<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.240> optimum<00:00:27.539> 400<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.170> easily

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
go through the optimum 400 really easily

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.529 
go through the optimum 400 really easily
we've<00:00:28.949> done<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.369> prep<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> 400<00:00:30.449> we've

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
we've done the prep for the 400 we've

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.749 
we've done the prep for the 400 we've
just<00:00:30.750> chopped<00:00:30.960> them<00:00:31.080> into<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:32.160> sticks<00:00:32.520> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
just chopped them into little sticks so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.280 
just chopped them into little sticks so
that<00:00:32.790> they<00:00:32.969> can<00:00:33.180> go<00:00:33.300> down<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.719> feed<00:00:33.960> tube

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
that they can go down the feed tube

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.930 
that they can go down the feed tube
easily<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:34.980> get<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> best<00:00:35.520> result

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
easily and we can get the best result

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.490 
easily and we can get the best result
but<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.540> look<00:00:36.809> at<00:00:36.870> how<00:00:37.020> much<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.350> those

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
but have a look at how much of those

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.619 
but have a look at how much of those
greens<00:00:37.950> those<00:00:38.219> leafy<00:00:38.610> greens<00:00:38.879> come<00:00:39.210> out<00:00:39.390> I

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
greens those leafy greens come out I

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
greens those leafy greens come out I
would<00:00:40.200> chat<00:00:40.469> too<00:00:40.680> while<00:00:40.920> we're<00:00:41.129> juicing<00:00:41.370> but

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
would chat too while we're juicing but

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.190 
would chat too while we're juicing but
the<00:00:41.760> centrifugal<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.420> gonna<00:00:42.570> make<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.079> much

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the centrifugal is gonna make so much

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.850 
the centrifugal is gonna make so much
noise<00:00:43.940> loud<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.420> 400<00:00:45.989> juicer<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.410> nice<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
noise loud the 400 juicer is nice and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100 
noise loud the 400 juicer is nice and
quiet<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.520> talk<00:00:47.700> over<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> top<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.930> when

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
quiet we can talk over the top but when

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.950 
quiet we can talk over the top but when
Rory<00:00:49.350> turns<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.270> you'll<00:00:51.270> hear<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> big

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
Rory turns that on you'll hear a big

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.479 
Rory turns that on you'll hear a big
difference<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.530> Rory<00:00:52.800> let's<00:00:53.070> get<00:00:53.280> juicing

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
difference so Rory let's get juicing

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:10.650 
difference so Rory let's get juicing
alright

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.080 

as<00:01:11.660> you<00:01:11.870> can<00:01:12.020> see<00:01:12.370> there<00:01:13.370> is<00:01:13.550> a<00:01:13.580> big<00:01:13.850> difference

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
as you can see there is a big difference

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.560 
as you can see there is a big difference
between<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.960> two<00:01:14.990> juices<00:01:15.880> just<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:17.030> standard

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
between the two juices just to standard

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.180 
between the two juices just to standard
one<00:01:17.750> if<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:18.020> want<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.230> pull<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.410> apart<00:01:18.620> and

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
one if you want to pull that apart and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.760 
one if you want to pull that apart and
check<00:01:19.580> it<00:01:19.730> out<00:01:19.850> Rory<00:01:20.180> I'll<00:01:20.900> just<00:01:21.230> keep<00:01:21.470> juicing

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
check it out Rory I'll just keep juicing

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:30.040 
check it out Rory I'll just keep juicing
over<00:01:22.220> here<00:01:22.400> with<00:01:22.550> my<00:01:22.730> optimum<00:01:23.600> 400<00:01:28.780> it's<00:01:29.780> just

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
over here with my optimum 400 it's just

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.840 
over here with my optimum 400 it's just
got<00:01:30.320> a<00:01:30.470> little<00:01:30.620> bit<00:01:30.830> caught<00:01:31.280> because<00:01:31.670> it's

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
got a little bit caught because it's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.050 
got a little bit caught because it's
ripping<00:01:32.180> and<00:01:32.480> shredding<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:33.230> tearing<00:01:34.060> you

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
ripping and shredding and tearing you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.340 
ripping and shredding and tearing you
know<00:01:35.150> it's<00:01:35.300> just<00:01:35.480> got<00:01:35.690> caught<00:01:35.900> at<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.080> bottom

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
know it's just got caught at the bottom

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.690 
know it's just got caught at the bottom
there<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:36.590> hasn't<00:01:36.770> been<00:01:36.980> able<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.310> feed

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
there and hasn't been able to feed

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.860 
there and hasn't been able to feed
through<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.240> we're<00:01:38.330> gonna<00:01:38.420> have<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.630> waste

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
through so we're gonna have to waste

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.600 
through so we're gonna have to waste
that<00:01:39.110> bit<00:01:39.320> or<00:01:39.500> feed<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.770> through<00:01:40.010> again<00:01:40.130> but<00:01:40.460> I

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
that bit or feed it through again but I

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.820 
that bit or feed it through again but I
think<00:01:41.000> we'd<00:01:41.090> find<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.480> same<00:01:41.720> thing<00:01:42.050> happen<00:01:42.470> if

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
think we'd find the same thing happen if

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.260 
think we'd find the same thing happen if
we<00:01:43.070> fed<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.280> through<00:01:43.400> again<00:01:43.730> so<00:01:43.880> Rory's<00:01:44.120> gonna

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
we fed it through again so Rory's gonna

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.180 
we fed it through again so Rory's gonna
put<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.510> back<00:01:44.540> together<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.590> kitchen<00:01:45.980> bench

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
put it back together the kitchen bench

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.690 
put it back together the kitchen bench
is<00:01:46.400> a<00:01:46.430> bit<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.910> messy<00:01:48.220> look<00:01:49.220> I<00:01:49.370> think<00:01:49.610> we

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
is a bit of a messy look I think we

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.310 
is a bit of a messy look I think we
could<00:01:49.880> just<00:01:50.030> keep<00:01:50.180> going<00:01:50.240> we<00:01:50.630> can<00:01:50.810> see<00:01:51.080> how

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
could just keep going we can see how

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.030 
could just keep going we can see how
comfortable<00:01:51.980> and<00:01:52.160> neat<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.510> optimum<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.080> and

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
comfortable and neat the optimum is and

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:19.369 
comfortable and neat the optimum is and
the<00:01:55.190> slow<00:01:55.490> juicers<00:01:55.880> just

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.839 

well<00:02:20.379> no<00:02:21.099> wonder<00:02:21.280> people<00:02:21.550> didn't<00:02:21.730> like

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
well no wonder people didn't like

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.119 
well no wonder people didn't like
juicing<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.870> what<00:02:23.140> Rory<00:02:23.379> just<00:02:23.709> said<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.040> me

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
juicing is what Rory just said to me

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.759 
juicing is what Rory just said to me
over<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.519> noise<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.870> totally<00:02:26.230> agree<00:02:26.470> with

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
over that noise and I totally agree with

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.830 
over that noise and I totally agree with
him<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:26.980> does<00:02:27.459> absolutely<00:02:28.120> makes<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.480> racket

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
him that does absolutely makes a racket

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.600 
him that does absolutely makes a racket
I've<00:02:28.959> been<00:02:29.140> juicing<00:02:29.290> with<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.709> slow<00:02:30.010> juicer<00:02:30.250> for

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
I've been juicing with a slow juicer for

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.720 
I've been juicing with a slow juicer for
a<00:02:30.670> while<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.209> is<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:32.530> quiet<00:02:33.069> you<00:02:33.610> can

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
a while and this is so so quiet you can

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.759 
a while and this is so so quiet you can
see<00:02:34.000> we've<00:02:34.180> got<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.390> beautifully<00:02:35.019> mixed<00:02:35.379> juice

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
see we've got a beautifully mixed juice

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.150 
see we've got a beautifully mixed juice
here<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.420> optimum<00:02:37.930> juicer<00:02:38.620> it's<00:02:38.890> it's

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
here in the optimum juicer it's it's

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.729 
here in the optimum juicer it's it's
absolutely<00:02:39.340> beautiful<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.360> mixed<00:02:40.690> well<00:02:40.959> over

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
absolutely beautiful and mixed well over

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.520 
absolutely beautiful and mixed well over
here<00:02:42.129> in<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.599> centrifugal<00:02:43.599> juicer<00:02:44.140> besides

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
here in this centrifugal juicer besides

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.470 
here in this centrifugal juicer besides
the<00:02:44.739> fact<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.040> our<00:02:45.129> entire<00:02:45.760> kitchen<00:02:46.150> bench

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
the fact that our entire kitchen bench

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.839 
the fact that our entire kitchen bench
is<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> mess<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.590> juicer<00:02:48.010> kept<00:02:48.220> wiggling<00:02:48.459> and

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
is a mess the juicer kept wiggling and

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.199 
is a mess the juicer kept wiggling and
moving<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.930> was<00:02:50.170> loud<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.860> noisy<00:02:51.099> the<00:02:51.940> juice

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
moving it was loud and noisy the juice

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.080 
moving it was loud and noisy the juice
you<00:02:52.450> can<00:02:52.599> see<00:02:52.840> already<00:02:53.049> is<00:02:53.680> really<00:02:54.310> separated

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
you can see already is really separated

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.710 
you can see already is really separated
rather<00:02:55.420> than<00:02:55.660> combined<00:02:56.230> here<00:02:57.010> in<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:58.329> juicing

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
rather than combined here in the juicing

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.990 
rather than combined here in the juicing
jug<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.049> I'm<00:02:59.109> gonna<00:02:59.260> pop<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.500> in<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.430> little<00:03:00.849> cup

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
jug so I'm gonna pop it in a little cup

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.490 
jug so I'm gonna pop it in a little cup
and<00:03:01.180> we're<00:03:01.660> gonna<00:03:01.780> just<00:03:01.989> have<00:03:02.049> a<00:03:02.140> look<00:03:02.290> at<00:03:02.379> what

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
and we're gonna just have a look at what

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.660 
and we're gonna just have a look at what
happens<00:03:02.829> in<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.010> few<00:03:03.190> minutes<00:03:03.519> Rory<00:03:03.819> here<00:03:03.940> we<00:03:04.030> go

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
happens in a few minutes Rory here we go

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.309 
happens in a few minutes Rory here we go
so<00:03:06.670> there's<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.970> lot<00:03:07.269> this<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.480> really<00:03:08.049> thick

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
so there's a lot this is really thick

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.770 
so there's a lot this is really thick
and<00:03:08.530> chunky<00:03:08.799> as<00:03:09.129> it<00:03:09.250> goes<00:03:09.400> into<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.879> cup<00:03:10.090> even

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
and chunky as it goes into the cup even

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.420 
and chunky as it goes into the cup even
with<00:03:10.930> us<00:03:11.109> putting<00:03:11.530> that<00:03:11.650> thick<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.190> chunky

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
with us putting that thick and chunky

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.479 
with us putting that thick and chunky
pulp<00:03:12.879> in<00:03:13.329> there<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:14.590> can<00:03:14.769> actually<00:03:14.920> see<00:03:15.340> that

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
pulp in there you can actually see that

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.000 
pulp in there you can actually see that
there's<00:03:15.670> considerably<00:03:16.269> less<00:03:16.540> yield<00:03:17.049> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
there's considerably less yield the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.160 
there's considerably less yield the
green<00:03:18.310> colour<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.879> not<00:03:18.910> as<00:03:19.269> bright<00:03:19.480> enough<00:03:20.019> you

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
green colour is not as bright enough you

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.539 
green colour is not as bright enough you
can<00:03:20.319> see<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:20.769> there<00:03:20.980> but<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.190> green<00:03:21.370> colour

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
can see that there but the green colour

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.460 
can see that there but the green colour
is<00:03:21.670> definitely<00:03:22.209> not<00:03:22.329> as<00:03:22.480> bright<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.019> from<00:03:23.319> my

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
is definitely not as bright and from my

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.309 
is definitely not as bright and from my
naked<00:03:23.919> eye<00:03:24.040> I<00:03:24.340> can<00:03:24.790> really<00:03:25.150> clearly<00:03:25.660> see<00:03:26.079> that

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
naked eye I can really clearly see that

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.129 
naked eye I can really clearly see that
that<00:03:26.829> centrifugal<00:03:27.430> juice<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.970> separating<00:03:28.750> and

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
that centrifugal juice is separating and

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.949 
that centrifugal juice is separating and
and<00:03:29.410> moving<00:03:30.190> apart<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.389> know<00:03:31.480> the

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
and moving apart so you know the

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.629 
and moving apart so you know the
nutritional<00:03:32.200> profile<00:03:32.829> of<00:03:33.099> a<00:03:33.160> slow<00:03:33.400> juicer

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
nutritional profile of a slow juicer

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.879 
nutritional profile of a slow juicer
juice<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.209> much<00:03:34.480> higher<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.319> juice<00:03:35.530> is<00:03:35.709> well

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
juice is much higher the juice is well

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.890 
juice is much higher the juice is well
combined<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.579> were<00:03:36.669> able<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.000> draw<00:03:37.480> more<00:03:37.840> of

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
combined we were able to draw more of

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.379 
combined we were able to draw more of
the<00:03:38.200> greens<00:03:38.530> out<00:03:39.130> of<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.639> vegetables<00:03:40.209> and

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
the greens out of the vegetables and

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.349 
the greens out of the vegetables and
have<00:03:41.079> that<00:03:41.230> beautiful<00:03:41.410> green<00:03:41.919> juice<00:03:42.280> in<00:03:43.030> there

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
have that beautiful green juice in there

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.140 
have that beautiful green juice in there
and<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:44.200> course<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:44.650> one<00:03:44.919> made<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.519> mess<00:03:45.790> got

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
and of course this one made a mess got

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.930 
and of course this one made a mess got
stuck<00:03:46.540> made<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.079> lot<00:03:47.349> of<00:03:47.380> noise<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:48.609> that<00:03:48.760> was<00:03:48.910> a

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
stuck made a lot of noise and that was a

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.240 
stuck made a lot of noise and that was a
brand<00:03:49.450> new<00:03:49.569> centrifugal<00:03:50.380> juicer<00:03:50.829> straight

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
brand new centrifugal juicer straight

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.250 
brand new centrifugal juicer straight
from<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.609> box<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:51.970> really<00:03:52.359> big<00:03:52.660> comparison

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
from the box so a really big comparison

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.159 
from the box so a really big comparison
you<00:03:53.349> have<00:03:53.440> anything<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.739> add<00:03:53.859> Rory<00:03:54.160> no<00:03:54.519> you

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
you have anything to add Rory no you

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:02.460 
you have anything to add Rory no you
literally<00:04:00.480> able<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.540> see<00:04:01.720> what<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:01.989> centrifugal

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
literally able to see what a centrifugal

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.920 
literally able to see what a centrifugal
juicer<00:04:02.919> does<00:04:03.069> in<00:04:03.250> comparison<00:04:03.790> yeah<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.720> and

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
juicer does in comparison yeah and and

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.240 
juicer does in comparison yeah and and
this<00:04:05.049> was<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.319> brand<00:04:05.530> new<00:04:05.590> out<00:04:05.739> of<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.889> box<00:04:06.069> as

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
this was a brand new out of the box as

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.830 
this was a brand new out of the box as
well<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:06.639> you<00:04:07.060> know<00:04:07.180> neither<00:04:07.389> of<00:04:07.599> them<00:04:07.720> have
