00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
put it up before the video started and

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.789 
put it up before the video started and
as<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.140> can<00:02:24.290> see<00:02:24.319> as<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.370> prophet<00:02:25.730> saw<00:02:25.909> before

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
as you can see as the prophet saw before

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.649 
as you can see as the prophet saw before
it<00:02:27.799> will<00:02:27.950> go<00:02:28.189> down<00:02:28.219> and<00:02:28.939> probably<00:02:29.180> didn't<00:02:29.569> see

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
it will go down and probably didn't see

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.349 
it will go down and probably didn't see
the<00:02:29.780> going<00:02:30.079> down<00:02:30.260> court<00:02:30.590> but<00:02:31.489> here's<00:02:32.239> the

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
the going down court but here's the

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:38.589 
the going down court but here's the
downside<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:35.569> doesn't<00:02:35.870> go<00:02:35.959> up<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.790> if

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
downside to that it doesn't go up so if

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.509 
downside to that it doesn't go up so if

this right here is just showing you how
high<00:05:10.280> blocks<00:05:10.849> can<00:05:11.120> go<00:05:11.560> before<00:05:12.560> they<00:05:13.539> could<00:05:14.539> go

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
high blocks can go before they could go

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.159 
high blocks can go before they could go
to<00:05:14.780> a<00:05:14.960> boiler<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:20.270> this<00:05:20.569> is<00:05:20.690> just<00:05:20.840> some<00:05:20.990> random
