00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
they're stupid and then they won't be

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.830 
they're stupid and then they won't be
able<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.010> stop<00:03:38.220> or<00:03:38.940> they'll<00:03:39.090> go<00:03:39.209> too<00:03:39.269> slow<00:03:39.810> and

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
able to stop or they'll go too slow and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.509 
able to stop or they'll go too slow and
then<00:03:40.170> other<00:03:40.380> people<00:03:40.590> will<00:03:40.739> slide<00:03:41.040> into<00:03:41.280> them

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519
