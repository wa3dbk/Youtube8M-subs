00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.910
 weekly 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.080
 as an ideal son-in-law 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.650
 the humorist spares nothing or nobody 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.670
 I read yesterday in these Sundays they have 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.009
 do a whole report on cars 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.250
 of the royal family for queen paola 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.110
 it's a fiat in his image yeah that's 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.810
 that an Italian not very reliable to his 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.460
 picture hello so she existed on 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.410
 just seen the man who heard radio 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.340
 at the start was a stage man and bah 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.840
 now I come to do chronicles 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.759
 I'm talking about act that comes because 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 there you change so I'm going to write some 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.110
 again everyday then is what 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.330
 is studies for that in fact I do not 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.310
 do not see me and I did indeed who was 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.619
 not planned for that I got up 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.560
 for that you came to see I you 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.350
 to visit cape on the ulb campus 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.570
 which houses the school solid and graduated from 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.520
 marketing in hand alex offers himself a small 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.050
 pilgrimage ten years after the end of his 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.550
 curriculum 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.899
 what motivated me this gives not the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.789
 all know what I wanted to do at 18 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.200
 years so in the big studies there had been 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.800
 medicine but then I think it takes a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.929
 true vocation 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.060
 it was right short we loved too much the 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.630
 letters there was polytech have to like 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.569
 three figures 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.849
 so he was solvay and I did that 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.080
 when I was in first michel hallé a 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.340
 did an interview that was the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.260
 school director at the time who 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.450
 was titled stood the school of the elite 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.030
 julie wish me v'là in the school of 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.830
 the elite but it was not the goal and I 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.569
 did not have much this side is Stouffer's 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.030
 will you say recent subtitles 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.830
 and what is the mood that is the only 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.970
 s media that the fart in that it is 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.180
 that I find that there is still a lot of 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.180
 pretense I'm told oh that's okay 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.590
 nothing has changed, but we're going 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.480
 wait for skimming the second year 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.480
 to see his good answers 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.210
 get to the bottom of the class if 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.900
 the habit I had 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.599
 valet 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.300
 for reminder and you see I took 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:07.600
 a subset not 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:10.560
 she has become because I know 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.560
 not even how I managed 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.130
 here we go to the psycho library 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.270
 the most beautiful with two usb bus and I 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.360
 will explain my method of 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.360
 job 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.970
 and 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.190
 first lesson as asleep in 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.690
 library do not have to sleep on the 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.090
 table because then we have a bad taste 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.460
 years dreamed placed too since we 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.900
 puts in the world from here 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.790
 and then we're doing very well and this 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.790
 night for the 13th 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:03.050
 but but that's after the idea that 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.900
 people think after in the middle of 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.269
 work that we are brilliant that fatally 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.849
 it's a real plus and I've been credible 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.440
 in everything I did when I 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.550
 say tribute and get up I have 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.780
 sports journalists so much you 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.440
 say to comment a football match that 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.630
 has no interest 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.820
 but as he made me get up I 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.290
 comic comic it is not directly 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.120
 is not connected to humor and well 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.870
 yet I was credible said yes it's 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.090
 a smart little comic 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.470
 subsidence in the last year there is a 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.580
 student who calls me a student of last 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.690
 who told me we would like you to come 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.040
 make a speech to note handed over 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.000
 qualifications 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.950
 I said what I meet you who you 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.240
 call it's a bit like if the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.860
 Faculty of Sciences asked the brothers 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.919
 bogdanoff to come make the speech 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.169
 am good i am still bad i 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.010
 will eat succeed and so he told me 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.120
 yes, but what we want precisely 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:51.130
 someone who made a parallel path 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.130
 is all called quote for better 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:00.350
 you study gender is very real and at the 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.050
 end of my speech 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.419
 teachers like students have 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.610
 applauded a force got up and 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.320
 I like it really moved me and I got 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.310
 said like I had to send their image 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.310
 who wants to have 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.139
 that's the new building I've ever 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.400
 known must study in there on this 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.270
 funny hole is that they put a 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.039
 hole in the ceiling 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.810
 and I tell myself that it's just like the 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.770
 students to get up he is aiming at the sky do not 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.479
 do not want to be bored in their 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.770
 ascension is your explanation i think 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.100
 we get a toolbox 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.479
 great in this school there that can 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.520
 be used in all areas 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.080
 that is, you understand that 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.870
 if you work a lot you 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.039
 could have anything you want 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.260
 so we even have in this toolbox 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.490
 a form of ambition in saying to myself I 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.380
 do you want that ah well, well, I'll go 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.060
 gave means and that's actually 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.250
 also gives us that confidence in us 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.200
 somewhere if they make the effort if 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.229
 works everything will come 6 gives them the 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.229
 means
