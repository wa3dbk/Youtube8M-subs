00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
low buff I'm not sure that is is that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.280 
low buff I'm not sure that is is that
shooting<00:02:20.310> gallery<00:02:20.580> know<00:02:20.910> what<00:02:21.810> warframes<00:02:22.170> are

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
shooting gallery know what warframes are

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.930 
shooting gallery know what warframes are
we<00:02:22.350> actually<00:02:22.500> go<00:02:22.890> we<00:02:23.010> got<00:02:23.130> Mirage<00:02:23.490> we<00:02:23.790> got<00:02:23.910> a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
we actually go we got Mirage we got a

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.960 
we actually go we got Mirage we got a
vault<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.440> I'm<00:02:25.500> guessing<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.860> speed<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
vault and so I'm guessing that speed and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.520 
vault and so I'm guessing that speed and
i'm<00:02:27.150> not<00:02:27.240> sure<00:02:27.330> what<00:02:27.540> other<00:02:27.720> warframes<00:02:28.320> we've

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
i'm not sure what other warframes we've

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.070 
i'm not sure what other warframes we've
got<00:02:28.680> we've<00:02:29.100> got<00:02:29.130> yeah<00:02:29.730> we<00:02:29.850> got<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.030> frost<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.540> volt

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
got we've got yeah we got a frost a volt

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.950 
got we've got yeah we got a frost a volt
Mirage<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.400> mag<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.720> those<00:02:33.870> two<00:02:34.200> mag<00:02:34.980> and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
Mirage and a mag so of those two mag and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.020 
Mirage and a mag so of those two mag and
mag<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.440> frost<00:02:38.070> are<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> only<00:02:38.460> useful<00:02:38.670> ones

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
mag and frost are the only useful ones

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.170 
mag and frost are the only useful ones
vault<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.320> Mirage<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:41.340> really<00:02:41.640> not<00:02:41.850> sure<00:02:41.910> how

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
vault and Mirage I'm really not sure how

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.180 
vault and Mirage I'm really not sure how
they<00:02:42.360> contribute<00:02:42.630> at<00:02:42.870> all<00:02:43.020> i'm<00:02:43.620> guessing<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
they contribute at all i'm guessing the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.820 
they contribute at all i'm guessing the
idea<00:02:44.880> vault<00:02:45.330> has<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:45.930> every<00:02:46.230> uses<00:02:46.530> speed

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
idea vault has is that every uses speed

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.450 
idea vault has is that every uses speed
fan<00:02:47.160> we<00:02:47.340> can<00:02:47.550> attack<00:02:48.090> faster<00:02:48.600> but<00:02:49.440> um<00:02:49.620> again<00:02:50.220> I

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
fan we can attack faster but um again I

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.850 
fan we can attack faster but um again I
feel<00:02:51.360> as<00:02:51.510> though<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:52.170> Trinity<00:02:52.440> with

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
feel as though like Trinity with

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.130 
feel as though like Trinity with
blessing<00:02:53.280> or<00:02:53.520> energy<00:02:53.970> restore<00:02:54.300> would<00:02:54.840> be<00:02:54.960> much

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
blessing or energy restore would be much

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.270 
blessing or energy restore would be much
more<00:02:55.170> useful<00:02:55.350> i'm<00:02:55.710> just<00:02:55.830> going<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:55.980> activate

just<00:03:17.220> taking<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.550> more<00:03:17.700> offensive<00:03:18.090> approach<00:03:18.270> as

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
just taking a more offensive approach as

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.540 
just taking a more offensive approach as
low<00:03:18.690> snow<00:03:18.930> globes<00:03:19.230> there's<00:03:19.560> no<00:03:19.710> sitting<00:03:20.460> on

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
low snow globes there's no sitting on

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.830 
low snow globes there's no sitting on
the<00:03:20.640> tram<00:03:20.880> there's<00:03:21.240> not<00:03:21.420> really<00:03:21.570> anything

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
the tram there's not really anything

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.470 
the tram there's not really anything
although<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:23.190> shield<00:03:23.520> paralyzes<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.240> restore

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
although the shield paralyzes to restore

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.030 
although the shield paralyzes to restore
my<00:03:24.510> own<00:03:24.750> shield<00:03:24.990> so<00:03:25.200> i<00:03:25.260> can<00:03:25.410> keep<00:03:25.530> tram<00:03:25.830> going

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
my own shield so i can keep tram going

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.550 
my own shield so i can keep tram going
because<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:27.030> tram<00:03:27.240> basically<00:03:27.690> moves<00:03:27.930> off<00:03:28.200> our

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
because the tram basically moves off our

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.530 
because the tram basically moves off our
shield<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.280> if<00:03:29.490> we<00:03:29.700> don't<00:03:29.850> have<00:03:30.000> shields<00:03:30.390> find

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
shield so if we don't have shields find

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.150 
shield so if we don't have shields find
it<00:03:30.630> stops<00:03:30.840> moving<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.770> means<00:03:31.890> it<00:03:32.130> takes

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
it stops moving and that means it takes

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.240 
it stops moving and that means it takes
more<00:03:32.430> damage<00:03:33.620> someone<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.740> down<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.130> we

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
more damage someone is down but we

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.740 
more damage someone is down but we
really<00:03:35.610> can't<00:03:35.640> go<00:03:35.940> back<00:03:36.120> for<00:03:36.300> him<00:03:36.330> we<00:03:36.540> need<00:03:36.690> to

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.900 
below par right now I think we are going
to<00:04:09.270> struggle<00:04:09.480> um<00:04:10.350> our<00:04:11.100> shields<00:04:11.520> thing<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:11.730> need

to struggle um our shields thing I need

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.010 
to struggle um our shields thing I need
to<00:04:11.970> keep<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.209> up<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.570> can<00:04:12.690> actually<00:04:12.930> keep

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
to keep that up so I can actually keep

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.090 
to keep that up so I can actually keep
check<00:04:13.230> on<00:04:13.260> everyone<00:04:13.530> shields<00:04:13.860> because<00:04:14.010> I

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
check on everyone shields because I

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.770 
check on everyone shields because I
think<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.340> more<00:04:14.459> people<00:04:14.790> there<00:04:14.910> are<00:04:15.060> then

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
think the more people there are then

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.080 
think the more people there are then
then<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.950> faster<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.430> moves<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.820> could<00:04:18.000> be

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
then the faster it moves I could be

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.090 
then the faster it moves I could be
wrong<00:04:18.209> about<00:04:18.270> that<00:04:18.480> that<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:18.900> will<00:04:19.260> go<00:04:19.980> ahead

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
bullet attractor works on these guys I'm

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.540 
bullet attractor works on these guys I'm
going<00:04:44.759> to<00:04:44.819> try<00:04:44.970> actually<00:04:45.449> uh<00:04:46.340> yep<00:04:47.340> early

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
going to try actually uh yep early

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.860 
going to try actually uh yep early
attract<00:04:47.819> Ashley<00:04:48.060> works<00:04:48.210> on<00:04:48.389> them<00:04:48.539> I<00:04:48.660> didn't

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
attract Ashley works on them I didn't

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.260 
attract Ashley works on them I didn't
know<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:48.990> their<00:04:49.560> resource<00:04:50.099> drop<00:04:50.310> go<00:04:51.120> back

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
know that their resource drop go back

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.270 
know that their resource drop go back
and<00:04:51.449> use<00:04:52.139> that<00:04:52.169> to<00:04:52.319> get<00:04:52.470> one<00:04:52.680> shields<00:04:52.979> back<00:04:53.099> up

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
and use that to get one shields back up

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.100 
and use that to get one shields back up
this<00:04:53.880> is<00:04:54.030> actually<00:04:54.330> going<00:04:54.599> easier<00:04:54.960> than<00:04:55.050> I

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
this is actually going easier than I

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.620 
this is actually going easier than I
expected<00:04:55.139> we<00:04:56.130> all<00:04:56.250> around<00:04:56.400> half<00:04:56.669> HP<00:04:56.910> ebook<00:04:57.479> is

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
expected we all around half HP ebook is

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.080 
expected we all around half HP ebook is
that<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.110> extraction<00:04:58.349> zone<00:04:58.590> i<00:04:58.889> see<00:04:59.070> i<00:04:59.250> think

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
that the extraction zone i see i think

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.879 
that the extraction zone i see i think
that<00:05:00.210> could<00:05:00.419> very<00:05:00.479> well<00:05:00.690> be<00:05:00.900> extraction<00:05:01.380> and

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
that could very well be extraction and

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.680 
that could very well be extraction and
my<00:05:02.160> shields<00:05:02.460> gone<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:02.880> i<00:05:02.910> need<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.180> use<00:05:03.449> shield

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
my shields gone so i need to use shield

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.830 
my shields gone so i need to use shield
polarize<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.320> what<00:05:04.680> oh<00:05:05.449> that<00:05:06.449> was<00:05:06.570> like<00:05:06.690> an

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
polarize and what oh that was like an

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.839 
polarize and what oh that was like an
Arctic<00:05:07.139> one<00:05:07.530> so<00:05:07.830> he<00:05:08.160> did<00:05:08.310> a<00:05:08.340> lot<00:05:08.520> more<00:05:08.669> damage

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
Arctic one so he did a lot more damage

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.820 
Arctic one so he did a lot more damage
and<00:05:09.090> he<00:05:09.210> would<00:05:09.389> always<00:05:09.419> do<00:05:10.169> that<00:05:10.440> all<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.560> pain

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
and he would always do that all the pain

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.770 
and he would always do that all the pain
but<00:05:11.550> least<00:05:11.729> these<00:05:11.849> guys<00:05:12.060> can<00:05:12.210> revive<00:05:12.509> me<00:05:12.660> while

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
but least these guys can revive me while

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.060 
but least these guys can revive me while
saying<00:05:12.990> bio<00:05:13.169> channel<00:05:13.410> so<00:05:13.620> I'm<00:05:13.680> just<00:05:13.860> kind<00:05:14.039> of

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
saying bio channel so I'm just kind of

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.920 
saying bio channel so I'm just kind of
sitting<00:05:14.280> on<00:05:14.460> it<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:15.090> I'll<00:05:15.240> she'll<00:05:15.479> polarize

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
sitting on it and I'll she'll polarize

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.480 
sitting on it and I'll she'll polarize
again<00:05:16.199> gabon<00:05:16.590> shields<00:05:16.889> back<00:05:17.039> up<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.370> never

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
again gabon shields back up and never

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.450 
again gabon shields back up and never
mind<00:05:17.789> i<00:05:17.970> don't<00:05:18.150> have<00:05:18.300> energy<00:05:19.039> so<00:05:20.039> do<00:05:20.220> we<00:05:20.310> have<00:05:20.340> a

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
mind i don't have energy so do we have a

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.300 
mind i don't have energy so do we have a
Trinity<00:05:20.849> yeah<00:05:21.389> that's<00:05:21.599> a<00:05:21.659> Trinity<00:05:22.070> why<00:05:23.070> did<00:05:23.250> I

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
Trinity yeah that's a Trinity why did I

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.770 
Trinity yeah that's a Trinity why did I
think<00:05:23.490> we<00:05:23.550> had<00:05:23.669> a<00:05:23.699> frost<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.210> swear<00:05:24.509> I<00:05:24.539> saw<00:05:24.720> the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
think we had a frost I swear I saw the

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.020 
think we had a frost I swear I saw the
snow<00:05:25.020> globe<00:05:25.229> or<00:05:25.380> something<00:05:25.590> in<00:05:25.650> the<00:05:25.710> beginning

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
snow globe or something in the beginning

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.189 
snow globe or something in the beginning
also<00:05:27.030> these<00:05:27.150> guys<00:05:27.389> aren't<00:05:27.630> staying<00:05:27.930> near<00:05:28.169> the

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
also these guys aren't staying near the

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.830 
also these guys aren't staying near the
tram<00:05:28.530> anywhere<00:05:28.949> near<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:29.550> as<00:05:30.210> much<00:05:30.539> as<00:05:30.570> they

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
tram anywhere near and as much as they

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.390 
tram anywhere near and as much as they
should<00:05:30.870> be<00:05:31.169> so<00:05:31.770> it's<00:05:31.860> moving<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.190> lot<00:05:32.370> slower

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
should be so it's moving a lot slower

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.210 
should be so it's moving a lot slower
and<00:05:33.240> it<00:05:33.449> gradually<00:05:33.930> loses<00:05:34.560> health<00:05:34.770> just<00:05:35.009> over

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
and it gradually loses health just over

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.430 
and it gradually loses health just over
time<00:05:35.370> but<00:05:35.520> we're<00:05:35.669> second<00:05:35.880> is<00:05:36.000> our<00:05:36.120> extraction

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
time but we're second is our extraction

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.570 
time but we're second is our extraction
is<00:05:37.440> that<00:05:37.590> really<00:05:37.800> extraction<00:05:38.190> and<00:05:38.280> we<00:05:38.340> really

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
is that really extraction and we really

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.490 
is that really extraction and we really
are<00:05:38.729> and<00:05:40.220> how<00:05:41.220> did<00:05:41.400> we<00:05:41.490> do<00:05:41.639> this<00:05:42.110> maybe<00:05:43.110> we're

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
are and how did we do this maybe we're

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.390 
are and how did we do this maybe we're
not<00:05:43.590> going<00:05:43.710> to<00:05:43.770> get<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:43.949> right<00:05:44.039> school

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
not going to get the right school

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.520 
not going to get the right school
because<00:05:44.550> we<00:05:44.639> lost<00:05:44.759> so<00:05:44.909> much<00:05:45.030> HP<00:05:45.289> i'm<00:05:46.289> not<00:05:46.469> sure

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
because we lost so much HP i'm not sure

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.820 
because we lost so much HP i'm not sure
but<00:05:47.419> yeah<00:05:48.419> this<00:05:48.599> this<00:05:48.960> looks<00:05:49.169> like<00:05:49.259> extraction

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
but yeah this this looks like extraction

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.100 
but yeah this this looks like extraction
i<00:05:50.009> see<00:05:50.159> if<00:05:50.219> i<00:05:50.280> can<00:05:50.460> get<00:05:50.909> back<00:05:51.090> yes<00:05:51.360> i<00:05:51.389> can<00:05:51.659> what<00:05:51.690> a

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
i see if i can get back yes i can what a

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.159 
i see if i can get back yes i can what a
