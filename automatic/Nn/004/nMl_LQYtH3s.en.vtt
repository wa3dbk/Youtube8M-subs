 home of the network invites a leader 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:24.930
 I will show you how to make a 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:28.140
 crescent placed at first 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.019
 in the bowl of the beater the flour 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.260
 sugar salt and yeast 1.9 and milk 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.450
 we will trouble in first gear 5 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.899
 minutes then 4-1 five minutes in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.690
 second 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.030
 once the kneading is finished we go 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.280
 come ride with the palm of your hand 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.829
 inside the pact in order to perform 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.629
 a nice, regular ball is going the 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.820
 let stand once the dough 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.100
 rest for 30 minutes we will come flour and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.199
 the work plan has an impact 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.149
 platinum slightly using the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.870
 rolling pin one to come spread 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.940
 in star then we just tap the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.549
 butter to get a steady mass 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.409
 it is placed in the center of the dough then 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.340
 round comes close to perform a 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.830
 folding into envelopes and to flap the 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.280
 last so for the age tour it is done 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.280
 in three stages 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.869
 and there I fold in portfolio of which 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.210
 lamballe in the baking paper and 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.860
 place them 15 minutes in the fridge in 15 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.619
 minutes are past we will come 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.300
 perform the second round the roll to 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.590
 pastry in hand we come and go 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.290
 in length 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.670
 the dough it is important to respect 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.590
 break times because the butter is going 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.270
 come snap back inside the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.399
 paste for better incorporation and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.440
 better cooking development 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.440
 so once my down is done 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.810
 and regular I just bend to both 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.620
 third one third 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.540
 the last fifteen minutes we just 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.490
 So we will go and re going a 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.040
 last time to give the last 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.290
 turn I close to two- thirds 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.920
 I let him ask five minutes and I 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.910

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.150
 hands glued to each other 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.070

 chocolate bar using my 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:43.270
