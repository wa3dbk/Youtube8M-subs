00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.529
 my name is miguel tours 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.110
 designed and designed for the fields of 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.110
 Sahrawi refugees 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.510
 ok now let's see all the pieces 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.120
 what are we going to need for the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.640
 construction of this pump 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.750
 on the table we have these pieces that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.930
 can be found in any 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.000
 hardware store or specialized center 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.699
 plumbing are pieces that is a set 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.940
 I do not think it exceeds the value of 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.710
 twenty euros the most important part is 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.229
 this anti-return valve is a valve 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.300
 that has a little ball inside that will be the 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.210
 responsible for facilitating suction and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.590
 water ejection as you can see the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.570
 construction is very simple they are 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.590
 materials that can be found in 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.479
 any pvc site this allows 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.780
 Installation in the pump installation 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.179
 be very fast and effective the pump is already 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:27.340
 mounted a very important part also 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:30.520
 it is this that is the suction function 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.969
 by a threaded rod and very important 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.780
 is that it has a rubber that goes very 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.730
 just so I can make a vacuum 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.580
 and thus facilitate 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.810
 the water solution 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.980
 this pump is 20 millimeters but in 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.000
 We can also find the market 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.480
 bigger 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.150
 the case is costing 40,000 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.890
 this would facilitate us to be able to extract 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.890
 much more water 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.130
 action 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.790
 next let's watch a video 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.110
 where a test is done with this same 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.130
 pump but at 3 meters 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.130
 we meet 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.230
 I have always slept 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.510
 of plumbing and we're going to do a test 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.240
 with the pump with the design of the pump 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.960
 smaller than we have been able to open 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.960
 and we'll see it 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.720
 we will see that shortly we are 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.640
 If you need more information, do not doubt 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.640
