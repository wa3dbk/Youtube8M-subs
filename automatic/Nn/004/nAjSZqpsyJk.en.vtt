talk about necrotic breath which is the
most<00:00:41.640> dangerous<00:00:41.879> ability<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:43.350> tanks<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.950> this

breath he will do a Conal breath attack

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189 
breath he will do a Conal breath attack
so<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.910> will<00:00:51.030> hit<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.449> current<00:00:51.780> tank<00:00:52.020> of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
so it will hit the current tank of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.770 
so it will hit the current tank of
course<00:00:52.670> plus<00:00:53.670> anyone<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.300> happens<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.719> in

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
can turn the boss during it and you know

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090 
can turn the boss during it and you know

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
face them away from anybody that might

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.789 
face them away from anybody that might
be<00:01:08.280> getting<00:01:08.490> hit<00:01:08.640> by<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> first<00:01:09.030> ticker<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
be getting hit by the first ticker to

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.140 
be getting hit by the first ticker to
the<00:01:10.799> other<00:01:10.920> big<00:01:11.159> important<00:01:11.790> note<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the other big important note is that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.270 
the other big important note is that
necrotic<00:01:12.540> breath<00:01:12.840> does<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.320> lot<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.590> damage<00:01:13.950> on

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
necrotic breath does a lot of damage on

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.170 
necrotic breath does a lot of damage on
the<00:01:14.369> tank<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.560> while<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.830> active<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:18.030> will

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the tank and while it is active it will

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.090 
the tank and while it is active it will
reduce<00:01:18.330> all<00:01:18.750> healing<00:01:19.140> effects<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> tank

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
reduce all healing effects on the tank

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.840 
reduce all healing effects on the tank
by<00:01:20.280> 99<00:01:20.520> percent<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.560> means<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.950> for

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
by 99 percent so what this means is for

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.990 
by 99 percent so what this means is for
yourself<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> tank<00:01:25.590> you'll<00:01:25.860> want<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.280> do

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
yourself as a tank you'll want to do

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.249 
yourself as a tank you'll want to do
your<00:01:27.060> best<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.479> make<00:01:27.630> sure<00:01:27.750> your<00:01:27.900> health<00:01:28.080> is

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
your best to make sure your health is

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.460 
your best to make sure your health is
topped<00:01:28.500> off<00:01:28.680> before<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> breath<00:01:29.430> hits<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
topped off before the breath hits and

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.690 
topped off before the breath hits and
not<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.650> afraid<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.009> use<00:01:32.130> any<00:01:32.250> personal

boss this is particularly important if
you're<00:01:37.799> transitioning<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.420> you

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you're transitioning and you just you

eater which we'll talk about in a moment
the<00:01:45.540> next<00:01:45.840> mechanic<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.409> rot<00:01:46.770> which<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the next mechanic is rot which is the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.539 
the next mechanic is rot which is the
main<00:01:48.030> tank<00:01:48.509> swap<00:01:48.810> mechanic<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
main tank swap mechanic and as a

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.819 
main tank swap mechanic and as a
standard<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.270> stacks<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.500> current

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
standard it stacks up on the current

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.429 
standard it stacks up on the current
tank<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.329> you'll<00:01:54.329> want<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> swap<00:01:54.810> around<00:01:55.079> four

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
tank and you'll want to swap around four

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.649 
tank and you'll want to swap around four
or<00:01:55.470> five<00:01:56.100> stacks<00:01:56.460> seems<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.299> pretty<00:01:57.450> good

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
or five stacks seems to be pretty good

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.310 
or five stacks seems to be pretty good
number<00:01:58.430> just<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.670> wary<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.750> tank<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
number just be wary that the tank that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.880

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
mushroom rejuvenating also is very

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.860 
mushroom rejuvenating also is very
beneficial<00:05:19.930> in<00:05:20.410> this<00:05:20.530> case<00:05:20.770> it<00:05:21.100> will<00:05:21.280> heal

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
important for tanks to be inside it but

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.570 
important for tanks to be inside it but
you<00:05:31.330> do<00:05:31.540> need<00:05:31.720> to<00:05:31.780> pull<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.260> creatures<00:05:32.620> nearby

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580

you do need to pull the creatures nearby
these<00:05:33.820> mushrooms<00:05:34.240> just<00:05:34.690> like<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.960> living<00:05:35.230> so

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
these mushrooms just like the living so

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.800 
these mushrooms just like the living so
that<00:05:36.130> your<00:05:36.490> raid<00:05:36.700> can<00:05:37.000> benefit<00:05:37.540> from<00:05:37.570> the
