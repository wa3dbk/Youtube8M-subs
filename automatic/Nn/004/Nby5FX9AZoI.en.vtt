00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.120
 Welcome to the duel of 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.020
 table neighbors in neustadt where the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.309
 blues hit the sharks hamburg 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.320
 The hosts stormed into the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.450
 especially Michaela Klauß 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.250
 Berkenhagen was hot and I mean 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.960
 glowing hot here sat down soon 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.180
 against three defenders and scores 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.020
 acrobatic under the basket 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.100
 then relocated his game 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.990
 outside and meets three three 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.210
 one behind the other the last of almost 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.130
 outside the hall effect hook good 13 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.539
 points in eight minutes of play time why 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.119
 it was no longer you can only guess 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.920
 1928 leads neustadt and the Schalke 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.870
 First of all a time to recover 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.270
 that works at least for bernhard 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.309
 holzner priority what you can I can 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.379
 better michael first brisk from the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.030
 then run the offensive rebound just around 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.770
 to clarify the threesome 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.940
 compensation 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.079
 Holsten makes eight of his nine points in the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 first quarter and takes care of the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.550
 In addition, six picked up 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.559
 rebounds and two blocks from the second 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.239
 quarter then barak salami provided for the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.190
 first tour of the hamburger in this 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.510
 game 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.000
 but we will come back to him again 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.440
 here is roger perret from the basket im 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.930
 third quarter then runs another 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.060
 at the new cities 1 kevin matthias 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.040
 Chic takes 13 3 throughout the game and 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.920
 give away 5 for a strong 19 points of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.659
 the bank near hamburg takes over christoph 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.909
 from the responsibility and sport betrayed 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.950
 slave that is simply too easy 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.320
 He makes eleven points , got five rebounds 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.700
 and five assists 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.080
 on the other side of the field 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.820
 matthias send on his message and 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.460
 punished every half inch too much 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.900
 place directly by three in the following 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.979
 attack you see why is that good 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.900
 to know exactly the boards 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.670
 TTG let the ball from the blue 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.860
 Foam of the bottom edge of the board 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.520
 after reverse lab in the basket I have 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.960
 not seen yet 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.960
 here again to enjoy 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.729
 A man has a very fine hand 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.590
 samuel one on neustädter side too 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.939
 tobacco costs christofer from beau im 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.909
 full sprint and then close in 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.229
 fall off but hamburg plays in the fourth 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.970
 quarter strong and gets through the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.710
 design by christopher von deylen der 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.100
 again against three defenders completes 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.759
 a three-point lead 2.3 seconds 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.759
 on the clock 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.400
 so now command back the clock 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.630
 we ran in the night at 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.840
 insinger gets the ball 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.310
 the pack for 3 so everything is correct place 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.510
 on 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.730
 in the extension start in neustadt 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.570
 good offensive rebound lukas köhler and 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.640
 lou dissipate 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.940
 but the extension belongs to mubarak 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.490
 salami 23 points strong 15 rebounds and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.750
 5 steals or until then, though only 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.210
 with a 3 on the account 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.950
 but that changes kevin makartsteg 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.970
 uses more of that hamburg 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.950
 apparently still not understood 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.800
 has that can earn and sunk that 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.360
 next 3 tour neustadt 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.650
 but mubarak salami almost wanted to 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.250
 surely she did not think so 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.690
 take 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.430
 he picks up the folder and 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.680
 sunk the threesome with board guidance 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.120
 hamburg also samuel a triumphant 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.940
 absolutely win 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.560
 Only 23 points brought 5 rebounds there 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.650
 seven assists and claus I am cases 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.270
 and shortens here to two points 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.430
 it is enough for another wonder till 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.000
 Tegeler leaves at least the door 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.890
 wide open 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.050
 he rejects two free throws and such 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.880
 Neustadt gets the last chance in the 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.050
 park and find the open shooter 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.290
 the wing matthias piece for the victory 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.080
 No 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.790
 game over hamburg wins the last 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.740
 Throw grades salami and Tegeler still 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.140
 but they do not work together and they do not 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.140
 the game with 83 82 at the sharks
