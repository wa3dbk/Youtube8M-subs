00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.320
 hello today we are going to make a video of 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.480
 New Year's Eve with eyes as well as very 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.100
 smoking that are the keys of makeup 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.040
 first I will show you the hopitals 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.070
 posts I teach to do it in the other eye 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.570
 I hope you like it, let's go with the video 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.279
 I'm going to start by applying the phrase to not 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.500
 ruin after the eyes protagonists 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.390
 of this makeup used the base which 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.250
 me up mascara that combines perfect with 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.529
 the brush expert face brass of real 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.000
 techniques this base is my favorite 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.920
 within the low cost because it leaves 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.149
 a very juicy finish on the skin does not give 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.789
 no fat and has a coverage 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.289
 average high average usually employ the most in 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.359
 summer because it is very liquid and in 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.769
 Winter we prefer more creamy the 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.300
 brush is very compact so it is 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.840
 something difficult to handle but it gives a lot 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.760
 coverage in the bases that you want 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.860
 now let's use an eye test 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.330
 specifically that of chu face my favorite 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.890
 the ones I've tried helps extend 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.489
 better the shadows and that these last 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.489
 all night 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.250
 to fix the makeup and get a 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.410
 powdery finish I will use the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.090
 powder perfect match de l'orel 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.710
 very good it seems that even the pores are 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 shrink after applying them 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.159
 It will also be easier to remove later 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.150
 the waste that remains under the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.150
 eye after painting them 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.490
 let's go with the mess the eyes to see if I 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.439
 I explain well for you to get a 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.640
 perfect formed I start by applying a 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.380
 white shadow on the entire mobile eyelid 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.550
 because later it is easier to extend the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.380
 shadows that we put on top 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.060
 as a second and the three colors of a 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.340
 good smoking requires a shade 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.230
 grayish it pulls a little to lilac it 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.210
 try to mark the end first 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.980
 diagonal line at the end of the eyebrows and 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.600
 the eye socket we only leave it 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.340
 marked with a compact and precise brush 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.500
 in the description you can see the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.970
 brushes that I use with the same shadow 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.650
 Bring a looser brush of hair 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.270
 we are going to extend the lines that we have 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.920
 marked up to get 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.570
 bring the drawing almost to the eyebrows 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.460
 we should blur very well and with 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.290
 patience this is the basis of smoked 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.240
 on which we will later put the shadow 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.440
 Black will give more depth to the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.230
 eye 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.360
 and third color just a very black 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.340
 black now yes we need to be very 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.540
 precise because the black shadow will cover 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.880
 less surface than the gray shadow 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.770
 Previous with a plan and short brush 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.840
 we mark again the diagonal lines of 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.540
 horizontal to important touches of this 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.250
 then we clean the brush and 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.930
 we blur with longer strokes 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.350
 long the eye socket but without getting 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.350
 to tear 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.430
 then we need a pointed brush 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.750
 to slightly extend the stroke 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.090
 previous up getting 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.500
 draw a kind of triangle as I have 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.420
 warned the black shadow requires a lot 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.690
 work blurred and combine brushes 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.850
 different but it will be worth it 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.740
 and now it's just blurring this species 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.180
 of triangle that we have drawn first 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.190
 we use a brush and blending with the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.540
 hair not too long and what we do 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.310
 is to blur the ends with 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.850
 short movements trying to reach 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.850
 the eyebrow 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.040
 then we take a brush also from 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.260
 blurred but with the hairs are more 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.330
 long is a less precise brush 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.310
 is the final touch this human and what 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.200
 will do is mix the white of the eyelid the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.060
 gray of the base and black in the basin 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.760
 the movement is continuous from one side to 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.260
 another without squeezing much the stroke we have 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.140
 finished with the outline of the eye we 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.670
 we fell asleep if you left the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.350
 limit of the diagonal line picks up a 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.510
 stick I gave myself perfection that line 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.459
 external 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.590
 let's now integrate the upper zone 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.209
 of the eye with the lower one using the shadow 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.799
 gray of the umad or in the outer half 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.530
 of the lower lashes and with a 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.269
 flat brush to light the eyelid 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.430
 mobile and accentuate the contrast we take 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.810
 a pearly shadow I'm going to use this 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.819
 of face that is a brown 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.190
 grayish with silver sparkles is 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.080
 beautiful pretty and it's called green and suit 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.910
 for the eye line hits something 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.860
 stylized and this is achieved with a 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.810
 gel eyeliner and an angled brush 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.300
 to not load the eye we draw it 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.190
 horizontal very close to the eyelashes and 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.230
 only in the middle east does the eye go 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.820
 swelling towards the end the trick is 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.740
 draw from outside to inside beginning 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.240
 out of the corner and then with a pencil 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.220
 white we painted the tear 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.350
 light up the look I love this 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.430
 effect on smoky eyes when shooting we are 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.660
 taking a lot but at the same time 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.460
 making sure we get the 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.070
 contrasts that a good smoky needs 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.210
 and we are almost finished with the eyes of the 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.210
 rest of the makeup is a trifle 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.069
 We distribute the white pencil with a 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.069
 Brush 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.470
 finally with the same shade used 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.260
 at the beginning we drew a kind of 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.390
 eyeliner the inner half of the eye 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.940
 and with that same white shadow we illuminate 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.040
 the area under the arch of the eyebrows 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.600
 now he applied some mascara the technique 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.490
 is to bring the tabs towards the end 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.530
 of the eye and insisting with the brush in 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.890
 the tips of them we want some 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.890
 cat eyes 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.710
 and since the eyes are very painted it is not 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.330
 more fill a little the eyebrows this 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.710
 case is of benefit and is very well 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.509
 because it comes with a series with its 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.710
 skewers but a shadow is enough 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.710
 brown and an angled brush 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.490
 we fix the color and comb with a gel 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.719
 of eyebrows as you see thanks to the idea 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.520
 horizontal money and eyelashes 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.150
 stretched to the side we get some 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.310
 cat eyes 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.540
 finished the eyes we covered the area 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.340
 below them with a concealer 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.840
 illuminator because when making the eyes 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.090
 we have removed some makeup with the 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.310
 hand add a triangle and blend with 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.930
 brush this is from l'oréal not what 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.729
 I recommend because there are better 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.740
 to enhance the cheeks and how it does 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.020
 kim kardashian we must outline e 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.430
 illuminate to outline you need a 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.440
 bronzer and a very dense brush and 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.539
 flat draws a diagonal line underneath 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.360
 of the cheek bone diffuses very 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.740
 very well deep down we want something more 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.419
 soft natural make-up kim 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.850
 kardashian which in my opinion is a bit 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.800
 undoubtedly this contour is undoubtedly 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.750
 very good to cheeks without low cheekbones 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.460
 then with the brush towards the neck and 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.590
 finally apply the bronzer on the 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.000
 ends of the forehead reviews this 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.380
 sort of number 3 that we have drawn 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.380
 on each side and list 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.500
 as for the illuminator we go first 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.790
 with the mac see a cream product that 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.650
 I extend with the stepping brush 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.540
 gaztherria techniques perfect for 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.860
 cream textures I apply to touches in 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.340
 the diagonal that goes from the ear to 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.320
 leite of the nose 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.820
 then he emphasized the effect and fixed the 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.650
 anterior illuminator with powders 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.610
 also mac silver dust illuminators 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.889
 applied on cheekbones and nose 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.199
 one of my favorite blushes is down 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.849
 boy of the val mark is a pink chewing gum 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.620
 very soft and something pearly that illuminates 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.360
 very much the small ones and it is very 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.610
 natural I apply it between the diagonals 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.439
 of the illuminator and the bronzer 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.639
 we have the contoured face and this 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:27.990
 it means that we have different 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.909
 volumes that focus the focus of 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.009
 attention on the cheekbones we turn the lip 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:34.169
 with a natural onion pencil this is 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.879
 how will discrete lips go like 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.650
 natural pencils we can get out a 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:41.060
 little and draw something beyond 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.060
 lip line to give volume 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.820
 and to finish, use your 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.490
 lipstick newt preferred mine is 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:52.080
 nix mars and it's called this with you have 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:54.479
 a tone the site does not dry out the lip 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.460
 this is all we get a look very 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.810
 very festive night in which it stands out in 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.139
 the eyes without removing volume in 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.139
 lips 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.740
