00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:14.880
 and it does that not only in doing it the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.220
 Once you have been very busy but already already 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.780
 no longer they deserve further explanation 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.080
 they deserve more videos and what I'm going to 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.180
 do 39 now in trying I'm going to go up 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.330
 another video apart from this one so already 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.490
 you know 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.020
 and good moving by following with the 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.730
 chapter we got a strong of 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.280
 Colombia there also let her wait 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.020
 because I think it's a pretty selection 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.270
 good I find more interesting than the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.730
 of Switzerland is not the Mexican team that 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.699
 would be indicated and we arrived but still 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.269
 so if you feel bad 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.970
 platón so we go to the classic because 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:51.190
 this is the classic is the project 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.680
 che of the classic of football classics 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.210
 Mexican and let's go to the party we have 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.120
 four america holder has four 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.949
 owner and the truth that is going to be going to 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.470
 be difficult the game although it will not 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.629
 be benítez with the america but yes it goes 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.250
 to be game son in law of your sangüesa 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.680
 have a good defense diego battery 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.150
 Kings are going to have the powers and the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.490
 truth is that I felt it 32 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.220
 minutes 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.390
 I feel overwhelmed in America the truth 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.980
 in the prizes 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.890
 I'm not going to take the ball away 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.800
 about 20 minutes and it did not cost work 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.840
 the truth to have a lot of position and 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.610
 verticals with the information of two 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.830
 creative and two forwards caused me 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.710
 a lot of damage the truth caused me damage 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.030
 tremendous 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.520
 and the egg just barely failed and 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.860
 another 20 has with lopez and I do the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.110
 missing but that we lack the truth 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.090
 it seems more need was the headbutt already 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.150
 install and after installing another help 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.960
 arbitral and clear in this the center 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:56.140
 sangüesa diego reyes there is an average goal 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.690
 I like weird and 1-0 to top the goal 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.630
 american have not indicated not what 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.250
 I wanted is the hand be the hand of the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.800
 parent referee and not if I decide missing 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.780
 but lack I did not seem to lack but 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.070
 when there is doubt, they are always like that 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.410
 yellow color what I do not understand and 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.270
 now is what I do not understand a pure 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.000
 true but I knew I had to tie 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.410
 I 'm not going to lose this and sometimes with 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.580
 that goal also the rival team a 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.760
 little bit of iron 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.280
 to the lack of more iron curve will be 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.290
 fabian for again certain until there 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.850

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.010
 gas had been playing well in this 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.590
 when well 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.800
