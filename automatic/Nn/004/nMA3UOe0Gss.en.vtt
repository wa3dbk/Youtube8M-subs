the interviews towards you know the end

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.780 
the interviews towards you know the end
with<00:05:21.660> Daryl's<00:05:22.080> I<00:05:22.380> think<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:23.190> key<00:05:23.370> point<00:05:23.669> here

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
with Daryl's I think the key point here

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.280 
with Daryl's I think the key point here
is<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.150> sum<00:05:24.479> up<00:05:24.630> what<00:05:24.750> you're<00:05:24.870> saying<00:05:25.139> is<00:05:25.260> that

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
is to sum up what you're saying is that

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.310 
is to sum up what you're saying is that
you<00:05:25.620> probably<00:05:25.919> built<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:26.910> most<00:05:27.090> famous<00:05:27.419> metal

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
you probably built the most famous metal

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.560 
you probably built the most famous metal
guitar<00:05:28.740> of<00:05:28.919> all<00:05:29.040> times<00:05:29.370> I<00:05:29.760> can't<00:05:30.240> think<00:05:30.419> of<00:05:30.479> a

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
guitar of all times I can't think of a

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.659 
guitar of all times I can't think of a
guitar<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.930> it's<00:05:31.200> more<00:05:31.350> recognized<00:05:31.950> more

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
guitar that it's more recognized more

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.550 
guitar that it's more recognized more
love<00:05:33.000> more<00:05:33.270> photograph<00:05:33.870> than<00:05:34.080> this<00:05:34.200> cos<00:05:34.380> right

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
love more photograph than this cos right

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.900 
love more photograph than this cos right
that's<00:05:34.710> why<00:05:34.800> we<00:05:34.919> bring<00:05:35.100> it<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.220> trade<00:05:35.550> shows<00:05:35.760> so

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
that's why we bring it to trade shows so

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.640 
that's why we bring it to trade shows so
people<00:05:36.240> could<00:05:36.389> experience<00:05:37.020> I<00:05:37.289> think<00:05:37.350> that's

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
people could experience I think that's

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.900 
people could experience I think that's
how<00:05:37.770> Daryl<00:05:38.100> would<00:05:38.220> like<00:05:38.370> people<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.729> be<00:05:38.820> able

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
how Daryl would like people to be able

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.969 
how Daryl would like people to be able
to<00:05:39.090> see<00:05:39.210> these<00:05:39.330> guitars<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:40.229> guitar<00:05:40.560> under<00:05:40.770> it

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
to see these guitars the guitar under it

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.189 
to see these guitars the guitar under it
was<00:05:41.160> used<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.550> film<00:05:41.789> the<00:05:42.240> song<00:05:42.449> walk<00:05:42.780> that's<00:05:43.050> in

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
was used to film the song walk that's in

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:43.670 
was used to film the song walk that's in
the<00:05:43.289> walk

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
the walk

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.340 
the walk
so<00:05:44.460> anyway<00:05:44.789> buddy<00:05:45.060> created<00:05:45.539> this<00:05:45.630> guitar<00:05:46.050> and

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
so anyway buddy created this guitar and

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.920 
so anyway buddy created this guitar and
I<00:05:46.500> think<00:05:46.830> now<00:05:47.100> here<00:05:47.400> we<00:05:47.520> are<00:05:47.550> fast-forward<00:05:48.330> 25

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
I think now here we are fast-forward 25

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.810 
I think now here we are fast-forward 25
years<00:05:49.169> later<00:05:49.490> technologies<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:50.669> much

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
years later technologies that much

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.560 
years later technologies that much
better<00:05:51.120> this<00:05:51.600> is<00:05:51.780> kind<00:05:52.020> of<00:05:52.080> a<00:05:52.200> 2008<00:05:53.570> rendition

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
better this is kind of a 2008 rendition

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.120 
better this is kind of a 2008 rendition
in<00:05:54.690> some<00:05:54.930> ways<00:05:55.110> have<00:05:55.440> that<00:05:55.620> guitar<00:05:55.919> with<00:05:56.070> the

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
in some ways have that guitar with the

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.430 
in some ways have that guitar with the
top<00:05:56.340> mounted<00:05:56.700> floyd<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.240> so<00:05:57.419> forth<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:58.260> that's

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
top mounted floyd and so forth so that's

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.850 
top mounted floyd and so forth so that's
what<00:05:58.650> this<00:05:58.800> guitar<00:05:59.220> would<00:06:00.000> have<00:06:00.150> been<00:06:00.300> today

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
what this guitar would have been today

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
yeah and that if it would have developed
