00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.210
 the top 5 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.220
 that 's number 5 of the top with that shot 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.070
 very simple minfar 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.220
 one more calculated and one vertex but 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.610
 It was good this good this type 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.130
 number 5 the truth is that in that game 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.600
 they were already there a lot of newbie of many 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.830
 they remembered 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.560
 so if you tell me the clear things 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.659
 that they kill me by cropped new already 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.549
 come down with retro lancia is that's what 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.399
 what's more good for me I'm going we're going to 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.270
 go to number four in the number 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.340
 four we have a lineup done although 15 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.410
 fucking gringo that was putting that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.080
 I kill me I kill myself twice as 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.020
 with a smoke grenade as impute me 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.870
 that in these sniper events do not like 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.370
 as we do not have but an adult who 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.950
 they stick a smoke grenade and you 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.739
 chingaste already kill you but good this 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.519
 Now I got my revenge with this point 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.519
 but I liked it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.900
 at number 38 I bring you a brain was 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.290
 just as I'm leaving the response I'm going 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.990
 in search of my victim and good this 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.790
 also here I do not know if they will remember that 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.819
 departure for which was with cautious enemy 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.190
 this good here I said no I'm going to see 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.020
 see what comes out I go back this bastard and 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.900
 well I see that he shot someone and not 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.569
 gave him details when he fucked whore 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.810
 in front of the bastard the valvular cycle 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.519
 the couple now yes that was reaction of 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.170
 seconds 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.989
 now I did not expect to find me 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.450
 with this bastard the good the worst is that 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.430
 I ran with a bit of luck and now yes 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.620
 to calculate a little more or less 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.350
 also where the race was to 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.830
 I could hit him and well that's how I took out 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.319
 the blind far and the first blood and good 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.540
 in the number two boys I bring you one 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.250
 of my blink of my blind be sorry 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.800
 white see why then here they get 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.569
 princesses who mispronounce the 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.409
 word but good are line farc 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.590
 well this is one of my favorites 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:41.109
 because the mind if it is bastard or not 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.810
 more I suddenly saw the little thing in the 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.510
 queen is and peeping like a pendeja and 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.900
 Well the truth is that now I had 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.230
 to calculate legend and at the distance of 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.120
 the head and as you know to do 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.060
 a horn plan is always in the center 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.030
 of the screen sometimes for so the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.709
 water comes out a little 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.319
 and diverted to the right or to the left 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.190
 not so do not trust that always 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.550
 is going to be in the center the truth 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.270
 sometimes it also depends a lot if 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.940
 You are active because if you are active 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.010
 Look, it does not move so much 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.360
 and if you do not have active your life moves 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.310
 so much what is going to change a bit more the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.820
 direction of the bullet then there's 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.010
 things that do affect the shot 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.790
 you also have to see a bit of luck 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.810
 and other its precision you say that your 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.820
 experience with these shots but good 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.520
 so I leave them guys and I hope they 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.130
 like it good as I do not know if you already saw 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.250
 my mini thesis that I just did 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.560
 smoking humor no more the same as this one 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.790
 more war 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:58.430
 there comes this blind farc in narrowness 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:02.120
 they like it and I leave it to you 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.750
 and good guys like first place I want 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:10.009

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.119
