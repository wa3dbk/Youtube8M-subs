okay<00:01:59.760> so<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.660> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.900> see<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.260> nylon

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
okay so so as you can see the nylon

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.240 
okay so so as you can see the nylon
material<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:02.340> very<00:02:02.970> stretchy<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.250> flexible

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
material is very stretchy and flexible

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.820 
material is very stretchy and flexible
there's<00:02:06.560> a<00:02:07.560> lot<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.430> lot<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.030> movement<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:10.410> is

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
there's a lot of lot of movement and is

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.980 
there's a lot of lot of movement and is
great<00:02:11.100> for<00:02:11.130> sort<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.550> our<00:02:11.700> art<00:02:12.210> projects<00:02:12.870> and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
great for sort of our art projects and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.590 
great for sort of our art projects and
anything<00:02:13.440> any<00:02:13.650> sort<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:13.950> Oz's<00:02:14.460> those<00:02:15.270> types<00:02:15.510> of

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
anything any sort of Oz's those types of

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.540 
anything any sort of Oz's those types of
things<00:02:15.840> really<00:02:16.170> wonderful<00:02:16.710> amounts<00:02:17.430> of

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
things really wonderful amounts of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.440 
things really wonderful amounts of
stretch<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.600> give<00:02:18.900> these<00:02:20.090> really<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.210> very

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
stretch and give these really is a very

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.080 
stretch and give these really is a very
great<00:02:21.780> great<00:02:22.590> material<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.160> prove<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:26.090> even

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
great great material to prove it even

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.230 
great great material to prove it even
the<00:02:27.390> sort<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.960> double<00:02:28.230> wall<00:02:28.380> thickness<00:02:29.240> pots

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
the sort of double wall thickness pots

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.420 
the sort of double wall thickness pots
very<00:02:30.990> stretchy<00:02:31.410> very<00:02:31.770> squishy<00:02:34.430> obviously

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
very stretchy very squishy obviously

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.570 
very stretchy very squishy obviously
that<00:02:35.580> makes<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.970> slightly<00:02:37.370> slightly<00:02:38.370> more

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
that makes it slightly slightly more

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.810 
that makes it slightly slightly more
flexible<00:02:39.120> than<00:02:39.300> an<00:02:39.600> abs<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.290> PLA<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.730> you've

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
flexible than an abs and PLA so you've

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.710 
flexible than an abs and PLA so you've
got<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.000> be<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> little<00:02:42.240> careful<00:02:42.390> when

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
got to be a little careful when

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.050 
got to be a little careful when
designing<00:02:43.080> mechanical<00:02:43.770> parts<00:02:44.130> structural

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
designing mechanical parts structural

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.980 
designing mechanical parts structural
parts<00:02:45.740> but<00:02:46.740> for<00:02:46.950> anything<00:02:47.160> sort<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.750> want

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
parts but for anything sort of you want

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.990 
parts but for anything sort of you want
to<00:02:49.170> have<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.380> bit<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.709> give<00:02:49.950> any<00:02:50.400> sort<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.730> fabric

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
to have a bit of give any sort of fabric

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.160 
to have a bit of give any sort of fabric
type<00:02:51.480> materials<00:02:52.110> or<00:02:52.350> stretchy<00:02:53.280> materials

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
type materials or stretchy materials

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:19.730 
type materials or stretchy materials
it's<00:02:55.170> really<00:02:55.470> wonderful<00:02:55.950> for<00:02:56.100> now

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.530 

I'm<00:03:20.740> going<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:20.980> do<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.130> quick<00:03:21.610> destruction<00:03:22.270> test

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
I'm going to do a quick destruction test

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.670 
I'm going to do a quick destruction test
on<00:03:22.810> some<00:03:23.740> PLA<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.670> printed<00:03:25.360> nylon<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:26.440> is

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
on some PLA and printed nylon this is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.370 
on some PLA and printed nylon this is
the<00:03:27.670> nylon<00:03:28.090> 6<00:03:28.330> 1<00:03:28.480> 8<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:31.030> just<00:03:31.380> some

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
the nylon 6 1 8 and this is just some

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.520 
the nylon 6 1 8 and this is just some
PLA<00:03:32.770> and<00:03:33.810> just<00:03:34.810> show<00:03:34.960> you<00:03:34.990> the<00:03:35.140> difference

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
PLA and just show you the difference

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.830 
PLA and just show you the difference
between<00:03:35.650> sort<00:03:36.490> of<00:03:36.580> flexibility<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.660> the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
between sort of flexibility and the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.120 
between sort of flexibility and the
strength<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.320> get<00:03:38.470> with<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.830> two<00:03:39.010> different

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
strength you get with the two different

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.170 
strength you get with the two different
materials<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:41.080> first<00:03:41.320> of<00:03:41.440> all<00:03:41.790> let's<00:03:42.790> destroy

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
materials so first of all let's destroy

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.080 
materials so first of all let's destroy
the<00:03:43.770> PLA<00:03:44.770> should<00:03:45.220> be<00:03:45.370> fairly<00:03:45.700> straightforward

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
the PLA should be fairly straightforward

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.090 
the PLA should be fairly straightforward
fairly<00:03:46.630> easy<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:49.350> we<00:03:50.350> can<00:03:50.500> actually<00:03:50.650> stretch

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
fairly easy so we can actually stretch

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.740 
fairly easy so we can actually stretch
it<00:03:51.280> quite<00:03:51.490> well<00:03:52.800> it<00:03:53.800> starts<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.510> give<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.540> little

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
it quite well it starts to give a little

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.630 
it quite well it starts to give a little
bit<00:03:57.570> takes<00:03:58.570> quite<00:03:58.810> a<00:03:58.870> bit<00:03:58.930> to<00:03:59.110> destroy<00:03:59.680> this<00:04:00.250> is

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.140 

two<00:04:03.640> perimeters<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:05.160> three<00:04:06.160> solid<00:04:06.730> layers<00:04:06.910> of

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
two perimeters and three solid layers of

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.510 
two perimeters and three solid layers of
popper<00:04:09.240> okay<00:04:10.240> so<00:04:10.800> that's<00:04:11.800> sort<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.040> destroyed

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
popper okay so that's sort of destroyed

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.720 
popper okay so that's sort of destroyed
that's<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.390> bit<00:04:16.380> shatters<00:04:17.380> it's<00:04:18.190> pretty<00:04:18.400> strong

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
that's a bit shatters it's pretty strong

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.590 
that's a bit shatters it's pretty strong
it's<00:04:18.940> good<00:04:19.120> good<00:04:19.150> layer<00:04:19.859> lamination<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.600> no

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
it's good good layer lamination and no

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.260 
it's good good layer lamination and no
real<00:04:22.810> problems<00:04:23.140> there<00:04:23.380> so<00:04:24.000> it's<00:04:25.000> quite<00:04:25.210> a

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
real problems there so it's quite a

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.800 
real problems there so it's quite a
strong<00:04:25.510> hard<00:04:25.810> material<00:04:27.270> okay<00:04:28.270> now<00:04:28.660> we're

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
strong hard material okay now we're

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.250 
strong hard material okay now we're
going<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:28.960> try<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.340> nylon<00:04:30.340> 6<00:04:30.550> 1<00:04:30.700> 8<00:04:30.990> now<00:04:31.990> we<00:04:32.020> can

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
going to try the nylon 6 1 8 now we can

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.860 
going to try the nylon 6 1 8 now we can
see<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:33.000> this<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.150> lot<00:04:34.330> more<00:04:34.360> flexible

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.900 

it's<00:04:37.870> still<00:04:38.050> cracking<00:04:38.320> over<00:04:38.680> there<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:39.100> think

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
it's still cracking over there I think

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.850 
it's still cracking over there I think
that's<00:04:40.060> just<00:04:40.270> as<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:41.220> no-slip<00:04:42.220> gives<00:04:42.490> them

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
that's just as the no-slip gives them

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.770 
that's just as the no-slip gives them
okay<00:04:44.860> so<00:04:44.919> I'm<00:04:45.160> gonna<00:04:45.250> try<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:45.730> turn<00:04:46.540> it<00:04:46.660> inside

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
okay so I'm gonna try and turn it inside

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.600 
okay so I'm gonna try and turn it inside
out<00:04:46.960> so<00:04:47.350> I<00:04:47.860> can<00:04:48.100> get<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.370> cracking<00:04:48.820> a<00:04:48.880> bit<00:04:50.610> it's

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
out so I can get it cracking a bit it's

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.440 
out so I can get it cracking a bit it's
pretty<00:04:51.850> good<00:04:53.880> okay<00:04:54.880> enough<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.300> some

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
pretty good okay enough to you some

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.380 
pretty good okay enough to you some
tools

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:15.360 

oh<00:05:11.820> okay<00:05:12.820> we<00:05:13.180> got<00:05:13.330> bit<00:05:13.890> finally<00:05:14.890> got<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.100> bit<00:05:15.280> of

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
oh okay we got bit finally got a bit of

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.420 
oh okay we got bit finally got a bit of
delamination<00:05:15.580> there<00:05:16.380> so<00:05:17.380> it<00:05:17.500> tears<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:21.340> you

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
delamination there so it tears and you

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.650 
delamination there so it tears and you
have<00:05:21.550> to<00:05:21.640> pull<00:05:21.820> it<00:05:21.850> pretty<00:05:22.120> hard

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
have to pull it pretty hard

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:36.510 
have to pull it pretty hard
this<00:05:23.650> was<00:05:23.830> printed<00:05:24.070> out<00:05:25.050> 235<00:05:26.050> degrees<00:05:26.500> C<00:05:35.520> the

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
this was printed out 235 degrees C the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.600 
this was printed out 235 degrees C the
actual<00:05:36.850> printed<00:05:37.360> parts<00:05:38.070> actually<00:05:39.070> gonna<00:05:39.430> be

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
actual printed parts actually gonna be

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.120 
actual printed parts actually gonna be
impossible<00:05:39.850> to<00:05:40.120> break<00:05:40.360> that<00:05:44.730> stretches<00:05:45.730> but

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
impossible to break that stretches but

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.050 
impossible to break that stretches but
it's<00:05:48.130> gonna<00:05:48.310> be<00:05:48.400> very<00:05:48.640> difficult

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
it's gonna be very difficult

00:05:49.060 --> 00:06:01.020 
it's gonna be very difficult
break<00:05:49.240> that<00:05:58.110> yeah<00:05:59.110> sure<00:05:59.830> no<00:06:00.520> it<00:06:00.640> sure<00:06:00.820> that

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
break that yeah sure no it sure that

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.580 
break that yeah sure no it sure that
would<00:06:01.180> tear<00:06:01.540> it<00:06:03.720> maybe<00:06:04.720> twist<00:06:05.050> it<00:06:05.230> oh<00:06:05.350> yeah

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
would tear it maybe twist it oh yeah

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.580 
would tear it maybe twist it oh yeah
twist<00:06:06.070> you<00:06:06.220> can't<00:06:06.600> just<00:06:09.000> get<00:06:10.000> a<00:06:10.060> little<00:06:10.330> bit

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
twist you can't just get a little bit

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:17.580 
twist you can't just get a little bit
cracking<00:06:11.590> I<00:06:15.330> think<00:06:16.330> it<00:06:16.420> probably<00:06:16.750> any<00:06:17.470> way

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
cracking I think it probably any way

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.360 
cracking I think it probably any way
you're<00:06:17.710> gonna<00:06:17.800> do<00:06:18.010> that<00:06:18.040> is<00:06:18.250> by<00:06:18.400> cutting<00:06:19.330> it

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
you're gonna do that is by cutting it

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.730 
you're gonna do that is by cutting it
and<00:06:21.370> then<00:06:21.550> you<00:06:21.610> can<00:06:21.790> pull<00:06:22.150> there<00:06:22.650> there's<00:06:23.650> a

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
and then you can pull there there's a

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.010 
and then you can pull there there's a
pot<00:06:24.010> still<00:06:24.610> quick<00:06:24.820> tricky

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:34.530 

maybe<00:06:32.580> no<00:06:33.580> that's<00:06:33.880> not<00:06:34.030> gonna<00:06:34.150> break<00:06:34.330> it

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
maybe no that's not gonna break it

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.530 
maybe no that's not gonna break it
okay<00:06:35.530> so<00:06:36.120> then<00:06:37.120> maybe<00:06:39.060> maybe<00:06:40.060> the<00:06:40.210> only<00:06:40.330> way<00:06:40.480> to

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
okay so then maybe maybe the only way to

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.400 
okay so then maybe maybe the only way to
do<00:06:40.810> this<00:06:40.960> is<00:06:41.200> to<00:06:41.380> cut<00:06:41.680> into<00:06:41.890> it<00:06:43.050> see<00:06:44.050> if<00:06:44.140> I<00:06:44.260> can

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
do this is to cut into it see if I can

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.260 
do this is to cut into it see if I can
tear<00:06:44.710> across

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.920 

yeah<00:06:50.270> it's<00:06:50.660> gonna<00:06:50.810> tear<00:06:52.420> okay<00:06:53.420> so<00:06:53.480> you<00:06:53.690> come<00:06:53.900> to

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
yeah it's gonna tear okay so you come to

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.570 
yeah it's gonna tear okay so you come to
a<00:06:54.170> tear<00:06:54.560> a<00:06:54.590> nylon<00:06:55.090> it<00:06:56.090> is<00:06:56.210> quite<00:06:56.510> tricky<00:06:56.840> to<00:06:57.580> its

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
a tear a nylon it is quite tricky to its

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:07.560 
a tear a nylon it is quite tricky to its
breaking<00:06:58.940> this<00:06:59.210> own<00:06:59.420> without<00:06:59.720> that<00:07:00.080> first<00:07:00.350> cut

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.920 

no<00:07:08.570> that's<00:07:08.870> pretty<00:07:09.020> good<00:07:09.200> material<00:07:10.780> nice<00:07:11.780> and

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
no that's pretty good material nice and

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.530 
no that's pretty good material nice and
flexible<00:07:12.260> nice<00:07:12.890> and<00:07:13.070> strong<00:07:13.310> and<00:07:16.540> the

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
flexible nice and strong and the

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:25.540 
flexible nice and strong and the
delamination<00:07:17.810> then<00:07:20.350> of<00:07:21.350> the<00:07:21.560> mayor's<00:07:24.550> only

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
delamination then of the mayor's only

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.980 
delamination then of the mayor's only
really<00:07:25.760> happens<00:07:26.090> when<00:07:26.240> your<00:07:26.360> very<00:07:26.570> very<00:07:26.780> low

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:26.990 
really happens when your very very low

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.200 
really happens when your very very low
temperatures<00:07:27.580> and<00:07:28.580> even<00:07:28.850> then<00:07:28.970> if<00:07:29.090> you're

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.210 
temperatures and even then if you're

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.850 
temperatures and even then if you're
going<00:07:29.360> at<00:07:29.540> slow<00:07:29.780> speed<00:07:30.140> you<00:07:30.410> can<00:07:30.530> get<00:07:30.650> very

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
going at slow speed you can get very

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.320 
going at slow speed you can get very
good<00:07:30.980> lamination<00:07:33.910> so<00:07:34.910> I<00:07:34.940> think<00:07:35.060> we're<00:07:35.240> going

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330 
good lamination so I think we're going

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.310 
good lamination so I think we're going
to<00:07:35.390> leave<00:07:35.510> it<00:07:35.660> there<00:07:35.750> just<00:07:36.650> gives<00:07:37.370> you<00:07:37.430> an<00:07:37.520> idea

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:38.320 
to leave it there just gives you an idea

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.210 
to leave it there just gives you an idea
strength<00:07:39.320> of<00:07:39.560> the<00:07:41.800> printed<00:07:42.800> six<00:07:43.010> one<00:07:43.160> eight

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.220 
strength of the printed six one eight

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:50.580 
strength of the printed six one eight
nine

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:50.590 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:57.629 

you

00:07:57.629 --> 00:07:57.639 

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:59.699 

you
