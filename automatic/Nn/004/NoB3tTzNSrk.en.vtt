all right this video is going to show
how<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.250> install<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:03.030> four-speed<00:00:03.570> transmission

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
how to install a four-speed transmission

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.919 
how to install a four-speed transmission
out<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.920> an<00:00:05.009> HCC<00:00:05.430> 70<00:00:06.029> or<00:00:06.210> TRX<00:00:06.810> 70<00:00:07.319> or<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.950> CTE<00:00:08.490> or

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
out of an HCC 70 or TRX 70 or a CTE or

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.930 
out of an HCC 70 or TRX 70 or a CTE or
excel<00:00:09.929> or<00:00:10.170> whatever<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.559> got<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.950> P<00:00:11.400> 4-speed

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
excel or whatever you got a P 4-speed

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.009 
excel or whatever you got a P 4-speed
transmission<00:00:11.969> they're<00:00:12.780> all<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> same

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
transmission they're all the same

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:21.349 
transmission they're all the same
basically

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.570 

so<00:00:22.359> once<00:00:23.170> you<00:00:23.289> have<00:00:23.410> your<00:00:23.470> engine<00:00:23.980> all<00:00:24.130> taken

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
so once you have your engine all taken

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.929 
so once you have your engine all taken
apart

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
apart

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.659 
apart
top<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.390> clutch<00:00:26.109> cover<00:00:26.380> and<00:00:26.710> your<00:00:27.310> case<00:00:27.490> is

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
top and clutch cover and your case is

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.460 
top and clutch cover and your case is
split<00:00:28.029> just<00:00:28.270> like<00:00:28.419> so<00:00:28.599> in<00:00:28.720> my<00:00:28.840> case<00:00:28.900> splitting

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
split just like so in my case splitting

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.409 
split just like so in my case splitting
video<00:00:29.770> you're<00:00:30.489> basically<00:00:30.849> ready<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.150> start

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
video you're basically ready to start

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.600 
video you're basically ready to start
going<00:00:31.599> so<00:00:32.290> once<00:00:33.190> you're<00:00:33.370> at<00:00:33.430> this<00:00:33.550> stage

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
going so once you're at this stage

star off just remove this detent arm or
just<00:00:43.600> loosen<00:00:43.989> it<00:00:44.079> a<00:00:44.170> little<00:00:44.199> bit<00:00:44.500> so<00:00:45.040> that<00:00:45.160> you

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
just loosen it a little bit so that you

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.740 
just loosen it a little bit so that you
can<00:00:45.400> so<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.760> spring<00:00:45.970> comes<00:00:46.150> off<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:46.510> you<00:00:46.570> can

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
can so the spring comes off and you can

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.899 
can so the spring comes off and you can
move<00:00:46.930> it<00:00:46.989> out<00:00:47.140> of<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.230> way<00:00:47.519> so<00:00:48.519> go<00:00:48.550> ahead<00:00:48.820> and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
move it out of the way so go ahead and

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.319 
move it out of the way so go ahead and
do<00:00:48.970> that<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.829> also<00:00:50.980> need<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.280> get<00:00:52.120> a<00:00:52.150> plan

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
do that you also need to get a plan
