00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.750
 tremendous at a goal dear friends with 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.160
 you find noob and in this video I will show 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.779
 you what is literate light and how 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.930
 realize it naturally map 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.429
 robin where there is such a magic field 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.500
 impudent Katya is an overview of the enemies 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.610
 just going wild and masking with 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.559
 camouflage net is not what 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.750
 quickly fly feature platoon 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.510
 one flies in one bushes and the other in 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.559
 others and see what happens 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.579
 the light in this game is all literate light 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.760
 decides the outcome of the battle and decides it in 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.690
 any situation be it the end of the battle as if 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.930
 start of the fight 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.550
 the light of men is always a competent light 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.609
 there is a passive light in this one 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.369
 Situations on 75 stand and accordingly 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.930
 don't shine no after shot either 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.060
 just do not shine does not necessarily 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.210
 shoot when you just shine pasibo 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.850
 you can just stand and not shoot 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.990
 so as not to glow iron that is i 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.970
 only on canvas I can afford 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.799
 shoot like this standing in the bushes 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.530
 simultaneously follow hellcat shoot and 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.850
 soup and, in principle, more so begin 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.570
 no business but i have no other 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.750
 there are no tanks with photo masking 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.070
 so Iâ€™m shaking myself 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.930
 a little late realized that . which is 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.030
 there drove the British could me 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.330
 visit when I shot but it was late 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.100
 good opponents later realized it and 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.950
 generally almost poorly reacted 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.170
 on the fact that I was hooked but 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.910
 what gives light first he makes it clear 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.640
 your allies where are the enemies well 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.740
 the same is logical secondly he is dumbfounded 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.900
 adversary because adversary is not 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.000
 understands where it shines if u do not 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.130
 sees goal u don't understand what's needed 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.899
 do he immediately forgets where he went and 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.119
 why did he go as soon as but lights up 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.619
 this light bulb he forget whom 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.090
 shoot what does he even do he 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.030
 starts to rush from the side of the station 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.070
 this trouble toto 48 5 then there it is here 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.680
 I do not know what to do in confusion 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.630
 then forward backwards 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.269
 go for 1 thomas go in there move 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.550
 in they are just going crazy because it 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.880
 the beginning of the battle this card is a robin of course 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.250
 it is clear that this is a barn plan shocked 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.110
 the battle has just begun has passed literally here 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.080
 two and a half minutes almost fiercely 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.940
 20 seconds, I do not have everything after due 80 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:42.670
 that's what light is 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.170
 this is a fundamental change in the battle in our favor 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.450
 you just need to know and be able to 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.720
 shine if the engine line understand 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.860
 what's on your shoulders in a very important 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.200
 the fate of your team and you need 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.390
 correctly highlight not die before 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.310
 time and not fly to the enemy base with 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.410
 shouts shcha guys I will focus all of you 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.860
 piss off and and live literally at the base there 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.900
 seconds 15 you will immediately kill it is not light 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.060
 illiteracy this is not literate 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.790
 light and do not immediately go to the enemy 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.530
 base in order to pick up arthur that is yes 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.450
 surely mrs distract take away and mouth 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.549
 but this is not the first mission you need 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.410
 show where the enemies are you need 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.600
 make it clear how they are leaving to 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.850
 your allies understand but smart allies 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.489
 understand how to act with this 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.310
 separation of rivals and respectively 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.990
 need to highlight in order for your 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.670
 allies 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.110
 handed out a freak and you get 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.980
 additional experience therefore this video 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.190
 I want to urge you 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.770
 play the world correctly and I often 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.900
 I observe that the players simply do not know how 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.790
 I can't shine at all yes I'm here 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.550
 do not really give the tactics of highlighting but I 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.530
 give such small basics and make it clear 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.020
 yet that is competent and that the light 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.300
 Basil sweet sometimes more effective than that 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.830
 light active if we just skated 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.300
 between enemies that is passively possible 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.070
 put the bushes and let not 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.020
 sure to shoot that is fat too 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.760
 par 10 i played i wouldn't shoot because 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.610
 that the shot would have disguised me right away 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.490
 where he masked me more precisely and immediately 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.430
 would have noticed and destroyed 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.400
 so I think all ingenious is simple 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.709
 enough for you to learn it all for yourself 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.900
 of course it's a shame that I am against war 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.180
 Allied forces miss the base but apparently 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.340
 the three of us are having fun there in a circle and here they are 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.990
 base captured base captured therefore 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.260
 this victory and we did not have time for those two 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.210
 classes pick up and with a score of 13 1 we 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.880
 won and fast enough all 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.190
 thanks to competent light i climb video
