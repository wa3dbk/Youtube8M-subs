00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.900
 to make it new we are going to make another 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.900
 face here 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.280
 and now we are going to learn 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.920
 to be the face of joy is very 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.080
 simple is she you know how to do all or 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.590
 at least you know how to look but at 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.850
 you better not know 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.800
 to draw 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.440
 Well, the face of joy is very 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.920
 simple if we have our face 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.550
 our neutral face 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.149
 it's a neutral face let's put it with 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.339
 face of joy in the face of joy 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.339
 it's going to be this we erase the mouth 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.559
 we smile and we put the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.960
 small parentheses two small curves 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.750
 separated from the separate beige line 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.390
 it has to go separate to look like 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.940
 the meat that smiling the meat that is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.860
 bend up 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.660
 that we will continue drawing we can draw 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.400
 this would be the part of the cheeks 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.200
 but good 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:29.670
 this would be a smiling face 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.670
 we can put the eyebrows 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.480
 and so row normally every time 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.760
 we laugh we raise our eyebrows up 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.010
 you know as if we were sad but 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.910
 it's not joy right now 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.910
 those eyebrows 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.400
 we can place those eyebrows in two 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.970
 ways or up 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.970
 or 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.490
 place them well apart from the eye 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.009
 and so 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.429
 in this way we have a face that smiles 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.849
 he is very happy that he is very happy and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.640
 He is over with wide eyes 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:17.459
 being happy that's a way now 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:22.990
 well we can give greater happiness to the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:26.790
 face without looking at the eyes if I now 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:31.019
 I put a line like that in my eyes 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.510
 with the eye on the face is even more 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.790
 happy sees her 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.630
 because I've put a little bit of 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.750
 meat plugging 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.580
 and some lines covering the eye but it's 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.580
 on top you can also reach and make it 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.800
 even happier if instead of eyes and 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.700
 I have 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.620
 single 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.670
 the lines 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.140
 of the eyes nothing else like that is already happy and 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.740
 very happy 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.590
 all right 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.920
 You see happy and very happy now what 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.160
 next thing we're going to do when we clear the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.160
 face 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.160
 is that through this smile we are going to 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.440
 change 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.590
 you all know how to make happiness we cagamos 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.720
 to see I just just reminded you 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.800
 now well inside if we have our 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.800
 eyes and happy face 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.239
 smile let's transform this face into 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.239
 a villain smile
