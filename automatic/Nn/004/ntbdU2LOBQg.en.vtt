want<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:53.729> claymores<00:01:54.320> covering<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.530> ass

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
want to have claymores covering your ass

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.840 
want to have claymores covering your ass
and<00:01:56.540> a<00:01:57.540> state<00:01:58.009> you'd<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.250> would<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> great

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and a state you'd think would be a great

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.749 
and a state you'd think would be a great
map<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.420> air<00:02:00.810> spore<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
map for air spore and it is for the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.840 
map for air spore and it is for the
unmanned<00:02:03.350> air<00:02:04.350> support<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.280> Harrier

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
unmanned air support like the Harrier

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.760 
unmanned air support like the Harrier
it's<00:02:06.090> gonna<00:02:06.240> be<00:02:06.390> great<00:02:06.689> for<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.110> because<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it's gonna be great for that because the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.589 
it's gonna be great for that because the
Harrier<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.310> shoot<00:02:08.489> around<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.060> get

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
Harrier is going to shoot around and get

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.990 
Harrier is going to shoot around and get
kills<00:02:09.869> obviously<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> chopper<00:02:11.640> gunner

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
kills obviously but the chopper gunner

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.490 
kills obviously but the chopper gunner
is<00:02:12.150> actually<00:02:12.750> not<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:12.989> good

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
is actually not that good

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.010 
is actually not that good
for<00:02:13.710> any<00:02:13.890> free-for-all<00:02:14.490> even<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> state<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
for any free-for-all even on a state and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.590 
for any free-for-all even on a state and
the<00:02:16.470> reason<00:02:16.770> being<00:02:17.090> well<00:02:18.090> first<00:02:18.270> I'm<00:02:18.360> gonna<00:02:18.480> go

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
the reason being well first I'm gonna go

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.270 
the reason being well first I'm gonna go
into<00:02:18.810> why<00:02:18.930> most<00:02:19.200> people<00:02:19.470> think<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.800> a

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
into why most people think it is a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.830 
into why most people think it is a
really<00:02:20.610> good<00:02:20.700> kill<00:02:20.940> streak<00:02:21.240> for<00:02:21.420> free-for-all

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
really good kill streak for free-for-all

really good kill streak for free-for-all
a<00:02:21.870> lot<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.080> people<00:02:22.320> think<00:02:22.830> themselves<00:02:22.980> well

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
a lot of people think themselves well

a quick check on this guy and see if

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.210 
a quick check on this guy and see if
he's<00:03:36.150> moved<00:03:36.480> or<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:37.410> I'm<00:03:37.739> gonna<00:03:37.890> be<00:03:38.040> able<00:03:38.100> to

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
he's moved or if I'm gonna be able to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.190 
he's moved or if I'm gonna be able to
get<00:03:38.370> him<00:03:38.610> because<00:03:39.150> he<00:03:39.360> seemed<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:39.959> the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
get him because he seemed like the

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.080 
get him because he seemed like the
closest<00:03:40.769> threat<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:42.739> then<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:44.130> hear<00:03:44.640> my<00:03:44.880> claim

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
closest threat and then I hear my claim

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.690 
closest threat and then I hear my claim
will<00:03:45.209> go<00:03:45.299> off<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.140> see<00:03:46.290> this<00:03:46.440> guy<00:03:46.650> run<00:03:47.190> right

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
will go off and I see this guy run right

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.479 
will go off and I see this guy run right
past<00:03:47.880> me<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.750> pick<00:03:49.019> up<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.350> kill<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.370> got

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
past me so I pick up that kill and I got

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.250 
past me so I pick up that kill and I got
pretty<00:03:50.760> lucky<00:03:50.880> because<00:03:51.090> he<00:03:51.510> shot<00:03:51.720> my<00:03:51.900> Claymore

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
pretty lucky because he shot my Claymore

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.539 
pretty lucky because he shot my Claymore
and<00:03:52.470> if<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.650> didn't<00:03:52.860> hear<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.130> claim<00:03:53.280> would<00:03:53.430> go

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
and if I didn't hear the claim would go

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.120 
and if I didn't hear the claim would go
off<00:03:53.730> I<00:03:53.970> probably<00:03:54.470> might<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:55.650> ended<00:03:55.860> up<00:03:55.890> dying

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
off I probably might have ended up dying

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.990 
off I probably might have ended up dying
from<00:03:56.400> him<00:03:56.579> so<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.450> get<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.380> talk<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:58.680> Bill<00:03:58.799> new<00:03:59.000> 25

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
from him so I get to talk to Bill new 25

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.569 
from him so I get to talk to Bill new 25
kills<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:01.290> decided<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.799> instead<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.459> just

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
kills and I decided that instead of just

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.670 
kills and I decided that instead of just
crawling<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.150> in<00:04:03.269> what<00:04:03.450> right<00:04:03.810> away<00:04:04.049> I'm<00:04:04.590> going

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
crawling it in what right away I'm going

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.310 
crawling it in what right away I'm going
to<00:04:05.130> take<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:05.760> opportunity<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.930> try<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:07.200> get

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
to take this opportunity to try and get

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.770 
to take this opportunity to try and get
a<00:04:07.350> couple<00:04:07.650> more<00:04:07.769> kills<00:04:08.299> because<00:04:09.299> I've<00:04:09.450> gotten

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
a couple more kills because I've gotten

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.750 
a couple more kills because I've gotten
maybe<00:04:10.350> four<00:04:10.650> or<00:04:10.680> five<00:04:10.769> tactical<00:04:11.370> nukes<00:04:11.610> not<00:04:11.730> a

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
maybe four or five tactical nukes not a

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.259 
maybe four or five tactical nukes not a
free-for-all

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
free-for-all

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.120 
free-for-all
but<00:04:12.660> I've<00:04:12.900> always<00:04:13.079> called<00:04:13.769> them<00:04:13.860> in<00:04:13.950> right

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
but I've always called them in right

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.539 
but I've always called them in right
away<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:14.640> this<00:04:15.269> is<00:04:15.480> just<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.549> ridiculously

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
away and this is just so ridiculously

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.729 
away and this is just so ridiculously
weird<00:04:17.940> but<00:04:18.540> I've<00:04:18.660> never<00:04:18.989> gotten<00:04:19.410> more<00:04:19.680> than

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
weird but I've never gotten more than

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.990 
weird but I've never gotten more than
thirty<00:04:20.070> kills<00:04:21.830> it's<00:04:22.830> very<00:04:23.099> weird<00:04:23.340> because<00:04:23.580> I

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
thirty kills it's very weird because I

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.060 
thirty kills it's very weird because I
know<00:04:24.390> if<00:04:24.660> somebody<00:04:25.050> dies<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.349> they're

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
know if somebody dies and they're

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.450 
know if somebody dies and they're
watching<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.490> killcam<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:27.180> new

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
watching the killcam and the new

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.240 
watching the killcam and the new
it<00:04:28.060> doesn't<00:04:28.389> count<00:04:28.509> as<00:04:28.660> my<00:04:28.780> kill<00:04:29.020> and<00:04:29.319> some<00:04:30.130> of

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
it doesn't count as my kill and some of

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.760 
it doesn't count as my kill and some of
them<00:04:30.400> have<00:04:30.840> it's<00:04:31.840> just<00:04:32.080> really<00:04:32.289> weird

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
them have it's just really weird

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.129 
them have it's just really weird
I've<00:04:33.430> never<00:04:33.639> gotten<00:04:33.910> more<00:04:34.090> than<00:04:34.240> 30<00:04:34.419> kills<00:04:34.690> so

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
I've never gotten more than 30 kills so

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.980 
I've never gotten more than 30 kills so
I<00:04:35.169> wanted<00:04:35.500> to<00:04:35.590> do<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.330> take<00:04:37.720> I

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
I wanted to do that so I take I

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.939 
I wanted to do that so I take I
basically<00:04:38.500> just<00:04:38.800> use<00:04:38.979> my<00:04:39.190> same<00:04:39.400> strategy<00:04:40.949> and

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
basically just use my same strategy and

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.040 
basically just use my same strategy and
what<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.639> got<00:04:42.759> to<00:04:42.880> do<00:04:42.970> is<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.360> can't<00:04:43.599> just<00:04:43.840> let

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
what you got to do is you can't just let

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.350 
what you got to do is you can't just let
the<00:04:44.319> like<00:04:45.009> now<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.550> have<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:45.910> nuke<00:04:46.090> or

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
the like now that you have the nuke or

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.430 
the like now that you have the nuke or
now<00:04:46.479> that<00:04:46.630> you're<00:04:46.810> building<00:04:46.990> up<00:04:47.169> a<00:04:47.229> really

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
now that you're building up a really

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.680 
now that you're building up a really
long<00:04:47.889> kill<00:04:48.220> streak<00:04:48.520> and<00:04:48.789> this<00:04:49.240> goes<00:04:49.419> for<00:04:49.569> any

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
long kill streak and this goes for any

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.420 
long kill streak and this goes for any
game<00:04:49.930> type<00:04:50.139> you<00:04:50.680> know<00:04:50.770> when<00:04:50.919> I<00:04:50.949> really<00:04:51.310> get

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
game type you know when I really get

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.089 
game type you know when I really get
cocky<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.330> think<00:04:52.870> is<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.050> best<00:04:53.229> word<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:54.009> don't

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
cocky I think is the best word you don't

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.070 
cocky I think is the best word you don't
want<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.370> get<00:04:54.490> really<00:04:54.699> ambitious<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.509> try<00:04:56.020> to

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
want to get really ambitious and try to

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.140 
want to get really ambitious and try to
just<00:04:56.259> run<00:04:56.500> out<00:04:56.650> there<00:04:56.889> and<00:04:57.099> get<00:04:57.729> all<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:57.940> kills

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
just run out there and get all the kills

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.640 
just run out there and get all the kills
that<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.360> can<00:04:58.599> because<00:04:59.199> that's<00:04:59.380> probably

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
that you can because that's probably

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.610 
that you can because that's probably
gonna<00:04:59.800> end<00:04:59.860> up<00:05:00.099> with<00:05:00.250> you<00:05:00.370> dying<00:05:00.639> so<00:05:01.479> I<00:05:01.780> you
