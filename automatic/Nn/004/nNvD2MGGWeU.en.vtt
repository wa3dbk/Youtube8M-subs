00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.959
 the side of good I am reynaldinho messenger of god 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.689
 I would like to share them with you 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.619
 that which is written in English, and the two verses 10 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.839
 life is like everything I want in my eyes I did not see the limits 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.240
 and do not foresee my heart of some joy 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.680
 but my heart rejoices in the fruit of my labor. 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.030
 this was my position in my work 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.060
 and scout for all the works that have made my hands 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.370
 as also 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.210
 work that working error had done 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.980
 since then it will have validity and attention. 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.880
 under the sun 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.200
 I speak here one moment on a regular basis and the third I try in the real 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.970
 40 years old 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.960
 your heart in your hand 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.190
 one of the wisest men 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.620
 fiorina face of the earth 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.000
 and Solomon 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.640
 he the next week he 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.430
 he sought meaning in life 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.890
 I think a little 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.430
 a bitter man 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.980
 the governing body 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.670
 a boring man because he said so everything I've done in my life 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.880
 everything was the fastest was will utility 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.680
 and someone here the whole chapter 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.140
 we noticed that Solomon this great leader 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.600
 with great quality 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.960
 he was not surprised 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 in all the things that you can achieve 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.190
 part of this resource Queiroz was the richest man in the world 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.440
 and I say that he was a collector of arts 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.710
 he sought wisdom 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.220
 in the study 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.660
 he made sense in life 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.440
 of sex 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.800
 of the pleasures he sought in the search 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.659
 he for a certain moment he only 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.589
 all in the name of the book 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.589
 he searched the wine in the narcotic 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.090
 and he said yes 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.639
 everything that differentiates the validity 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.869
 It's so hard when we work so hard. 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.959
 we found that 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.739
 our life 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.879
 What we did not make sense 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.090
 and in that great existential emptiness that they were on the bus to fill with 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.569
 something 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.440
 but 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.379
 here the bible says 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.809
 what a loner 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:39.130
 at the very end 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.379
 this book 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.510
 already the book of poetry which means the book of the preacher this preaching of his 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.489
 life 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.209
 he is already here 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.569
 already old 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.409
 he is already here 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.309
 with 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:54.899
 the time 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:56.869
 what happened 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.089
 it's him 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:03.659
 we conclude renew your life he will tell you where the meaning of your life is 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.259
 Chapter 12 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.399
 verse 3 he says so 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:12.219
 of all that has been heard 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.329
 of everything I've learned 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.959
 of everything I've said about my life 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.719
 saucer 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:20.749
 the conclusion is 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:24.079
 tend to God and keep His commandments 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.459
 because this is a duty of the whole world 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.800
 Because god 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.699
 the rear of the renault all the time 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.109
 and even because it is incomplete 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.570
 either be good 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.699
 or whether it is evil 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:43.180
 Solomon he says the following he does not find sense in the things that he 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.939
 I lived beneath the ground beneath the sky. 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.329
 but he discovered that the true meaning of life 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.409
 being here is what created them 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.349
 it's over the sky 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.219
 is above usual 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:57.359
 sense to be integers 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.269
 the true purpose of our life 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.669
 who gave us 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.389
 God was God who created us. 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.400
 and that I'm already thinking of the man's catastrophe 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.859
 your message 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.319
 in which the protagonist and put 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.319
 he already left in restoring the statue 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.000
 he sent Jesus Christ, his son, to everyone who leads me to believe 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.919
 I wanted to understand 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.919
 do not perish but have everlasting life 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.610
 so god he planted eternity in our heart 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.949
 if you seek meaning in your life in what is timeless 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.759
 in what 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.559
 in what the rust goal 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.139
 you will get very frustrated 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.159
 It'll be like putting it in a punched pocket. 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.870
 but if today you should seek your god right 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.169
 and give your life to god 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.490
 delivering your landfill path into trust and accepting God's plan in 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.580
 your life 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.739
 we receive jesus christ you become son of god 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.930
 for this your heart 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.969
 Our life in Paraiba 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:10.839
 God bless 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.349
 I stayed here 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.830
 a part of your ordinances of God's promises
