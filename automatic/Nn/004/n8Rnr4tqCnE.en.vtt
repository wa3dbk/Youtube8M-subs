try<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.360> find<00:00:09.540> out<00:00:09.870> what<00:00:10.290> 1/2<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:11.010> 60<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:13.849> in

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
try and find out what 1/2 of 60 is in

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.800 
try and find out what 1/2 of 60 is in
maths<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.780> means<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.859> multiply<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:18.600> half

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
maths of means to multiply so one half

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.029 
maths of means to multiply so one half
of<00:00:19.020> 60<00:00:19.439> equals<00:00:19.830> one<00:00:20.369> half<00:00:20.609> times<00:00:21.029> 60<00:00:21.920> there<00:00:22.920> are

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
of 60 equals one half times 60 there are

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.830 
of 60 equals one half times 60 there are
two<00:00:23.279> main<00:00:23.460> methods<00:00:23.670> used<00:00:24.180> when<00:00:24.420> finding<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
two main methods used when finding the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
two main methods used when finding the
fraction<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.439> number<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.490> let's<00:00:26.699> try<00:00:26.939> method

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
fraction of a number so let's try method

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.620 
fraction of a number so let's try method
1<00:00:27.510> first<00:00:28.039> in<00:00:29.539> method<00:00:30.539> 1<00:00:31.219> we<00:00:32.219> have<00:00:32.430> 1/2<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.180> 60

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
1 first in method 1 we have 1/2 of 60

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.020 
1 first in method 1 we have 1/2 of 60
which<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.649> said<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.040> equal<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.579> 1/2<00:00:35.969> times<00:00:36.000> 60

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
which we said is equal to 1/2 times 60

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.569 
which we said is equal to 1/2 times 60
the<00:00:39.030> first<00:00:39.300> step<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.780> method<00:00:40.200> 1<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.280> divide

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the first step in method 1 is to divide

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.869 
the first step in method 1 is to divide
the<00:00:41.610> whole<00:00:41.969> number<00:00:42.360> by<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> denominator<00:00:43.879> so

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the whole number by the denominator so

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.709 
the whole number by the denominator so
we<00:00:45.030> now<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.649> 60<00:00:46.760> divided<00:00:47.760> by<00:00:47.879> 2<00:00:50.090> 60<00:00:51.090> divided

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
we now have 60 divided by 2 60 divided

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.920 
we now have 60 divided by 2 60 divided
by<00:00:51.750> 2<00:00:51.899> equals<00:00:52.770> 30<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.879> we<00:00:56.879> now<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
by 2 equals 30 so we now have to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.349 
by 2 equals 30 so we now have to
remember<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.440> numerator<00:00:59.239> because<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
remember the numerator because the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.389 
remember the numerator because the
numerator<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.960> also<00:01:01.320> important<00:01:02.039> than<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.250> this

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
numerator is also important than in this

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.679 
numerator is also important than in this
problem<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> step<00:01:04.680> 2<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.909> multiply<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
problem so step 2 is to multiply the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.719 
problem so step 2 is to multiply the
answer<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.650> step<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.159> by<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> numerator<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
answer from step one by the numerator so

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.660 
answer from step one by the numerator so
30<00:01:11.729> times<00:01:12.540> 1<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.830> equals<00:01:14.250> 30<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> our<00:01:17.400> final

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
30 times 1 which equals 30 so our final

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.170 
30 times 1 which equals 30 so our final
answer<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:20.189> half<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.729> 60<00:01:21.180> equals<00:01:21.630> 30

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
answer is that one half of 60 equals 30

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.120 
answer is that one half of 60 equals 30
now<00:01:24.180> let's<00:01:24.450> try<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> find<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.229> half<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.680> 60

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
now let's try to find one half of 60

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.859 
now let's try to find one half of 60
using<00:01:26.520> method<00:01:26.850> two<00:01:28.400> again<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:29.970> half<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.420> 60

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
using method two again one half of 60

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.690 
using method two again one half of 60
equals<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.920> half<00:01:32.159> times<00:01:32.579> 60<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:35.100> first<00:01:35.400> step

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
equals one half times 60 the first step

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.350 
equals one half times 60 the first step
in<00:01:35.939> method<00:01:36.570> two<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.799> turn<00:01:38.009> 60<00:01:38.549> into<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
in method two is to turn 60 into a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.639 
in method two is to turn 60 into a
fraction<00:01:39.659> by<00:01:40.470> placing<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:41.009> over<00:01:41.159> 1

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
fraction by placing it over 1

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.460 
fraction by placing it over 1
why<00:01:43.649> won't<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.130> ask<00:01:44.689> because<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
why won't you ask because one is the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.889 
why won't you ask because one is the
only<00:01:46.680> number<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.310> when<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.090> divide<00:01:48.270> another

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
only number that when you divide another

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.679 
only number that when you divide another
number<00:01:49.200> by<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.340> number<00:01:50.790> remains<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.390> same

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
number by it the number remains the same

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.719 
number by it the number remains the same
in<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.979> case<00:01:53.420> 60<00:01:54.420> divided<00:01:55.200> by<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.590> equals<00:01:56.250> 60

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
in this case 60 divided by one equals 60

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.810 
in this case 60 divided by one equals 60
if<00:01:57.450> we'd<00:01:58.290> use<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.939> example<00:02:00.829> 60<00:02:01.829> divided<00:02:02.700> by

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
if we'd use to for example 60 divided by

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.459 
if we'd use to for example 60 divided by
2<00:02:02.880> equals<00:02:03.659> 30<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.759> our<00:02:06.090> number<00:02:06.689> would<00:02:07.049> change

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
2 equals 30 so our number would change

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.969 
2 equals 30 so our number would change
and<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.550> want<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.910> know<00:02:09.090> what<00:02:09.479> 1/2<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.200> 60<00:02:10.739> is

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
and we want to know what 1/2 of 60 is

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.500 
and we want to know what 1/2 of 60 is
not<00:02:11.849> one-half<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.629> 30

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
not one-half of 30

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.949 
not one-half of 30
so<00:02:14.170> we<00:02:14.319> use<00:02:14.590> one<00:02:15.629> we<00:02:16.629> now<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:17.250> 1/2<00:02:18.360> times<00:02:19.360> 60

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
so we use one we now have 1/2 times 60

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.660 
so we use one we now have 1/2 times 60
over<00:02:20.440> 1<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:22.599> next<00:02:22.900> step<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:24.040> multiply<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
over 1 the next step is to multiply the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.559 
over 1 the next step is to multiply the
two<00:02:25.030> fractions<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:27.220> multiply<00:02:27.730> fractions<00:02:28.000> we

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
two fractions to multiply fractions we

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.350 
two fractions to multiply fractions we
multiply<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.650> numerator<00:02:30.340> by<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.790> numerator

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
multiply the numerator by the numerator

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.520 
multiply the numerator by the numerator
and<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:32.200> denominator<00:02:32.280> by<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.310> denominator

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
and the denominator by the denominator

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.600 
and the denominator by the denominator
so<00:02:35.940> 1<00:02:36.940> times<00:02:37.209> 60<00:02:38.430> over<00:02:39.430> 2<00:02:39.910> times<00:02:40.360> 1<00:02:41.610> which

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
so 1 times 60 over 2 times 1 which

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:50.880 
so 1 times 60 over 2 times 1 which
equals<00:02:44.099> 60<00:02:45.930> divided<00:02:46.930> by<00:02:47.049> 2<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:48.900> 60<00:02:49.900> divided<00:02:50.769> by

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
equals 60 divided by 2 and 60 divided by

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.800 
equals 60 divided by 2 and 60 divided by
2<00:02:50.970> equals<00:02:51.970> 30<00:02:52.299> as<00:02:53.099> you<00:02:54.099> can<00:02:54.280> see<00:02:54.519> both<00:02:55.209> methods

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
2 equals 30 as you can see both methods

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.349 
2 equals 30 as you can see both methods
give<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.440> same<00:02:56.680> answer<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:58.180> should

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
give you the same answer you should

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.569 
give you the same answer you should
practice<00:02:58.510> both<00:02:58.959> methods<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.680> then<00:03:00.220> decide

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
practice both methods and then decide

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.240 
practice both methods and then decide
which<00:03:01.299> works<00:03:01.629> best<00:03:01.900> for<00:03:02.019> you<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.590> which<00:03:02.980> makes

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
which works best for you and which makes

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.900 
which works best for you and which makes
more<00:03:03.489> sense<00:03:05.489> let's<00:03:06.489> try<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.819> different

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
more sense let's try a different

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.380 
more sense let's try a different
question<00:03:08.099> let's<00:03:09.099> find<00:03:09.400> what<00:03:10.180> 2/3<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:11.079> 24<00:03:11.769> is

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
question let's find what 2/3 of 24 is

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.470 
question let's find what 2/3 of 24 is
let's<00:03:13.390> use<00:03:13.540> method<00:03:14.140> 1<00:03:15.599> 2/3<00:03:16.599> of<00:03:16.889> 24<00:03:17.889> is<00:03:18.480> 2/3

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
let's use method 1 2/3 of 24 is 2/3

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.539 
let's use method 1 2/3 of 24 is 2/3
times<00:03:20.079> 24<00:03:21.690> what<00:03:22.690> do<00:03:22.870> we<00:03:23.019> do<00:03:23.230> first

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.789 

that's<00:03:27.549> right<00:03:27.940> we<00:03:28.630> divide<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.139> whole<00:03:29.410> number

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
that's right we divide the whole number

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.580 
that's right we divide the whole number
by<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.459> denominator<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:32.230> 24<00:03:33.030> divided<00:03:34.030> by<00:03:34.209> 3

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
by the denominator so 24 divided by 3

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:42.300 
by the denominator so 24 divided by 3
and<00:03:36.480> 24<00:03:37.620> divided<00:03:38.620> by<00:03:38.650> 3<00:03:38.819> equals<00:03:39.819> 8<00:03:41.040> what<00:03:42.040> do<00:03:42.190> we

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
and 24 divided by 3 equals 8 what do we

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.000 
and 24 divided by 3 equals 8 what do we
do<00:03:42.489> next<00:03:45.389> that's<00:03:46.389> right<00:03:46.750> we<00:03:47.380> multiply<00:03:47.950> the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
do next that's right we multiply the

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.559 
do next that's right we multiply the
answer<00:03:48.280> 8<00:03:49.060> by<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.750> numerator<00:03:50.319> so<00:03:51.190> 8<00:03:51.489> times<00:03:52.209> 2

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
answer 8 by the numerator so 8 times 2

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:01.500 
answer 8 by the numerator so 8 times 2
which<00:03:53.470> equals<00:03:53.790> 16<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.870> 2/3<00:03:56.440> of<00:03:56.680> 24<00:03:57.669> is<00:03:57.970> 16<00:04:00.510> let's

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
which equals 16 so 2/3 of 24 is 16 let's

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.800 
which equals 16 so 2/3 of 24 is 16 let's
try<00:04:01.780> method<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:03.569> 2/3<00:04:04.569> of<00:04:04.810> 24<00:04:05.709> equals<00:04:06.269> 2/3<00:04:07.269> times

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
try method to 2/3 of 24 equals 2/3 times

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.620 
try method to 2/3 of 24 equals 2/3 times
24<00:04:08.940> what<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.120> we<00:04:10.239> do<00:04:10.419> first

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.250 

that's<00:04:14.320> right<00:04:14.680> we<00:04:15.340> turn<00:04:15.610> 24<00:04:16.300> into<00:04:16.870> a<00:04:16.900> fraction

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
that's right we turn 24 into a fraction

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.380 
that's right we turn 24 into a fraction
by<00:04:17.950> placing<00:04:18.010> it<00:04:18.520> over<00:04:18.700> 1

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
by placing it over 1

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:27.870 
by placing it over 1
we<00:04:20.290> now<00:04:20.440> have<00:04:21.150> 2/3<00:04:22.150> times<00:04:22.930> 24<00:04:23.680> over<00:04:23.920> 1<00:04:26.730> what<00:04:27.730> do

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
we now have 2/3 times 24 over 1 what do

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.710 
we now have 2/3 times 24 over 1 what do
we<00:04:28.000> do<00:04:28.150> next

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.720 

that's<00:04:31.720> right<00:04:32.050> we<00:04:32.770> multiply<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.430> two

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
that's right we multiply the two

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:41.880 
that's right we multiply the two
fractions<00:04:34.680> how<00:04:35.680> do<00:04:35.740> we<00:04:35.950> do<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:40.200> that's<00:04:41.200> right

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
fractions how do we do that that's right

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.310 
fractions how do we do that that's right
we<00:04:42.370> multiply<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:43.030> numerator<00:04:43.690> by<00:04:44.290> the

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
we multiply the numerator by the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.880 
we multiply the numerator by the
numerator<00:04:44.980> and<00:04:45.400> then<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.270> denominator<00:04:46.890> by

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
numerator and then the denominator by

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.150 
numerator and then the denominator by
the<00:04:47.950> denominator<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:50.340> we<00:04:51.340> have<00:04:51.780> 2<00:04:52.780> times<00:04:53.440> 24

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
the denominator so we have 2 times 24

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:02.640 
the denominator so we have 2 times 24
over<00:04:55.530> 3<00:04:56.530> times<00:04:57.160> 1<00:04:57.960> which<00:04:58.960> equals<00:04:59.760> 48<00:05:00.760> over<00:05:01.650> 3

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
over 3 times 1 which equals 48 over 3

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.330 
over 3 times 1 which equals 48 over 3
and<00:05:03.510> 48<00:05:04.510> divided<00:05:05.410> by<00:05:05.560> 3<00:05:06.180> equals<00:05:07.180> 16<00:05:07.980> so<00:05:08.980> again

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
and 48 divided by 3 equals 16 so again

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.720 
and 48 divided by 3 equals 16 so again
we<00:05:10.000> found<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.690> two-thirds<00:05:11.290> of<00:05:11.500> 24<00:05:12.340> is<00:05:12.610> 16

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
we found that two-thirds of 24 is 16

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.510 
we found that two-thirds of 24 is 16
let's<00:05:15.730> try<00:05:16.030> one<00:05:16.270> final<00:05:16.750> question<00:05:17.190> let's<00:05:18.190> find

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
let's try one final question let's find

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.980 
let's try one final question let's find
what<00:05:19.150> 3/4<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.170> 75<00:05:20.980> is<00:05:21.250> if<00:05:22.590> we<00:05:23.590> try<00:05:23.860> method<00:05:24.310> 1<00:05:24.990> we

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
what 3/4 of 75 is if we try method 1 we

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.840 
what 3/4 of 75 is if we try method 1 we
divide<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.740> whole<00:05:26.770> number<00:05:27.400> by<00:05:27.790> the

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
divide the whole number by the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.820 
divide the whole number by the
denominator<00:05:29.070> 75<00:05:30.070> divided<00:05:31.030> by<00:05:31.150> 4<00:05:31.800> does<00:05:32.800> not

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
denominator 75 divided by 4 does not

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.040 
denominator 75 divided by 4 does not
give<00:05:33.250> an<00:05:33.370> answer<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:33.850> is<00:05:34.090> a<00:05:34.120> whole<00:05:34.450> number<00:05:34.720> as

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
give an answer that is a whole number as

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.330 
give an answer that is a whole number as
four<00:05:35.890> is<00:05:36.010> not<00:05:36.160> a<00:05:36.220> factor<00:05:36.340> of<00:05:36.730> 75<00:05:38.220> when<00:05:39.220> the

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
four is not a factor of 75 when the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.550 
four is not a factor of 75 when the
denominator<00:05:39.880> is<00:05:40.090> not<00:05:40.120> a<00:05:40.360> factor<00:05:40.900> of<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.350> whole

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
denominator is not a factor of the whole

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.430 
denominator is not a factor of the whole
number<00:05:41.980> using<00:05:42.970> method<00:05:43.330> one<00:05:43.360> can<00:05:43.870> become<00:05:44.200> quite

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
number using method one can become quite

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.990 
number using method one can become quite
complicated<00:05:45.090> so<00:05:46.090> let's<00:05:46.360> try<00:05:46.690> method<00:05:47.170> two<00:05:48.000> so

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
complicated so let's try method two so

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.450 
complicated so let's try method two so
we<00:05:49.180> have<00:05:50.040> 3/4<00:05:51.040> of<00:05:51.250> 75<00:05:51.910> which<00:05:52.810> equals<00:05:53.380> 3/4<00:05:54.130> times

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
we have 3/4 of 75 which equals 3/4 times

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.010 
we have 3/4 of 75 which equals 3/4 times
75<00:05:55.410> so<00:05:56.410> we<00:05:56.530> make<00:05:56.710> 75<00:05:57.460> a<00:05:57.760> fraction<00:05:58.390> by<00:05:58.990> dividing

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
75 so we make 75 a fraction by dividing

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.100 
75 so we make 75 a fraction by dividing
it<00:05:59.680> by<00:05:59.830> one<00:06:00.960> what<00:06:01.960> do<00:06:02.140> we<00:06:02.260> do<00:06:02.410> next<00:06:04.110> that's

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
it by one what do we do next that's

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.380 
it by one what do we do next that's
right<00:06:05.560> we<00:06:06.250> multiply<00:06:06.850> the<00:06:06.910> fractions<00:06:07.830> so<00:06:09.390> 3

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
right we multiply the fractions so 3

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:18.860 
right we multiply the fractions so 3
times<00:06:11.140> 75<00:06:12.480> over<00:06:13.480> 4<00:06:13.900> times<00:06:14.620> 1<00:06:15.630> so<00:06:16.630> 3<00:06:17.590> times<00:06:17.830> 75

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
times 75 over 4 times 1 so 3 times 75

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.020 
times 75 over 4 times 1 so 3 times 75
equals<00:06:20.100> 225<00:06:21.100> and<00:06:21.790> we<00:06:22.750> place<00:06:23.050> this<00:06:23.320> over<00:06:23.590> 4<00:06:24.580> by<00:06:24.790> 1

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
equals 225 and we place this over 4 by 1

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.300 
equals 225 and we place this over 4 by 1
which<00:06:25.810> equals<00:06:26.020> 4

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
which equals 4

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:35.610 
which equals 4
we<00:06:27.880> now<00:06:28.090> have<00:06:28.980> 225<00:06:30.240> divided<00:06:31.240> by<00:06:31.510> 4<00:06:33.600> 225<00:06:34.620> divided

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
we now have 225 divided by 4 225 divided

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:43.020 
we now have 225 divided by 4 225 divided
