00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
so like I said it's kind of an

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.610 
so like I said it's kind of an
interesting<00:02:29.670> concept<00:02:30.180> we<00:02:30.600> might<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.290> new

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
interesting concept we might have a new

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.800 
interesting concept we might have a new
xbox<00:02:32.190> one<00:02:32.250> coming<00:02:32.640> out<00:02:32.760> but<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.390> almost<00:02:33.660> a

five-hundred-dollar price tag yeah

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.540 
five-hundred-dollar price tag yeah
that's<00:02:37.170> debatable<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:37.890> it's<00:02:38.010> worth<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.400> but

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
that's debatable if it's worth it but

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.070 
that's debatable if it's worth it but
you<00:02:38.670> know<00:02:38.700> if<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.000> fits<00:02:39.180> your<00:02:39.330> needs<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.750> you

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
