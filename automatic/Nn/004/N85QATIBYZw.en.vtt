00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
fry of onions now the Florentine part is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.580 
fry of onions now the Florentine part is
spinach<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.239> we<00:02:30.329> put<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> whole<00:02:30.810> bunch<00:02:30.840> of

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
spinach so we put a whole bunch of

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.350 
spinach so we put a whole bunch of
spinach<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.190> pan<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.849> might<00:02:33.209> look

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
spinach in the pan and it might look

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.420 
spinach in the pan and it might look
like<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.690> pans<00:02:33.959> overflowing<00:02:34.829> but<00:02:34.980> spinach

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
like the pans overflowing but spinach

00:02:35.430 --> 00:03:06.240 
like the pans overflowing but spinach
breaks<00:02:35.730> down<00:02:36.000> very<00:02:36.060> very<00:02:36.659> quickly

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.820 

how<00:03:06.790> about<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:06.970> handful<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.510> chopped<00:03:07.930> garlic<00:03:08.290> of

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
how about a handful of chopped garlic of

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.980 
how about a handful of chopped garlic of
course<00:03:09.120> sticky<00:03:10.120> it's<00:03:10.300> gonna<00:03:10.450> stick<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.900> keep

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
course sticky it's gonna stick to keep

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.080 
course sticky it's gonna stick to keep
it<00:03:11.170> in<00:03:11.440> but<00:03:11.980> we'll<00:03:12.100> add<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.400> garlic<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.820> the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
it in but we'll add the garlic to the

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.180 
it in but we'll add the garlic to the
spinach<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.720> saute<00:03:14.500> those<00:03:14.710> two<00:03:15.010> flavors

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
spinach and saute those two flavors

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.420 
spinach and saute those two flavors
together

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.520 

and<00:03:20.819> see<00:03:21.000> how<00:03:21.150> quickly<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.780> spinach<00:03:22.170> starts

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
and see how quickly the spinach starts

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.250 
and see how quickly the spinach starts
to<00:03:22.680> break<00:03:22.920> down<00:03:23.189> it's<00:03:23.519> mostly<00:03:24.090> water<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:24.750> when

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
to break down it's mostly water so when

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.140 
to break down it's mostly water so when
the<00:03:25.379> cell<00:03:25.620> structure<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.400> leaf<00:03:26.549> breaks

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
the cell structure of the leaf breaks

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.819 
the cell structure of the leaf breaks
down<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.659> the<00:03:27.750> water<00:03:27.959> starts<00:03:28.409> to<00:03:28.500> evaporate

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
down and the water starts to evaporate

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:40.070 
down and the water starts to evaporate
look<00:03:29.610> at<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.819> loss<00:03:30.329> of<00:03:30.540> volume<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.319> have

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.070 

next<00:03:40.860> our<00:03:40.980> protein<00:03:41.430> product<00:03:41.940> which<00:03:42.750> is<00:03:42.900> about

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
next our protein product which is about

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.810 
next our protein product which is about
half<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.500> pound<00:03:43.680> of<00:03:43.950> peeled<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.610> deveined

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
half a pound of peeled and deveined

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.850 
half a pound of peeled and deveined
shrimp<00:03:45.330> that's<00:03:45.990> gonna<00:03:46.200> go<00:03:46.410> in<00:03:46.590> with<00:03:46.740> the

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
shrimp that's gonna go in with the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
spinach the garlic and the onions will

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.320 
spinach the garlic and the onions will
start<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.530> combine<00:03:49.950> all<00:03:50.430> those<00:03:50.670> flavors

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
start to combine all those flavors

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:10.390 
start to combine all those flavors
together<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:52.080> stir-fry<00:03:52.740> them<00:03:53.250> together

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.890 

these<00:04:11.400> are<00:04:11.550> cannellini<00:04:12.030> beans<00:04:12.420> one<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.810> my

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
these are cannellini beans one of my

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.300 
these are cannellini beans one of my
favorite<00:04:13.410> because<00:04:13.560> they're<00:04:13.800> really<00:04:14.040> kind<00:04:14.250> of

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
favorite because they're really kind of

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.970 
favorite because they're really kind of
meaty<00:04:14.670> and<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.120> round<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.170> it's<00:04:16.320> really<00:04:16.709> good

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
meaty and and round and it's really good

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.250 
meaty and and round and it's really good
high<00:04:17.220> protein<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.150> add<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.810> dish<00:04:19.019> and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
high protein to add to the dish and

high protein to add to the dish and
again<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.130> ingredients<00:04:20.280> really<00:04:21.000> are

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
again the ingredients really are

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.390 
again the ingredients really are
unimportant<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.470> can<00:04:22.680> substitute<00:04:22.950> any

this over pasta or rice I like the

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.540 
this over pasta or rice I like the
protein<00:04:28.020> qualities<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.070> cannellini
