features of this particular mousepad
it's<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.379> course<00:00:52.710> different<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> way<00:00:53.730> that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
it's of course different in the way that

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.700 
it's of course different in the way that
it<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.710> glass<00:00:56.300> that<00:00:57.300> itself<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> bad

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it is glass that itself can be a bad

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.110 
it is glass that itself can be a bad
thing<00:00:58.739> obviously<00:00:59.640> if<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:01.190> drop<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.640> hard

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
that you're going to break this thing

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.000 
that you're going to break this thing
there<00:01:09.000> has<00:01:09.240> been<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.510> few<00:01:09.689> revisions<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.530> this

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
there has been a few revisions in this

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.929 
there has been a few revisions in this
pad<00:01:11.640> over<00:01:12.060> time<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:13.350> corners<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.670> been

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
pad over time the corners I have been

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.500 
pad over time the corners I have been
rounded<00:01:15.979> so<00:01:16.979> they're<00:01:17.100> no<00:01:17.220> longer<00:01:17.430> even<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
rounded so they're no longer even a

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.830 
rounded so they're no longer even a
little<00:01:18.659> bit<00:01:18.869> sharp<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.939> this<00:01:20.939> also<00:01:21.270> comes

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
little bit sharp and this also comes

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.999 
little bit sharp and this also comes
with<00:01:22.490> 6<00:01:23.540> silicon<00:01:24.540> feet<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:27.240> really

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
with 6 silicon feet so it's really

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.330 
with 6 silicon feet so it's really
sticky<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.970> does<00:01:30.210> stay<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:31.290> desk<00:01:32.630> and

hours upon ends you could find it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.959 
hours upon ends you could find it
hurting<00:03:00.470> right<00:03:01.470> here<00:03:01.739> in<00:03:01.919> particular<00:03:02.280> on<00:03:02.760> your

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
hurting right here in particular on your

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.869 
hurting right here in particular on your
hands<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:04.200> that's<00:03:04.739> not<00:03:05.010> great<00:03:05.250> you've<00:03:05.549> kind<00:03:05.849> of

I<00:03:06.000> like<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> stay<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:06.689> little<00:03:06.780> bit<00:03:07.019> further

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
I like to stay in a little bit further

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.039 
I like to stay in a little bit further
however<00:03:08.180> that<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.359> kind<00:03:09.569> of<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:09.750> bit<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.989> a

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
however that is kind of a bit of a

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.229 
however that is kind of a bit of a
concern<00:03:10.500> for<00:03:10.530> me<00:03:10.799> they<00:03:11.370> might<00:03:11.639> want<00:03:11.879> to<00:03:11.969> try

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
concern for me they might want to try

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.990 
concern for me they might want to try
and<00:03:12.480> maybe<00:03:12.629> put<00:03:12.930> something<00:03:13.319> here<00:03:13.650> along<00:03:14.639> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
and maybe put something here along the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.349 
and maybe put something here along the
edges<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.689> avoid<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:17.370> from<00:03:17.430> happening<00:03:17.909> or

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
edges to avoid this from happening or

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.319 
edges to avoid this from happening or
maybe<00:03:19.260> even<00:03:19.379> round<00:03:19.829> that<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.730> particular

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
maybe even round that this particular

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.020 
maybe even round that this particular
corner<00:03:21.870> down<00:03:22.560> at<00:03:22.739> an<00:03:22.829> angle<00:03:22.979> more<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.729> it's<00:03:23.879> not

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
corner down at an angle more so it's not

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.920 
corner down at an angle more so it's not
as<00:03:24.329> hard<00:03:24.989> on<00:03:25.199> your<00:03:25.829> hands<00:03:26.659> let<00:03:27.659> me<00:03:27.690> just

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
as hard on your hands let me just

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.809 
as hard on your hands let me just
actually<00:03:28.109> have<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> look<00:03:28.709> at<00:03:28.919> the<00:03:29.220> mice<00:03:29.459> when

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
actually have a look at the mice when

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.020 
actually have a look at the mice when
they<00:03:29.970> are<00:03:30.090> actually<00:03:30.269> on<00:03:30.569> this<00:03:31.049> pad<00:03:31.319> itself

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
they are actually on this pad itself

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.439 
they are actually on this pad itself
okay<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.090> here<00:03:33.449> it<00:03:33.540> is<00:03:33.629> on<00:03:33.750> my<00:03:33.870> desk<00:03:34.139> and<00:03:34.970> as<00:03:35.970> you

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
okay so here it is on my desk and as you

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.469 
okay so here it is on my desk and as you
can<00:03:36.569> see<00:03:36.799> it's<00:03:37.799> pretty<00:03:37.979> easy<00:03:38.129> pretty<00:03:39.000> hard<00:03:39.299> so

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.479 
can see it's pretty easy pretty hard so

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:44.119 
can see it's pretty easy pretty hard so
I<00:03:39.540> can<00:03:39.720> move<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.819> pad<00:03:41.819> with<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.629> nice<00:03:43.409> sticky

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
I can move this pad with the nice sticky

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.599 
I can move this pad with the nice sticky
silicon<00:03:44.849> see-through<00:03:45.599> feet<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:46.079> it<00:03:46.259> and<00:03:46.609> here

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
silicon see-through feet on it and here

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:54.979 
silicon see-through feet on it and here
is<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:48.180> optical<00:03:48.840> mouse<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:53.629> does<00:03:54.629> work

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
is the optical mouse and it does work

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.589 
is the optical mouse and it does work
quite<00:03:55.319> well<00:03:55.829> if<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.759> can<00:03:56.909> see<00:03:57.120> here<00:03:57.329> on<00:03:57.479> the

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
quite well if you can see here on the

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.679 
quite well if you can see here on the
screen<00:04:00.769> again<00:04:01.769> go<00:04:01.919> back<00:04:01.949> to<00:04:02.129> the<00:04:02.370> mouse<00:04:02.689> it's

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
screen again go back to the mouse it's

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.490 
screen again go back to the mouse it's
so<00:04:04.620> laser<00:04:04.859> mouse<00:04:05.129> it's<00:04:05.639> an<00:04:05.759> optic<00:04:06.090> mouse<00:04:06.500> can

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
so laser mouse it's an optic mouse can

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.439 
so laser mouse it's an optic mouse can
go<00:04:07.620> back<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:07.919> the<00:04:08.009> screen<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:08.699> it<00:04:08.819> is<00:04:08.909> working

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
go back to the screen so it is working

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:13.039 
go back to the screen so it is working
I<00:04:09.479> did<00:04:10.079> not<00:04:10.290> really<00:04:10.739> suspect<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.509> would

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
I did not really suspect that this would

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.589 
I did not really suspect that this would
work<00:04:13.290> however<00:04:14.189> it<00:04:14.370> does<00:04:14.579> work<00:04:14.609> quite<00:04:14.819> well<00:04:15.060> and

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
work however it does work quite well and

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.539 
work however it does work quite well and
of<00:04:15.959> course<00:04:16.289> your<00:04:16.979> regular<00:04:17.489> mice<00:04:18.389> your<00:04:19.169> ball

another<00:04:28.900> cool<00:04:29.560> feature<00:04:29.860> about<00:04:30.069> this<00:04:30.490> of

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
another cool feature about this of

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.990 
another cool feature about this of
course<00:04:31.000> is<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.810> is<00:04:32.050> glass<00:04:32.319> and<00:04:32.729> being<00:04:33.729> glass

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
course is it is glass and being glass

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.219 
course is it is glass and being glass
it's<00:04:34.750> very<00:04:35.469> hard<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:36.099> it's<00:04:36.789> very<00:04:36.909> flat<00:04:37.449> now

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
it's very hard and it's very flat now

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.909 
it's very hard and it's very flat now
why<00:04:38.650> is<00:04:38.710> this<00:04:38.979> good<00:04:39.250> well<00:04:39.909> let's<00:04:40.719> face<00:04:40.930> it<00:04:40.990> it's

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
why is this good well let's face it it's

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.969 
why is this good well let's face it it's
better<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.430> have<00:04:42.639> a<00:04:42.669> nice<00:04:43.409> hard<00:04:45.000> surface<00:04:46.000> for

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
better to have a nice hard surface for

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.700 
better to have a nice hard surface for
your<00:04:47.979> mice<00:04:48.280> because<00:04:48.849> they<00:04:49.270> do<00:04:49.330> then<00:04:49.930> glide

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
your mice because they do then glide

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.920 
your mice because they do then glide
over<00:04:51.129> the<00:04:51.370> surface<00:04:51.569> quite<00:04:52.569> easily<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.389> sum

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
over the surface quite easily so to sum

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.559 
over the surface quite easily so to sum
up<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.199> video<00:04:56.590> review<00:04:57.039> I<00:04:57.280> give<00:04:57.759> this<00:04:58.000> Iceman

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
up this video review I give this Iceman

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.950 
up this video review I give this Iceman
a<00:04:58.810> 7<00:04:59.289> out<00:04:59.469> of<00:04:59.529> 10<00:05:00.090> overall<00:05:01.090> a<00:05:01.240> good<00:05:01.689> path

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
a 7 out of 10 overall a good path

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.089 
a 7 out of 10 overall a good path
however<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.680> does<00:05:02.889> have<00:05:03.250> some<00:05:04.120> drawbacks

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
however it does have some drawbacks

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.450
