00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
was a brilliant idea

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.339 
was a brilliant idea
I<00:00:28.619> own<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.670> play<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.480> still<00:00:31.140> think

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
I own one now I play it I still think

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.319 
I own one now I play it I still think
it's<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> fantastic<00:00:32.279> device<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> think<00:00:33.210> they

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
it's a fantastic device and I think they

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.510 
it's a fantastic device and I think they
made<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> right<00:00:33.870> moves<00:00:34.140> are<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.530> after<00:00:34.829> you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
made the right moves are going after you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.459 
made the right moves are going after you
know<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> very<00:00:35.940> casual<00:00:36.510> demographic<00:00:37.290> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
know a very casual demographic and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.750 
know a very casual demographic and
they're<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.739> after<00:00:38.010> young<00:00:38.340> younger

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
they're going after young younger

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.720 
they're going after young younger
demographic<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> TDs<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.309> think<00:00:41.610> it

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
demographic with the TDs and I think it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.910 
demographic with the TDs and I think it
fits<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> perfectly<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
fits that perfectly I think it's one of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.440 
fits that perfectly I think it's one of
the<00:00:43.980> most<00:00:44.100> comfortable<00:00:44.670> handhelds<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.300> ever

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
going to cost $99.99 US dollar so 100

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.749 
going to cost $99.99 US dollar so 100
bucks<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.890> cost<00:01:35.100> alright

people are actually annoyed at that

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.100 
people are actually annoyed at that
but<00:02:00.960> whatever<00:02:01.619> then<00:02:02.070> go<00:02:02.219> find<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.939> regular<00:02:03.869> Wii

and play GameCube games but Nintendo

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.639 
and play GameCube games but Nintendo
there's<00:02:08.849> two<00:02:09.179> things<00:02:09.539> here<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.379> them<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
there's two things here one of them is

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.110 
there's two things here one of them is
not<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:10.979> big<00:02:11.099> as<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> other<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.819> I'll<00:02:11.940> mention

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
not as big as the other so I'll mention

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.460 
not as big as the other so I'll mention
that<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:12.510> first

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that one first

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.230 
that one first
I think<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.920> price<00:02:14.160> point<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> Wii<00:02:15.030> mini

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
I think the price point of the Wii mini

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.320 
I think the price point of the Wii mini
should<00:02:15.630> be<00:02:16.400> $79.99<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> think<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.820> hundred<00:02:17.940> bucks

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
should be $79.99 I think a hundred bucks

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.140 
should be $79.99 I think a hundred bucks
when<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.110> could<00:02:19.500> get<00:02:19.680> used<00:02:20.250> seventh<00:02:20.910> gen

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
when you could get used seventh gen

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.100 
when you could get used seventh gen
consoles<00:02:21.950> for<00:02:22.950> 129<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.210> 99<00:02:24.690> bucks<00:02:24.930> I'm

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
consoles for 129 and 99 bucks I'm

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.840 
consoles for 129 and 99 bucks I'm
talking<00:02:25.350> about<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.650> PlayStation<00:02:26.280> 3<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.610> think

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
talking about the PlayStation 3 I think

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.130 
talking about the PlayStation 3 I think
that's<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.120> little<00:02:27.240> bit<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.510> expansion<00:02:27.990> but

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
that's a little bit more expansion but

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.370 
that's a little bit more expansion but
you<00:02:28.260> could<00:02:28.380> get<00:02:28.500> an<00:02:28.950> Xbox<00:02:29.790> 360<00:02:30.600> slim<00:02:30.900> not<00:02:31.230> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
you could get an Xbox 360 slim not the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.130 
you could get an Xbox 360 slim not the
old<00:02:31.560> red<00:02:31.890> ring<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.250> death<00:02:32.310> 1<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.060> Xbox<00:02:33.540> 360

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
old red ring of death 1 the Xbox 360

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.220 
old red ring of death 1 the Xbox 360
slim<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:35.160> could<00:02:35.340> get<00:02:35.490> one<00:02:35.640> used<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.240> like<00:02:36.360> 129

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
slim you could get one used for like 129

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.370 
slim you could get one used for like 129
so<00:02:37.650> really<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.280> price<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.850> wii<00:02:39.030> mini

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
so really the price of the wii mini

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.440 
so really the price of the wii mini
should<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.650> much<00:02:41.460> cheaper<00:02:41.790> i<00:02:42.000> mean<00:02:42.180> hell<00:02:42.330> you
