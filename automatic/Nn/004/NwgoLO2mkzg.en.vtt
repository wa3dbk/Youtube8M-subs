you're<00:06:03.080> using<00:06:03.200> skype<00:06:03.650> but<00:06:03.979> in<00:06:04.220> terms<00:06:04.430> of

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
you're using skype but in terms of

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.550 
you're using skype but in terms of
taking<00:06:04.820> photos<00:06:05.180> I<00:06:05.390> would<00:06:05.690> not<00:06:05.960> recommend<00:06:06.110> but

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
taking photos I would not recommend but

taking photos I would not recommend but
then<00:06:06.680> again<00:06:06.770> this<00:06:07.070> is<00:06:07.250> we<00:06:07.400> just<00:06:07.640> entertainment

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
then again this is we just entertainment

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.020 
then again this is we just entertainment
as<00:06:08.630> a<00:06:08.690> whole<00:06:08.990> i<00:06:09.919> think<00:06:10.340> amazon<00:06:10.760> has<00:06:10.850> done<00:06:11.000> a

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
as a whole i think amazon has done a

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.490 
as a whole i think amazon has done a
good<00:06:11.210> job<00:06:11.270> here<00:06:11.660> but<00:06:11.900> i<00:06:11.930> would<00:06:12.110> love<00:06:12.229> to<00:06:12.350> see

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
good job here but i would love to see

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.380 
good job here but i would love to see
more<00:06:12.830> improvements<00:06:13.340> in<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.490> future<00:06:13.790> more

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
more improvements in the future more

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.090 
more improvements in the future more
flexibility<00:06:14.960> with<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:15.290> operating<00:06:15.680> system

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
flexibility with the operating system

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.650 
flexibility with the operating system
that<00:06:16.400> allows<00:06:16.610> you<00:06:16.820> to<00:06:16.940> do<00:06:17.090> more<00:06:17.330> than<00:06:17.390> just

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
that allows you to do more than just

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
that allows you to do more than just
consuming<00:06:19.810> amazon<00:06:20.810> products<00:06:21.200> if<00:06:21.350> you<00:06:21.470> will

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
consuming amazon products if you will

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.830 
consuming amazon products if you will
but<00:06:22.220> in<00:06:22.460> terms<00:06:22.760> of<00:06:22.910> a<00:06:23.000> consumption<00:06:23.450> so<00:06:23.540> i<00:06:23.570> think

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
but in terms of a consumption so i think

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.390 
but in terms of a consumption so i think
this<00:06:23.900> works<00:06:24.140> well<00:06:24.440> if<00:06:24.919> you<00:06:25.010> leave<00:06:25.190> for<00:06:25.310> a

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
this works well if you leave for a

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.490 
this works well if you leave for a
