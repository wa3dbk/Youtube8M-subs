00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
this talking about a year turned out me

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.799 
this talking about a year turned out me
almost<00:00:46.350> almost<00:00:46.739> three<00:00:47.070> years<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.660> you

know it turns out you meet me at nine

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.150 
know it turns out you meet me at nine
months<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.570> again<00:00:51.809> made<00:00:52.050> 11<00:00:52.620> babies<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
months but it's again made 11 babies and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.369 
months but it's again made 11 babies and
nights<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.360> know<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> very<00:00:55.230> expensive

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
nights you know a lot of very expensive

robots<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> world<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
robots is going in in the world that you

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.970 
robots is going in in the world that you
guys<00:00:57.480> are<00:00:57.690> funding<00:00:58.350> suspending<00:00:58.739> than<00:00:58.859> their

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
guys are funding suspending than their

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
guys are funding suspending than their
what

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
what

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.299 
what
the<00:01:02.000> reason<00:01:02.390> is<00:01:02.540> there's<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.410> huge<00:01:03.740> number<00:01:04.130> of

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
the reason is there's a huge number of

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.490 
the reason is there's a huge number of
brilliant<00:01:05.000> people<00:01:05.059> working<00:01:05.600> in<00:01:05.660> robotics<00:01:06.110> and

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
brilliant people working in robotics and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.810 
brilliant people working in robotics and
they<00:01:06.890> don't<00:01:07.070> have<00:01:07.160> the<00:01:07.250> tools<00:01:07.460> they<00:01:07.580> need<00:01:07.790> to

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
they don't have the tools they need to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.270 
they don't have the tools they need to
be<00:01:08.030> as<00:01:08.120> effective<00:01:08.360> as<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:08.690> could<00:01:08.920> then<00:01:09.920> when

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
be as effective as it could then when

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.950 
be as effective as it could then when
you<00:01:10.370> look<00:01:10.580> at<00:01:10.730> the<00:01:10.880> future<00:01:11.090> of<00:01:11.270> robotics<00:01:11.750> and

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
you look at the future of robotics and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.990 
you look at the future of robotics and
you<00:01:12.140> look<00:01:12.290> at<00:01:12.440> the<00:01:12.590> number<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:12.890> people<00:01:13.130> could

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
you look at the number of people could

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.630 
you look at the number of people could
do<00:01:14.210> better<00:01:14.360> if<00:01:14.630> they<00:01:14.750> have<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.050> right<00:01:15.140> tools

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
do better if they have the right tools

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.860 
do better if they have the right tools
that<00:01:16.640> makes<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.060> robots<00:01:17.360> look<00:01:17.510> cheap<00:01:17.720> by

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
that makes the robots look cheap by

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.270 
that makes the robots look cheap by
comparison<00:01:18.260> right<00:01:18.800> there's<00:01:18.980> this<00:01:19.100> huge

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
comparison right there's this huge

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.700 
comparison right there's this huge
opportunity<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.600> by<00:01:20.810> just<00:01:21.020> putting<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:21.290> on<00:01:21.380> 11

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
opportunity and by just putting it on 11

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.470 
opportunity and by just putting it on 11
robots<00:01:22.010> we<00:01:22.160> think<00:01:22.340> we<00:01:22.430> can<00:01:22.580> help<00:01:22.670> them<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.210> so

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
robots we think we can help them and so

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.140 
robots we think we can help them and so
that's<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.750> fantastic<00:01:24.080> kitchen<00:01:24.940> I'd<00:01:25.940> like<00:01:26.120> to

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
that's a fantastic kitchen I'd like to

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.970 
that's a fantastic kitchen I'd like to
announce<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.900> winners<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:27.440> pr2<00:01:27.740> beta

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
of yeah so we have this assistive

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.749 
of yeah so we have this assistive
kitchen<00:01:56.270> map<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:57.229> which<00:01:58.220> is<00:01:58.340> kind<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.550> meant

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
kitchen map and which is kind of meant

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.660 
kitchen map and which is kind of meant
as<00:01:58.970> a<00:01:59.530> kitchen<00:02:00.530> or<00:02:00.740> environment<00:02:01.400> for<00:02:01.580> the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
as a kitchen or environment for the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.520 
as a kitchen or environment for the
future<00:02:01.970> so<00:02:02.660> we're<00:02:02.930> going<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.110> have<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.410> robot

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
future so we're going to have the robot

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.670 
future so we're going to have the robot
in<00:02:03.860> there<00:02:04.690> will<00:02:05.690> be<00:02:05.810> able<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.170> help<00:02:06.320> elderly

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
in there will be able to help elderly

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.080 
in there will be able to help elderly
and<00:02:07.190> handicapped<00:02:07.610> people<00:02:07.820> so<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:09.230> a<00:02:09.500> sense<00:02:10.090> we

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
and handicapped people so in a sense we

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.699 
and handicapped people so in a sense we
know<00:02:11.209> that<00:02:11.390> elderly<00:02:11.690> people<00:02:12.050> kind<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.320> don't

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
know that elderly people kind of don't

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.770 
know that elderly people kind of don't
like<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.070> go<00:02:13.190> in<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.370> land<00:02:13.519> area<00:02:13.640> houses<00:02:13.880> would

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
like to go in the land area houses would

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.910 
like to go in the land area houses would
like<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.050> stay<00:02:15.230> home<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.620> we're<00:02:15.769> going<00:02:15.890> to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
like to stay home and we're going to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.420 
like to stay home and we're going to
have<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.220> robot<00:02:16.370> there<00:02:16.670> too<00:02:17.560> let's<00:02:18.560> say<00:02:18.769> make

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
have the robot there too let's say make

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.259 
have the robot there too let's say make
a<00:02:20.709> set<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.830> tables<00:02:22.280> for<00:02:22.459> them<00:02:22.610> clean<00:02:23.000> the

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
a set the tables for them clean the

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.330 
a set the tables for them clean the
table<00:02:23.600> after<00:02:23.720> then<00:02:23.989> put<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.380> dishes<00:02:24.980> into<00:02:25.250> the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
table after then put the dishes into the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.180 
table after then put the dishes into the
dishwasher<00:02:25.900> mop<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.080> floor<00:02:27.320> enter<00:02:28.100> on

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.869 
every single muscle movement be planning
a<00:03:19.590> higher<00:03:19.709> level<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.459> we<00:03:20.549> wanted<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.760> see<00:03:20.849> a

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
a higher level so we wanted to see a

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.270 
a higher level so we wanted to see a
similar<00:03:21.180> with<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.329> robot<00:03:22.069> another<00:03:23.069> thing<00:03:23.250> is

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
similar with the robot another thing is

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.720 
similar with the robot another thing is
learning<00:03:23.790> from<00:03:23.819> demonstrations<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:25.140> so<00:03:25.799> it's

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
learning from demonstrations and so it's

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.460 
learning from demonstrations and so it's
often<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.299> lot<00:03:27.420> easier<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.720> show<00:03:27.930> how<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.140> show

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
often a lot easier to show how to show

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.750 
often a lot easier to show how to show
somebody<00:03:28.680> how<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.859> do<00:03:29.010> something<00:03:29.280> then<00:03:29.459> try<00:03:29.700> to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
somebody how to do something then try to

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.759 
somebody how to do something then try to
explain<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.569> same<00:03:31.049> thing<00:03:31.200> goes<00:03:31.230> with<00:03:31.349> program

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
explain it same thing goes with program

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.430 
explain it same thing goes with program
a<00:03:31.890> robot<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.519> if<00:03:33.359> we<00:03:33.599> can<00:03:33.720> show<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.200> robot<00:03:34.409> a

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
a robot so if we can show the robot a

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.190 
a robot so if we can show the robot a
tie<00:03:34.620> knot<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.099> you<00:03:35.760> know<00:03:35.940> keep<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.389> similar<00:03:37.079> to

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
tie knot and you know keep it similar to

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.809 
tie knot and you know keep it similar to
those<00:03:37.290> demonstrations<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.129> now<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.579> robot

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
those demonstrations and now the robot

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.849 
those demonstrations and now the robot

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
fire exits our spring loaded so you

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.890
