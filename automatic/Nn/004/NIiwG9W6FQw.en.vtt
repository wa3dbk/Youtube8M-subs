00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello there is ferra.ru from the ifa exhibition 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.179
 2013 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.200
 and we are on sony stand and look 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.750
 on their new smartwatch smartwatch 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.369
 or two who is a smartwatch well this 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.050
 that which came up because 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.740
 smartphones are too big to 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.619
 every time pull them out 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.689
 pockets now we have not only 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.990
 second screen for a big monitor but but 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.419
 still 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.090
 but also the second screen for the smartphone here 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.260
 such a smartwatch can be 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.809
 sync with your phone and checks 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.260
 basic mail or tweet or 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.880
 someone else so here 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.240
 unlock 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.520
 such a familiar button and see here 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.930
 There are different applications you can read 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.070
 mail true of course spoiled and 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.530
 combined compared with the usual 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.450
 android gmail am can be looked at 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.970
 facebook stage is very similar to symbian 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.670
 s40 facebook is also such a pardon 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.100
 but none the less 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.200
 if you are too lazy to climb on the phone 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.869
 very very useful thing in general i 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.600
 I predict that when smartphones will be with 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.270
 12 diagonal smoke and it will be soon 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.130
 for two years only 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.409
 such watches will be very very 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.299
 popular in court just like to say 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.580
 that they are different from the first 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.580
 smartwatch oh yes almost nothing but 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.760
 the fact that they are waterproof perhaps 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.290
 another important thing for this watch 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.450
 except they are waterproof 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.720
 compared with the previous is that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.360
 now they charge with micro 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.460
 beaten up usual that is no need to carry 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.470
 with an extra cord to them 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.990
 recharge 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.360
 work without recharging for 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.330
 three or four than three or four days they 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:04.790
 sony smartwatch 2 watch 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.790
