00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.470
 today I come to talk about a product that 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.210
 we are really enjoying it and that it is 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.279
 giving very good results in particular 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.930
 that is this product that today here that 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.640
 You already know him but good that they have 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.670
 reformulated and we wanted to share it with 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.590
 you in particular this product 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.590
 agricultural and liposomal zero 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.060
 they commented that their liposome formula gives 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.840
 get glycolic acid 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.060
 have a greater penetration in the skin and 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.120
 therefore get a greater 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.460
 effectiveness 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.890
 The texture of the product is a texture 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.350
 fresh a light texture that does not leave 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.309
 fat and what good once put on 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.309
 the skin leaves the sensations of having the 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.420
 very very soft skin 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.430
 good and because this glycolic acid does not 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.539
 irritates good simply because 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.800
 the liposomes are formulated with which 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.250
 get 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.880
 penetrate without irritating the surface of the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.580
 skin 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.310
 the concentration that has acid 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.470
 glycolic is not excessively high is 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:33.770
 a concentration at 6% and that has some 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.720
 exfoliating and moisturizing properties 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.000
 regenerating our skin is worth 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.000
 6 glycolic acid 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.090
 with exfoliating moisturizing properties 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.120
 and regenerative 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.460
 its liposome formula gives gets to have 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.400
 an action in depth for the rue 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.550
 gas and its free formula allows then 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.530
 have a renovating and exfoliating action 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.720
 on the surface of the skin without reaching 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.390
 irritate also carries vitamin e 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.060
 vitamin c and stem cells of origin 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.700
 vegetable with which is good too 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.550
 contains glycolic acid ceramides between 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.300
 others, well, a cost that goes 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.120
 to have and combine the exfoliating action 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.400
 and glycolic acid regenerator with 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.100
 a moisturizing and softening action of the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.470
 skin is worth the product in particular comes 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.660
 in a dropper bottle I'm going to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.690
 teach so you can see the texture comes 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.110
 also as if it were a very 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.110
 light 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.200
 very very soft and good as we are going to 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.540
 apply the product 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.860
 the product or you must apply 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.959
 directly in the palm of your hand and 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.459
 then give small touches to the face 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.680
 to massage never apply the 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.410
 dropper directly because 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.150
 you will lose products and apart good not what 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.800
 will apply even if in an area it 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.150
 will concentrate more than others the ideal is 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.700
 As I say in the palm of your hand 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.709
 a few drops and then taps 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.210
 all over the face avoiding always the 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.520
 Eye contour area 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.050
 Suitable for all skin types and 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.920
 even sensitive skins are 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.420
 tolerating superbly and good 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.010
 because even in summer recommend it 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.390
 you can use without any problem 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.570
 because the acid concentration 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.040
 glycolic is not excessively irritating 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.660
 and I say that is 6 percent and 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.340
 well we would apply it and we will put it 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.940
 in summer because the ideal is to apply it 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.150
 only at night and of course always 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.640
 will be associated with a solar protection 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.430
 the morning 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.590
 that is very important that you do not forget it 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.300
 protect from the sun 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.890
 daily and especially times 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.160
 summer, being in the spring as a 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.190
 important summer introduce in the 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.260
 daily routine a sunscreen then 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.840
 also commented that in normal skins 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.080
 and mixed the product is working very 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.180
 all right 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.980
 applying it alone without putting 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.959
 a cream on top of the texture that 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.640
 has that is excited moisturizes 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.940
 very much and it leaves us the feeling of 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.730
 straps nothing in normal dry skin 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.530
 then you would have to put on a cream 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.230
 nutritious or a moisturizing cream in 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.200
 function of that the function of the 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.040
 skin and to to compensate a little and give 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.169
 a little nutrition Well worth 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.330
 nothing more to tell you that we are 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.240
 liking a lot for this product and that 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.150
 is nominated for some prizes and if you 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.150

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.160

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.800
 composition and characteristics of
