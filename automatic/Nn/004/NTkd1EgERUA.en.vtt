00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:24.789
 I 'm not happy, I understand, I'm 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.670
 well here quiet him walking I do not have 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.830
 problems if I had problems and I would 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.720
 I would fix to walk and not have any 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.250
 place to sleep because it reaches your 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.470
 hands 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.470
 with this wonderful collection for 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.940
 continue doing campaign with a 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.680
 level 1 assembly forward try 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.760
 Summers ease of mounting ultra 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.440
 fast speed but that I do not understand 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.000
 nothing 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.739
 look with great attention this great 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.710
 Orixe's made campaign tent 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.050
 good 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.809
 of course we have the color red green 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.009
 blue yellow purple blue fire flying 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.470
 pale pink green but you're 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.810
 repeating and it is showing everything 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.150
 while the same whole range is super 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.409
 place bed 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.190
 will protect you from all evil that you can 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.190
 stop at night 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.080
 besides this bed of the type is of last 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.270
 generation and everyone envy their 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.650
 shop then the other 16 dismisses a park 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.479
 that putting pixel of spectrum in 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.860
 conflict with the owner that's the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.570
 most unlikely story that I've 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.130
 perceived never parted lines the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.190
 progressive approach of man to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.630
 real world and trunks see of course if 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.520
 you have a last pass of the last 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.979
 short generation 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.780
 associate I also hope to treasure a 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.430
 camping post of how the field is 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.570
 interdisciplinary is a field of 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.100
 study that limits us 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.670
 Traditional among several disciplines 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.670
 academic 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.390
 in the jungle in the snow on the water 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:13.500
 in the house I really wondered if 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.720
 someone can sleep in a tent 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:23.770
