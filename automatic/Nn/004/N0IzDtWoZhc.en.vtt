control the cursor is the little black

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
control the cursor is the little black
thing<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.650> can<00:00:40.800> move<00:00:40.920> around<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.610> oh

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
thing you can move around like that oh

thing you can move around like that oh
yes<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:42.540> line<00:00:42.839> like<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:43.260> you're<00:00:43.409> typing

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
yes it's the line like if you're typing

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.740 
yes it's the line like if you're typing
an<00:00:43.769> email<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.159> little<00:00:44.370> line<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:45.150> that's<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
an email the little line then that's the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.010 
an email the little line then that's the
cursor<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.640> whole<00:00:47.820> set<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.719> arrows

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
cursor so we have a whole set of arrows

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.569 
cursor so we have a whole set of arrows
you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.469> move<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> cursor<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.160> things<00:00:50.370> so

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you can move the cursor with things so

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.220 
you can move the cursor with things so
take<00:00:51.270> them<00:00:51.390> through<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.660> cursor

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
take them through the cursor

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.459 
take them through the cursor
well<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> cursor<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.129> easiest<00:00:53.579> one<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.120> if

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
well the cursor the easiest one is if

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.069

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
code like an m1 or a tool change I have

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.339 
code like an m1 or a tool change I have
a<00:01:17.070> long<00:01:17.280> program<00:01:17.520> I'm<00:01:17.880> looking<00:01:18.149> for<00:01:18.300> tool<00:01:18.810> 17

00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:19.349 
a long program I'm looking for tool 17

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:21.230 
a long program I'm looking for tool 17
because<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.649> want<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:19.860> restart<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.429> program<00:01:20.459> at

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
because I want to restart the program at

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.510 
because I want to restart the program at
tool<00:01:21.450> number<00:01:21.569> 17<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.349> you<00:01:22.440> just<00:01:22.590> type<00:01:22.709> in<00:01:22.890> 17

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
tool number 17 so you just type in 17

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.520 
tool number 17 so you just type in 17
down<00:01:24.209> and<00:01:24.509> it's<00:01:24.630> gonna<00:01:24.780> search<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.140> well

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
down and it's gonna search for well

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050 
down and it's gonna search for well
you'd<00:01:25.649> have<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.800> look<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.190> T<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:26.520> 17

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
you'd have to look for the T because 17

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.820 
you'd have to look for the T because 17
might<00:01:27.270> happen<00:01:27.420> anything<00:01:27.990> oh<00:01:28.140> okay

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
so if I'm looking for tool 17 T 17 go

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.949 
so if I'm looking for tool 17 T 17 go
find<00:01:32.099> it<00:01:32.220> okay<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.030> then<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.479> would<00:01:33.630> would

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
find it okay and then that would would

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.199 
find it okay and then that would would
start<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.610> cursor<00:01:35.610> control<00:01:35.729> takes<00:01:36.119> you

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
let's go back to program memory okay

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.500 
let's go back to program memory okay
okay<00:02:38.359> so<00:02:38.749> if<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.439> if<00:02:39.730> I'm<00:02:40.730> guessing<00:02:41.150> home<00:02:41.329> would

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
so end picture to the end of the program

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.080 
so end picture to the end of the program
okay<00:02:45.379> so<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.010> that'll<00:02:46.159> do<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:46.549> in<00:02:46.760> other
