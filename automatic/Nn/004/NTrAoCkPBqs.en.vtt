 new make up tutorial this time 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.360
 on the new autumn winter collection 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.599
 proposed by girl and not wants de madame 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.660
 a particular collection certainly 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.550
 for my predominant opinion the blush 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.750
 wonderful proposed in the collection 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.210
 I decided to offer you a look 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.210
 really really simple and fast it is 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.220
 concentrated on dark and lacquered lips 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.289
 just from madame then I chose for 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.730
 the eyes of the new pencils proposed on 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.880
 color that I liked best in 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.120
 absolute that this amber silver that is 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.300
 a silver with a top point inside the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.420
 pencil and those where twist and is 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.399
 removable so self tempering and I have it 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.690
 used as an eyeliner 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:55.289
 you see doing a line with all your eyes 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.960
 predominant with a nice big kiss ok 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.260
 that it was visible but delicate from 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.750
 color and then or abundant with mascara the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.360
 sil of the black stop that I love and I have it 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.520
 put on and under the base was already 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.930
 made and is that of the cc crime of 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.189
 chanel that I did in the review 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.220
 previous one 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.979
 now let me show you the blushes 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.830
 black packet of rose then 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.299
 different from the usual packs we have 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.110
 we have a black box opening it 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.229
 this wonder that is beautiful 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.780
 blush that in all the colors that is better 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.720
 emphasize a woman's face 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.090
 we have peach in pink and light pink 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.189
 with any brick tip they can 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.500
 be used obviously separate or 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:49.229
 mixing everything is very nice because 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.360
 you get up and we have your brush 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.790
 among other things it was done in pink then 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.600
 very very feminine very beautiful 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.549
 certainly a beautiful pec and for the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.189
 lips proposed new colors 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.100
 of the fires that are those little more than 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.270
 I had already bought or said metal 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.859
 of not resume 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.470
 not because I don't like it but because it is 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:14.129
 important around that is one 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.319
 heaviness the package that my mom 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.629
 and then I wanted very lacquered lips 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.690
 and so I fell in love with the gloss 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.269
 which, however, is a beautiful covering proposed 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.569
 really a collection that is the 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.150
 color 863 gloss in the latch are gloss 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.940
 super lacquered with a nice plum tone 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.910
 that drove me crazy with silver 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.769
 Now let's go and apply the blush I have 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.569
 to open the eye a little and does the 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.849
 contrast with the silver took the 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.010
 lighter color and I put it 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.280
 in the inner corner of the eye you see 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.260
 to give an anti-fatigue point to the 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.390
 look because gray is the risk 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.849
 that if it is not well covered and the oriaia 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.459
 weigh down the look by putting a 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.140
 rose point inside fatigue it 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.769
 look and i am very well because he has a 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.079
 nice contrast now I take a brush from 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:09.030
 blush I simply then had all the 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:15.000
 colors and with circular movements I go 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:17.639
 to apply this is a is a blush that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.769
 has a color that can be very modulated a 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.530
 depending on how much we do or apply 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.859
 we will have a more or less intense color and it is 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.350
 really suitable for all complexions 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:30.030
 because we have this beautiful orange that goes 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.470
 well even on dark complexion with 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.840
 all the shades of pink that mine is one 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.099
 clear complexion and just that 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.950
 bonne effect min 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.290
 I'm deliberately emphasizing it 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.690
 in fact you see use the brush giving 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.150
 like linen circles because I want them 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.310
 cheeks emphasized to the fullest for this 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.959
 look and with this blog it is not difficult 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.810
 because it releases the color very well me 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.069
 let's go with second is a piece 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.840
 beautiful that is this big one 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.639
 I really wanted the lips to look like 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:07.290
 will go for this season but the 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:10.730
 I wanted very lacquered so you will see how 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.730
 nice effect with this blog 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.250
 which releases orange micro glitter 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:24.280
 that perfectly reflect the tone of the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:27.520
 blush is less difficult to wear than a 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:35.290
 plum lipstick but equally background but 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.400
 intriguing and then to be a gloss 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.400
 seco dh a good seal 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.480
 there is a tac and beauty 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.550
 this is struck by light 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.800
 artificial from the daylight takes 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.930
 these flashes of micro glitter that 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.380
 perfectly resume the orange of the 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.330
 blush and I must tell you that in my opinion 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:11.650
 this is the look that best interprets 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:15.040
 this collection is the blush costs 54 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:19.120
 euro so you pay the gloss instead 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.790
 on the 28 is therefore also pencils like le 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.860
 but other pencils, I can tell you one 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.040
 very feminine collection a lot 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.210
 intriguing for the winter certainly a 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.210
 kiss of the next video
