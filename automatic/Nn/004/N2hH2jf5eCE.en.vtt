00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
thing that this has taught me is that I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.990 
thing that this has taught me is that I
eat<00:01:28.020> way<00:01:28.380> too<00:01:28.409> much<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:29.009> every<00:01:29.490> meal<00:01:29.700> because

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
eat way too much of every meal because

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.380 
eat way too much of every meal because
it<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.780> doesn't<00:01:31.350> take<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.740> much<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.390> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it really doesn't take that much to to
