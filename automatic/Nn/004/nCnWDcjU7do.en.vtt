look at it like Ritter the good this is

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
look at it like Ritter the good this is
the<00:01:48.659> new<00:01:48.780> texture<00:01:49.079> pack<00:01:49.229> obviously<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.950> city

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the new texture pack obviously the city

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.219 
the new texture pack obviously the city
texture<00:01:50.880> pack<00:01:51.030> which<00:01:51.240> my<00:01:51.540> bad<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.020> actually

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
texture pack which my bad I actually

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.499 
texture pack which my bad I actually
called<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:53.090> thought<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.149> didn't<00:01:54.329> know<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
called it I thought I didn't know the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.609 
called it I thought I didn't know the
name<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.899> said<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> looked

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
name of it I said like it looked

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.620 
name of it I said like it looked
industrial<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.060> because<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.390> boats

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
industrial but just because of the boats

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690 
industrial but just because of the boats
I<00:01:57.899> guess<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> actual<00:01:58.770> name<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.310> City

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
I guess the actual name for it is City

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.270 
I guess the actual name for it is City
texture<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.810> city<00:02:01.049> texture<00:02:01.409> pack<00:02:01.590> so

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
texture but the city texture pack so

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.740 
texture but the city texture pack so
that's<00:02:02.430> cool<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> way<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.820> actually<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
that's cool the way I actually know the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.389 
that's cool the way I actually know the
name<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:04.200> oh<00:02:04.380> yeah<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.070> that

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
name of it now oh yeah so this is that

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.130 
name of it now oh yeah so this is that
texture<00:02:05.759> pack<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.299> if<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.750> look<00:02:06.780> at<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
texture pack and if you look at it you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.300 
texture pack and if you look at it you
can<00:02:07.170> actually<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.500> carpets<00:02:07.920> on<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> ground

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
can actually see carpets on the ground

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.040 
can actually see carpets on the ground
and<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.420> see<00:02:09.569> what<00:02:09.780> looks<00:02:09.810> like

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
and then you can see what looks like

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.339 
and then you can see what looks like
whoa<00:02:10.530> or<00:02:10.920> something<00:02:11.430> some<00:02:12.030> sort<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.420> block<00:02:12.750> but

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
whoa or something some sort of block but

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.580 
whoa or something some sort of block but
if<00:02:13.440> you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
if you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.100 
if you
kirti<00:02:13.830> careful<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.400> zoom<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.840> blocks

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
kirti careful and zoom in so the blocks

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.320 
kirti careful and zoom in so the blocks
that<00:02:16.260> are<00:02:16.319> on<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.530> ground<00:02:16.800> r<00:02:17.129> square<00:02:17.760> patterns

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
that are on the ground r square patterns

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.070 
that are on the ground r square patterns
they're<00:02:18.660> flat<00:02:19.019> like<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.709> squares<00:02:20.069> are

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
they're flat like the squares are

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.940 
they're flat like the squares are
horizontal<00:02:22.080> my<00:02:22.230> dad<00:02:22.379> not<00:02:22.530> vertical

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
horizontal my dad not vertical

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.009 
horizontal my dad not vertical
horizontal<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.940> it's<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.540> they're<00:02:24.660> flat

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
horizontal and it's like they're flat

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.839 
horizontal and it's like they're flat
across<00:02:25.379> it<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:25.860> if<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.340> look<00:02:26.459> at<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.580> walls

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
across it and if you look at the walls

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.150 
across it and if you look at the walls
you<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.569> see<00:02:27.750> at<00:02:28.080> where<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.650> torches<00:02:29.010> are

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
you can see at where the torches are

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.800 
you can see at where the torches are
they're<00:02:29.519> flat<00:02:29.849> too<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:30.420> then<00:02:30.540> right

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
they're flat too but then right

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.420 
they're flat too but then right
underneath<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.260> they're<00:02:31.560> diagonal<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.400> I

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
underneath that they're diagonal so I

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.910 
underneath that they're diagonal so I
don't<00:02:32.670> know<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.780> means<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> same

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
don't know if this means it's the same

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.119 
don't know if this means it's the same
pattern<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:35.930> like<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> same<00:02:37.500> block<00:02:37.860> so

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
pattern on like on the same block so

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.430 
pattern on like on the same block so
let's<00:02:38.340> say<00:02:38.519> these<00:02:39.209> are<00:02:39.239> all<00:02:39.599> wool<00:02:40.170> or

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
let's say these are all wool or

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.430 
let's say these are all wool or
something<00:02:40.799> which<00:02:41.310> i'm<00:02:41.519> not<00:02:41.849> sure<00:02:42.120> well<00:02:42.959> no<00:02:43.260> I

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
something which i'm not sure well no I

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.650 
something which i'm not sure well no I
mean<00:02:43.500> unless<00:02:43.950> they're<00:02:44.250> going<00:02:44.519> for<00:02:44.730> them<00:02:45.540> not

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
mean unless they're going for them not

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.300 
mean unless they're going for them not
to<00:02:45.810> look<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:45.989> well<00:02:46.380> then<00:02:46.620> obviously<00:02:46.920> they

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
to look like well then obviously they

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.180 
to look like well then obviously they
you<00:02:47.670> know<00:02:47.700> hit<00:02:48.209> home<00:02:48.420> run<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.380> if<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.650> just

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
you know hit home run but like if I just

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.530 
you know hit home run but like if I just
by<00:02:50.280> looking<00:02:50.610> at<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.760> if<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.000> had<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.209> guess<00:02:51.390> what

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
by looking at it if I had to guess what

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.930 
by looking at it if I had to guess what
it<00:02:51.690> was<00:02:51.989> i<00:02:52.260> would<00:02:52.530> say<00:02:52.709> stay<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:52.980> clay<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.549> mean

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
it was i would say stay in clay I mean

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.339 
it was i would say stay in clay I mean
I'm<00:02:54.030> just<00:02:54.180> throwing<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.420> out<00:02:54.540> there<00:02:54.599> I'm<00:02:55.049> not

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
I'm just throwing it out there I'm not

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.530 
I'm just throwing it out there I'm not
