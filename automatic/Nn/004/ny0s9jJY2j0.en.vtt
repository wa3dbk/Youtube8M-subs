00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:37.869
 windows 8 has yusbi 30 but more about that 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:44.830

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.910
 drives directly maternal itself 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.290
 Here is such a mother 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:52.459
 it does what it does not protect Chips 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:57.630
 damage is put it easy and deals 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:02.850
 we are not friendly with the installation of the processor 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:08.280
 let's see her connectors begin stylish 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:13.670

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:31.340

 unattended operating system 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:59.370
 It drives you can have in mind not to drive 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.640
 hard and with the help of windows and installations 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:10.140
 up to 2 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:15.770
 such a plan goes sata 6 gigabytes per 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:24.980
 second transmission goes direct 11 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:29.850

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.720
 will work well 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:56.220
 the basis for the assembly is not the most expensive on 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:59.240
 normal computer is supposed to 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.240
 backside 

00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:12.369
