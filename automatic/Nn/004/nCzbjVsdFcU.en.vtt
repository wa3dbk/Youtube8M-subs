that there is a lot of detail going on

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.319 
that there is a lot of detail going on
here<00:00:52.620> i<00:00:52.649> mean<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.280> eyes<00:00:53.460> they<00:00:53.850> look<00:00:54.059> kind<00:00:54.300> of

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
here i mean the eyes they look kind of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.959 
here i mean the eyes they look kind of
like<00:00:54.390> stickers<00:00:54.780> i'm<00:00:55.079> not<00:00:55.230> sure<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.710> they<00:00:55.829> are

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
like stickers i'm not sure if they are

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.400 
like stickers i'm not sure if they are
they<00:00:56.969> might<00:00:57.239> be<00:00:57.390> painted<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.899> they<00:00:58.170> kind<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
they might be painted on they kind of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.510 
they might be painted on they kind of
look<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.590> stickers<00:00:58.920> though<00:00:59.160> i<00:00:59.190> haven't

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
look like stickers though i haven't

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.279 
look like stickers though i haven't
really<00:00:59.789> looked<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> mouth<00:01:01.079> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
really looked it up but the mouth is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.080 
really looked it up but the mouth is
actually<00:01:01.680> indented<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.399> kirby<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.059> a

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
actually indented on kirby it's not a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.560 
actually indented on kirby it's not a
sticker<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.660> actually<00:01:03.989> carved<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
sticker they actually carved it out and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.090 
sticker they actually carved it out and
overall<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:06.840> Kirby<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> really<00:01:07.920> good

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
overall I think Kirby is a really good

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.399 
overall I think Kirby is a really good
looking<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.520> me<00:01:08.670> Bo<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.060> mean<00:01:09.570> his<00:01:09.840> color<00:01:10.140> looks

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
looking at me Bo I mean his color looks

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.260 
looking at me Bo I mean his color looks
a<00:01:10.560> little<00:01:10.799> bit<00:01:10.979> pale<00:01:11.280> compared<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.030> he<00:01:12.090> is

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
a little bit pale compared to what he is

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.440 
a little bit pale compared to what he is
in<00:01:12.450> video<00:01:12.689> games<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.130> might<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.729> me

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
in video games but that might just be me

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.480 
in video games but that might just be me
and<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> way<00:01:16.170> I'm<00:01:16.439> looking<00:01:16.770> at<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.310> don't

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and the way I'm looking at it I don't

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670 
and the way I'm looking at it I don't
really<00:01:17.700> know<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.990> think<00:01:19.140> he<00:01:19.500> looks

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
really know but I think he looks

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
really know but I think he looks
accurate<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.280> terms<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.850> his

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
accurate in terms of you know his

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.820 
accurate in terms of you know his
proportions<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.930> these<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.530> pretty<00:01:22.680> much

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
proportions and these are pretty much

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.170 
proportions and these are pretty much
straight<00:01:23.130> out<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.280> Smash<00:01:23.580> Brothers<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
straight out of Smash Brothers the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
straight out of Smash Brothers the
trophies<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.560> nice<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.770> they<00:01:26.040> use

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
trophies and it's nice that they use

notice and another thing that I kind of

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.069 
notice and another thing that I kind of
don't<00:02:24.310> like<00:02:24.549> is<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.819> crack<00:02:25.269> on<00:02:25.569> Kirby's

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
don't like is the crack on Kirby's

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.860 
don't like is the crack on Kirby's
backside<00:02:27.000> what<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> nice<00:02:28.239> place<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.540> put<00:02:28.840> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
backside what a nice place to put a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.080 
backside what a nice place to put a
crack<00:02:29.140> there<00:02:29.799> is<00:02:30.069> a<00:02:30.219> crack<00:02:30.489> going<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.909> whole

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
crack there is a crack going the whole

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.569 
crack there is a crack going the whole
way<00:02:31.150> along<00:02:31.480> his<00:02:32.170> back<00:02:32.409> and<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:33.129> actually<00:02:33.250> does

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
way along his back and it actually does

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.429 
way along his back and it actually does
go<00:02:33.670> around<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.329> front<00:02:34.359> to<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.989> can<00:02:35.139> see<00:02:35.349> it

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
go around the front to you can see it

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.199 
go around the front to you can see it
and<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:36.040> guess<00:02:36.310> they<00:02:36.459> needed<00:02:36.730> somewhere<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
and I guess they needed somewhere to

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.839 
and I guess they needed somewhere to
attach<00:02:37.689> two<00:02:38.019> pieces<00:02:38.530> I'm<00:02:39.430> not<00:02:39.549> really<00:02:39.730> sure

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
attach two pieces I'm not really sure

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.339 
attach two pieces I'm not really sure
why<00:02:40.150> they<00:02:40.269> couldn't<00:02:40.450> make<00:02:40.659> this<00:02:40.780> all<00:02:41.019> one

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
why they couldn't make this all one

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.709 
why they couldn't make this all one
piece<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:42.430> don't<00:02:42.909> know<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.090> didn't<00:02:43.389> make<00:02:43.510> them

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:43.719 
piece I don't know I didn't make them

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.750 
piece I don't know I didn't make them
but<00:02:44.379> it'd<00:02:44.500> be<00:02:44.530> nice<00:02:44.799> if<00:02:44.859> this<00:02:45.250> scene<00:02:45.519> was

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
but it'd be nice if this scene was

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.280 
but it'd be nice if this scene was
hidden<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.090> little<00:02:46.299> bit<00:02:46.389> more<00:02:46.599> you<00:02:47.139> can

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
hidden a little bit more you can

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.379 
hidden a little bit more you can
actually<00:02:47.470> see<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.859> seam<00:02:48.189> on<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.519> top<00:02:48.879> of<00:02:48.909> him<00:02:49.180> to

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
actually see a seam on the top of him to

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.659 
actually see a seam on the top of him to
going<00:02:49.840> like<00:02:50.109> across<00:02:50.889> the<00:02:51.189> top<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.519> his<00:02:51.639> head

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
going like across the top of his head

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.899 
going like across the top of his head
and<00:02:52.030> down<00:02:52.150> his<00:02:52.329> arms<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:54.250> not<00:02:54.549> super

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
and down his arms it's not super

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.280 
and down his arms it's not super

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
looked pretty good as well because I

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.339 
looked pretty good as well because I
think<00:04:25.150> they<00:04:25.360> look<00:04:25.479> really<00:04:25.840> good<00:04:26.050> because

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
think they look really good because

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:26.850 
think they look really good because
they're<00:04:26.469> very

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
they're very

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.619 
they're very
symbol<00:04:27.129> and<00:04:27.310> there's<00:04:27.520> not<00:04:27.759> a<00:04:27.789> huge<00:04:28.210> amount<00:04:28.419> of

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:28.629 
symbol and there's not a huge amount of

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:30.119 
symbol and there's not a huge amount of
detail<00:04:28.960> so<00:04:29.139> they<00:04:29.259> look<00:04:29.409> simple<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:29.889> they<00:04:29.949> look

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:30.129 
detail so they look simple and they look

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.129 
detail so they look simple and they look
clean<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:31.210> really<00:04:31.479> can't<00:04:31.719> mess<00:04:31.870> it<00:04:31.930> up

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
clean and you really can't mess it up

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.740 
clean and you really can't mess it up
that<00:04:32.349> much<00:04:32.530> but<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.729> think<00:04:34.360> Kirby<00:04:34.629> is

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
that much but I think Kirby is

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.659 
that much but I think Kirby is
definitely<00:04:35.139> in<00:04:35.229> the<00:04:35.289> top<00:04:35.319> three<00:04:35.889> of<00:04:36.099> the<00:04:36.520> best

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
definitely in the top three of the best

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.249 
definitely in the top three of the best
looking<00:04:36.849> at<00:04:37.120> me<00:04:37.210> goes<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:37.599> far<00:04:37.840> i<00:04:37.900> drank

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
looking at me goes so far i drank

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.140 
looking at me goes so far i drank

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
Pikachu up there as well I didn't see

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.730
