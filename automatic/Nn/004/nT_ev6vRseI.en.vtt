00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.000
 not 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.070
 hello my name is olivier I am 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.780
 football coach and today I 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.430
 will teach you to juggle well 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.600
 juggling are technical gestures that 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.699
 will lead you to apprehend a lot 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.600
 better the air balloons but we 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.820
 will also see that there is a great 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 utility on articular flexibility and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.610
 the bullet strikes I'm going to you 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.530
 show a few gestures first the 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.620
 classic juggling foot right foot 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.620
 left 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.669
 this juggling and the classic juggling 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.710
 then and right foot left that brings 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.600
 also some coordination in the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.860
 feet and who will teach you better 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.539
 apprehend as I told you all 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.319
 on time the balloons that come from 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.269
 aerial way 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:43.800
 we can also work on the 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.449
 juggling joint flexibility like 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.600
 I explained it to you by juggling 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.600
 varied kick indoor outdoor 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.769
 on this juggling 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.479
 we have seen the openness and 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.799
 the hip closure that has a 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.929
 repeating work will allow a 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.589
 better joint flexibility of the 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.239
 pelvic girdle 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.500
 as I told him just now 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.330
 is also an application on the typing 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.700
 ball for that I'm going to realize a 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.620
 juggling foot a little more at the foot 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.810
 in tray with the tip of feet towards 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.810
 the horizon and the balloon that does not turn 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.219
 juggling and in most gestures 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.479
 football techniques that's why 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.909
 that it will be necessary to arm you with patience 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.460
 during your debut and even take some 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.460
 techniques such as a rebound between 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.219
 each juggle to apprehend a little 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.079
 better the balloon and appreciate the 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.030
 trajectory of this one the juggling at 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.579
 many variants small an arrested 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.350
 secondly in motion and also 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.520
 some crystal applications but 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.229
 that we will not find on the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.119
 field at matches and I'm going 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.289
 finish by telling you this a good 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.090
 jugglers is not necessarily a good 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.009
 footballer but any good footballer 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.179
 it's bound to be juggling today 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.380
 have seen the different types of 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:54.090
 juggling and their application 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.590
 we'll see in an upcoming video 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.590
 how to learn how to warm up
