bringing me back to another question and
at<00:01:50.130> first<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.490> thought<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.810> was

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
at first I thought it was because I was

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.780 
at first I thought it was because I was
getting<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.530> wrong<00:01:52.680> answer<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.759> was

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
getting the wrong answer and I was

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.969 
getting the wrong answer and I was
asking<00:01:54.149> me<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.600> ask<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.649> know<00:01:55.740> answer

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
asking me to ask that you know answer

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.530 
asking me to ask that you know answer

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that question again but now that's the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.230 
that question again but now that's the
right<00:01:57.750> answer<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.969> see
