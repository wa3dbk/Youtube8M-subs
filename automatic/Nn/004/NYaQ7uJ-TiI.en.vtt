in my full opinion those sort of things

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
in my full opinion those sort of things
should<00:00:34.800> not<00:00:34.950> be<00:00:35.160> played<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.399> video<00:00:35.730> games<00:00:35.940> or

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
there we all played call duty and it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
there we all played call duty and it
would<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.670> fucking<00:01:41.909> annoying<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.710> I'm

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
would just be fucking annoying and I'm

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.350 
would just be fucking annoying and I'm
sure<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.250> way<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.549> another<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.030> game<00:01:45.210> will

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
