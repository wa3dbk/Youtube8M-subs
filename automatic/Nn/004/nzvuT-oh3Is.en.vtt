00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.519
 Let's enter and enter the character in Excel first 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.510
 One 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.109
 Have 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.700
 Burn 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.700
 Hmm 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.950
 Edo 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.500
 Is a form saying I, for example, 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.010
 I want to buy to the character grave 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.440
 I want to change the letter of an apple to red 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.989
 How is it time ? 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:59.520
 I guess this is the upper menu bar of the child 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.870
 Such a home is written on the right side of here 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.510
 red 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.800
 There is a red line below 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.300
 You can change the color of the text here 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:17.350
 I can do various things but here 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:20.430
 It's a lot of different things It's red or it's light orange 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.820
 But I will change the color in this way 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.840
 Since Imariï½°such also wrote in red 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.719
 Put together the cursor to the place of the red 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.719
 8 Press left mouse click 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.270
 When was I am 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.730
 in this way 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.720
 The character turns red 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.800
 Let's change the oranges a little 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.409
 Orange 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:54.180
 I'm in the middle, so I can't tell a little 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.340
 In the later you do not change the color of this character 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.830
 If you want to change the color of 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:06.250
 At that time it's about this character 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:11.030
 There is a place like a fill on the left side of the place to change the color 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.980
 Order from here you can change the color of the cell 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.210
 This time is yellow so I will 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:23.250
