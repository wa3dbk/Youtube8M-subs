I got about 153 images once you have all
your<00:00:17.010> images<00:00:17.369> imported<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.210> want<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> go<00:00:18.570> over

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.620 
your images imported you want to go over
to<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.760> actually<00:00:20.760> click<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.300> add

to the right and actually click the add
clips<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.619> conversion<00:00:23.310> list<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.789> then

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
clips to the conversion list and then

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029 
clips to the conversion list and then
just<00:00:24.090> click<00:00:24.269> convert<00:00:24.720> all<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
just click convert all it's going to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.820 
just click convert all it's going to
convert<00:00:26.789> all<00:00:27.060> those<00:00:27.449> images<00:00:27.930> into<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> single

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
convert all those images into a single

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.790 
convert all those images into a single
AVI<00:00:29.250> file<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.420> once<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:30.869> done<00:00:31.080> proceed<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
AVI file so once that's done proceed to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.950 
AVI file so once that's done proceed to
step<00:00:31.980> two<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.489> then<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.270> bring<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.600> down<00:00:33.750> on

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
step two and then just bring it down on

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.470 
step two and then just bring it down on
the<00:00:34.079> timeline<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:35.460> could<00:00:35.610> hit<00:00:35.820> play<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.300> just

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the timeline you could hit play and just

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000 
the timeline you could hit play and just
watch<00:00:36.630> your<00:00:36.870> time-lapse<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.590> it'll<00:00:37.770> just

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
watch your time-lapse and it'll just

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.340 
watch your time-lapse and it'll just
work<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.210> automatically<00:00:40.079> does<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
work it just automatically does it

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.319 
work it just automatically does it
because<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.160> said<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.520> takes<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:42.059> those

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
because like I said it takes all those

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.470 
because like I said it takes all those
images<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.079> makes<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.160> single<00:00:44.520> AVI<00:00:45.090> file

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
images and makes it one single AVI file

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.200 
images and makes it one single AVI file
which<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> video<00:00:46.140> file<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.000> could

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
which is a video file so then you could

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.910 
which is a video file so then you could
just<00:00:48.239> mess<00:00:48.840> around<00:00:48.870> with<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> colors<00:00:49.739> they

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
just mess around with the colors they

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.160 
just mess around with the colors they
have<00:00:49.950> different<00:00:50.370> presets<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.090> as<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> said<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
have different presets and as I said in

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
have different presets and as I said in
my<00:00:52.199> previous<00:00:52.500> video<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.340> also<00:00:53.489> manually

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
my previous video you can also manually

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.299 
my previous video you can also manually
adjust<00:00:54.750> all<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> colors<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> exposure<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
adjust all the colors the exposure the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.000 
adjust all the colors the exposure the
contrast<00:00:56.879> saturation<00:00:57.559> once<00:00:58.559> you're<00:00:58.710> happy

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
contrast saturation once you're happy

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.319 
contrast saturation once you're happy
with<00:00:59.160> all<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.489> colors<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.030> could<00:01:00.149> also

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
with all the colors you could also

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.260 
with all the colors you could also
adjust<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:01.530> speed<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.609> time-lapse<00:01:03.030> if

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
adjust that speed of the time-lapse if

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
adjust that speed of the time-lapse if
you<00:01:03.359> want<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.809> faster<00:01:04.439> or<00:01:04.619> slower<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
you want it to be faster or slower it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.219 
you want it to be faster or slower it
depends<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.540> want<00:01:06.840> here<00:01:07.110> I'm

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
depends on what you really want here I'm

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.230 
depends on what you really want here I'm
just<00:01:07.409> slowing<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.830> down<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.610> how

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
just slowing it down just to see how

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.719 
just slowing it down just to see how
slow<00:01:09.570> it'll<00:01:09.900> actually<00:01:10.080> go<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.220> sped<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.549> up

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
slow it'll actually go then I sped it up

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.270 
slow it'll actually go then I sped it up
a<00:01:11.850> little<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.270> hit<00:01:12.689> play<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.979> played<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
a little bit hit play and it played a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.310 
a little bit hit play and it played a
little<00:01:14.549> faster<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> think<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.930> went<00:01:16.140> with

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
little faster but I think I went with

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.910 
little faster but I think I went with
the<00:01:16.759> hundred-percent<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
the hundred-percent just what it

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.530 
the hundred-percent just what it
defaulted<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.759> was<00:01:20.880> happy<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.299> that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
defaulted to and I was happy with that

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.240 
defaulted to and I was happy with that
once<00:01:21.960> you've<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.170> your<00:01:22.350> video<00:01:22.619> perfect

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
once you've got your video perfect

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.950 
once you've got your video perfect
you're<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.759> export<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.540> went

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you're going to want to export it I went

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.560 
you're going to want to export it I went

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000

full HD 1080p h.264 exporting it to my
computer<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.310> exporting<00:01:35.850> pretty<00:01:36.060> quick

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
computer and it's exporting pretty quick

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.510 
computer and it's exporting pretty quick
it's<00:01:36.689> not<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.170> big<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.560> file<00:01:37.799> so<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.369> mean

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it's not that big of a file so I mean

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.730 
it's not that big of a file so I mean
it's<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> take<00:01:39.270> forever<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.869> it's

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
it's not going to take forever and it's

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.319 
it's not going to take forever and it's
pretty<00:01:41.009> much<00:01:41.189> done<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.700> let's<00:01:41.880> check<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.119> out

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
pretty much done so let's check it out
