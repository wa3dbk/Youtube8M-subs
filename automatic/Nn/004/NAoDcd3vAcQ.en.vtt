mini front bike seat which is made for
toddlers<00:00:22.170> now<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> get<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> better

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
toddlers now to get a better

toddlers now to get a better
understanding<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.269> route<00:00:24.570> let's<00:00:25.170> break

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
understanding of this route let's break

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.650 
understanding of this route let's break
it<00:00:25.680> down<00:00:25.710> into<00:00:26.160> its<00:00:26.189> various<00:00:26.699> components<00:00:27.300> it's

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it down into its various components it's

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.300 
it down into its various components it's
essentially<00:00:28.260> comprised<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.949> three

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
essentially comprised of three

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
essentially comprised of three
interconnected<00:00:29.699> hills<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.050> let's<00:00:31.289> take<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
interconnected hills so let's take a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.650 
interconnected hills so let's take a
look<00:00:31.740> at<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.920> configuration<00:00:32.399> we'll<00:00:33.300> start

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
look at this configuration we'll start

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.889 
look at this configuration we'll start
with<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> long<00:00:34.200> uphill<00:00:34.500> climb<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.489> rising<00:00:36.329> 72

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
with a long uphill climb here rising 72

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.780 
with a long uphill climb here rising 72
feet<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.260> elevation<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.250> street<00:00:38.579> then

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
feet in elevation the street then

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.910 
feet in elevation the street then
straightens<00:00:39.450> out<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> short<00:00:40.050> block<00:00:40.590> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
straightens out for a short block and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.400 
straightens out for a short block and
then<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.610> hit<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> second<00:00:42.690> hill<00:00:42.870> which

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
then we hit up with a second hill which

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.069 
then we hit up with a second hill which
itself<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:43.980> an<00:00:44.250> elevation<00:00:44.700> climb<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.120> 47<00:00:45.870> feet

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
itself has an elevation climb of 47 feet

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.260 
itself has an elevation climb of 47 feet
the<00:00:46.649> street<00:00:46.980> thing<00:00:47.190> goes<00:00:47.399> down<00:00:47.789> hill<00:00:48.090> aways

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the street thing goes down hill aways

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.690 
the street thing goes down hill aways
and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.350> finally<00:00:49.680> hits<00:00:50.010> up<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> third

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
and then it finally hits up with a third

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.150 
and then it finally hits up with a third
hill<00:00:50.969> which<00:00:51.449> rises<00:00:51.780> 26<00:00:52.649> feet<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.039> elevation

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
hill which rises 26 feet in elevation

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.819 
hill which rises 26 feet in elevation
and<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.300> we<00:00:54.480> bicycle<00:00:55.079> our<00:00:55.199> way<00:00:55.320> back<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
and then we bicycle our way back to the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.069 
and then we bicycle our way back to the
starting<00:00:56.190> point<00:00:56.399> now<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.840> each

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
starting point now we see that each

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.049 
starting point now we see that each
Hills<00:00:58.379> elevation<00:00:58.980> climb<00:00:59.250> gets<00:00:59.520> shorter<00:01:00.000> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
Hills elevation climb gets shorter and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.759 
Hills elevation climb gets shorter and
shorter<00:01:00.180> from<00:01:01.050> 72<00:01:01.800> feet<00:01:02.210> 47<00:01:03.210> feet<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> 26<00:01:04.559> feet

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
shorter from 72 feet 47 feet and 26 feet

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.090 
shorter from 72 feet 47 feet and 26 feet
however<00:01:05.489> realize<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.689> each<00:01:06.900> Hill<00:01:07.200> also<00:01:07.799> gets

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
however realize that each Hill also gets

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.280 
however realize that each Hill also gets
successively<00:01:08.850> steeper<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.630> steeper<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
successively steeper and steeper and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.320 
successively steeper and steeper and
that<00:01:10.830> makes<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.280> particular<00:01:11.850> figure<00:01:12.090> eight

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that makes this particular figure eight

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
that makes this particular figure eight

route naturally calibrate it to work

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.010 
route naturally calibrate it to work

and<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.830> also<00:01:17.009> hits<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.490> cardiovascular

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and it also hits your cardiovascular

three<00:01:20.970> laps<00:01:21.000> around<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.659> figure<00:01:21.990> 8<00:01:22.170> which

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
three laps around this figure 8 which

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.320 
three laps around this figure 8 which
means<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> cumulative<00:01:23.580> distance

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
means that the cumulative distance

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.170 
means that the cumulative distance
traveled<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.900> 2.1<00:01:25.770> miles<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.939> total
