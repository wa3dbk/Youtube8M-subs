00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.570
 hi how about this excuse the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.680
 delays but the video is already 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:11.990
 I let's see circular to the 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.830
 bands since they are higher and lower 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:24.790
 the minor of 7 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:28.570
 they are four more shades that would be down 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:33.190
 up and one two three and then up 1 2 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:38.940
 3 that leads 123 once again starts to 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:42.430
 down up and 123 up 1 2 3 up 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.470
 2 3 up until it works well 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.790
 I want it to work out because they are 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.070
 battling some with this respite 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.629
 then let's do it now because yes 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.629
 have it come on the sun chord 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.120
 with 23 points 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.120
 3 above 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.720
 23 above 123 above 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 then the minor 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:17.320
 is up 23 life 23 and 7 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.979
 once again I am 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.550
 I want you to practice a lot because one 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.550
 it is complicated suffers and sarasola 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.490
 the least 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.610
 that's all I want you to practice 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.770
 well practice the changes of 7 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.189
 go to sun of sun to my minor do 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.619
 all that you do them exactly fast 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.890
 if it is more possible that they can for 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.509
 that I am gas followed by the contribution that we 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.970
 hear the difference that separated and 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.530
 stops though well then many 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.530
 thank you I hope you practice
