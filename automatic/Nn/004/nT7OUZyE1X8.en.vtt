again<00:00:11.490> about<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.440> Apple<00:00:13.440> grading<00:00:13.860> process

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
again about the Apple grading process

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.810 
again about the Apple grading process
and<00:00:15.020> this<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> stage<00:00:16.560> where<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.580> are

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
and this is a stage where we are

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.960 
and this is a stage where we are
selecting<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.990> genotypes<00:00:19.650> for<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.730> fruit

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
selecting the genotypes for the fruit

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.439 
selecting the genotypes for the fruit
quality<00:00:21.380> so<00:00:22.380> after<00:00:23.070> having<00:00:23.279> produced<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.240> one

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449

rootstock<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> field<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.349> seen

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
rootstock on the field as we have seen

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.690 
rootstock on the field as we have seen
in<00:00:29.240> spring<00:00:30.240> these<00:00:30.769> plants<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.949> planted<00:00:32.489> in

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
in spring these plants are planted in

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.500 
in spring these plants are planted in
the<00:00:33.239> first<00:00:33.690> field<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:35.300> you<00:00:36.300> see

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the first field like here you see

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.229 
the first field like here you see
normally<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.260> 50<00:00:38.010> centimeters<00:00:38.700> distance

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
normally on 50 centimeters distance

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.130 
normally on 50 centimeters distance
they're<00:00:40.140> planted<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.739> every<00:00:41.129> tree<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
they're planted and every tree here is a

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.810 
they're planted and every tree here is a
genotype<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.379> an<00:00:43.620> individual<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.430> different

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
genotype is an individual is different

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.440 
genotype is an individual is different
and<00:00:45.350> every<00:00:46.350> tree<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.920> has<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.489> potential<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and every tree here has the potential to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.049 
and every tree here has the potential to
become<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.989> variety<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.770> course<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.460> cannot<00:00:50.730> use

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
become a variety of course we cannot use

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.709 
become a variety of course we cannot use
thousands<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:52.789> varieties<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
thousands of varieties so we have to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.380 
thousands of varieties so we have to
select<00:00:54.980> but<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> first<00:00:56.520> year<00:00:56.850> they<00:00:57.270> are

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
select but in the first year they are

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.959 
select but in the first year they are
not<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:58.260> blooming<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.129> they<00:00:59.219> don't<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.699> fruit

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
not a blooming and they don't have fruit

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.119 
not a blooming and they don't have fruit
so<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.809> look<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> trees<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> second

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
so we look at the trees in the second

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.870 
so we look at the trees in the second
year<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> second<00:01:08.070> year<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> trees<00:01:08.640> are

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
year so in the second year the trees are

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
year so in the second year the trees are
already<00:01:09.090> bigger<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.680> you'll<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.040> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
already bigger like here you'll see a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.730 
already bigger like here you'll see a
big<00:01:11.340> difference<00:01:11.720> they<00:01:12.720> are<00:01:12.869> all<00:01:13.110> ready

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
big difference they are all ready

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.820 
big difference they are all ready
fulfilling<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.970> filling<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> space<00:01:16.170> they

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
fulfilling and filling the space they

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.670 
fulfilling and filling the space they
have<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.369> course<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:19.020> would<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
have of course if this would be a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.039 
have of course if this would be a
professional<00:01:20.549> orchard<00:01:20.970> they<00:01:21.330> will<00:01:21.509> would<00:01:21.840> be

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
professional orchard they will would be

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.469 
professional orchard they will would be
here<00:01:22.320> tomorrow<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.939> hectares

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
here tomorrow but we don't have hectares

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.719 
here tomorrow but we don't have hectares
and<00:01:24.750> hectares<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:25.799> our<00:01:25.920> breeding<00:01:26.159> process

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
and hectares so for our breeding process

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.520 
and hectares so for our breeding process
we<00:01:26.909> are<00:01:27.000> using<00:01:27.210> about<00:01:27.450> four<00:01:27.840> hectares<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
we are using about four hectares and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
we are using about four hectares and
that's<00:01:28.979> enough<00:01:29.340> otherwise<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.299> would<00:01:30.689> have

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that's enough otherwise I would have

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.920 
that's enough otherwise I would have
problem<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.530> my<00:01:31.680> book<00:01:31.860> holding<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.689> see

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
problem with my book holding so you see

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.810 
problem with my book holding so you see
here<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.890> first<00:01:35.070> fruits<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
here we have the first fruits here a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.920 
here we have the first fruits here a
yellow<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.640> test<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.090> not

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
yellow one here so we can test it not

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.289 
yellow one here so we can test it not
very<00:01:40.229> nice<00:01:40.500> for<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.979> moment<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.119> is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
very nice for the moment but this is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.200 
very nice for the moment but this is
also<00:01:42.540> no<00:01:42.869> spray<00:01:43.320> orchard<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.520> our<00:01:44.729> breeding<00:01:45.000> we

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
also no spray orchard in our breeding we

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.960 
also no spray orchard in our breeding we
are<00:01:45.299> doing<00:01:45.689> almost<00:01:45.960> no<00:01:46.290> sprays<00:01:46.759> sometimes<00:01:47.759> we

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
are doing almost no sprays sometimes we

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.550 
are doing almost no sprays sometimes we
are<00:01:48.060> doing<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.479> or<00:01:48.509> two<00:01:48.659> sprays<00:01:49.049> during

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
are doing one or two sprays during

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.220 
are doing one or two sprays during
blooming<00:01:49.860> time<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.850> have

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
blooming time to have

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.140 
blooming time to have
not<00:01:53.230> as<00:01:53.530> special<00:01:53.890> escapes<00:01:54.370> trains<00:01:54.700> coming

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
not as special escapes trains coming

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.720 
not as special escapes trains coming
through<00:01:55.600> who<00:01:56.080> could<00:01:56.290> break<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:57.040> resistances

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
through who could break the resistances

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.630 
through who could break the resistances
we<00:01:57.910> have<00:01:58.120> bred<00:01:59.020> in<00:01:59.260> in<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.590> varieties<00:02:00.100> but

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
we have bred in in the varieties but

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.200 
we have bred in in the varieties but
otherwise<00:02:01.060> we<00:02:01.480> are<00:02:01.570> doing<00:02:01.840> here<00:02:02.050> no<00:02:02.320> sprays<00:02:03.210> so

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
otherwise we are doing here no sprays so

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.650 
otherwise we are doing here no sprays so
a<00:02:04.600> first<00:02:05.080> fruit<00:02:06.600> hmm<00:02:07.890> hi<00:02:08.890> as<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.310> tip<00:02:09.550> hi<00:02:10.270> super

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
a first fruit hmm hi as a tip hi super

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.780 
a first fruit hmm hi as a tip hi super
but<00:02:11.230> it's<00:02:11.410> too<00:02:11.530> early<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.830> select<00:02:12.250> because<00:02:12.430> you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
but it's too early to select because you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.600 
but it's too early to select because you
know<00:02:12.940> almost<00:02:13.510> no<00:02:14.230> none<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.010> trees<00:02:15.280> are

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
know almost no none of the trees are

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.330 
know almost no none of the trees are
fruiting<00:02:16.510> for<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.810> moment<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:17.620> go<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:18.220> the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
fruiting for the moment so we go to the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.960 
fruiting for the moment so we go to the
third<00:02:18.580> year<00:02:23.190> but<00:02:24.190> they<00:02:24.310> are<00:02:24.400> growing<00:02:24.640> here

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
third year but they are growing here

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.110 
third year but they are growing here
three<00:02:25.750> years<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.350> in<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.490> autumn<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:27.970> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
three years and in the autumn of the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.440 
three years and in the autumn of the
third<00:02:28.360> year<00:02:28.690> almost<00:02:29.200> all<00:02:29.380> trees<00:02:30.340> are<00:02:30.730> full<00:02:31.390> of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
third year almost all trees are full of

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:46.800 
third year almost all trees are full of
fruit<00:02:34.290> nope<00:02:35.320> we<00:02:35.500> have<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.740> go<00:02:35.890> further<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:45.810> see

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
fruit nope we have to go further you see

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.890 
fruit nope we have to go further you see
here<00:02:47.200> we<00:02:47.350> planted<00:02:47.860> on<00:02:48.040> 25<00:02:49.000> centimeters

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
here we planted on 25 centimeters

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.990 
here we planted on 25 centimeters
because<00:02:50.740> at<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.160> time<00:02:51.430> we<00:02:51.580> didn't<00:02:51.850> have

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
because at that time we didn't have

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.630 
because at that time we didn't have
enough<00:02:52.270> enough<00:02:52.990> playthrough<00:02:53.590> it's<00:02:53.709> very<00:02:54.430> very

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
enough enough playthrough it's very very

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.790 
enough enough playthrough it's very very
narrow<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.390> normally<00:02:55.810> there<00:02:55.900> planting<00:02:56.320> is<00:02:56.470> 50

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
narrow so normally there planting is 50

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.460 
narrow so normally there planting is 50
centimeters<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.580> here<00:02:58.030> now<00:02:58.360> we<00:02:58.959> have<00:02:58.989> fruits

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
centimeters and here now we have fruits

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.990 
centimeters and here now we have fruits
if<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.650> are<00:03:02.769> crossing<00:03:03.010> an<00:03:03.340> early<00:03:03.610> variety

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
if you are crossing an early variety

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.970

with an early barrage of course most of

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.540 
with an early barrage of course most of
the<00:03:06.550> varieties<00:03:07.030> will<00:03:07.239> have<00:03:07.600> fruit<00:03:08.260> also<00:03:08.620> early

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
the varieties will have fruit also early

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.970 
the varieties will have fruit also early
in<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.700> season<00:03:09.910> but<00:03:10.180> not<00:03:10.330> all<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:11.530> if<00:03:11.650> you<00:03:11.800> are

most<00:03:15.850> of<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.420> roots<00:03:16.660> will<00:03:16.930> crop<00:03:17.260> in<00:03:17.530> somewhere

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
most of the roots will crop in somewhere

in<00:03:18.610> September<00:03:19.060> or<00:03:19.120> October<00:03:19.239> but<00:03:20.140> not<00:03:20.410> all<00:03:20.709> so

it's a long time you have to go through

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.890 
it's a long time you have to go through
the<00:03:23.080> lines<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.530> testing<00:03:24.489> how<00:03:25.269> are<00:03:25.480> we<00:03:25.630> testing

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
the lines and testing how are we testing

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.250 
the lines and testing how are we testing
the<00:03:26.290> rice<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:26.970> look<00:03:27.970> with<00:03:28.150> me<00:03:28.330> so<00:03:28.780> we<00:03:28.930> are<00:03:29.019> going

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
the rice so look with me so we are going

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.890 
the rice so look with me so we are going
here<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:29.950> we<00:03:30.820> are<00:03:30.850> looking<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.269> see<00:03:31.480> here<00:03:31.750> the

here and we are looking you see here the

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.949 
here and we are looking you see here the
apples<00:03:32.730> some<00:03:33.730> have<00:03:34.000> already<00:03:34.269> been<00:03:34.570> picked

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
apples some have already been picked

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.420 
apples some have already been picked
some<00:03:35.830> aren't<00:03:36.510> fruit<00:03:37.510> thing<00:03:37.810> now<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.410> some<00:03:39.220> are

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
some aren't fruit thing now and some are

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.110 
some aren't fruit thing now and some are
full<00:03:39.670> of<00:03:39.940> fruit<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:40.980> how<00:03:41.980> are<00:03:42.190> we<00:03:42.220> selecting<00:03:42.580> so

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
full of fruit so how are we selecting so

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.910 
full of fruit so how are we selecting so
the<00:03:43.299> only<00:03:43.450> way<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.780> do<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.019> is<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.350> test<00:03:44.620> the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
the only way to do it is to test the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.130 
the only way to do it is to test the
varieties<00:03:45.519> to<00:03:45.640> eat<00:03:45.760> them<00:03:45.970> that's<00:03:46.420> reason<00:03:46.959> I'll

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
varieties to eat them that's reason I'll

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.000 
varieties to eat them that's reason I'll
always<00:03:47.739> with<00:03:48.220> life<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.720> here<00:03:50.019> take<00:03:50.799> this

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
always with life so here take this

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.470 
always with life so here take this
variety<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.850> take

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.050 

no<00:03:59.750> here<00:04:00.750> take<00:04:01.200> another<00:04:01.230> one<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:02.670> see<00:04:02.880> the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
no here take another one you see the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.229 
no here take another one you see the
differences<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:04.290> one<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.980> red<00:04:05.430> like<00:04:05.970> this

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
differences this one is red like this

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.570 
differences this one is red like this
and<00:04:07.580> this<00:04:08.580> one<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.970> sister<00:04:09.420> is<00:04:09.860> green<00:04:10.860> like

and this one the sister is green like

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.699 
and this one the sister is green like
Ronnie<00:04:11.940> Smith<00:04:12.239> like<00:04:12.569> this<00:04:13.050> is<00:04:13.200> possible

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
Ronnie Smith like this is possible

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.180 
Ronnie Smith like this is possible
though<00:04:14.040> they<00:04:14.489> are<00:04:14.700> sisters<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.600> course<00:04:16.530> if<00:04:16.980> the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
though they are sisters of course if the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.330 
though they are sisters of course if the
same<00:04:17.489> parents<00:04:18.090> but<00:04:19.079> they<00:04:19.290> are<00:04:19.380> so<00:04:19.680> different

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
same parents but they are so different

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:29.549 
same parents but they are so different
like<00:04:20.489> children<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.690> test<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.260> green<00:04:22.500> one

00:04:29.549 --> 00:04:29.559 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:33.149 

not<00:04:30.249> bad<00:04:30.549> and<00:04:30.789> this<00:04:31.629> is<00:04:31.689> the<00:04:31.989> reason<00:04:32.379> I<00:04:32.559> have

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:33.159 
not bad and this is the reason I have

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.639 
not bad and this is the reason I have
selected<00:04:33.759> this<00:04:33.909> one<00:04:34.119> you<00:04:34.599> see<00:04:34.809> then<00:04:35.319> I<00:04:35.439> make<00:04:35.619> a

looking<00:04:47.109> closer<00:04:47.379> at<00:04:47.589> this<00:04:47.769> variety<00:04:47.979> we<00:04:48.789> are

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
looking closer at this variety we are

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.019 
looking closer at this variety we are
taking<00:04:49.869> some<00:04:50.079> good<00:04:50.289> wood<00:04:50.409> and<00:04:50.699> next<00:04:51.699> clinker

taking some good wood and next clinker

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:53.609 
taking some good wood and next clinker
we<00:04:52.179> are<00:04:52.239> making<00:04:52.449> wind<00:04:52.809> to<00:04:52.929> graph<00:04:53.139> things<00:04:53.379> out

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:53.619 
we are making wind to graph things out

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:56.279 
we are making wind to graph things out
of<00:04:53.859> this<00:04:54.039> variety<00:04:54.459> to<00:04:54.849> plant<00:04:55.119> more<00:04:55.419> trees<00:04:55.449> who

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
of this variety to plant more trees who

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.709 
of this variety to plant more trees who
have<00:04:56.469> a<00:04:56.499> closer<00:04:56.889> look<00:04:57.039> to<00:04:57.819> this<00:04:57.999> number<00:04:58.389> and

00:04:58.709 --> 00:04:58.719 
have a closer look to this number and

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.139 
have a closer look to this number and
then<00:04:59.229> four<00:04:59.499> or<00:04:59.529> five<00:04:59.739> six<00:04:59.979> years<00:05:00.309> perhaps<00:05:00.489> it

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:01.149 
then four or five six years perhaps it

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:03.899 
then four or five six years perhaps it
will<00:05:01.419> become<00:05:01.749> a<00:05:01.989> variety<00:05:02.769> the<00:05:03.159> first<00:05:03.579> yellow

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:03.909 
will become a variety the first yellow

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:09.329 
will become a variety the first yellow
variety<00:05:04.539> of<00:05:04.949> Lumira<00:05:07.709> so<00:05:08.709> this<00:05:08.889> is<00:05:09.039> the<00:05:09.159> way

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:09.339 
variety of Lumira so this is the way

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.359 
variety of Lumira so this is the way
breathing<00:05:10.089> Rose<00:05:10.269> it<00:05:11.079> takes<00:05:11.349> a<00:05:11.499> long<00:05:11.739> long<00:05:11.769> time

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:12.369 
breathing Rose it takes a long long time
