00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.380
 Guys I also hope they were fine 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.060
 so we end up today with a 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.160
 gameplay will be mw2 to the sniper a 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.440
 nuclear attempt but how does 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.730
 not how to act yes it's easy with 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.440
 he took the microphone to colleagues at 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.700
 just that my two but who 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.900
 would they do that only 6 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.250
 who surround him and so I'm going to have to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.780
 take me out of business 19 who you go 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.210
 see if I will succeed or not in 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.170
 regards my class it's simple and guys 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.370
 intervention bullet shirt and with the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.050
 spring camouflage is really too much 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.399
 Stylish this camouflage there I like it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.440
 too much with regard to assets 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.609
 pass-pass diop and pro report 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.659
 to try to play a maximum at 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.100
 noise as given that I have a 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.589
 headphones you will see that this is a 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.089
 nice attempt that nuclear pardon 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.319
 but it's not an attempt at the ats 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.940
 to have been lying down not electric quads 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.499
 shot of the coop wedding from me i'm not 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.550
 a sniper monster I try to me 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:58.019
 get by with my level 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.190
 you'll see if I want to get it or not 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.449
 I warn you right now guys 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.589
 there will be moments of delay 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.479
 other times when I go over rock 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.949
 so you'll see for yourself in addition 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.240
 he forgets to specify he is solo so 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.290
 it's even more difficult so it's 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.770
 demolition for those who would have 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.150
 not understood 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.220
 so today we have a little message 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.270
 special to the rage community so to all 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.600
 the people who are watching you this 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.610
 video 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.320
 do not start thinking it's a blow 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.730
 mouth or make morals etc 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.020
 it's not at all that it's just that we 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.070
 you think was worth the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.050
 guy the french community 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.730
 despite her saying something about her when 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.960
 even qualities and defects so we 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.030
 decided to tell you a little bit 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.380
 that we think of the rabies community then 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.550
 roach to start know that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.260
 we team rage that is to say all the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.910
 kinds performing performance forgiveness and 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.020
 the commentators are trying to 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.280
 do your best to satisfy you 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 that is, when you do not use 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.640
 in the comments to make bo 2d 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.990
 coaching and we try to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.070
 satisfy you with doing what we 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.290
 simply says 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.330
 Besides, know that hypno has forbidden 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.770
 bacon center dga peace on ghost or 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.630
 even hardcore since you 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.890
 was not too hot for that we see 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.780
 we try to satisfy you as much as possible 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.220
 besides black of the same issues very 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.120
 complicated why it's not the game that is 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.350
 complicated in itself this is the 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.880
 community that makes that rage leaves 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.810
 so we leave a microstation ya plus 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.190
 no one in front you see that it's 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.720
 very complicated get out of the big massacre 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.650
 on black ops 2 but we try when 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.120
 even to the best vouvoyer 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.430
 holidays I tried to remake a little 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.590
 trick on mw2 solo and that's hoping 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.060
 that you will like more friends 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.610
 we're not going to lie about itno right now 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.380
 he breaks his ass to go up 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.480
 chained frankly it works that way forward 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.800
 little by little it's normal so you 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.420
 guys the subscribers go is that the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.380
 majority you follow the move you 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.540
 help me lakes etc 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.030
 but there are some minorities 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.770
 who insulted and so this is part 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.940
 I'll just ask you 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.680
 guys to respect the players 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.400
 performance even if you are not like 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.780
 lure a etc 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.520
 I take what was most j 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.200
 do not insult in the comments 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.030
 instead encouraged to watch them through 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.770
 example the english community doom clan 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.000
 full carnage and it's about a week 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.230
 I spoke to you at the studs of three 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.820
 times that their elders subscribers 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.540
 frankly encouraged them have had to 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.220
 play good guys 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.080
 savior is a frankly super mambo 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.470
 gameplay showing you propose it 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.700
 a lot 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.870
 Can you change that? 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.430
 comment there it will change everything on 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.350
 kind of performance it's going to tell themselves what they 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.430
 are right they motivated me so valley 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.959
 on another co afp while an author 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.520
 another comments another comment 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.200
 pardon that lasted in not the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.430
 sovereign hall pet zero etc 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.870
 you really believe that the player 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.520
 performant if he will be motivated no the 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.900
 guys so that's up to you guys to make a 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.070
 effort to motivate us when is 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.840
 even the French community have like 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.910
 we try to represent the community 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.780
 French maximum even if it's not 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.700
 easy every day 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.840
 it's clear especially that goss a game that 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.230
 was not appreciated by everyone 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.760
 anyway 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.230
 I tell you honestly 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.610
 personally kid I liked 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.780
 but the problem is that the community 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.400
 do not appreciate it so we can we can 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.959
 not too much out of the big stuff on it and 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.400
 if you moretti way will come out more than 200 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.840
 sorghum go out a chai not what a 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.280
 triple neck on ghost a triple kay 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.630
 month mound the frankly I told them 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.680
 not easily but we will say that 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.600
 I made them more easily than on 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.950
 bo 2 why because on goss and the 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.150
 current game there are many more people 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.140
 finally there is not much more 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.640
 world but the community is not like 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.080
 that of black ops 2 that is to say that 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.130
 snapped away not at all goes and his 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.180
 lands while on black ops the 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.560
 guy it's really very complicated to 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.850
 take out a good thing that is to say that 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.170
 when for example you're going to put a 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.820
 vital microstation either will be more 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.930
 person in front or so you go 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.370
 play solo you will fall against 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.750
 a group of six who play them only 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.190
 microstation and it's really broken 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.060
 fuck me besides small anecdote 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.190
 I tried to play black ops 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.570
 time with a group of two buddies one 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.640
 was sure we had fallen against a 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.290
 Spanish team play there run run drones 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.640
 microstation in full szymon their friends 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.810
 microstation they all left the 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.400
 party with connection to the author 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.690
 interrupted and there was no one left 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.700
 in front at the end of not even 30 seconds 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.049
 we saw bo2 it's really very 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.890
 complicated besides said in the 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.420
 comments what you would like 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.280
 see and like a nostalgia guys 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.420
 avoid insulting earlier and making 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.190
 constructive criticism I know that 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.630
 a lot of youtube hours again 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.370
 but it's really very important because 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.450
 why that will motivate youtuber that 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.979
 will tell him ah it's true that I have to 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.479
 improve in that maybe this 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.530
 gameplay the three supports any other 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.270
 wreck and I'll try the next 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.009
 time 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.960
 and if we will say two or three years 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.220
 all alone saw this really 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.500
 who will advance and not to 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.090
 a kind of no zesty animal 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.080
 laika it goes downright unmotivated the 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.389
 nobody and there will be more gameplay 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.650
 at all to finish anyway friends 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.449
 that's what he said yassin 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.009
 do not hesitate to help me lake in 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.210
 videos to encourage us to put some 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.009
 good feedback when you love, 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.539
 the gameplay in which I have guys 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.009
 it's a pleasure do not believe that a 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.389
 little jesus and the people they answer 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.590
 not or even when we do not respond to your 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.580
 comments it's not it's not 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.870
 the bed is not that sometimes we have 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.099
 no time for all to answer so 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.479
 do not hesitate to put what you 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.470
 think if you like not said why 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.669
 you do not have to show that the 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.750
 community do it's not the worst 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.550
 despite what many people 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.690
 tell me I am I am convinced that 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.370
 the French community is not the 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.659
 stone at the disadvantage finally there of 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.169
 qualities and flaws like all 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:03.669
 communities 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.900
 so friends are really counting on 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.190
 you to boost us especially that the 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.990
 new call of it will go out so we have 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.340
 need of you it's thanks to you that we 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.720
 want to go out of the gameplay if you 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.400
 are not there we stop youtube
