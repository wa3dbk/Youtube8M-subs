00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:13.660
 lucy my life was really cool and 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.660
 then came 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.660
 my life was still alive 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.660

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.939
 goose 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:36.700

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:51.879

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.060
 always harassed and improved 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.899
