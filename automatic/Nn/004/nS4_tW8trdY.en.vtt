year's or whatever they were placing
okay<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.579> replacing<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.360> D<00:01:03.629> 209

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
okay well this is replacing the D 209

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.529 
okay well this is replacing the D 209
which<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.619> brought<00:01:04.799> out<00:01:04.979> last<00:01:05.249> year<00:01:05.609> which<00:01:06.329> is

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
which we brought out last year which is

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.230 
which we brought out last year which is
was<00:01:06.899> a<00:01:07.100> in<00:01:08.100> tech<00:01:08.369> tire<00:01:08.670> meaning<00:01:09.090> new

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
was a in tech tire meaning new

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.239 
was a in tech tire meaning new
technology<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> technology<00:01:11.100> behind

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:11.249 
technology in the technology behind

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:13.160 
technology in the technology behind
these<00:01:11.520> tires<00:01:11.759> is<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.569> got<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.719> band

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
these tires is that it's got a band

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.440 
these tires is that it's got a band
around<00:01:13.530> them<00:01:13.829> which<00:01:14.399> makes<00:01:14.759> it<00:01:14.969> so<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> tire

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
around them which makes it so the tire

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.719 
around them which makes it so the tire
does<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:15.780> grow<00:01:16.079> at<00:01:16.350> speed<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.399> tire<00:01:17.579> does

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
does not grow at speed so the tire does

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.590 
does not grow at speed so the tire does
not<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:17.999> any<00:01:18.149> bigger

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
not get any bigger

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.499 
not get any bigger
so<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.929> gearing<00:01:19.229> does<00:01:20.159> not<00:01:20.340> change<00:01:20.729> which<00:01:21.359> is

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
so the gearing does not change which is

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.779 
so the gearing does not change which is
a<00:01:21.539> great<00:01:21.840> thing<00:01:21.869> for<00:01:22.109> racers<00:01:22.679> they<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.159> better

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
a great thing for racers they can better

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:25.699 
a great thing for racers they can better
set<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.329> their<00:01:24.450> bikes<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.840> way<00:01:24.959> and<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:25.709 
set up their bikes that way and the

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:27.139 
set up their bikes that way and the
other<00:01:25.740> thing<00:01:26.039> is<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.219> it<00:01:26.429> runs<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.670> real<00:01:26.850> low

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
other thing is that it runs a real low

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.699 
other thing is that it runs a real low
air<00:01:27.450> pressure<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:28.229> things<00:01:28.439> are<00:01:28.560> running

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
air pressure these things are running

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:31.039 
air pressure these things are running
about<00:01:28.920> 21<00:01:29.340> pounds<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.849> the<00:01:29.939> air<00:01:30.119> where<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
about 21 pounds in the air where in the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.349 
about 21 pounds in the air where in the
past<00:01:31.259> they've<00:01:31.469> run<00:01:31.679> around<00:01:31.889> 28<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.969> the

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
past they've run around 28 and the

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.429 
past they've run around 28 and the
reason<00:01:33.569> they<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:33.719> get<00:01:33.840> away<00:01:33.929> with<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.289> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
reason they can get away with that is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.349 
reason they can get away with that is
because<00:01:34.679> of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.859> design<00:01:35.219> of<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.429> tire<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
because of the design of the tire the

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.359 
because of the design of the tire the
sidewall<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.139> then<00:01:37.889> gives<00:01:38.039> it<00:01:38.099> a<00:01:38.189> bigger

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
sidewall and then gives it a bigger

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.609 
sidewall and then gives it a bigger
fatter<00:01:38.670> contact<00:01:39.539> patch<00:01:39.779> so<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.079> has<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:40.349> grip

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
fatter contact patch so it has more grip

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.029 
fatter contact patch so it has more grip
it's<00:01:41.520> also<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.819> triple<00:01:42.149> tread<00:01:42.569> tire<00:01:43.039> meaning

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
it's also a triple tread tire meaning

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.489 
it's also a triple tread tire meaning
that<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.909> sides<00:01:45.179> of<00:01:45.359> the<00:01:45.419> tire<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.109> you<00:01:46.289> say

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
that the sides of the tire if you say

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:48.949 
that the sides of the tire if you say
you<00:01:46.919> want<00:01:47.039> a<00:01:47.159> soft<00:01:47.549> tire<00:01:47.789> that<00:01:48.630> means<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
you want a soft tire that means the

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:50.809 
you want a soft tire that means the
sides<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.469> tire<00:01:49.649> are<00:01:49.770> soft<00:01:50.099> in<00:01:50.459> the<00:01:50.759> middle

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
sides of the tire are soft in the middle

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.239 
sides of the tire are soft in the middle
is<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.779> next<00:01:52.049> harder<00:01:52.469> compound<00:01:52.679> which<00:01:53.130> would

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
is the next harder compound which would

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.099 
is the next harder compound which would
be<00:01:53.369> approximately<00:01:53.669> a<00:01:54.060> medium<00:01:54.419> if<00:01:54.749> you<00:01:54.869> want<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
be approximately a medium if you want to

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.269 
be approximately a medium if you want to
meet<00:01:55.229> him<00:01:55.349> he'd<00:01:55.499> be<00:01:55.590> medium<00:01:55.889> on<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.069> sides

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:56.279 
meet him he'd be medium on the sides

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:59.809 
meet him he'd be medium on the sides
