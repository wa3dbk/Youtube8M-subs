00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
money on think all the over and which is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.640 
money on think all the over and which is
profit<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.720> way<00:02:49.810> they<00:02:49.959> frame<00:02:50.170> their<00:02:50.290> arts

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
one shot it's still most likely it's not

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.750 
one shot it's still most likely it's not
gonna<00:05:28.080> win<00:05:28.260> it's<00:05:28.410> only<00:05:28.500> 33%<00:05:28.979> like<00:05:29.370> you<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:29.610> win

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
think the perceived edge that's very

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.110 
think the perceived edge that's very
important<00:05:38.070> so<00:05:38.160> that's<00:05:38.310> what<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.460> tip<00:05:38.700> is<00:05:38.910> that's

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
mentality is rise she's got a big chance

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.440 
mentality is rise she's got a big chance
of<00:05:58.650> 28<00:05:58.950> to<00:05:59.070> 1<00:05:59.220> there's<00:05:59.820> a<00:05:59.850> couple<00:06:00.000> of<00:06:00.150> best<00:06:00.300> for

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
of 28 to 1 there's a couple of best for

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.820 
of 28 to 1 there's a couple of best for
later<00:06:00.600> in<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.840> year<00:06:00.870> to<00:06:00.990> watch<00:06:01.500> out<00:06:01.680> for

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
later in the year to watch out for

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.830 
later in the year to watch out for
Dublin<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.310> all-ireland<00:06:02.460> football<00:06:03.090> 71

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
Dublin the all-ireland football 71

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.080 
Dublin the all-ireland football 71
haven't<00:06:04.080> won<00:06:04.169> that<00:06:04.260> since<00:06:04.410> 1995<00:06:05.160> but<00:06:05.760> I<00:06:05.789> think

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
haven't won that since 1995 but I think

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.670 
haven't won that since 1995 but I think
there<00:06:06.300> are<00:06:06.390> coming<00:06:06.630> teams<00:06:06.840> semi-final<00:06:07.500> last

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
there are coming teams semi-final last

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.070 
there are coming teams semi-final last
year<00:06:08.039> and<00:06:08.220> I<00:06:09.090> think<00:06:09.570> they'll<00:06:09.690> do<00:06:09.810> well<00:06:09.930> in<00:06:10.020> the

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
year and I think they'll do well in the

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.330 
year and I think they'll do well in the
league<00:06:10.229> so<00:06:10.410> Dublin<00:06:10.680> are<00:06:10.800> a<00:06:10.860> great<00:06:11.010> price<00:06:11.190> at

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
league so Dublin are a great price at

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.950 
league so Dublin are a great price at
seven<00:06:11.580> to<00:06:11.669> one<00:06:11.789> and<00:06:12.060> also<00:06:12.479> one<00:06:12.660> thing<00:06:12.810> I'm

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
seven to one and also one thing I'm

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.150 
seven to one and also one thing I'm
always<00:06:13.169> going<00:06:13.410> on<00:06:13.470> about<00:06:13.560> we<00:06:13.860> all<00:06:13.979> have<00:06:14.130> our
