00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
worries me is that they played with the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.840 
worries me is that they played with the
number<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.500> seed<00:00:37.800> hanging<00:00:38.280> around<00:00:38.640> their

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
number one seed hanging around their

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.510

neck against against southern it's not

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.150

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the way you you do that you you play

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.590 
the way you you do that you you play
with<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> number<00:00:44.670> one<00:00:44.820> seed<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.270> Club

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
with the number one seed and you Club

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.850

the other team with it that's what

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160 
the other team with it that's what
you're<00:00:47.010> supposed<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.899> don't<00:00:48.960> think

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
you're supposed to do and I don't think

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.430 
you're supposed to do and I don't think
the<00:00:49.500> pressure<00:00:49.860> from<00:00:50.850> being<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.629> 1<00:00:51.870> seed<00:00:52.170> goes

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the pressure from being a 1 seed goes

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.930 
the pressure from being a 1 seed goes
away<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> you're<00:00:53.370> playing<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> eight

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
away now that you're playing the eight

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.410 
away now that you're playing the eight
nine<00:00:54.180> game<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:55.680> zaga<00:00:55.980> had<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.730> 16<00:00:57.210> game

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
nine game I can zaga had it in a 16 game

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.939 
nine game I can zaga had it in a 16 game
why<00:00:57.690> wouldn't<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.530> against<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
why wouldn't they have it against the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.950 
why wouldn't they have it against the
eight<00:00:59.129> maybe<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.059> would<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.329> away<00:01:00.629> once<00:01:00.870> you

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
eight maybe it would go away once you

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.770 
eight maybe it would go away once you
were<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> sweet<00:01:01.590> 16<00:01:02.000> but<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.600> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
were in the sweet 16 but if you if you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.450 
were in the sweet 16 but if you if you
felt<00:01:03.960> pressure<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.559> round<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:05.010> there's<00:01:05.250> no

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
felt pressure in round one there's no

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.370 
felt pressure in round one there's no
reason<00:01:05.850> why<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.060> wouldn't<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.689> round<00:01:06.930> two<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
reason why you wouldn't in round two and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.130 
reason why you wouldn't in round two and
that<00:01:07.860> worries<00:01:08.340> me<00:01:08.369> about<00:01:08.610> Gonzaga<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that worries me about Gonzaga this is a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.500 
that worries me about Gonzaga this is a
game<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.619> which<00:01:10.799> they're<00:01:11.010> much<00:01:11.280> more<00:01:12.060> skilled

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
game in which they're much more skilled

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.060 
game in which they're much more skilled
offensively<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.409> should<00:01:13.590> although

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
offensively they should although

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.530 
offensively they should although
certainly<00:01:14.400> Wichita<00:01:14.790> State<00:01:15.030> plays<00:01:15.240> great

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
certainly Wichita State plays great

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.690 
certainly Wichita State plays great
defense<00:01:15.770> they<00:01:16.770> should<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.070> able<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.400> score

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
defense they should be able to score

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.999 
defense they should be able to score
enough<00:01:17.970> points<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.390> win<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.960> remove<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
enough points to win if you remove the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.520 
enough points to win if you remove the
emotion<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> circumstance<00:01:21.540> from<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.049> but

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
emotion of the circumstance from it but

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.499 
emotion of the circumstance from it but
we<00:01:22.770> can't<00:01:23.070> remove<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.700> that's<00:01:23.939> why<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
we can't remove that that's why it's the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.990 
we can't remove that that's why it's the
tournament<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.580> Gonzaga

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
tournament and I think that the Gonzaga

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.460 
tournament and I think that the Gonzaga
has<00:01:27.150> got<00:01:27.330> some<00:01:27.540> trouble<00:01:27.869> ahead<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.200> them<00:01:28.320> right

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
has got some trouble ahead of them right

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.969 
has got some trouble ahead of them right
now

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
now

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.740 
now
yeah<00:01:29.189> would<00:01:29.369> certainly<00:01:29.640> appear<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.659> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
yeah would certainly appear so if you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.450 
yeah would certainly appear so if you
look<00:01:30.900> down<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.229> UPS<00:01:31.560> team<00:01:31.770> performance<00:01:32.159> index

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
going to have to guard well but it's a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.860 
going to have to guard well but it's a
team<00:03:20.100> that<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.549> very<00:03:20.640> balanced<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.570> will<00:03:21.690> take

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
team that is very balanced and will take

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.590 
team that is very balanced and will take
what<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.680> give<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.070> they<00:03:23.220> execute<00:03:23.820> well<00:03:24.030> they

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
what you give it they execute well they

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.750 
what you give it they execute well they
are<00:03:24.750> not<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> dynamic<00:03:25.440> offensive<00:03:26.400> team<00:03:26.580> but

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
are not a dynamic offensive team but

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.310 
are not a dynamic offensive team but
they<00:03:26.880> did<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> great<00:03:27.330> job<00:03:27.360> against<00:03:27.959> Pitt<00:03:28.140> which

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
they did a great job against Pitt which

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.550 
they did a great job against Pitt which
typically<00:03:28.830> plays<00:03:29.130> quite<00:03:30.120> quite<00:03:30.690> capable

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
typically plays quite quite capable

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.340 
typically plays quite quite capable
defense<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.790> maybe<00:03:33.540> maybe<00:03:33.900> they're<00:03:34.080> finding

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
defense so maybe maybe they're finding

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.289 
defense so maybe maybe they're finding
their<00:03:34.650> stride<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:35.010> little<00:03:35.190> bit<00:03:35.549> or<00:03:35.910> maybe<00:03:36.090> it

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
their stride a little bit or maybe it

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.009 
their stride a little bit or maybe it
was<00:03:36.450> just<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:37.200> one<00:03:37.709> game<00:03:37.950> deal<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:39.239> think

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
was just a one game deal but I think

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.680 
was just a one game deal but I think
that<00:03:40.170> Gonzaga<00:03:40.500> has<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.130> play<00:03:41.430> close<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.510> it

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
that Gonzaga has to play close to it

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.199 
that Gonzaga has to play close to it
better<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.410> close<00:03:43.769> one<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.549> its<00:03:44.670> better<00:03:44.850> games

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
better it close one of its better games

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.630 
better it close one of its better games
close<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.720> its<00:03:45.870> best<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:46.950> order<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.370> advance

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
close to its best in order to advance

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.610 
close to its best in order to advance
into<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.000> sweet<00:03:48.209> 16<00:03:48.390> all<00:03:49.260> right<00:03:49.440> well<00:03:49.560> that's

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
into the sweet 16 all right well that's

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.810 
into the sweet 16 all right well that's
certainly<00:03:49.920> gonna<00:03:50.070> have<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.370> be<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> little<00:03:50.730> bit

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
certainly gonna have to be a little bit

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.520 
certainly gonna have to be a little bit
