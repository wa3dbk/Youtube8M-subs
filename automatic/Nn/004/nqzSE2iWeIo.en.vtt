00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello you know that you wake up and 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.870
 somehow knows that is not at all 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.610
 my day I had in fact today 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.340
 Tomorrow I woke up relatively early 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.570
 even something that always helps me 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.519
 this is a bit in the coming transitions 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.080
 if I sleep too long then I am 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.880
 mostly lethargic all day and does not like 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.670
 but I really wanted to be early 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 I got up and still I know 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.460
 My mood is not the same all the time 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.289
 a little scratched 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.869
 I'm not bad and I'm fine 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.179
 not around or so I'm just like that 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.619
 maybe a bit sad you could 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.219
 I do not really call it that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.170
 Why 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.730
 maybe it's the weather I have 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.520
 So I was really looking forward to the autumn 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 and usually the garden is when 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.640
 one always parents beautifully in autumn 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.020
 all the colorful leaves are lying around 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.930
 but I just wanted it 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.160
 wet rainy and wet I believe 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.610
 that pushes me up a bit 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.530
 mind 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.059
 somehow everything personally 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.670
 someone says to me i feel 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.649
 not me handsome for me 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.410
 strong character i just like straight 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.699
 nothing to me today therefore right now 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.100
 thought now you always meet like that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.899
 properly showered and gestures round 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.189
 makes then really strong coffee and 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.770
 then the next outfit will be on 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.810
 Considered that I am doing now 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.150
 same and I believe that mine 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.110
 mood genthin will raise because of videos 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.240
 I always have to work 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.520
 helped me out a bit 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.689
 come to make out of my day and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.759
 I hope it will be the same now 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.930
 works so if now synonymous know that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.400
 Just do a day like that though you 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.900
 thinks today is just nothing 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.560
 Today I find myself just to 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.150
 puke 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.159
 I'm not really into that today 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.479
 Of course everything goes wrong somehow then 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.860
 Just write me something 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.509
 I feel better when I know 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.189
 that it's the same with others 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.189
 today is absolutely such a day 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.869
 I have no idea why it is me 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.670
 Now try to make the best of it 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.020
 and I really enjoy it 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.340
 a clipping on the day for you too 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.329
 turn on the make-up alone has 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.680
 helped out a bit 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.790
 make a little something out of yourself 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.770
 especially if you are kind of ugly 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.329
 that's for any reasons 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.159
 not so bad just times 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.630
 the opposite is what one does 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.030
 actually 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.560
 So it feels so much fun I suppose 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.689
 I take it to the garden and bremen 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.579
 second outfit of the day for autumn 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.229
 have fun 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.850
 My outfit for today is very much 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.679
 simple garments and accessories 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.690
 but in my opinion in 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.880
 combination a whole worth seeing 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.680
 yield 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.200
 I'm wearing a gray cardigan 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.200
 Magenta colored pullover a colorful 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.750
 scarf jewelry in africa style a blue 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.239
 jeans and gray boots with heel the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.860
 cardigan comes from primark two 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.530
 forming different knitting patterns 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.290
 she has seven vertical stripes at the front 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.640
 gray buttons two small side pockets 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.890
 for the house key or something 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.290
 Small change are also available 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.569
 I really like her because she is skinny and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.610
 still warm by the many 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.260
 there are many options available 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.329
 to wear and combine 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.400
 At this place I will have it open 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.530
 let one see below 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.450
 magento colors in sweaters of madonna 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.610
 Besides, there is not much to it 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.590
 say he is very simple I like the 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.359
 color very much and just combine it 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.120
 like when I'm dark red or ins 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.989
 wearing violet walking clothes come 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.600
 we go to the scarf 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.799
 I love scarves and shawls in autumn 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.269
 they are always the icing on the cake for me 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.280
 on every outfit 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.109
 Here I have a very soft 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.700
 cuddly scarf with dark red 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.519
 salmon-colored white dark blue 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.959
 selected as a floral pattern 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.200
 Color drawing can only be done by one 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.359
 Girls come down to it are strolling 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.109
 sometimes that looks too playful to me 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.430
 but with this I find it nice me 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.319
 have him tied so that you are in 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.440
 decolleté can still carry a chain 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.760
 it has become an elephant for me 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.620
 chain is pretty heavy 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.170
 but what about an elephant 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.519
 expect something else 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.470
 I wear matching earrings in it 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.799
 same color also in africa 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.319
 or antique style goes on 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.269
 it with the jeans she is navy blue and 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.790
 has these pseudo balanced positions 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.680
 on the thighs a few 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.980
 Tattered cracks and scratches are part of it 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.060
 also to the casual look of the pants 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.519
 I do not really like this one 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.639
 shabby look jeans but love these ones 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.989
 i'm my absolute favorite 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.650
 I like the bags with one 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.079
 sewn 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.540
 fate they come from lee cooper 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.519
 I have scotland on my shoes 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.900
 for gray boots with rounded edges 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.680
 lace and a small heel 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.900
 decided 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.780
 they are not very warm though 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.360
 still very comfortable and rain tight for 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.650
 today exactly the right one 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.050
 if you wonder what nail polish 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.910
 I wear it this is the blackboard is out 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.470
 the last video in beer mila and 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.759
 magenta the varnishes are both from msi and 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.370
 This brings us to the face of the day 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:40.250
 foundation and rouge of reval de loop 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.210
 concealer of patrice lipstick of 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.180
 marc us the color 00 22 lipgloss of 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.610
 Essens eye make up is as well 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.130
 purple or magenta colors 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.830
 I have products from max factor and 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.210
 Reval enough, the kohl pen is used 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.130
 also from max factor 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.610
 I also have the last stroke 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.289
 pulled that 's it I hope it has you 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.590
 fallen and you found it here completely 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.729
 okay for me it is not like this now 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.620
 special look from that I would now 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.910
 also just put on the uni and 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.360
 what it is now nothing 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.039
 Experimenting is like maybe 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.690
 a men's pullover from primark at 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.539
 Last time, it's just like that 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.280
 little something in this back to school 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.630
 university rail just now 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.190
 I do a lot of youtubers 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.810
 think this is an everyday outfit that 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.870
 but also fits very nicely in the autumn 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.240
 because I find the magenta and reds 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.590
 clearly fit in the fall as well 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.659
 season I think they are 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.190
 better to eat in the fall and 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.199
 another season I feel in 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.150
 This clothes very well 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.830
 I do not think gray is that way 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.139
 he announced this fall so this 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.159
 chestnut shades of yellow ocher and so on 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.300
 but I just like pretty happy 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:51.650
 so I will not give it up 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.970
 just because others might do this 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.770
 Fall is not so great for 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.530
 Gray is always one of me too 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.240
 color of the autumn combined with 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.250
 magenta did not quite like that 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.479
 gray mouse acts moderately I hope 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.740
 you can take a little something out 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.150
 the video and you liked it 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.280
 Write me in the comments 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.570
 if you made it over one page 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.560
 I am of course also, however, 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.090
 I'm not happy about that easily 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.159
 Of course you can still do that for me 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.940
 please give a little review then 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.560
 note down 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.000
 why he did that and I'm glad 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.100
 Of course, I am most glad of it 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.510
 would be if you have not already done so 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.910
 would subscribe to me 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.020
 much fun this year rather 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.610
 bit of rainy day maybe 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.680
 do you have better weather i hope for 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.330
 I 'll do it I still believe it 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.770
 a coffee and feel ashamed somewhere in 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.800
 a very comfortable chair with one 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.920
 notebook and scratch my dog ​​up 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.920
 then 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.990
 you should breathe in between 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.990
 talk
