00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
oh hello this is flax or processing

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.990 
oh hello this is flax or processing
today<00:00:57.340> what<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:58.370> have<00:00:58.640> here<00:00:59.090> is<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.660> dried<00:00:59.960> flax

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
today what I have here is the dried flax

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.460 
today what I have here is the dried flax
i'm<00:01:02.000> brother<00:01:02.300> christian<00:01:02.720> by<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:02.930> way<00:01:03.170> and

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
i'm brother christian by the way and

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.280 
i'm brother christian by the way and
this<00:01:03.740> is<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.980> hermitage<00:01:04.540> we<00:01:05.540> process<00:01:05.990> flax

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
this is the hermitage we process flax

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.560 
this is the hermitage we process flax
here<00:01:06.650> which<00:01:06.890> we've<00:01:07.070> done<00:01:07.250> for<00:01:07.550> 18<00:01:08.210> years<00:01:08.510> now

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
here which we've done for 18 years now

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.080 
here which we've done for 18 years now
and<00:01:11.680> this<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:12.860> one<00:01:13.010> of<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.160> stages<00:01:13.460> of<00:01:13.760> flax

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
and this is one of the stages of flax

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.720 
and this is one of the stages of flax
production<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.040> can<00:01:16.160> actually<00:01:16.310> break

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
production so you can actually break

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.109 
production so you can actually break
down<00:01:16.760> these<00:01:17.210> fibers<00:01:18.010> what<00:01:19.010> we<00:01:19.130> did<00:01:19.430> grew<00:01:20.000> the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
down these fibers what we did grew the

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.859 
down these fibers what we did grew the
flax<00:01:20.710> then<00:01:21.710> we<00:01:21.979> pulled<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.670> laid<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
flax then we pulled it laid it in the

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.800 
flax then we pulled it laid it in the
field<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.229> big<00:01:24.410> shocks<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:25.390> today<00:01:26.390> we<00:01:26.570> took

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
field and big shocks and today we took

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.690 
field and big shocks and today we took
the<00:01:26.960> flax<00:01:27.260> out<00:01:27.500> of<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.710> field<00:01:28.010> and<00:01:28.580> we're

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the flax out of the field and we're

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.749 
the flax out of the field and we're
putting<00:01:28.940> it<00:01:29.090> on<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.390> reading<00:01:29.690> field<00:01:30.610> this<00:01:31.610> is

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
putting it on the reading field this is

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.600 
putting it on the reading field this is
a<00:01:31.790> german<00:01:32.390> way<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.810> rotting<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:33.500> flax<00:01:33.830> which

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
a german way of rotting the flax which

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.180 
a german way of rotting the flax which
is<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:34.759> form<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.150> dry<00:01:35.450> rotting<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:36.979> can

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
is a form of dry rotting so you can

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.740 
is a form of dry rotting so you can
actually<00:01:37.340> get<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.700> fibers<00:01:38.240> from<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.420> flags

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
actually get the fibers from the flags

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.999 
actually get the fibers from the flags
i'm<00:01:39.200> laying<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.070> out<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:42.470> you<00:01:42.560> can<00:01:42.710> see<00:01:42.890> the

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
i'm laying it out so you can see the

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.810 
i'm laying it out so you can see the
grass<00:01:43.250> through<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.670> flax

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.680 

this<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.940> actually<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> last<00:01:51.659> step<00:01:52.250> in

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
this is actually the last step in

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.020 
this is actually the last step in
preparing<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:55.200> flax<00:01:55.580> before<00:01:56.580> we<00:01:56.640> break<00:01:56.850> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
preparing the flax before we break it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.380 
preparing the flax before we break it
down<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.390> pull<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> fibers<00:01:58.080> out<00:01:59.090> the<00:02:00.090> flax

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
down and pull the fibers out the flax

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.540 
down and pull the fibers out the flax

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
breaks down the plant and then we'll

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.230 
breaks down the plant and then we'll
take<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.709> off<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.070> field<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.580> process<00:02:15.000> it

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
take it off the field and process it

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.770 
take it off the field and process it

unevenly this is an ancient process
we've<00:02:38.700> done<00:02:38.880> thousands<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.600> years<00:02:39.840> ago<00:02:39.989> here

this farm was settled and the farmers
here<00:02:50.160> had<00:02:50.340> flax<00:02:50.640> tools<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.390> we<00:02:51.480> know<00:02:51.630> that

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
here had flax tools and we know that

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.580 
here had flax tools and we know that
they<00:02:52.080> grew<00:02:52.400> flax<00:02:53.400> here<00:02:53.880> along<00:02:54.720> caylor's<00:02:55.260> run

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
they grew flax here along caylor's run

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.550 
they grew flax here along caylor's run
where<00:02:56.100> we<00:02:56.190> grow<00:02:56.430> our<00:02:56.549> own<00:02:56.580> flats<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.840> they

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
where we grow our own flats and they

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.199 
where we grow our own flats and they
process<00:02:59.010> life<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.430> same<00:02:59.700> way<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.060> we

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
process life the same way that we

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:08.670 
process life the same way that we
process<00:03:00.420> flax<00:03:01.019> it's<00:03:01.410> 200<00:03:01.799> years<00:03:02.010> later

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.809 

what<00:03:09.430> will<00:03:09.609> happen<00:03:09.849> sometimes<00:03:10.659> if<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.230> Flex

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
what will happen sometimes if the Flex

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.490 
what will happen sometimes if the Flex
gets<00:03:12.819> too<00:03:13.060> wet<00:03:13.299> when<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:13.689> in<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.900> shucks<00:03:14.230> and

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
gets too wet when it's in the shucks and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.539 
gets too wet when it's in the shucks and
drawings<00:03:15.370> they'll<00:03:16.269> be<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.840> mold<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.950> forms<00:03:18.459> a

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
drawings they'll be a mold that forms a

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.660 
drawings they'll be a mold that forms a
little<00:03:18.819> bit<00:03:18.939> like<00:03:19.120> here<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.799> that<00:03:21.250> mold<00:03:21.489> is

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
little bit like here and that mold is

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.759 
little bit like here and that mold is
actually<00:03:21.909> eating<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.629> flax<00:03:22.959> fiber<00:03:23.349> so<00:03:23.680> you

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
actually eating the flax fiber so you

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.220 
actually eating the flax fiber so you
don't<00:03:23.950> want<00:03:24.129> that<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:25.659> really<00:03:25.930> really

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
don't want that so it's really really

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.879 
don't want that so it's really really
wet<00:03:26.590> when<00:03:27.219> we<00:03:27.310> have<00:03:27.549> it<00:03:27.700> into<00:03:27.939> little<00:03:28.060> shucks

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
wet when we have it into little shucks

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.440 
wet when we have it into little shucks
we<00:03:29.889> have<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.189> be<00:03:30.340> very<00:03:30.639> careful<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.090> take<00:03:31.299> it

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
we have to be very careful to take it

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.319 
we have to be very careful to take it
off<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.659> field<00:03:31.959> in<00:03:32.200> time<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:34.000> what<00:03:34.209> will

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
off the field in time but what will

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.580 
off the field in time but what will
happen<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.959> lay<00:03:35.230> it<00:03:35.349> out<00:03:35.439> in<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:36.400> Sun<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:38.290> the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
happen I lay it out in the Sun and the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.069 
happen I lay it out in the Sun and the
flash<00:03:38.829> will<00:03:39.040> dry<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:40.180> that's<00:03:40.359> process<00:03:40.959> of

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
flash will dry and that's process of

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.990 
flash will dry and that's process of
rotting<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.950> destroying<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.459> fibers<00:03:42.819> will

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
rotting and destroying the fibers will

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.099 
rotting and destroying the fibers will
stop<00:03:44.370> what<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.400> want<00:03:45.669> is<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.849> very<00:03:46.090> slow<00:03:46.629> process

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
stop what I want is a very slow process

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:53.970 
stop what I want is a very slow process
of<00:03:48.269> decay<00:03:49.269> for<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.720> flax<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.870> inside<00:03:53.409> coral

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
of decay for the flax the inside coral

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.330 
of decay for the flax the inside coral
break<00:03:54.219> away<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.790> does<00:03:55.329> an<00:03:55.419> outside<00:03:55.870> husk

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
break away and does an outside husk

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.099 
break away and does an outside husk
there<00:03:57.340> will<00:03:57.459> also<00:03:57.609> separate<00:03:58.510> from<00:03:58.719> the<00:03:58.810> flax

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
there will also separate from the flax

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.789 
there will also separate from the flax
fibers<00:03:59.879> so<00:04:00.879> this<00:04:01.030> whole<00:04:01.209> process<00:04:01.650> will<00:04:02.650> do

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
fibers so this whole process will do

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.849 
fibers so this whole process will do
that<00:04:02.980> in<00:04:03.129> three<00:04:03.340> or<00:04:03.430> four<00:04:03.489> weeks

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.449 

that's<00:04:09.859> a<00:04:09.980> flex<00:04:10.310> dog<00:04:10.870> what<00:04:11.870> we<00:04:11.959> have<00:04:12.170> here<00:04:12.650> is

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
that's a flex dog what we have here is

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.810 
that's a flex dog what we have here is

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.420 
class when we plant the seeds we make a
