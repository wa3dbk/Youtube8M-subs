00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
 somewhere on 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.430
 show that from state to debate you can 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.780
 still once i shared di passione 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.190
 mts 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.710
 he was co-author 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.519
 I understand from the store that we are quite a few 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.519
 made up the ceiling 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.240
 need to wait there 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.640
 you eyes 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.190
 religion because every child 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.180
 here I was 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.829
 I signed for good 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.960
 I have betrayed how 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:58.059
 works better with tiger now 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.090
 show because we are very warm 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.590
 water 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.130
 along the way it happens 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.130
 month and a half 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.460
 and and and 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:17.560
 purely carpian reservoirs such 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:20.670
 natural battles because 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.670
 and not this very big 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.430
 my 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.659
 this lake started this is also not strange 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.819
 absolutely 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.819
 first respect and then goods 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.470
 when is the pad how do I shove a 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.650
 because wicker heels primer and need 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.650
 less 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.950
 This, too, let's say that my strength works 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.310
 you are useless that works while growing 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.170
 the menu itself 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.570
 she wants beds and and then and then 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.160
 add a bit of appreciation to it all 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.540
 he decides it again the car flew 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.540
 variators include 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.300
 it turns out 20 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.900
 just because we have 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.900
 mostly water is cool and a magnet and they 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.590
 in manners 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.810
 developing already natural reservoirs 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.680
 this heresy and russia do not always succeed 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:51.200
 Takamura estimates associated with such 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.290
 art number 1 cards that too 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:02.239
 him jackson so spawn they sort of 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:04.329
 getting ready for this is something that is better not 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.329
 it happens 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.870
 this is this mixture 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:16.540
 she works today 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:20.580
 Here is such a scent of spice and color 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.580
 such that i am pushing for everything 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.980
 and in general for example I turned and found 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:41.860
 what works again with the ransom themselves 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.400
 not working 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.820
 society carosello yes he is very small 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.070
 knows our old 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.210
 it's even too greasy for that too 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:59.190
 something to talk here if the axis vector 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.190
 could where vivo and 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.720
 it's a brazier it's after us not 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.970
 Well, you have a lot of course 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.340
 you have it and we can invest 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.620
 be all beautiful in your area 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.220
 it works because guys from bashka 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.780
 would give not only what they pay for 1 and 1 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.260
 it works very well we will go by 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.260
 ways to 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.920
 Here and here, too, turned out very 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.910
 saturated new 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.450
 my understanding of who I am is all his 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.940
 carp is beautiful too firm 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.730
 will start too saturated it is so she 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.640
 sponge cake a little inferior cards turn 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.410
 queue it's there day carp can order 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.960
 really vivo not 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:55.400
 carry the price grows I his big flocks 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.160
 here it is then I do not know the suburbs I 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.890
 I think that it was more worked especially 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.250
 if you are in the spring in cold water 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:07.880
 spring and autumn the Poles then this here 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.490
 which bait are mixed up to this 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.200
 bait and 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.460
 and 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.460
 line from
