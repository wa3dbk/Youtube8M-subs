00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
pushing the piston back in so loops and

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.810 
pushing the piston back in so loops and
there<00:02:43.360> comes<00:02:43.690> right<00:02:43.960> off<00:02:43.990> like<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.670> okay<00:02:45.670> now

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
there comes right off like that okay now

there comes right off like that okay now
I'll<00:02:46.120> have<00:02:46.300> that<00:02:46.510> off<00:02:46.690> now<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.950> should<00:02:48.550> come

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
I'll have that off now this should come

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.540 
I'll have that off now this should come
off<00:02:48.990> fairly<00:02:49.990> easily<00:02:50.530> as<00:02:50.890> well<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:54.220> shouldn't

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
off fairly easily as well that shouldn't

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.970 
off fairly easily as well that shouldn't
be<00:02:54.730> too<00:02:54.910> tight<00:02:55.290> check<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.530> grease<00:02:56.770> where
