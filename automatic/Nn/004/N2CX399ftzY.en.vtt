00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
pizza essentially a piece of shop and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.909

I'm a security guard here and I want

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.580 
I'm a security guard here and I want
from<00:00:29.039> Toby<00:00:29.429> into<00:00:29.730> 6am<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.930> I<00:00:30.960> pretty<00:00:31.169> much<00:00:31.289> got

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
from Toby into 6am and I pretty much got

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.220 
from Toby into 6am and I pretty much got
a<00:00:31.649> look<00:00:31.890> around<00:00:32.449> too<00:00:33.449> pretty<00:00:33.480> much<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:33.989> make

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
a look around too pretty much just make

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.110 
a look around too pretty much just make
sure<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.469> all<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.949> that<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.969> non

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
sure that all of the that is non

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.299 
sure that all of the that is non
breaking<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.379> from<00:00:37.530> what<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.739> understand

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
breaking in but from what I understand

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.319 
breaking in but from what I understand
is<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.989> spooky<00:00:39.989> stuff<00:00:40.230> starts<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> happen<00:00:41.329> so

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
is that spooky stuff starts to happen so

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.660 
is that spooky stuff starts to happen so
I<00:00:42.720> guess<00:00:43.350> we'd<00:00:43.559> probably<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.920> be<00:00:44.070> seeing<00:00:44.430> here

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
I guess we'd probably can be seeing here

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.430 
I guess we'd probably can be seeing here
in<00:00:44.790> a<00:00:44.879> little<00:00:45.089> office<00:00:45.269> chair<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
in a little office chair right here and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.829 
in a little office chair right here and
there's<00:00:47.309> not<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.670> much<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.390> do

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
there's not really much that we can do

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:50.899 
there's not really much that we can do
is<00:00:49.140> kind<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.589> just<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.979> have<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.220> sit<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.699> not

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
is kind of just you have to sit have not

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.930 
is kind of just you have to sit have not
seen<00:00:51.120> anything<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.170> game<00:00:52.940> so

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
seen anything to do with this game so

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.090 
seen anything to do with this game so
I'm<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.180> sure<00:00:54.269> what<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.750> expect<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.920> know

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I'm not sure what to expect I just know

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.529 
I'm not sure what to expect I just know
the<00:00:56.219> premise<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.760> what<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.449> have

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the premise of what it is that we have

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.090 
the premise of what it is that we have
to<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.350> look<00:00:58.469> around<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.010> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
to do and you can look around and you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.630 
to do and you can look around and you
can't<00:00:59.399> move<00:00:59.640> Austin's<00:01:00.239> uh<00:01:01.609> uh<00:01:04.610> who's<00:01:05.610> this

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
can't move Austin's uh uh who's this

there calling Hills Casey I don't seem

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.420 
there calling Hills Casey I don't seem
to<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.039> able<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.280> click<00:01:20.550> anything

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.320 

I<00:01:24.990> feel<00:01:25.990> ok<00:01:26.140> this<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.680> previous<00:01:27.330> security

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
I feel ok this is the previous security

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.750 
I feel ok this is the previous security
guard<00:01:28.540> speaking<00:01:29.020> right<00:01:29.200> now<00:01:29.230> and<00:01:29.920> he<00:01:30.430> said<00:01:30.640> if

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
guard speaking right now and he said if

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.430 
guard speaking right now and he said if
there's<00:01:30.910> nothing<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.390> worry<00:01:31.600> about<00:01:31.720> i<00:01:32.200> come

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
there's nothing to worry about i come

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.920 
there's nothing to worry about i come
here<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:32.800> we<00:01:32.950> get<00:01:33.070> my<00:01:33.190> headphones<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:34.000> guess<00:01:34.900> I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
here and we get my headphones I guess I

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.350 
here and we get my headphones I guess I
probably<00:01:35.230> should<00:01:35.530> have<00:01:35.620> done<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:39.330> before<00:01:40.330> I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
probably should have done that before I

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:50.090 
probably should have done that before I
start<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.810> recording<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.630> someone<00:01:44.020> like

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.430 

right<00:01:51.300> so<00:01:52.300> I<00:01:52.330> think<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.869> have<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.020> wait<00:01:53.200> quite

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
right so I think you have to wait quite

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.260 
right so I think you have to wait quite
a<00:01:53.500> bit<00:01:53.830> for<00:01:54.100> this<00:01:54.250> room<00:01:54.490> all<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:57.850> just<00:01:58.090> did<00:01:58.240> a

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
a bit for this room all so I just did a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.450 
a bit for this room all so I just did a
test<00:01:58.600> run<00:01:58.930> see<00:01:59.200> if<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.530> was<00:01:59.649> okay<00:01:59.740> he<00:02:00.250> went<00:02:00.430> on

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
test run see if it was okay he went on

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:09.870 
test run see if it was okay he went on
for<00:02:00.640> quite<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.850> while<00:02:00.970> oh<00:02:07.110> my<00:02:08.110> god<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.880> just
