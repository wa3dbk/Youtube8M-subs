 perez in all its right that space belongs to us all and the state must 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.740
 ensure its protection and the safety of every citizen we simply 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.719
 we are a group 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:19.419
 federer declared 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.289
 that comply with a standard 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.979
 the regulation is clear 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.710
 the state must regulate 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.129
 for the protection 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:27.060

 phone rondón distinctive andasol in the caleñidad will be 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.659

 market 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.979
 the award 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.979
 but good still later 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.720
 to leave doubts is directly the manager of this megaobra 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.040
 who answers the big question that alicante and his colleagues have 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.960
 square 2 spaces aesthetically conceded 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.090
 they will not give spaces of tolerance of coexistence 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.029
 and two in insecurity 

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:14.159
 that can not be done in a demagogic way 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.589
 try to make it possible for everyone to montes utility 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.750
 timbiriche that is going to have 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.400
 a precariousness in terms of execution skill and aesthetics 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.309
 and a precarious one that will record monster circumstance 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:28.639
 that then 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.949
 there is the possibility of working the desire the push and the need 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:36.029
 The state allows it to the municipal entity 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.029
 vegara artist the rights of all citizens 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.189
 12 6% public space belongs to all people 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:46.699
 I think what we have been thinking 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.909
 in terms of spaces 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.669
 granted by the court 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.849
 for magazines for products for flowers 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.469
 they are adequate spaces 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:58.110
 and I think that is more or less the tasks 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.990
 but what happens is that there are many people who 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.550
 they start with the classic 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.300
 and ends proposed 3 4 meters because they count down to the space 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.869
 public is very common 

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:11.589
 we are people of the same age 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:14.589
 all the same to him the fact that we do not have 

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:17.129
 the fact that we do not have faith 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:21.110
 a job a job does not mean that we are getting ready we have need 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.009
 We do not have 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.749
 net that we do not have 

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:28.149
 so that there are of your roommates should keep running before the 

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:30.240
 arrival of the wolf because ironically 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.280
 if you as a citizen consume an informal sale that does not pay for services or 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.159
 rent 

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:38.680
 what it does is that the business is profitable and more jobs are created in the 

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:42.120
 streets that are not allowed municipal authority 

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.629
 It can not be a generator of employment but it can be an entity that promotes 

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:47.929
 incentive 

00:07:47.929 --> 00:07:51.759
 to private organizations to develop productive activities 

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:52.770
 In colombia 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:53.729
 who works then
