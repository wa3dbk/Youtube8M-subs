00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.640 

in<00:00:00.240> this<00:00:00.390> video<00:00:00.599> we're<00:00:00.989> going<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.260> take<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> look

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.340 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:00:01.770> how<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.070> divide<00:00:02.550> two-digit<00:00:03.389> numbers<00:00:03.720> by<00:00:04.110> a

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
at how to divide two-digit numbers by a

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.200 
at how to divide two-digit numbers by a
one<00:00:04.620> digit<00:00:04.799> number<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.790> I'm<00:00:05.910> going<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.060> show

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
one digit number and I'm going to show

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.849 
one digit number and I'm going to show
you<00:00:06.270> how<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.450> use<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.810> bus<00:00:07.020> shelter<00:00:07.500> method

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
you how to use the bus shelter method

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.519 
you how to use the bus shelter method
for<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.870> so<00:00:10.700> starting<00:00:11.700> with<00:00:12.330> an<00:00:12.719> example<00:00:13.110> of

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
for this so starting with an example of

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:23.870 
for this so starting with an example of
24<00:00:18.770> divided<00:00:19.770> by<00:00:19.920> two<00:00:21.949> so<00:00:22.949> by<00:00:23.490> now<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.789> should

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
24 divided by two so by now we should

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.120 
24 divided by two so by now we should
understand<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> concept<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.529> division

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
understand the concept that a division

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.000 
understand the concept that a division
is<00:00:26.550> splitting<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.210> number<00:00:27.480> down<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.050> we're

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
is splitting a number down so we're

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.420 
is splitting a number down so we're
going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.720> split<00:00:30.720> 24<00:00:31.439> down<00:00:31.619> into<00:00:31.980> two<00:00:32.130> pieces

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
going to split 24 down into two pieces

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.510 
going to split 24 down into two pieces
and<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:33.239> which<00:00:33.829> what<00:00:34.829> each<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.160> those<00:00:35.280> two

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and see which what each of those two

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.290 
and see which what each of those two
pieces<00:00:35.730> are<00:00:36.030> worth<00:00:37.520> so<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.670> should<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:38.879> able<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
pieces are worth so we should be able to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.740 
pieces are worth so we should be able to
understand<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.040> for<00:00:41.040> example<00:00:41.149> 4<00:00:42.149> divided<00:00:42.719> by

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
understand that for example 4 divided by

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.600 
understand that for example 4 divided by
2<00:00:43.579> gives<00:00:44.579> us<00:00:45.800> 4<00:00:46.800> split<00:00:47.070> into<00:00:47.190> two<00:00:47.399> different

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
2 gives us 4 split into two different

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.500 
2 gives us 4 split into two different
pieces<00:00:48.649> each<00:00:49.649> will<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.160> worth<00:00:50.399> two<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.329> that's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
pieces each will be worth two so that's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.330 
pieces each will be worth two so that's
our<00:00:51.719> answer

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
our answer

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.760 
our answer
so<00:00:53.340> that's<00:00:53.579> division<00:00:54.420> rib<00:00:55.140> bit<00:00:55.289> little<00:00:55.500> recap

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so that's division rib bit little recap

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.920 
so that's division rib bit little recap
on<00:00:55.920> understanding<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.629> I'm<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
on understanding there so I'm going to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.670 
on understanding there so I'm going to
show<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.109> now<00:00:58.350> how<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.710> use<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:01.199> bus<00:01:01.320> shelter

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
show you now how to use the bus shelter

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.529 
show you now how to use the bus shelter
method<00:01:02.010> I'll<00:01:02.579> call<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> bus<00:01:03.120> shelter

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
method I'll call it a bus shelter

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.509 
method I'll call it a bus shelter
because<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.500> looks<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.830> little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
because it looks a little bit like a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.350 
because it looks a little bit like a
bush<00:01:05.790> shelter<00:01:06.830> so<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> deep<00:01:08.340> vision<00:01:09.180> I'm

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
bush shelter so for the deep vision I'm

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.320 
bush shelter so for the deep vision I'm
gonna<00:01:09.540> draw<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.810> bush<00:01:10.020> shelter<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.970> pop<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
gonna draw the bush shelter and pop the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.890 
gonna draw the bush shelter and pop the
big<00:01:12.450> number<00:01:12.810> inside<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.220> first<00:01:14.430> number<00:01:14.900> 24

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
big number inside so the first number 24

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.969 
big number inside so the first number 24
divided<00:01:16.830> by<00:01:16.860> 2<00:01:18.110> I'm<00:01:19.110> gonna<00:01:19.229> write<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.500> two<00:01:19.770> on

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
divided by 2 I'm gonna write you two on

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.080 
divided by 2 I'm gonna write you two on
the<00:01:20.100> outside<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
the outside like that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.999 
the outside like that
because<00:01:21.479> another<00:01:21.689> way<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.140> asking<00:01:22.560> ourselves

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
because another way of asking ourselves

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.130 
because another way of asking ourselves
what<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.400> division<00:01:23.729> means<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> say<00:01:24.479> how<00:01:25.080> many

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
what a division means is to say how many

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
what a division means is to say how many
tools<00:01:25.530> go<00:01:26.159> into<00:01:26.520> 24<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:28.220> that's<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> question

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
tools go into 24 and that's the question

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.429 
tools go into 24 and that's the question
we're<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.030> ask<00:01:30.240> ourselves<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.259> each

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
we're going to ask ourselves and each

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.830 
we're going to ask ourselves and each
stage<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.159> Bush<00:01:32.400> shelter<00:01:32.579> method<00:01:33.119> so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
stage of this Bush shelter method so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.670 
stage of this Bush shelter method so
what<00:01:33.990> we're<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> bush

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
what we're going to do in the bush

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.960 
what we're going to do in the bush
shelter<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.640> we're<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.150> 2<00:01:37.159> into<00:01:38.159> 2<00:01:38.400> so

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
shelter is we're going to do 2 into 2 so

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.719 
shelter is we're going to do 2 into 2 so
how<00:01:39.180> many<00:01:39.240> twos<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:40.259> into<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.040> number<00:01:41.340> 2<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
how many twos go into the number 2 and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.310 
how many twos go into the number 2 and
the<00:01:42.270> answer<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:43.340> one<00:01:44.340> there's<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.210> 2<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the answer is one there's one 2 in the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.530 
the answer is one there's one 2 in the
number<00:01:46.530> 2<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:47.670> gonna<00:01:47.790> write<00:01:48.030> our<00:01:48.180> answer<00:01:48.450> at

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
number 2 I'm gonna write our answer at

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.710 
number 2 I'm gonna write our answer at
the<00:01:48.630> top<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.020> bush<00:01:49.170> shelter<00:01:49.500> there<00:01:50.720> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the top of the bush shelter there and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.789 
the top of the bush shelter there and
we're<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.079> into<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> next<00:01:52.500> number

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
we're going to go into the next number

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.480 
we're going to go into the next number
how<00:01:52.979> many<00:01:53.009> 2<00:01:53.399> was<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.600> number<00:01:54.840> 4<00:01:55.490> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
how many 2 was going to the number 4 and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.730 
how many 2 was going to the number 4 and
the<00:01:56.729> answer<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:58.020> 2<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:59.759> that<00:02:00.509> there<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:01.590> our

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the answer is 2 and that there is our

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.620 
the answer is 2 and that there is our
answer

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
answer

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.800 
answer
so<00:02:03.630> 24<00:02:04.140> divided<00:02:04.740> by<00:02:04.860> 2<00:02:04.979> should<00:02:05.430> give<00:02:06.210> us<00:02:06.680> 12

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
so 24 divided by 2 should give us 12

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.760 
so 24 divided by 2 should give us 12
it's<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:09.899> simple<00:02:10.110> as<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.370> just

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
it's as simple as that so it's just

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.470 
it's as simple as that so it's just
case<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.100> practicing<00:02:13.110> asking<00:02:14.110> yourself<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
case of practicing asking yourself the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.350 
case of practicing asking yourself the
question<00:02:16.990> how<00:02:17.140> many<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.820> number<00:02:19.060> apps<00:02:19.210> I

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
question how many of the number apps I

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.170 
question how many of the number apps I
go<00:02:19.660> into<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.440> number<00:02:20.710> inside<00:02:21.070> will<00:02:22.030> get

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
go into the number inside will get

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.270 
go into the number inside will get
straight<00:02:22.420> on<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.630> another<00:02:22.750> example<00:02:23.320> so<00:02:24.040> let's

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
straight on to another example so let's

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:37.050 
straight on to another example so let's
try<00:02:26.730> 50<00:02:30.000> divided<00:02:31.000> by<00:02:32.820> five<00:02:35.310> again<00:02:36.310> we're<00:02:36.910> going

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
try 50 divided by five again we're going

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.470 
try 50 divided by five again we're going
to<00:02:37.120> draw<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.300> little<00:02:37.480> shelter<00:02:39.120> 50<00:02:40.120> is<00:02:40.180> gonna<00:02:40.330> go

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
to draw a little shelter 50 is gonna go

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.980 
to draw a little shelter 50 is gonna go
inside<00:02:42.180> because<00:02:43.180> we<00:02:43.330> want<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.630> know<00:02:43.750> how<00:02:43.930> many

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
inside because we want to know how many

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.910 
inside because we want to know how many
fives<00:02:44.380> go<00:02:45.130> into<00:02:45.640> 50<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:47.290> one<00:02:47.470> number<00:02:47.620> at<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.890> time

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
fives go into 50 so one number at a time

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.870 
fives go into 50 so one number at a time
how<00:02:48.400> many<00:02:48.580> fives<00:02:48.850> go<00:02:49.090> into<00:02:49.360> 5<00:02:50.310> one<00:02:51.310> 5<00:02:51.580> goes<00:02:51.850> into

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
how many fives go into 5 one 5 goes into

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.060 
how many fives go into 5 one 5 goes into
5<00:02:52.330> only<00:02:53.290> 5<00:02:53.710> is<00:02:53.860> going<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.130> 0<00:02:55.260> 0<00:02:56.260> there<00:02:56.920> are<00:02:56.950> no

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
5 only 5 is going to 0 0 there are no

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.530 
5 only 5 is going to 0 0 there are no
fives<00:02:57.460> in<00:02:57.670> zero<00:02:58.710> and<00:02:59.710> that<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:01.120> our<00:03:01.360> answer

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
fives in zero and that is our answer

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.270 
fives in zero and that is our answer
there<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.950> 50<00:03:03.430> well<00:03:04.240> into<00:03:04.540> five<00:03:04.750> pieces<00:03:05.280> each

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
there so 50 well into five pieces each

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.490 
there so 50 well into five pieces each
one's<00:03:06.580> worth<00:03:06.790> 10<00:03:07.200> 50<00:03:08.200> divided<00:03:08.410> by<00:03:08.440> 5<00:03:08.860> is<00:03:09.040> 10

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
one's worth 10 50 divided by 5 is 10

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.760 
one's worth 10 50 divided by 5 is 10
another<00:03:11.500> example<00:03:11.650> 1<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.050> next<00:03:14.320> example

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
another example 1 so this next example

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:23.670 
another example 1 so this next example
if<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:16.590> were<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.620> say<00:03:20.100> 65<00:03:21.930> divided<00:03:22.930> by<00:03:23.050> 5<00:03:23.350> let's

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
if we were to say 65 divided by 5 let's

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.590 
if we were to say 65 divided by 5 let's
try<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:23.950> one<00:03:24.340> this<00:03:25.060> has<00:03:25.240> got<00:03:25.390> another

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
try this one this has got another

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.720 
try this one this has got another
element<00:03:25.990> to<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.350> we're<00:03:27.130> going<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.340> draw<00:03:27.490> a<00:03:27.520> bush

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
element to it we're going to draw a bush

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.170 
element to it we're going to draw a bush
shelter<00:03:28.090> out<00:03:28.209> nonetheless<00:03:28.450> roof<00:03:29.260> shelter<00:03:30.180> 65

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
shelter out nonetheless roof shelter 65

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.060 
shelter out nonetheless roof shelter 65
inside<00:03:31.690> how<00:03:32.590> many<00:03:32.890> fives<00:03:33.160> go<00:03:33.880> into<00:03:34.209> this<00:03:34.300> 65

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
inside how many fives go into this 65

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.770 
inside how many fives go into this 65
one<00:03:36.070> number<00:03:36.220> at<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> time<00:03:36.520> so<00:03:37.270> how<00:03:37.360> many<00:03:37.420> fires

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
one number at a time so how many fires

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.160 
one number at a time so how many fires
going<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.290> number<00:03:38.500> six<00:03:39.660> fire<00:03:40.660> goes<00:03:40.930> into

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
going to the number six fire goes into

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.160 
going to the number six fire goes into
the<00:03:41.260> number<00:03:41.440> six<00:03:41.709> once<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:43.690> doesn't<00:03:43.870> go<00:03:44.050> in

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
the number six once it doesn't go in

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.720 
the number six once it doesn't go in
exactly<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.300> difference<00:03:46.720> between<00:03:47.520> 5<00:03:48.520> and

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
exactly so the difference between 5 and

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.790 
exactly so the difference between 5 and
6<00:03:48.940> 5<00:03:49.630> goes<00:03:49.870> into<00:03:49.900> 6<00:03:50.170> once

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
6 5 goes into 6 once

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.699 
6 5 goes into 6 once
well<00:03:51.160> there's<00:03:51.310> one<00:03:51.520> left<00:03:51.760> over<00:03:52.290> now<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.530> one

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
well there's one left over now that one

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.890 
well there's one left over now that one
that's<00:03:53.950> left<00:03:54.100> over<00:03:54.310> I'm<00:03:55.300> not<00:03:55.480> going<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.660> forget

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
that's left over I'm not going to forget

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.270 
that's left over I'm not going to forget
about<00:03:55.959> it<00:03:56.170> I'm<00:03:56.320> going<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.530> carry<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.010> this

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
about it I'm going to carry it to this

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.830 
about it I'm going to carry it to this
next<00:03:57.580> number<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:57.970> we<00:03:58.060> can<00:03:58.209> consider<00:03:58.630> it

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
next number so we can consider it

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.710 
next number so we can consider it
alongside<00:03:59.500> this<00:03:59.950> one<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:01.090> instead<00:04:01.360> of<00:04:01.420> saying

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
alongside this one so instead of saying

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.280 
alongside this one so instead of saying
now<00:04:02.280> how<00:04:03.280> many<00:04:03.340> fives<00:04:03.790> go<00:04:04.030> into<00:04:04.360> five<00:04:04.810> we've

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
now how many fives go into five we've

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.680 
now how many fives go into five we've
got<00:04:05.560> how<00:04:05.950> many<00:04:06.220> fives<00:04:06.550> go<00:04:06.700> into<00:04:06.970> 15

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
got how many fives go into 15

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.420 
got how many fives go into 15
so<00:04:08.500> there<00:04:08.739> are<00:04:08.800> 1<00:04:09.010> 2<00:04:09.190> 3<00:04:09.520> 5<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.570> 15<00:04:11.310> so<00:04:12.310> our

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
so there are 1 2 3 5 and 15 so our

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.540 
so there are 1 2 3 5 and 15 so our
answer<00:04:12.630> now<00:04:13.630> becomes<00:04:14.080> 3<00:04:14.860> on<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.340> top<00:04:15.520> just

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
answer now becomes 3 on the top just

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.150 
answer now becomes 3 on the top just
there<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:18.100> our<00:04:18.250> answer<00:04:18.660> 65<00:04:19.660> divided<00:04:20.109> by<00:04:20.169> 5<00:04:20.470> is

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
there so our answer 65 divided by 5 is

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.189 
there so our answer 65 divided by 5 is
13

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:30.670 

we'll<00:04:25.199> have<00:04:25.319> another<00:04:25.590> girl<00:04:26.090> one<00:04:27.090> last<00:04:27.300> go

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:05:00.589 

we're<00:04:31.680> gonna<00:04:31.830> say<00:04:37.789> 74/377<00:04:38.789> kent<00:04:59.599> street

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
we're gonna say 74/377 kent street

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.510 
we're gonna say 74/377 kent street
sydney<00:05:00.810> is<00:05:01.680> one<00:05:02.029> so<00:05:03.029> we're<00:05:03.719> gonna<00:05:03.810> write

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
sydney is one so we're gonna write

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.679 
sydney is one so we're gonna write
carried<00:05:05.520> one<00:05:06.020> over<00:05:07.020> here<00:05:07.259> so<00:05:08.449> that's<00:05:09.449> now

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:09.689 
carried one over here so that's now

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.659 
carried one over here so that's now
become<00:05:09.960> 14<00:05:12.110> so<00:05:13.110> emily<00:05:13.379> 3<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.650> going<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:13.949> 14<00:05:14.430> when

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
become 14 so emily 3 is going to 14 when

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.360 
become 14 so emily 3 is going to 14 when
it's<00:05:14.819> 3<00:05:15.089> 6<00:05:15.449> 9<00:05:15.599> 12<00:05:16.310> so<00:05:17.310> that's<00:05:17.490> 4<00:05:19.009> but<00:05:20.009> we've<00:05:20.159> got

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
it's 3 6 9 12 so that's 4 but we've got

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.459 
it's 3 6 9 12 so that's 4 but we've got
2<00:05:20.849> left<00:05:21.839> over<00:05:23.569> so<00:05:24.569> we're<00:05:24.719> going<00:05:24.810> to<00:05:24.900> carry<00:05:25.110> the

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
2 left over so we're going to carry the

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.450 
2 left over so we're going to carry the
2<00:05:26.330> to<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.449> end<00:05:27.599> and<00:05:27.949> which<00:05:28.949> is<00:05:29.069> going<00:05:29.219> to<00:05:29.279> label
