however<00:00:55.310> I<00:00:55.400> didn't<00:00:55.670> actually<00:00:55.730> add<00:00:56.030> any<00:00:56.300> motion

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.840 
blur and as this is a CG sequence it's
quite<00:00:59.720> crisp<00:01:00.110> so<00:01:00.980> we<00:01:01.100> need<00:01:01.250> to<00:01:01.340> do<00:01:01.430> Smith<00:01:01.640> bit

more<00:01:01.940> realistic<00:01:02.300> but<00:01:02.660> add<00:01:02.870> a<00:01:02.899> bit<00:01:03.110> of<00:01:03.140> motion

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620

blur<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.260> sequence<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.610> let's<00:01:40.850> just<00:01:41.000> get<00:01:41.090> a

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150

appears<00:01:53.720> really<00:01:54.260> really<00:01:54.470> blurry<00:01:54.770> now<00:01:55.400> we<00:01:55.460> need

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
appears really really blurry now we need

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.950 
appears really really blurry now we need
to<00:01:55.760> fix<00:01:56.000> this<00:01:56.180> let's<00:01:56.780> go<00:01:56.930> back<00:01:57.110> to<00:01:57.140> final<00:01:57.530> cut

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
to fix this let's go back to final cut

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.810 
to fix this let's go back to final cut
now<00:01:59.960> if<00:02:00.229> we<00:02:00.350> just<00:02:00.500> move<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.890> timeline<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.729> the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
now if we just move the timeline to the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.350 
now if we just move the timeline to the
middle<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.180> secrets<00:02:02.600> where<00:02:02.780> we<00:02:02.840> can<00:02:02.960> see

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
middle of the secrets where we can see

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.649 
middle of the secrets where we can see
the<00:02:05.360> motion<00:02:05.659> blur<00:02:05.780> tell<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.140> most<00:02:06.350> effect

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
the motion blur tell you the most effect

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.789 
the motion blur tell you the most effect
and<00:02:08.659> I<00:02:08.840> mean<00:02:08.989> to<00:02:09.049> do<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.200> go<00:02:09.319> back<00:02:09.349> to<00:02:09.500> actual

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
and I mean to do is go back to actual

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.800 
and I mean to do is go back to actual
filters<00:02:10.220> tab<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.639> the<00:02:11.209> three<00:02:11.540> main

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.940 
time is 0.5 is the equivalent to 180
degrees<00:02:50.040> so<00:02:51.040> if<00:02:51.100> we<00:02:51.220> just<00:02:51.370> remove<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:51.730> 20<00:02:52.950> you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
degrees so if we just remove this 20 you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.610 
degrees so if we just remove this 20 you
see<00:02:54.130> we<00:02:54.250> have<00:02:54.430> non<00:02:54.880> motion<00:02:55.210> blood<00:02:55.360> on<00:02:55.510> there<00:02:55.690> if

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
see we have non motion blood on there if

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.680 
see we have non motion blood on there if
we<00:02:56.800> increase<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.340> 3.5<00:02:58.240> you<00:02:58.390> can<00:02:58.420> see<00:02:58.600> we

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
we increase this to 3.5 you can see we

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.630 
we increase this to 3.5 you can see we
have<00:02:58.720> lots<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.650> so<00:02:59.860> shutter<00:03:00.100> speeds<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.490> there

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
have lots of so shutter speeds on there

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.420 
have lots of so shutter speeds on there
as<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.600> lot<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:02.020> motion<00:03:02.200> by<00:03:02.440> going<00:03:02.710> on<00:03:02.830> what<00:03:03.280> we

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
as a lot of motion by going on what we

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.870 
as a lot of motion by going on what we
need<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.610> do<00:03:03.850> is<00:03:04.000> turn<00:03:04.300> this<00:03:04.510> down<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:06.400> actual

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
need to do is turn this down so actual

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.360 
need to do is turn this down so actual
0.5<00:03:08.700> now<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.730> know<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.210> correct<00:03:11.370> value

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
0.5 now I know this is the correct value

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.920 
0.5 now I know this is the correct value

your piece of footage I also have the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.680 
your piece of footage I also have the
shadow<00:03:20.950> samples<00:03:21.400> now<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.060> sets<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.330> number

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
shadow samples now this sets the number

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.420 
shadow samples now this sets the number
of<00:03:22.780> in<00:03:22.930> between<00:03:23.140> images<00:03:23.680> used<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.190> create<00:03:24.340> the

of in between images used to create the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.640 
of in between images used to create the
motion<00:03:24.940> blur<00:03:25.240> during<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.780> shirt<00:03:25.960> side<00:03:26.170> now<00:03:26.590> we

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
motion blur during the shirt side now we

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.080 
motion blur during the shirt side now we
can<00:03:26.770> increase<00:03:27.100> this<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.460> achieve<00:03:27.850> much<00:03:28.060> more

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
can increase this to achieve much more

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.270 
can increase this to achieve much more
smooth<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.870> motion<00:03:29.260> blur<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.650> respectively

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
smooth and motion blur and respectively

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.430 
smooth and motion blur and respectively
decrease<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:31.000> remove<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.600> much<00:03:32.050> more<00:03:32.170> jagged

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
decrease it to remove a much more jagged

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.360 
decrease it to remove a much more jagged
output<00:03:32.860> so<00:03:33.490> if<00:03:33.550> we<00:03:33.640> just<00:03:33.910> turn<00:03:34.690> this<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.990> one

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
output so if we just turn this to one

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.950 
output so if we just turn this to one
bit<00:03:36.370> more<00:03:36.550> of<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.670> jacket<00:03:36.970> output<00:03:37.270> in<00:03:37.360> there<00:03:37.450> if

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
bit more of a jacket output in there if

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.710 
bit more of a jacket output in there if
we<00:03:38.080> increase<00:03:38.530> this<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:39.040> say<00:03:39.460> 25<00:03:40.030> it's<00:03:40.390> much

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
we increase this to say 25 it's much

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.260 
we increase this to say 25 it's much
more<00:03:40.930> smoother<00:03:41.770> motion<00:03:41.980> blur<00:03:42.340> effect<00:03:42.700> as<00:03:43.120> you

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
more smoother motion blur effect as you

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.670 
more smoother motion blur effect as you
can<00:03:43.390> see<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.690> are<00:03:43.810> much<00:03:43.930> more<00:03:44.110> bit<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.350> a

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
can see that are much more bit of a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.860 
can see that are much more bit of a
blurring<00:03:45.310> effect<00:03:45.730> there<00:03:45.910> but<00:03:46.630> for<00:03:46.750> this

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
blurring effect there but for this

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.300 
blurring effect there but for this
particular<00:03:47.020> shot<00:03:47.560> what<00:03:47.710> we<00:03:47.800> need<00:03:47.950> to<00:03:48.070> do<00:03:48.190> is

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
particular shot what we need to do is

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.330 
particular shot what we need to do is
tune<00:03:48.580> this<00:03:48.700> down<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.150> four<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:53.830> also<00:03:53.980> have<00:03:54.220> the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
tune this down to four you also have the

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.280 
tune this down to four you also have the
vector<00:03:54.640> detail<00:03:55.090> pronto<00:03:55.570> now<00:03:55.960> that<00:03:56.170> we<00:03:56.260> just

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
vector detail pronto now that we just

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.200 
vector detail pronto now that we just
this<00:03:56.620> do<00:03:56.770> vary<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.310> density<00:03:57.790> of<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:57.940> vector

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.210 
this do vary the density of the vector

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.240 
this do vary the density of the vector
field<00:03:58.240> that<00:03:58.900> larger<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.410> vector<00:03:59.680> detail<00:04:00.040> is

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
field that larger the vector detail is

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.040 
field that larger the vector detail is
the<00:04:00.550> greater<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.880> processing<00:04:01.330> time<00:04:01.540> but<00:04:01.960> the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
the greater the processing time but the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.660 
the greater the processing time but the
more<00:04:02.230> detail<00:04:02.710> your<00:04:02.920> actual<00:04:03.160> vectors<00:04:03.520> and

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
more detail your actual vectors and

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.580 
more detail your actual vectors and
renders<00:04:04.030> should<00:04:04.180> be<00:04:04.380> for<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.410> particular

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
renders should be for this particular

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.260 
renders should be for this particular
sequence<00:04:06.160> we<00:04:06.280> don't<00:04:06.460> need<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.700> increase<00:04:07.060> this

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
sequence we don't need to increase this

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.660 
sequence we don't need to increase this
we're<00:04:07.420> gonna<00:04:07.570> leave<00:04:07.630> it<00:04:07.750> at<00:04:07.870> 0.2<00:04:08.520> so<00:04:09.520> now<00:04:09.610> we

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
we're gonna leave it at 0.2 so now we

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.220 
we're gonna leave it at 0.2 so now we
change<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.090> parameters<00:04:10.570> of<00:04:10.600> this<00:04:10.780> let's<00:04:11.080> get

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
change the parameters of this let's get

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.930 
change the parameters of this let's get
a<00:04:11.260> render<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.800> see<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.010> results<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.790> now<00:04:15.880> you

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
a render and see the results so now you

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.640 
a render and see the results so now you
play<00:04:16.180> through<00:04:16.420> actual<00:04:16.690> render<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.290> can<00:04:17.470> see

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
play through actual render you can see

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.229 
play through actual render you can see
you<00:04:17.739> had<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:17.920> much<00:04:18.160> nicer<00:04:18.340> effect<00:04:18.760> using<00:04:18.910> motion

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
you had a much nicer effect using motion

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.800 
you had a much nicer effect using motion
blur<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:21.130> now<00:04:21.250> we've<00:04:21.430> added<00:04:21.820> motion<00:04:22.420> blur<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.780> a

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
blur so now we've added motion blur to a

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.550 
blur so now we've added motion blur to a
retimed<00:04:23.500> CG<00:04:24.340> sequence

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
retimed CG sequence

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.020 
retimed CG sequence
now<00:04:26.919> this<00:04:27.070> is<00:04:27.130> just<00:04:27.310> an<00:04:27.430> overview<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:27.940> the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
now this is just an overview of the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.000 
now this is just an overview of the
motion<00:04:28.540> blur<00:04:28.750> effect<00:04:29.200> for<00:04:29.650> more<00:04:29.800> information
