reason<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.890> made<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.160> base<00:02:09.369> this<00:02:09.399> was<00:02:09.819> just<00:02:10.060> a

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
reason I made this base this was just a

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.570 
reason I made this base this was just a
test<00:02:10.420> base<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:12.190> see

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.510 

see<00:02:15.580> stuff<00:02:15.880> basically<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.569> see<00:02:16.780> if<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.520> we

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
see stuff basically to see if this we

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:31.199 
see stuff basically to see if this we
work<00:02:24.060> yeah<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.830> they're<00:02:27.150> now<00:02:28.150> all<00:02:28.540> just<00:02:30.209> make

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
work yeah so they're now all just make

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:40.199 
work yeah so they're now all just make
it<00:02:31.360> work<00:02:35.069> so<00:02:36.069> you'll<00:02:36.849> see<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.920> it's<00:02:39.209> two

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.520 
well except for the motor and one except
for<00:03:03.730> actual<00:03:04.150> electric<00:03:04.599> piece<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.080> use<00:03:05.290> in

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
for actual electric piece that I use in

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.160 
for actual electric piece that I use in
the<00:03:05.560> motor<00:03:06.209> one<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.299> my<00:03:07.360> mother's<00:03:07.569> on<00:03:07.870> five

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
the motor one of my mother's on five

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.050 
the motor one of my mother's on five
motors<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:10.209> yeah<00:03:10.980> for<00:03:11.980> walkers<00:03:12.430> for<00:03:12.940> the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
motors so yeah for walkers for the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.229 
motors so yeah for walkers for the
fourth<00:03:13.810> largest<00:03:13.930> again<00:03:14.440> so<00:03:15.160> yeah<00:03:15.310> now<00:03:15.700> for<00:03:16.120> the

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
fourth largest again so yeah now for the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.410 
fourth largest again so yeah now for the
inside<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.989> base<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:18.000> really<00:03:19.000> like<00:03:19.239> the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
inside of the base I really like the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.050 
inside of the base I really like the
space<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.079> made<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.500> it's<00:03:21.280> just<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:21.820> test

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
space and I made it it's just a test

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.800 
space and I made it it's just a test
base<00:03:22.299> though<00:03:22.630> pretty<00:03:23.350> much<00:03:24.090> it's<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.359> to<00:03:25.570> see

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
base though pretty much it's just to see

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.020 
base though pretty much it's just to see
oh<00:03:28.440> actually<00:03:29.440> it's<00:03:29.709> pretty<00:03:29.980> cool<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.910> yeah

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
oh actually it's pretty cool so yeah

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.880 
oh actually it's pretty cool so yeah
that's<00:03:31.600> basically<00:03:31.810> just<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.350> see<00:03:32.560> if<00:03:32.650> the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
that's basically just to see if the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.380 
that's basically just to see if the
double<00:03:33.220> sided<00:03:33.700> door<00:03:33.970> would<00:03:34.180> work<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:35.560> we<00:03:35.680> got<00:03:35.709> I

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
double sided door would work so we got I

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.300 
double sided door would work so we got I
guess<00:03:37.390> we'll<00:03:37.569> start<00:03:37.750> on<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.019> side<00:03:38.100> so<00:03:39.100> we<00:03:39.130> got

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
guess we'll start on this side so we got

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.830 
guess we'll start on this side so we got
some<00:03:39.640> assassin<00:03:40.239> droids<00:03:40.480> coming<00:03:40.840> in<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.840> that

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
some assassin droids coming in and that

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.340 
some assassin droids coming in and that
flow<00:03:44.079> can<00:03:44.880> replicate<00:03:46.290> fighting<00:03:47.290> these

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
flow can replicate fighting these

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.720 
flow can replicate fighting these
assassin<00:03:47.889> droids<00:03:48.130> you'll<00:03:48.280> notice<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.579> the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
assassin droids you'll notice that the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.199 
assassin droids you'll notice that the
one<00:03:48.910> has<00:03:50.100> separated<00:03:51.100> legs<00:03:51.370> that's<00:03:51.910> pretty

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
one has separated legs that's pretty

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.039 
one has separated legs that's pretty
cool<00:03:52.859> so<00:03:53.859> yeah<00:03:54.010> um<00:03:54.549> close<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.540> machine<00:03:55.840> gun

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
cool so yeah um close the machine gun

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.140 
cool so yeah um close the machine gun
commando<00:03:56.889> and<00:03:57.340> another<00:03:57.639> clone<00:03:57.910> with<00:03:58.060> a

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
commando and another clone with a

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.319 
commando and another clone with a
different<00:03:58.420> kind<00:03:58.600> of<00:03:58.660> chain<00:03:59.139> gun<00:03:59.350> or<00:03:59.500> something

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
different kind of chain gun or something

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.660 
different kind of chain gun or something
so<00:04:01.329> yeah<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.489> like<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:04.680> two<00:04:05.680> jet

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
so yeah this is like the two jet

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.479 
so yeah this is like the two jet
troopers<00:04:07.500> they're<00:04:08.500> my<00:04:08.620> customs<00:04:09.130> they<00:04:09.340> have

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
troopers they're my customs they have

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.809 
troopers they're my customs they have
the<00:04:09.670> different<00:04:09.850> bodies<00:04:11.400> some<00:04:12.400> clones

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
the different bodies some clones

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.720 
the different bodies some clones
shooting<00:04:13.269> those<00:04:13.389> super<00:04:13.690> battle<00:04:14.019> droids

clones<00:04:58.730> guarding<00:04:59.180> this<00:04:59.300> this<00:05:00.080> is<00:05:00.290> like<00:05:00.440> the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
clones guarding this this is like the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.320 
clones guarding this this is like the
comm<00:05:00.889> room<00:05:01.100> for<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.580> clones<00:05:01.940> who<00:05:02.180> are

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
comm room for the clones who are

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.390 
comm room for the clones who are
fighting<00:05:03.669> so<00:05:04.669> yeah<00:05:04.820> these<00:05:05.360> guys<00:05:05.570> are<00:05:05.810> also<00:05:06.400> two

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
guys with different bodies and they're

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.490 
guys with different bodies and they're
like<00:05:10.729> communicating<00:05:11.419> with<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.990> clones<00:05:12.350> were

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
like communicating with the clones were

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.469 
like communicating with the clones were
on<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.740> wall<00:05:12.889> and<00:05:13.070> stuff<00:05:13.280> seeing<00:05:14.180> if<00:05:14.300> they're

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
on the wall and stuff seeing if they're

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:15.900 
on the wall and stuff seeing if they're
alive

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910

another<00:05:19.970> clone<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:21.590> mark<00:05:21.860> on<00:05:22.010> shooting<00:05:22.370> them

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
another clone to mark on shooting them

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.590 
another clone to mark on shooting them
just<00:05:23.660> yeah<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.979> then<00:05:25.250> like<00:05:25.520> he'll<00:05:26.150> mouse<00:05:26.389> up
