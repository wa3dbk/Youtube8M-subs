00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.770 
think about like how how real it all is
and<00:04:02.560> how<00:04:03.560> it's<00:04:03.799> really<00:04:04.239> asking<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.329> question

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
and how it's really asking a question

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.780 
and how it's really asking a question
about<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:06.290> topic<00:04:06.850> that<00:04:07.850> is<00:04:08.090> pretty<00:04:09.790> pretty

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
about a topic that is pretty pretty

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.210 
about a topic that is pretty pretty
scary<00:04:11.180> for<00:04:11.480> some<00:04:11.630> people<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:11.930> think<00:04:12.200> about<00:04:12.290> but

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
scary for some people to think about but

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.000
