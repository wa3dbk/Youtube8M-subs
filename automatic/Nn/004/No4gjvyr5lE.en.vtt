00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello people today is about one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.240
 nail design I have not had one for a while 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.400
 Nail tutorial made more and thought 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.139
 I just make you like this 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.059
 lastminute oster tutorial where i am 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.519
 just a little white bunny 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.500
 with face painted on my ring finger 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.050
 how the whole thing is you see now 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.670
 and I would say a lot of fun 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.960
 while here we see already now 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.930
 everything we need, of course 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.500
 different nail polishes q tips and one 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.080
 scissors 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.179
 I use now red first 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 nail polish and carry it on every nail 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.649
 except on the level of the ring finger 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.120
 the exact colors I use 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.469
 I'll be right back 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.469
 Write infobox 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.300
 for the ring finger I now use the 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.300
 a friendly print of p 2 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.260
 Now I use white paint first 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.699
 and to draw my house 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.430
 Here I have chosen nail polish one 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.869
 game french models is suitable since the 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.869
 applicator is very thin 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.710
 I start here first with the head 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.009
 I just think that way 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:27.820
 semicircle and then it goes on the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.100
 directors so that the ears too first 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.200
 I prefer to be symmetrical 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.450
 one stroke up to the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.280
 nail bed and then I leave this 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.570
 strokes simply thicker they are the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.570
 small localities arise 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.039
 m 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.190
 now cuts with sharpness the code 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.270
 once diagonally apart around it 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.270
 to draw face 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.510
 However, I still take for the eyes 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.880
 debate page 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:11.340
 so that the eyes become so big with 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.770
 the pink nail polish I paint only the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.450
 ears and the munich after that I do 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:25.770
 then really with the beveled 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:28.560
 stems of the q tip so looks our hearts 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.780
 a little bit angry and that's why 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.570
 I take again here this white 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.560
 nail polish and draws something else 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.560
 live in the eye 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.400
 Today it was my new one 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.170
 nail design on the theme easter and if 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.209
 you like to see more nail tutorials 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.870
 Then just give me thumbs 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.730
 up 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.950
 otherwise it was a very common one 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.989
 asked question lately like me 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.209
 do my french modellage or if I am 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.680
 do that yourself and that can 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.870
 I answer directly yes I do 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.850
 the same with money and if 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.989
 you would like to see how it works then 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.610
 Just write me that in the 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.650
 infobox I had last in fact 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.690
 time quite often asked on facebook 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.680
 and so on whether I have a video 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.720
 could do 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.760
 and I think you could come if 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.470
 you now also say you would like that 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.810
 Well, I hope the video has you 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.959
 It is very easy and goes 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.250
 very fast and then we'll see you in the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.250
 next video again
