is that any of these products in a small

quantity are safe and sugar is safe in
small<00:01:28.350> quantities<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.340> my<00:01:29.430> taste<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.909> soon

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
small quantities for my taste I soon

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.730 
small quantities for my taste I soon
have<00:01:30.329> two<00:01:30.450> teaspoons<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:30.990> sugar<00:01:31.049> than<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.650> of

these equal or saccharine or Splenda but
the<00:01:35.430> real<00:01:35.610> danger<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.270> believe<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.049> high

the real danger I believe is in high

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.580 
the real danger I believe is in high

fructose is metabolized differently it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.389 
fructose is metabolized differently it
goes<00:01:45.060> right<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> fat<00:01:45.750> cells<00:01:46.100> it's<00:01:47.100> not

is<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.240> want<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.570> any<00:01:51.689> of

these<00:01:51.869> products<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.470> small<00:01:52.740> quantities

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
these products in small quantities

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
these products in small quantities
that's<00:01:53.579> safe<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.299> avoid<00:01:54.600> high<00:01:54.840> fructose<00:01:55.110> corn

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
that's safe but avoid high fructose corn
