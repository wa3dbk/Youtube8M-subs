00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.279 
create pick and he got the X&amp;Y
coordinates<00:00:14.790> mixed<00:00:15.330> up<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.870> gave<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.199> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
coordinates mixed up and this gave it a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.109 
coordinates mixed up and this gave it a
vertical<00:00:16.770> body<00:00:16.920> instead<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.490> horizontal

vertical body instead of a horizontal
ones<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:19.380> decided<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.100> turn<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.460> into

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
ones so they decided to turn this into

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that now and as you can see even though

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
that now and as you can see even though
the<00:00:29.910> original<00:00:30.420> creeper<00:00:30.720> looks<00:00:30.900> vaguely

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.260 
the original creeper looks vaguely
similar<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.309> tongue<00:00:32.460> special<00:00:32.910> appearance

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
similar and tongue special appearance

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.930 
similar and tongue special appearance
has<00:00:33.450> changed<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.290> very<00:00:34.320> much<00:00:34.890> as<00:00:35.100> para<00:00:35.370> habeas

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
has changed so very much as para habeas

has changed so very much as para habeas
and<00:00:36.059> Sons<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.540> since<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.050> was<00:00:37.200> survival<00:00:37.680> test

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and Sons so since this was survival test

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.619 
and Sons so since this was survival test
which<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.250> way<00:00:38.520> before<00:00:38.760> even<00:00:39.090> sound<00:00:39.480> was

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
which was way before even sound was

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.569 
which was way before even sound was
added<00:00:39.899> against<00:00:40.230> plate<00:00:40.469> years<00:00:40.710> ago<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
added against plate years ago the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340 
added against plate years ago the
creeper<00:00:41.969> did<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.300> few<00:00:42.600> different<00:00:42.750> things<00:00:42.960> than

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
it does right now so first of all I

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.250 
it does right now so first of all I
actually<00:00:45.090> flash<00:00:45.420> between<00:00:45.750> two<00:00:45.960> separate

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260

actually flash between two separate
shades<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.590> green<00:00:46.800> giving<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.309> really

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
shades of green giving it this really

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.700 
shades of green giving it this really
weird<00:00:47.969> kind<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.420> concerning<00:00:48.899> look<00:00:49.230> from<00:00:49.440> far

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
weird kind of concerning look from far

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.529 
weird kind of concerning look from far
second<00:00:50.489> thought<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.850> did<00:00:51.030> damage<00:00:51.390> through

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
second thought it did damage through

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.090 
second thought it did damage through
actual<00:00:51.870> physical<00:00:52.199> attacks<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.770> did<00:00:52.920> two

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
hearts / attack it's kind of like a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.389 
hearts / attack it's kind of like a
zombie<00:00:55.020> ascent<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.500> now<00:00:55.649> essentially<00:00:56.160> pull

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
zombie ascent right now essentially pull

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.099 
zombie ascent right now essentially pull
it<00:00:56.489> was<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> creeper<00:00:56.940> too<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.750> things<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
it was a creeper too and the things that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.750 
it was a creeper too and the things that
makes<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.800> kind<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.129> weird<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.520> instead

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
makes it really kind of weird is instead

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.099 
makes it really kind of weird is instead
of<00:00:59.879> blowing<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.539> gets<00:01:00.660> close<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.899> you

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
of blowing up when it gets close to you

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.349 
of blowing up when it gets close to you
as<00:01:01.350> she<00:01:01.620> blows<00:01:01.829> up<00:01:01.859> when<00:01:02.250> it's<00:01:02.399> killed<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.120> it's

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
as she blows up when it's killed so it's

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.640 
as she blows up when it's killed so it's
actually<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.960> know<00:01:04.080> something<00:01:04.409> unavoidable

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
actually you know something unavoidable

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.219 
actually you know something unavoidable
fret<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.489> since<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.270> course<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.840> creeper

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
fret so since then of course the creeper

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.289 
fret so since then of course the creeper
has<00:01:07.350> changed<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.070> very<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.909> become<00:01:09.180> one

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
has changed so very much it's become one

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.700 
has changed so very much it's become one
of<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> most<00:01:09.450> iconic<00:01:09.720> parts<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.530> game

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
of the most iconic parts of the game

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
of the most iconic parts of the game
mainly<00:01:11.490> because<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.790> how<00:01:11.970> menacing<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:12.600> are

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
mainly because of how menacing they are

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.880 
mainly because of how menacing they are
in<00:01:12.900> survival<00:01:13.140> mode<00:01:13.320> where<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.590> make<00:01:13.740> this

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
in survival mode where they make this

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.770 
in survival mode where they make this
very<00:01:14.130> recognizable<00:01:14.939> tester<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> big

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
very recognizable tester for a big

bug<00:01:40.049> all<00:01:40.229> those<00:01:40.470> years<00:01:40.680> ago<00:01:41.000> minecraft<00:01:42.000> might

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
bug all those years ago minecraft might

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.819 
bug all those years ago minecraft might
not<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.540> done<00:01:42.750> quite<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.229> well<00:01:43.380> because<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
not have done quite so well because it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.950 
not have done quite so well because it
had<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> different<00:01:44.250> logo<00:01:44.640> survival<00:01:45.600> mode<00:01:45.750> would

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
had a different logo survival mode would

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.660 
had a different logo survival mode would
play<00:01:46.140> differently<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> game<00:01:47.310> might<00:01:47.579> have

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
play differently and the game might have

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.340 
play differently and the game might have
taken<00:01:47.820> an<00:01:48.060> entirely<00:01:48.479> different<00:01:48.869> turn<00:01:49.110> as<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
taken an entirely different turn as a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.960 
taken an entirely different turn as a
result<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.950> being<00:01:50.159> quite<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.369> whack<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.820> at

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
result not being quite so whack is at

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.609 
result not being quite so whack is at
