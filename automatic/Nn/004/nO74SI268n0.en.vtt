going to do is duplicate all these

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.900 
going to do is duplicate all these
layers<00:00:51.949> that's<00:00:52.949> pretty<00:00:53.309> much<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.670> we're

it's actually pretty easy to make what

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
it's actually pretty easy to make what
easier<00:01:07.060> thought<00:01:07.330> would<00:01:07.480> be

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
easier thought would be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.219 
easier thought would be
fix<00:01:09.650> minor<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:11.540> guys<00:01:11.690> can<00:01:11.840> go<00:01:11.930> back<00:01:12.080> and

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
fix minor you guys can go back and

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:21.420 
fix minor you guys can go back and
fine-tune<00:01:12.650> whatever<00:01:13.640> when<00:01:13.820> you're<00:01:13.940> done

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:35.440 

duplicate

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:45.590 

make<00:01:36.450> these<00:01:36.690> things<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.200> smaller

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.499 

like<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.290> said<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.610> fine<00:01:47.820> tune<00:01:47.850> on

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
like I said because I can fine tune on

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.230 
like I said because I can fine tune on
your<00:01:48.659> own<00:01:48.780> time<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.159> time<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.939> shut<00:01:51.210> up
