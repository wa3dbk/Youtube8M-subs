things go so you have the show some of

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.520 
things go so you have the show some of
the<00:03:17.790> gameplay<00:03:18.269> looks<00:03:18.540> very<00:03:18.840> very<00:03:18.930> similar<00:03:19.170> to

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
the gameplay looks very very similar to

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.979 
the gameplay looks very very similar to
the<00:03:19.920> first<00:03:20.100> game<00:03:20.370> Disney<00:03:20.730> infinity<00:03:20.989> although

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
the first game Disney infinity although

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.270

something new they talked about was

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.280 
something new they talked about was

abilities like for instance captain

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.599 
abilities like for instance captain
america<00:03:27.870> shield<00:03:28.109> has<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.859> I<00:03:29.040> guess<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.489> have

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
america shield has like I guess you have

Captain America and kind of has this
little<00:03:31.470> skill<00:03:32.190> tree<00:03:32.459> now<00:03:32.670> where<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:32.970> can

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
little skill tree now where you can

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.870 
little skill tree now where you can
upgrade<00:03:33.799> different<00:03:34.799> parts<00:03:35.100> of<00:03:35.220> his<00:03:35.400> abilities

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
upgrade different parts of his abilities

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.300 
upgrade different parts of his abilities
so<00:03:36.030> you<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.239> upgrade<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.570> shield<00:03:37.070> maybe<00:03:38.070> make

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
so you can upgrade a shield maybe make

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.390 
so you can upgrade a shield maybe make
it<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.700> stronger<00:03:39.359> faster<00:03:39.900> more<00:03:40.410> powerful<00:03:40.590> so

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
it a stronger faster more powerful so

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.789 
it a stronger faster more powerful so
that'll<00:03:42.150> be<00:03:42.269> cool<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.690> see<00:03:42.720> they<00:03:43.109> showed<00:03:43.350> the

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
that'll be cool to see they showed the

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.770 
that'll be cool to see they showed the
Hulk<00:03:43.980> climbing<00:03:44.430> up<00:03:44.579> this<00:03:45.030> building<00:03:45.570> and

chest there the level cap now can go up

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.899 
chest there the level cap now can go up
to<00:03:58.940> 20<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.890> you<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.400> know<00:04:01.519> so<00:04:01.730> there's<00:04:01.879> a

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
to 20 and you you know so there's a

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.030 
to 20 and you you know so there's a
little<00:04:02.000> more<00:04:02.150> flexibility<00:04:02.870> with<00:04:02.959> that<00:04:03.409> with

the characters also some of the other

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.470 
the characters also some of the other
upgrades<00:04:06.769> I<00:04:07.220> guess<00:04:07.549> you<00:04:07.909> know<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.269> sort<00:04:08.390> of

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
upgrades I guess you know just sort of

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.030 
upgrades I guess you know just sort of
talk<00:04:08.629> about<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.080> toybox<00:04:09.470> months<00:04:09.890> though

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
talk about of the toybox months though

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.559 
talk about of the toybox months though
they<00:04:10.489> spent<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.790> lot<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.000> time<00:04:11.180> talking<00:04:11.450> about

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
they spent a lot of time talking about

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.970 
they spent a lot of time talking about
the<00:04:11.750> toy<00:04:11.930> box<00:04:12.140> mode<00:04:12.349> some<00:04:12.739> of<00:04:12.799> the<00:04:12.860> upgrades

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
the toy box mode some of the upgrades

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.710 
the toy box mode some of the upgrades
with<00:04:13.310> that<00:04:13.459> they're<00:04:13.640> offering<00:04:14.030> more

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
with that they're offering more

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.509 
with that they're offering more
structured<00:04:15.290> play<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:16.040> put<00:04:16.130> that<00:04:16.310> in<00:04:16.370> quotes

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
structured play and put that in quotes

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.240 
structured play and put that in quotes
as<00:04:16.880> that's<00:04:17.060> what<00:04:17.209> they<00:04:17.299> called<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.100> think

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
as that's what they called it so I think

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.280 
as that's what they called it so I think
what<00:04:19.579> they<00:04:19.669> try<00:04:19.850> and<00:04:19.940> do<00:04:20.030> is<00:04:20.120> make<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.329> a<00:04:20.479> little

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
what they try and do is make it a little

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.080 
what they try and do is make it a little
more<00:04:21.410> simplified<00:04:21.979> because<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:22.580> know<00:04:22.669> I<00:04:22.850> got<00:04:23.030> a

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
more simplified because you know I got a

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.090 
more simplified because you know I got a
couple<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.449> degrees<00:04:23.660> from<00:04:23.960> college<00:04:24.350> and<00:04:24.530> I

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
couple of degrees from college and I

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.320 
couple of degrees from college and I
tried<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.370> get<00:04:25.520> in<00:04:25.669> and<00:04:25.850> do<00:04:25.970> some<00:04:26.150> stuff<00:04:26.300> with

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
tried to get in and do some stuff with

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.020 
tried to get in and do some stuff with
toy<00:04:26.600> box<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.229> it<00:04:28.010> was<00:04:28.100> very<00:04:28.250> confusing<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.910> me

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
toy box and it was very confusing to me

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.060 
toy box and it was very confusing to me
so<00:04:29.270> yes<00:04:29.539> when<00:04:29.900> it<00:04:30.020> comes<00:04:30.139> to<00:04:30.229> structure<00:04:30.680> 20

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
so yes when it comes to structure 20

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.370 
so yes when it comes to structure 20
boxing<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.820> kind<00:04:32.570> of<00:04:32.660> want<00:04:32.840> that<00:04:32.900> because<00:04:33.139> I<00:04:33.289> was

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
boxing I kind of want that because I was

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.750 
boxing I kind of want that because I was
very<00:04:33.440> confused<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.130> that's<00:04:34.310> being<00:04:34.460> on<00:04:34.639> that

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
very confused and that's being on that

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.920 
very confused and that's being on that
they're<00:04:34.940> going<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.150> have<00:04:35.240> these<00:04:35.330> builders<00:04:35.870> or

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
they're going to have these builders or

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.170 
they're going to have these builders or
more<00:04:36.320> builders<00:04:36.740> in<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.039> toy<00:04:37.610> box<00:04:37.850> so<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.120> can

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
more builders in the toy box so you can

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.779 
more builders in the toy box so you can
drop<00:04:38.449> in<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:38.990> they'll<00:04:39.710> push<00:04:40.370> around<00:04:40.520> some

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
drop in and they'll push around some
