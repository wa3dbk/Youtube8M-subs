00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
really crazy actually I mean it felt it

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.870 
really crazy actually I mean it felt it
feels<00:01:16.050> like<00:01:16.230> it<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.710> can<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.190> it's<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.370> you

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
feels like it so we can but it's not you

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.340 
feels like it so we can but it's not you
know<00:01:18.050> so<00:01:19.050> it's<00:01:20.010> not<00:01:20.220> dead<00:01:21.080> if<00:01:22.080> they're

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
know so it's not dead if they're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.140 
know so it's not dead if they're
targeting<00:01:22.920> families<00:01:23.370> really<00:01:23.580> well<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
targeting families really well the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.200 
targeting families really well the
reputation<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.930> family<00:01:25.320> resort<00:01:25.590> is

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
reputation of a family resort is

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.320 
reputation of a family resort is
expanding<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.360> after<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:27.870> I<00:01:28.490> guess<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> if

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
expanding and after all I guess it is if

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.210 
expanding and after all I guess it is if
you<00:01:30.600> still<00:01:30.900> think<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.290> Vegas<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.979> place

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
you still think that Vegas is a place

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
you still think that Vegas is a place
for<00:01:32.430> kids<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> guess<00:01:33.360> circle<00:01:34.080> circle<00:01:34.380> is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
for kids then I guess circle circle is

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.109 
for kids then I guess circle circle is
probably<00:01:34.830> where<00:01:35.460> they're<00:01:35.580> gonna<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.910> more

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
probably where they're gonna have more
