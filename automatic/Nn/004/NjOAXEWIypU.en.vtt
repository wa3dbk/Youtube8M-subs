am using the Sigma angle brush this is
65<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> think<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.630> Maybelline<00:00:28.109> gel<00:00:28.320> liner

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
65 I think and the Maybelline gel liner

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.889 
65 I think and the Maybelline gel liner
it's<00:00:30.330> amazing<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.320> lasts<00:00:31.859> forever<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.899> just

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
it's amazing it lasts forever you just

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
it's amazing it lasts forever you just
need<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.170> take<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> very<00:00:34.710> small<00:00:35.070> amount<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
need to take a very small amount on the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.049 
need to take a very small amount on the
brush<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:38.190> brush<00:00:38.430> should<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.820> very

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
brush and the brush should be very

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.299 
brush and the brush should be very
precise<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.200> draw<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.590> thin

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
precise so that you can draw a very thin

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.470 
precise so that you can draw a very thin
line<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:43.140> need<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> imagine<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:44.280> line<00:00:44.520> from<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
line you need to imagine a line from the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.020 
line you need to imagine a line from the
outer<00:00:45.840> corner<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.469> eye<00:00:46.789> towards<00:00:47.789> your

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
outer corner of your eye towards your

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.779 
outer corner of your eye towards your
eyebrow<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.550> draw<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> line<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.090> very<00:00:51.360> thin<00:00:51.690> line

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
eyebrow and draw a line a very thin line

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.670 
eyebrow and draw a line a very thin line
the<00:00:53.789> size<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> line<00:00:54.539> completely<00:00:55.199> depends

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the size of the line completely depends

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.130 
the size of the line completely depends
upon<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.660> want<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.960> very

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
upon you like if you want a very

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.650 
upon you like if you want a very
dramatic<00:00:58.379> eye<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.489> make<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.910> longer<00:01:00.180> or

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
dramatic eye you can make it longer or

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.119 
dramatic eye you can make it longer or
in<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:01.859> case<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.370> prefer<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.000> size<00:01:03.650> next<00:01:04.650> I'm

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
in my case I prefer this size next I'm

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.190 
in my case I prefer this size next I'm
going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.640> draw<00:01:06.060> another<00:01:06.210> line<00:01:06.510> from<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
going to draw another line from the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
going to draw another line from the
second<00:01:07.560> point<00:01:07.770> towards<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:08.220> eye<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.729> form<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
second point towards my eye and form a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.670 
second point towards my eye and form a
triangle<00:01:11.510> then<00:01:12.510> I'm<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.049> fill<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
triangle then I'm going to fill up the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
triangle then I'm going to fill up the
triangle<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.640> small<00:01:15.119> strokes<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:16.700> prefer

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
triangle with the small strokes I prefer

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.210 
triangle with the small strokes I prefer
to<00:01:18.000> keep<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.630> triangle<00:01:19.409> thinner<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
to keep the triangle thinner at the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.480 
to keep the triangle thinner at the
beginning<00:01:21.259> because<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.710> try<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:22.979> keep<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
beginning because if I try to keep it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.999 
beginning because if I try to keep it
thicker<00:01:23.970> from<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.570> beginning<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.290> gets<00:01:25.590> messy

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
thicker from the beginning it gets messy

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.170 
thicker from the beginning it gets messy
in<00:01:26.220> my<00:01:26.369> case<00:01:27.500> now<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.340> thicken

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
in my case now we are going to thicken

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.920 
in my case now we are going to thicken
up<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.450> line<00:01:30.780> slowly<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.509> you<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.720> don't

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
up the line slowly and you just don't

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.899 
up the line slowly and you just don't
need<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.380> dap<00:01:34.740> again<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.250> again<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.670> again

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
need to dap again and again and again

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.510 
need to dap again and again and again
the<00:01:35.970> brush<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.079> pot<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.070> small

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the brush in the pot because the small

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.039 
the brush in the pot because the small
amount<00:01:38.850> goes<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> long<00:01:39.390> way

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.959 

for<00:01:45.049> this<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:46.189> can<00:01:46.340> see<00:01:46.609> that<00:01:46.789> I'm

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
for this and you can see that I'm

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.240 
for this and you can see that I'm
pulling<00:01:47.359> this<00:01:47.509> scheme<00:01:47.899> which<00:01:48.619> is<00:01:48.649> actually

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
pulling this scheme which is actually

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.450 
pulling this scheme which is actually
not<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.429> good<00:01:49.700> habit<00:01:49.939> but<00:01:50.679> this<00:01:51.679> is<00:01:51.799> me<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:52.159> can't

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
not a good habit but this is me I can't

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:02.710 
not a good habit but this is me I can't
help<00:01:52.670> it

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.210 

now<00:02:03.720> I'm<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> take<00:02:04.440> some<00:02:04.680> more<00:02:04.860> product

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
now I'm going to take some more product

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.700 
now I'm going to take some more product
in<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> brush<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.030> we'll<00:02:06.840> draw<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.170> line<00:02:07.380> from

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
in the brush and we'll draw a line from

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.180 
in the brush and we'll draw a line from
your<00:02:08.039> inner<00:02:08.670> corner<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.149> your<00:02:09.390> eye<00:02:10.039> we'll<00:02:11.039> do

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
your inner corner of your eye we'll do

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.000 
your inner corner of your eye we'll do
this<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.580> small<00:02:11.910> strokes<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.770> get

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
this with small strokes so that we get

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.510 
this with small strokes so that we get
every<00:02:14.340> precise<00:02:14.790> dent<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.300> line<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:16.520> we'll

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
every precise dent in line and we'll

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:27.380 
every precise dent in line and we'll
join<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.150> with<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.420> previous<00:02:19.110> line<00:02:26.390> always

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
join it with the previous line always

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.320 
join it with the previous line always
remember<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.340> need<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.670> spend<00:02:30.030> a

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
remember that you just need to spend a

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.280 
remember that you just need to spend a
little<00:02:30.660> bit<00:02:30.840> time<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.530> get<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> perfect<00:02:32.790> liner

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
little bit time to get a perfect liner

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.470 
little bit time to get a perfect liner
if<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.860> hurry<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.489> usually<00:02:35.880> not

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
if you do it in hurry it's usually not

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.780 
if you do it in hurry it's usually not
perfect<00:02:37.080> but<00:02:37.320> obviously<00:02:38.010> when<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.430> become<00:02:38.670> an

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
perfect but obviously when you become an

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
perfect but obviously when you become an
expert<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.959> can<00:02:39.989> do<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.620> guess<00:02:41.510> now<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:42.570> are

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
expert you can do it I guess now we are

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.140 
expert you can do it I guess now we are
going<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.260> thicken<00:02:44.070> up<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.489> outer<00:02:44.730> side<00:02:45.120> of

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
going to thicken up the outer side of

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.009 
going to thicken up the outer side of
the<00:02:45.420> line<00:02:46.430> slowly<00:02:47.430> joining<00:02:47.940> with<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.360> inner

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
the line slowly joining with the inner

00:02:49.019 --> 00:03:00.860 
the line slowly joining with the inner
corner<00:02:58.340> yes<00:02:59.340> now<00:03:00.060> we<00:03:00.120> are<00:03:00.330> done<00:03:00.569> with<00:03:00.720> our

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
corner yes now we are done with our

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.140 
corner yes now we are done with our
first<00:03:01.170> time<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:02.430> think<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.790> shape<00:03:02.940> is

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
first time and I think the shape is

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.449 
first time and I think the shape is
perfect<00:03:03.600> for<00:03:03.810> me<00:03:03.930> I<00:03:04.140> like<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.890> shape<00:03:05.160> and

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
perfect for me I like this shape and

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.400 
perfect for me I like this shape and
this<00:03:05.760> thickness<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.630> wing<00:03:09.019> next<00:03:10.019> we<00:03:10.320> are

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
this thickness of the wing next we are

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.520 
this thickness of the wing next we are
going<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.829> do<00:03:11.160> our<00:03:11.310> second<00:03:11.790> eye<00:03:12.140> again<00:03:13.140> we<00:03:13.290> draw

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
going to do our second eye again we draw

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.310 
going to do our second eye again we draw
an<00:03:13.650> imaginary<00:03:13.769> line<00:03:14.340> from<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.269> outer<00:03:15.690> corner

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
an imaginary line from the outer corner

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.970 
an imaginary line from the outer corner
of<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.560> eye<00:03:16.620> towards<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.519> eyebrows<00:03:18.769> for<00:03:19.769> this

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
of the eye towards the eyebrows for this

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.660 
of the eye towards the eyebrows for this
we<00:03:20.250> need<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.489> scotch<00:03:20.850> tape

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.460 

take<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.700> small<00:03:27.090> piece<00:03:27.420> of<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.840> scotch<00:03:28.140> tape

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
take a small piece of the scotch tape

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.160 
take a small piece of the scotch tape
and<00:03:28.730> stick<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.879> on<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.300> outer<00:03:30.450> side<00:03:30.780> of<00:03:30.810> your

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
and stick it on the outer side of your

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.680 
and stick it on the outer side of your
hand<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:32.129> that<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.519> stickiness<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.180> gone<00:03:33.420> and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
hand so that the stickiness is gone and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.860 
hand so that the stickiness is gone and
it<00:03:33.989> doesn't<00:03:34.379> harm<00:03:34.620> your<00:03:35.000> sensitive<00:03:36.000> area

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
it doesn't harm your sensitive area

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.010 
it doesn't harm your sensitive area
around<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.319> eyes

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.320 

next<00:03:46.020> stick<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.680> scotch<00:03:47.040> tape<00:03:47.340> along<00:03:48.270> the

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
next stick the scotch tape along the

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.930 
next stick the scotch tape along the
imaginary<00:03:49.319> line<00:03:49.560> from<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:50.160> outer<00:03:50.190> side<00:03:50.910> of

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
imaginary line from the outer side of

your<00:03:51.360> eye<00:03:51.390> towards<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.350> eyebrow<00:03:52.940> try<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.000> make

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
your eye towards the eyebrow try to make

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.710 
your eye towards the eyebrow try to make
it<00:03:54.480> symmetrical<00:03:54.690> with<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.560> other<00:03:56.130> eye<00:03:56.720> mostly

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
it symmetrical with the other eye mostly

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.949 
it symmetrical with the other eye mostly
it's<00:03:57.930> difficult<00:03:58.470> for<00:03:58.620> me<00:04:02.390> now<00:04:03.390> we<00:04:03.450> are<00:04:03.810> going

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
it's difficult for me now we are going

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.830 
it's difficult for me now we are going
to<00:04:04.140> take<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.560> sharpened<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.430> pencil<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.360> here

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
to take a sharpened I pencil and here

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.990 
to take a sharpened I pencil and here
I'm<00:04:06.989> using<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.530> Sigma<00:04:07.770> one<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.489> is<00:04:08.670> in<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
I'm using the Sigma one it is in the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.930 
I'm using the Sigma one it is in the
shared<00:04:09.300> boost<00:04:09.890> we<00:04:10.890> are<00:04:11.040> going<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.430> draw<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.700> line

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
shared boost we are going to draw a line

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.720 
shared boost we are going to draw a line
from<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.720> outer<00:04:12.959> corner<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.709> eye<00:04:13.830> towards

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
from the outer corner of the eye towards

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.310 
from the outer corner of the eye towards
the<00:04:15.300> end<00:04:15.989> of<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.230> eyebrow<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:18.140> advantage<00:04:19.140> is

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
the end of the eyebrow the advantage is

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.610 
the end of the eyebrow the advantage is
it<00:04:19.350> can<00:04:19.799> be<00:04:19.950> messy<00:04:20.430> but<00:04:20.730> it's<00:04:20.910> alright<00:04:21.450> because

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
it can be messy but it's alright because

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.640 
it can be messy but it's alright because
we<00:04:22.620> have<00:04:22.860> our<00:04:23.040> guideline<00:04:23.460> here<00:04:24.320> again<00:04:25.320> we<00:04:25.560> are

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
we have our guideline here again we are

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.710 
we have our guideline here again we are
going<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.950> draw<00:04:26.130> another<00:04:26.250> line<00:04:26.580> from<00:04:27.510> the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
going to draw another line from the

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.570 
going to draw another line from the
outer<00:04:27.900> corner<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> eye<00:04:28.710> towards<00:04:29.250> the

outer corner of the eye towards the
inner<00:04:29.850> side<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.510> line<00:04:31.320> should<00:04:31.590> be<00:04:31.650> thick

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
inner side and the line should be thick

on the outer side and thinner on the
inner<00:04:35.130> corner<00:04:37.010> we<00:04:38.010> are<00:04:38.070> going<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.490> even<00:04:38.880> the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
inner corner we are going to even the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.830 
inner corner we are going to even the
line<00:04:39.210> by<00:04:39.600> small<00:04:40.110> strokes<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:42.300> also<00:04:42.479> can<00:04:42.810> use

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
line by small strokes you also can use

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.540 
line by small strokes you also can use
the<00:04:43.110> gel<00:04:43.320> liner<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:44.250> same<00:04:44.490> way<00:04:46.220> but<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.430> am

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
the gel liner the same way but I am

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.969 
the gel liner the same way but I am
using<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.300> pencil<00:04:48.660> on<00:04:48.990> in<00:04:49.140> this<00:04:49.350> case<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.950> show

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
using the pencil on in this case to show

00:04:49.979 --> 00:05:06.090 
using the pencil on in this case to show
you<00:04:50.370> two<00:04:50.610> different<00:04:50.640> way

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.830 

now<00:05:07.100> we<00:05:07.190> are<00:05:07.520> going<00:05:07.730> to<00:05:07.880> draw<00:05:08.120> from<00:05:08.450> inner

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
now we are going to draw from inner

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.470 
now we are going to draw from inner
corner<00:05:08.870> of<00:05:09.170> the<00:05:09.410> eye<00:05:09.550> towards<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.790> outer<00:05:11.000> side

corner of the eye towards the outer side

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.080 
corner of the eye towards the outer side
and<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:12.500> should<00:05:12.680> be<00:05:12.800> right<00:05:12.980> in<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.520> close<00:05:13.820> to

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
and it should be right in and close to

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.330 
and it should be right in and close to
the<00:05:14.210> lashline<00:05:16.780> now<00:05:17.780> fill<00:05:18.170> up<00:05:18.290> all<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.710> gaps<00:05:18.920> in
