that what we have created here is a one

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.960 
that what we have created here is a one
page<00:00:26.660> template<00:00:27.660> an<00:00:28.080> index<00:00:28.530> file<00:00:28.770> that<00:00:29.670> is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
page template an index file that is

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.139 
page template an index file that is
capable<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.630> rendering<00:00:31.070> up<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.460> thousands<00:00:33.030> of

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
capable of rendering up to thousands of

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.590 
capable of rendering up to thousands of
pages<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.370> all<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.699> the<00:00:35.730> same<00:00:36.149> design

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
pages and all have the same design

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.000 
pages and all have the same design
scheme<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.290> flow<00:00:38.130> going<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.380> so<00:00:40.380> it<00:00:40.590> makes

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
scheme and flow going on and so it makes

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.549 
scheme and flow going on and so it makes
website<00:00:41.700> management<00:00:42.060> really<00:00:42.660> easy<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.380> you

can have lots of data archive or indexed
in<00:00:47.190> your<00:00:47.340> system<00:00:47.760> all<00:00:48.450> right<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.930> now<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.980> we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
in your system all right so now that we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.979 
in your system all right so now that we
have<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.520> system<00:00:51.120> set<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.719> where<00:00:51.809> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
have this system set up to where this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.350 
have this system set up to where this
little<00:00:52.829> magic<00:00:53.280> page<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.700> gonna<00:00:53.880> render<00:00:54.149> out

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360

little magic page is gonna render out
everything<00:00:54.870> from<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> database<00:00:55.590> according

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
we put in one security measure because

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.999 
we put in one security measure because

the URL string up top here tells the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.450 
the URL string up top here tells the

that's in the system the page will come

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.260 
that's in the system the page will come
up<00:01:49.650> if<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.310> number<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:50.759> not<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.150> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
up if it's a number that's not in the

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.339 
make sure this thing keeps its size no
matter<00:02:27.120> if<00:02:27.269> there's<00:02:27.450> only<00:02:27.540> one<00:02:27.840> or<00:02:27.959> two<00:02:28.080> lines

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
matter if there's only one or two lines

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.009 
matter if there's only one or two lines
it'll<00:02:28.769> still<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.190> some<00:02:29.459> some<00:02:30.209> links<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.900> the

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
it'll still have some some links to the

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.880 
it'll still have some some links to the
page<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.590> if<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:32.610> more<00:02:32.879> than<00:02:33.769> what's<00:02:34.769> in

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
page and if it's more than what's in

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.300 
page and if it's more than what's in
there<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.580> will<00:02:35.849> show<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.269> too<00:02:36.500> if<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.799> page

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
there it will show it too if the page

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.990 
there it will show it too if the page
content<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:39.569> bigger<00:02:39.900> than<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.319> area<00:02:41.000> it'll

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
content it's bigger than this area it'll

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600 
content it's bigger than this area it'll
still<00:02:42.239> show<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.629> vertically<00:02:43.040> okay<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.099> now

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
still show it vertically okay so now

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.789 
still show it vertically okay so now
let's<00:02:45.480> get<00:02:45.629> this<00:02:45.810> line<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.319> here<00:02:46.440> that's<00:02:46.680> going

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
let's get this line in here that's going

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.309 
let's get this line in here that's going
to<00:02:46.860> clean<00:02:47.129> out<00:02:47.340> all<00:02:47.610> letters<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.810> characters

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
to clean out all letters and characters

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.400 
to clean out all letters and characters
from<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.310> URL<00:02:50.489> string<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.629> nothing<00:02:52.290> but

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
from that URL string so it's nothing but

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.110 
from that URL string so it's nothing but
a<00:02:52.440> number<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:52.829> can<00:02:53.010> ensure<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:53.640> database

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
a number we can ensure that a database

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.059 
a number we can ensure that a database
will<00:02:54.359> not<00:02:54.540> get<00:02:54.720> hacked

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
will not get hacked

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.619 
will not get hacked
okay<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:56.129> let's<00:02:56.489> grab<00:02:56.700> this<00:02:56.879> line<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.180> made<00:02:57.599> a

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
okay so let's grab this line I made a

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:58.420 
okay so let's grab this line I made a
regex

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
regex

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.130 
regex
that's<00:02:59.430> going<00:02:59.849> to<00:02:59.940> replace<00:03:00.090> all<00:03:01.970> non<00:03:03.140> numeric

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
that's going to replace all non numeric

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.740 
that's going to replace all non numeric
characters<00:03:04.799> non<00:03:05.099> number<00:03:05.519> characters<00:03:05.819> so<00:03:06.599> all

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
characters non number characters so all

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.900 
characters non number characters so all
we<00:03:06.840> have<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.109> do<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.379> put<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.879> right<00:03:08.879> here

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
we have to do is put that right here

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.970 
we have to do is put that right here
where<00:03:09.209> we<00:03:09.329> determine<00:03:09.510> which<00:03:09.989> page<00:03:10.260> ID<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.799> use

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
where we determine which page ID to use

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.630 
where we determine which page ID to use
in<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.280> query<00:03:11.549> so<00:03:12.060> if<00:03:12.620> there's<00:03:13.620> no<00:03:13.859> get<00:03:14.250> PID

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
in the query so if there's no get PID

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.119 
in the query so if there's no get PID
then<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.629> make<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.989> page<00:03:16.230> one<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.739> home<00:03:16.920> page

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
then we make it page one the home page

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.379 
then we make it page one the home page
else<00:03:18.109> page<00:03:19.109> ID<00:03:19.379> equals<00:03:20.010> whatever<00:03:20.549> values<00:03:21.180> in

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
else page ID equals whatever values in

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.509 
else page ID equals whatever values in
the<00:03:21.480> URL<00:03:21.780> string<00:03:22.169> and<00:03:22.380> that's<00:03:22.980> where<00:03:23.190> they<00:03:23.340> can

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
the URL string and that's where they can

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.039 
the URL string and that's where they can
tamper<00:03:23.730> with<00:03:24.030> your<00:03:24.180> database<00:03:24.450> if<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.870> let

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
tamper with your database if you let

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.550 
tamper with your database if you let
them<00:03:25.370> because<00:03:26.370> they<00:03:26.549> can<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:27.419> type<00:03:27.989> into<00:03:28.470> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
them because they can just type into the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.890 
them because they can just type into the
URL<00:03:28.829> string<00:03:29.220> hit<00:03:29.400> return<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.090> your<00:03:30.450> script

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
URL string hit return and your script

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.409 
URL string hit return and your script
will<00:03:31.079> process<00:03:31.349> it<00:03:31.880> so<00:03:32.880> when<00:03:33.060> your<00:03:33.180> script

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
will process it so when your script

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.170 
will process it so when your script
processes<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.109> you<00:03:34.230> want<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.440> do<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:35.180> now

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
processes it you want to do this now

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.900 
processes it you want to do this now
what<00:03:36.329> this<00:03:36.480> line<00:03:36.720> does<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:37.319> uses<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:38.040> Reg

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
what this line does is uses the Reg

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.620 
what this line does is uses the Reg
replace<00:03:39.359> function<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:40.380> PHP<00:03:40.889> function<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.630> we

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
replace function the PHP function and we

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.479 
replace function the PHP function and we
use<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:43.260> reg<00:03:43.560> ex<00:03:43.859> a<00:03:44.130> reg<00:03:45.000> expression<00:03:45.599> and<00:03:46.489> what

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
use a reg ex a reg expression and what

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.470 
use a reg ex a reg expression and what
it<00:03:47.609> does<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.569> knocks<00:03:49.560> out<00:03:49.799> everything<00:03:50.609> but

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
it does is it knocks out everything but

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.770 
it does is it knocks out everything but
numbers<00:03:52.049> zero<00:03:52.769> through<00:03:52.859> nine<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:54.630> can

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
numbers zero through nine and you can

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.050 
numbers zero through nine and you can
see<00:03:54.959> what<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.200> does<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.799> claims<00:03:56.099> what<00:03:56.910> to

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
see what it does is it claims what to

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.680 
see what it does is it claims what to
allow<00:03:57.389> here<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.489> if<00:03:59.489> you<00:03:59.609> wanted<00:03:59.970> letters<00:04:00.540> you

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
allow here and if you wanted letters you

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.580 
allow here and if you wanted letters you
can<00:04:00.840> just<00:04:01.019> go<00:04:01.169> a<00:04:01.379> through<00:04:02.099> Z<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.109> then<00:04:04.109> capital

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
can just go a through Z and then capital

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.979 
can just go a through Z and then capital
A<00:04:04.709> through<00:04:05.099> Z<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.660> would<00:04:06.780> allow<00:04:06.959> all

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
A through Z and that would allow all

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.949 
A through Z and that would allow all
letters<00:04:07.590> too<00:04:08.209> but<00:04:09.209> we<00:04:09.299> just<00:04:09.329> want<00:04:09.660> numbers

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
letters too but we just want numbers

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.599 
letters too but we just want numbers
here<00:04:10.169> and<00:04:10.379> you<00:04:10.650> see<00:04:10.859> right<00:04:11.069> here<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.459> going

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
here and you see right here it's going

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.000 
here and you see right here it's going
to<00:04:11.669> replace<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.000> with<00:04:12.359> nothing<00:04:13.109> so<00:04:13.859> basically

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
to replace it with nothing so basically

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.390 
to replace it with nothing so basically
it<00:04:14.489> just<00:04:14.519> takes<00:04:14.910> all<00:04:15.560> characters<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:17.190> are

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
it just takes all characters that are

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.159 
it just takes all characters that are
non<00:04:17.579> numbers<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.299> replaces<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.750> with<00:04:18.870> nothing

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
non numbers and replaces it with nothing

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.129 
non numbers and replaces it with nothing
and<00:04:19.880> let's<00:04:20.880> see<00:04:21.030> if<00:04:21.120> we<00:04:21.239> can<00:04:21.389> get<00:04:21.539> an<00:04:21.630> example

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
and let's see if we can get an example

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.100 
and let's see if we can get an example
of<00:04:22.289> it

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.670 

let's<00:04:26.110> echo<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.810> really<00:04:29.110> this<00:04:29.200> is<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.380> last

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
let's echo and really this is the last

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.050 
let's echo and really this is the last
thing<00:04:29.830> we<00:04:29.890> have<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.100> do<00:04:30.310> before<00:04:30.640> we<00:04:30.670> can<00:04:30.910> make

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
thing we have to do before we can make

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.500 
thing we have to do before we can make
