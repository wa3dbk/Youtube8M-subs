00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
 if one had to ignore briefly what percent of listeners to stupid says 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.779
 Percent he say in Germany percent of the game can already say 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.290
 percent will award the highest calamity against the erstwhile gentes ever percent 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.889
 Has 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.739
 Because I think he is almost the perfect game 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.050
 as good as the player is 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.529
 just as shitty 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.019
 and that I say deliberately shoot so chosen is the support of 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.779
 Blizzard or the press and pr work in Germany 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.580
 to leave with the money 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.330
 just at the big distance 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.650
 whether one develops meanwhile reputation where one really says Prof the 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.280
 Game will be tested with Skela and at the latest two days game he plays 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.190
 to play later in the mailbox 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.720
 The Ubisoft and Electronic Act are just exemplary that the press and 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.199
 pr-work in Germany 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.139
 So, the two big ones are Nintendo's just as good 

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:50.139
 yes they want to be fight Olsen has another story 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.739
 yes with Activision Blizzard it is so that not even on Mels answers 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.309
 every little Popelka existed in Germany 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.030
 At least one says 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.120
 with the words we regret but unfortunately it demand far too big 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.730
 at Activision Blizzard and the agency the percent the 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.170
 Press work Appelt does the pr-work 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.030
 Percent is nothing 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.240
 when bursts are written as girls somehow there was none 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 Cancellation Â«I have no reaction 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.750
 when the call 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.600
 it can be but the man Olaf b argued it is really hard 6 I have to 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.590
 to say honestly on the agenda is the same every year 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.149
 you get somehow percentages and appointments yes one stands then because of that 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.929
 stood a weather or electric resistance and the people 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.050
 Dating with the man it just does not come at the comfort of 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.700
 and last year what so that this day will never be reeh instead of being open 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.770
 the one against the deed has never happened, yes that would like to say this point 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.670
 the percentage percent majority does not give more the points for that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.229
 game 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.410
 and there have been years to be open 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.350
 someone who is number one is that Activision Blizzard the seemingly 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.360
 he thinks he can not afford something like that I do not know if 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.479
 It works diamond press platforms to run better problems with it 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.860
 or whether the little ones in this case and treat him so shitty 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.360
 no idea 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.420
 but also the ones who told Anubis to join us for this job 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.899
 of 30 fully understandable as Blizzard in Germany binding 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.200
 I can only hope for now I will complement the celebration on the 18th of March 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.250
 that they are lucky but thank God place behind this place where it would like 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.800
 be slim in the past few years always let in percent to 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.599
 Luck has stood so that I will always be right 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.040
 could watch the games 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.790
 but as I said of me, the pr- and organization Save the Date 6 yes 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.250
 So I'll try again this year about Diablo 3 too 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.580
 bribe us out to play but important says from Khedira 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.729
 that clunky maybe leaves again in the resistance 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.529
 as if the scenery had 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:44.479
 Daimler that was a lot of Arquette now comes a lot of good we start and 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:48.200
 Percent comes to the rating of StarCraft 2 Wings of Liberty for the PC 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.549
 and now come to the positive 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.930
 So um 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.029
 It should have been negative because it is good as nothing 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:59.419
 I have to honestly say that there is one 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.149
 I played no game but lately because so consistent and so balanced and 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.159
 so around 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.269
 Sound is 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.879
 "Positive is definitely 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.790
 the long-term motivation of the campaign is incredibly good the St fits everything 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.069
 together in each 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.210
 Mission to the new units percent a team got set right 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.260
 all this around with math facts and the research is great 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.790
 the campaign is fun 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.180
 and in reality it would not have to be honest but be through the 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.220
 Dusty mom always know how to go on 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.919
 but involved in the incredibly intense 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.290
 Who saves fuel? 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.600
 Minute by boat there not much to say 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.889
 it was the second one is going away 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.859
 Percent of music teacher "incredibly good" percent at Lenz around you 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.749
 at any time the possibility wide-sports the passing over almost 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:46.350
 immediately 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.479
 you can not downhill it over the internet the battle net 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.699
 to finally understand about this one that you always the same 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.699
 Stu many people belong to GEA divided creeps 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.619
 Head high motivation and you have to say almost 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:05.019
 the graphics are superb the house are outstanding the bands sequences 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.429
 excellent so i had english versions known modes English 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:09.319
 downloading 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.909
 secunet German second action is home 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.129
 I can not find anything negative about this, yes 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.079
 If I say now I have to find something negative 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:23.999
 So would have to think very hard what you could do there 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.180
 for the Mercedes 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:29.960
 honestly 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.370
 So um 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.680
 Maybe that you can play it moments is the only thing though 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.320
 I always have to pull myself out of the internet 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.289
 but that has to be such a trend Smart on 11 all sponsorship 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.400
 the classic copy protection is gone 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.020
 as well as well you have to go the animals way soon but you can 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.789
 Play tomorrow on the Internet 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.199
 which of course percent for the genetic test percent what they just play to themselves 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.990
 want and an hour server down 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.479
 and the massive whoever plays that has much to do 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.639
 but otherwise Verdi Waldbad best know percent of my best efforts 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.279
 Real value is also a pleasure 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.550
 That's why I come to a review 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.919
 which have never existed in this form but I can tell the researchers that 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.770
 there are best games in these areas 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.449
 Mass Effect 2 was a great white who shooter when he first 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.229
 I think I got a lot of people from Mars percent with us 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.340
 StarCraft 2 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.800
 Topp does this all by himself at the beginning he is still there 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.770
 my solo mum is now better than eleven percent 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.210
 lowered it was better now 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.819
 a little better now 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.610
 as of Mass Effect 2 of so I have no choice but that 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.400
 Krafts 2 was 98 percent to give me the best game of the last 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.089
 at least five more years 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:40.220
 from the acute goiter future Kita 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.250
 from which I expect a lot like Diablo 3 these places couple look the plate Tha 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.080
 For example, they can gamble 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.159
 if it is for the community 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:51.349
 that was in the Ghent to StarCraft 2 Wings of Liberty in 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.459
 Well we are approaching with big steps in the fiftieth Sven again 

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:57.789
 We have to leave something there and maybe Porsche price again 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:58.199
 out 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.919
 she looks now it will be euro terminal two times 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:05.789
 Percent of what he was the best so far who was the game of the year 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:08.599
 mine is not at all but i just have to go it alone 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:09.509
 percent 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.569
 Unit and Roll Dhabi but what to go again that ask me his 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:13.550
 Title before 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.220
 this love people m 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.880
 "Many of you we helped to profile first 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.680
 injury-plagued here Lower Saxony Uwe Bremer is only a week later 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.869
 all over 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:25.150
 we are all day anyway 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.110
 is missing 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.620
 is there to play but this would mean that Miss again to swap fun 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.710
 at StarCraft 2 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.919
 all good and much and what became 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:33.340
 Jarchow
