goes

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
goes

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.380 
goes
I'm<00:00:24.990> pouring<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.070> about<00:00:26.340> 1<00:00:26.760> cup<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.420> oil<00:00:29.269> so<00:00:30.269> we

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
I'm pouring in about 1 cup of oil so we

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
I'm pouring in about 1 cup of oil so we
got<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> test<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.080> oil<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.650> make<00:00:31.800> sure<00:00:32.070> it's

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
got to test the oil to make sure it's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.310 
got to test the oil to make sure it's
hot<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.390> means<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.809> going<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.020> sizzle

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
hot and that means it's going to sizzle

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.410 
hot and that means it's going to sizzle
when<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.680> stick<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> tortilla<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
when I stick a tortilla and it in a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.720 
when I stick a tortilla and it in a
sizzling<00:00:36.870> while<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.620> do<00:00:37.770> three<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.190> time

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
sizzling while I do three at a time

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.799 
sizzling while I do three at a time
one<00:00:39.270> two<00:00:40.430> three<00:00:43.579> because<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.789> always<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
one two three because I always have a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.080 
one two three because I always have a
family<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.350> feed

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
family to feed

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.330 
family to feed
so<00:00:48.090> I've<00:00:48.360> developed<00:00:48.750> methods<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.100> goes

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
so I've developed methods so this goes

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.110 
so I've developed methods so this goes
down<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:51.000> fast<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.230> high<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.120> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
down really fast it's on high and the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
down really fast it's on high and the
coldness<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.690> those<00:00:55.590> tortillas<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.340> bringing

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
coldness of those tortillas is bringing

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.520 
coldness of those tortillas is bringing
the<00:00:57.120> temperature<00:00:57.329> down<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.350> too

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the temperature down so it's not too

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.889 
the temperature down so it's not too
high<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> dangerous<00:01:00.480> part<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
high this is the dangerous part of the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.369 
high this is the dangerous part of the
recipe<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:02.010> careful<00:01:02.840> stay<00:01:03.840> way<00:01:04.110> away<00:01:04.140> from

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
recipe so be careful stay way away from

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.370 
recipe so be careful stay way away from
that<00:01:04.739> hot<00:01:04.920> oil<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> my<00:01:06.540> method<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.229> have

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that hot oil so my method is to have

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.429 
that hot oil so my method is to have
this<00:01:07.560> bubbling<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.460> really<00:01:09.060> hot<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.479> as

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
this bubbling up and really hot and as

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.070 
this bubbling up and really hot and as
one<00:01:10.770> side<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.159> kind<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.430> done<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.780> going

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
one side is kind of done then I'm going

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.690 
one side is kind of done then I'm going
to<00:01:13.140> flip<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.710> been<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.040> there<00:01:14.189> about<00:01:14.280> 30

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to flip it it's been in there about 30

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030 
to flip it it's been in there about 30
seconds<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.049> feel<00:01:16.350> they're<00:01:16.680> getting<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
seconds and I can feel they're getting a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.310 
seconds and I can feel they're getting a
little<00:01:17.400> harder<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> touch<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.930> that's

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
little harder to the touch and that's

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
little harder to the touch and that's
the<00:01:19.619> perfect<00:01:19.979> time<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.520> turn<00:01:20.790> stick<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> fork<00:01:21.600> in

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the perfect time to turn stick a fork in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.649 
the perfect time to turn stick a fork in
it<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.259> we're<00:01:22.530> going<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.009> shape<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
it and we're going to kind of shape it

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.969 
it and we're going to kind of shape it
so<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.869> one's<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> sit<00:01:25.500> there

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
so that one's going to sit there

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.749 
so that one's going to sit there
this<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.030> gets<00:01:27.240> turned<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.720> slipped<00:01:27.990> as<00:01:28.200> well

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
this one gets turned and slipped as well

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.410 
this one gets turned and slipped as well
and<00:01:29.759> now<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.659> too<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:32.939> three<00:01:33.270> at<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and now this one too to do three at a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.140 
and now this one too to do three at a
time<00:01:33.799> you've<00:01:34.799> got<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> really<00:01:35.369> maneuver<00:01:36.000> in

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
time you've got a really maneuver in

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.690 
time you've got a really maneuver in
that<00:01:36.360> oil<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:37.320> get<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.710> shape<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.310> those

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
that oil to get that shape in those

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.960 
that oil to get that shape in those
talked<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> shells<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> turn<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> over<00:01:41.790> to
