00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
i'm really happy with it i started by

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.360 
i'm really happy with it i started by
adding<00:00:09.450> some<00:00:09.840> cardstock<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> bottom<00:00:11.040> I'm

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
adding some cardstock to the bottom I'm

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.999 
adding some cardstock to the bottom I'm
using<00:00:11.790> some<00:00:12.179> visual<00:00:12.929> triangles<00:00:13.559> just<00:00:13.650> two

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
using some visual triangles just two

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.709 
using some visual triangles just two
pieces<00:00:14.190> of<00:00:14.429> cardstock<00:00:14.670> stuck<00:00:15.089> together<00:00:15.240> and

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
pieces of cardstock stuck together and

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.240 
pieces of cardstock stuck together and
I'm<00:00:16.260> putting<00:00:16.500> those<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.830> bottom<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
I'm putting those on the bottom of the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.400 
I'm putting those on the bottom of the
card<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:18.210> give<00:00:18.330> weight<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.810> bottom<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
card to give weight to the bottom of the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.160 
card to give weight to the bottom of the
card<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.330> so<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> ice<00:00:21.570> cream<00:00:21.750> cone<00:00:21.900> doesn't

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
card and so the ice cream cone doesn't

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.300 
card and so the ice cream cone doesn't
look<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.410> floating<00:00:22.920> out<00:00:22.980> there<00:00:23.039> by

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
look is just floating out there by

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.640 
look is just floating out there by
itself<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.789> space<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.720> me<00:00:24.900> that's<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:25.320> my

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
itself in space to me that's just my

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.730 
itself in space to me that's just my
preference<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.310> guess<00:00:27.109> and<00:00:28.109> there's<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.710> ice

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
preference I guess and there's the ice

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500 
preference I guess and there's the ice
cream<00:00:29.039> cone<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.580> peel<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:29.970> stick<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
came with the kit and using triangles

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.470 
came with the kit and using triangles
left<00:00:35.370> room<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.760> cone<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.120> fit<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.390> of

last scoop of ice cream that does cover

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.010 
last scoop of ice cream that does cover
the<00:01:51.869> cone<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.380> than<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.560> thought<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.950> would

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
the cone more than I thought it would

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.420 
the cone more than I thought it would
but<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.619> admit<00:01:55.799> everything<00:01:56.250> looks

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
but I have to admit everything looks

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.709 
but I have to admit everything looks
just<00:01:56.490> fine<00:01:56.880> once<00:01:57.360> everything's<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.049> place

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
just fine once everything's in place

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.800 
just fine once everything's in place
okay<00:02:01.610> see<00:02:02.610> now<00:02:02.790> usually<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> front<00:02:03.719> of

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
okay see now usually I do the front of

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.200 
okay see now usually I do the front of
the<00:02:03.869> card<00:02:04.140> first<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.579> last<00:02:05.820> card

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
the card first but it's the last card

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.000 
the card first but it's the last card
and<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.420> was<00:02:06.540> getting<00:02:06.689> awfully<00:02:07.170> confident

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
and I was getting awfully confident

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.580 
and I was getting awfully confident
Here<00:02:08.790> I<00:02:08.820> am<00:02:08.970> trying<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.720> use<00:02:09.750> up<00:02:10.020> scraps<00:02:10.200> that

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
Here I am trying to use up scraps that

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.040 
Here I am trying to use up scraps that

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
are left from the rest of the kit to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.530 
are left from the rest of the kit to
decorate<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.530> front<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.860> card<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:15.360> was

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
decorate the front of the card it was

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.140 
decorate the front of the card it was
fast<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.020> easy<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.470> really<00:02:16.950> liked<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.670> wish<00:02:17.970> I

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
fast and easy I really liked it I wish I

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.680 
fast and easy I really liked it I wish I
done<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.050> more<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.220> had<00:02:20.760> one<00:02:21.120> single

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
done this more so I had one single

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.810 
done this more so I had one single
candle<00:02:22.110> left<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.770> put<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.220> right<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.550> there

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
candle left so I put it right on there

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.020 
candle left so I put it right on there
and<00:02:24.000> now<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.410> loves<00:02:25.650> looks<00:02:25.920> awfully<00:02:26.310> lonely<00:02:26.580> so

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
and now it loves looks awfully lonely so

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.480 
and now it loves looks awfully lonely so
I'm<00:02:27.270> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.600> use<00:02:27.870> circles<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:29.130> I<00:02:29.250> make<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
I'm going to use circles and I make the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.280 
I'm going to use circles and I make the
circles<00:02:29.850> look<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.240> light<00:02:30.660> coming<00:02:31.020> off<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
circles look like light coming off the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.590 
circles look like light coming off the
candle<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.070> I'm<00:02:32.940> going<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.180> use<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.420> design

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
candle and I'm going to use that design

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.680 
candle and I'm going to use that design
principle<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.410> three<00:02:34.800> three<00:02:35.550> sets<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.300> three

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
principle of three three sets of three

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.120 
principle of three three sets of three
dots<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:38.400> I'm<00:02:38.520> still<00:02:38.730> mixing<00:02:39.060> up<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.480> colors

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
dots and I'm still mixing up the colors

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.480 
dots and I'm still mixing up the colors
here<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.510> try<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.570> vary<00:02:43.560> where<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> pinks<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
here I try to vary where the pinks and

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.660 
here I try to vary where the pinks and
the<00:02:44.580> Browns<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.630> blues<00:02:45.900> were<00:02:46.400> but<00:02:47.400> three

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
the Browns and the blues were but three

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.310 
the Browns and the blues were but three
sets<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.060> three<00:02:48.120> coming<00:02:48.720> when<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.080> use<00:02:49.200> the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
sets of three coming when you use the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.600 
sets of three coming when you use the
scrapbooking<00:02:49.920> doodle<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.430> looks<00:02:53.550> like

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
scrapbooking doodle and it looks like

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.890 
scrapbooking doodle and it looks like
just<00:02:53.850> two<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.300> bottom<00:02:54.420> but<00:02:54.630> that's<00:02:54.750> good

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
just two on the bottom but that's good

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.570 
just two on the bottom but that's good
if<00:02:55.020> that's<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.290> vanilla<00:02:55.620> dot<00:02:55.920> there's<00:02:56.370> two

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
if that's a vanilla dot there's two

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.420 
if that's a vanilla dot there's two
vanilla<00:02:56.820> dots<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.300> there<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.160> now<00:02:59.160> I'm

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
vanilla dots on there so now I'm

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.010 
vanilla dots on there so now I'm
thinking<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.910> need<00:02:59.970> something<00:03:00.450> more<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
thinking I need something more in the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.630 
thinking I need something more in the
center<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.470> card<00:03:01.800> what<00:03:02.100> am<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.430> going<00:03:02.580> to
