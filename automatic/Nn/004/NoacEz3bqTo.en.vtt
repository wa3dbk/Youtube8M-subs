00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.610
 Welcome to our www cor 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.890
 creative workshop how was the ps4 know 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.910
 a manufacturer of effect colors and 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.100
 Today I want you a whole 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.010
 special introduce for rusty effects 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 the colors are rusty and natural 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.430
 there is a patina with the eda 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.140
 I can put even small accents 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.029
 For example, we would like to show you 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.009
 such a beautiful decorative plate 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:38.670
 You can make it originally 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:42.210
 really just white at first 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.329
 But you need your deco plate then 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.620
 rusty the corresponding patina to me 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.930
 I opted for oxide 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.420
 then you just need particles and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.620
 a role 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.430
 to rest rod are not quite 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.980
 bad and push girl first 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.750
 once when we prime the plate 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.750
 gives some rusty on the plate 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.080
 you see what she is a very creamy 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.330
 Above all else, color is a water-resistant one 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.620
 dry color so that their objects for 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.240
 the interior and also for the 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.260
 The outdoor area could also shape that 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.190
 can leave outside year-round but the 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.190
 color well into the role 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.289
 now comes the first color order which 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.579
 This is called priming 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.049
 I know that from me I always prefer to say 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.090
 two thin layers as one too thick 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.659
 the first thin layer provides for adhesion 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.979
 mediator 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:49.700
 That's what you wear a thin layer 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:49.700
 do not forget rusty on the edge 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.770
 you see the first layer does not cover 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 but it is really just a whole 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.780
 Can without order and I leave 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.920
 dry now for a short time 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.539
 if the paint is dry, it leads 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.459
 relax a bit 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.349
 she then heard that structure too 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.580
 already and it really feels like it 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.010
 that's the fact 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.090
 now comes the second color order 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.569
 you can also roll again 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.569
 make 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.520
 then the second color order is now 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.420
 already cover i take you to help 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.420
 and dry a little bit 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.620
 I think that's enough for the last one 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.739
 I use the cube 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.909
 Sponge I also need the patina 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.530
 You have to stir these up really well 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.790
 We are very much metal pigments 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.200
 contain and you know that 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.769
 We need to be well caught are 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.769
 something on the plate 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.769
 and then I can start getting wet 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.720
 You can work in wet with patina 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.830
 Also at the end of all final on dry 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.750
 objects again a bit patina 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.760
 vision I would like to show you today how 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.870
 is worked wet in wet and 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.970
 first of all with the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.830
 Sponge rusty and wear it really 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.830
 generous again on the plate 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:37.629
 follows the shape of the plate around this 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.400
 make it look more alive 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.400
 I work now something patina with a 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.049
 and distribute it wet in wet 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.049
 rusty 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.819
 so i am satisfied the whole i leave 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.230
 dry now and you see there is one 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.730
 small color change after drying 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.470
 and then you can see the patina 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.120
 really good please remember it rusty 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.010
 liable on all surfaces you can 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.810
 So objects made of plastic glass 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.519
 Terracotta of paper or wood 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.110
 design it and I wish you 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.750
 now quite a lot of great creative 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.769
 ideas and a lot of rusty effects with
