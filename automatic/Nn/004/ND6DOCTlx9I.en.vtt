same<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.990> because<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
same this one I know is that because the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.380 
same this one I know is that because the
glue<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.979> doesn't<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.490> gold<00:01:20.700> paint<00:01:21.060> in

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.670 
glue is doesn't have the gold paint in
there<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:21.960> that's<00:01:22.110> another<00:01:22.350> main<00:01:22.650> difference

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
there so that's another main difference

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.090 
there so that's another main difference
and<00:01:23.540> one<00:01:24.540> thing<00:01:24.720> though<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
and one thing though because of the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.679 
and one thing though because of the
light-up<00:01:26.430> feature<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.880> noticed<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.450> all

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
light-up feature I noticed this on all

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.039 
light-up feature I noticed this on all
the<00:01:27.900> power<00:01:28.080> power<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.220> glue<00:01:29.430> mark<00:01:30.299> 6<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the power power of glue mark 6 is that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.010 
the power power of glue mark 6 is that
his<00:01:31.320> his<00:01:31.560> very<00:01:32.040> loose<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.700> mean<00:01:32.939> really<00:01:33.570> loose<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
cycle most up bobblehead list so that's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.719 
cycle most up bobblehead list so that's
one<00:01:36.810> thing<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.110> note<00:01:37.320> if<00:01:37.619> you're<00:01:37.860> citing<00:01:38.520> which

so<00:02:06.719> that

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
so that

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.880 
so that

and<00:02:11.620> back<00:02:11.920> in<00:02:11.950> out<00:02:12.430> Rosia<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.360> prepare<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.780> leg

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
and back in out Rosia to prepare the leg

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.110 
and back in out Rosia to prepare the leg
bend<00:02:14.500> at<00:02:14.620> two<00:02:14.650> points<00:02:14.800> at<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> knee<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.640> their
