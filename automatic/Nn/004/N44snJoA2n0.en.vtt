00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.199
 mitchell 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.199
 participants who come from all kinds of disciplines 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:20.960
 own knowledge 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.060
 and expertise 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.720
 to come to a solution of a few days a card 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.850
 you live with a nice learn together 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.280
 he sleeps but in the same place together well come in india intense period 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.100
 you to concepts in the type of solutions for those challenges 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.070
 3 it has been formulated to clients 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.990
 because 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.100
 4 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 the 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.890
 we have our feet to deal with issues of inflation in healthcare 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.370
 dr 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.340
 the most striking thing is this week 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.440
 that the whole difference 6 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.720
 a student and a teacher and also that business professor 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.369
 actually gone 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.020
 the enthusiasm of everyone in Kerkrade other de 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.740
 the organization and participants also stop the process supervisors 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.359
 I can really enjoy the beauty of this week 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.359
 I am immersed yes 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.899
 yes lived for a week 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.899
 also submerged 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.119
 what i have learned is and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.950
 very much 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.179
 collaborate with different age groups 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.490
 the disciplines 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.810
 the process 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.230
 was very much like we Belgians 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.070
 so he was very clear and well-organized and got the process 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.939
 I also learned how to do such a process 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.000
 and what is none of it and what is not 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.809
 I think that debate has learned a lot about cooperation 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.469
 if you come up with lots of different ideas, it's pretty hard 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:14.869
 because of the rain leads to a whole 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.869
 but I think it finally worked out 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.349
 the 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.089
 Another solution to the problem was that the students that boy died 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.409
 true long-term vision and 20 years of murder plan are the most 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.769
 recently three laps at least intel 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.769
 and by consistently say 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.999
 talking about it 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:39.859
 all in all a week at the moment 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.869
 they are now able to shift that more and more 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.669
 have a good idea about the long term and I actually think so 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:51.039
 very clever because that is going to win 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.649
 it will really help my career 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:55.999
 you get when you come in the plus the dome 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.999
 a very good look 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.089
 Operate 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:02.909
 and that was very 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.279
 educational and 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:07.299
 we also meet each other with a week 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.569
 that happens wonderfully special things in relationships to come to 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.569
 special things 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:21.049
 I hope it gets a bit of a sequel but I also think it's for 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.659
 Especially for companies the young guy might be good to suffice with 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.539
 customers 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:28.909
 the food those days 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.729
 this concept 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.410
 including the place to respond the thoughts of Persie headlined 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.539
 that is not the case with this week's rocket 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.819
 but that they did actually come to the next steps 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.779
 in the form of student housing 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.359
 is scarce 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.109
 and for you education 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.620
 help the pin 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.709
 that rumor that the implementation is mainly the ideas that are made 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:53.809
 we are going to be placed
