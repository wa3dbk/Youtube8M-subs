00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
start you know start to basically

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.830 
start you know start to basically
producing<00:01:07.229> eggs<00:01:07.439> again<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> if<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.570> look<00:01:09.720> at

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
producing eggs again so if you look at

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.020 
producing eggs again so if you look at
it<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.590> will<00:01:10.799> take<00:01:11.040> around<00:01:11.220> 20<00:01:11.490> minutes

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it it will take around 20 minutes

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.280 
it it will take around 20 minutes
overall<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.869> produce<00:01:13.619> next<00:01:14.130> set<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.340> X<00:01:15.290> but

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
overall to produce next set of X but

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.890 
overall to produce next set of X but
however<00:01:16.500> I've<00:01:16.979> ran<00:01:17.430> out<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.119> chicken<00:01:18.479> foot

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
however I've ran out of the chicken foot

approximately three empty slots i can

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.640 
approximately three empty slots i can
add<00:01:30.259> uncreate<00:01:31.259> three<00:01:31.860> more<00:01:32.509> you<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.650> three
