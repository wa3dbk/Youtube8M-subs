00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.870
 hello everybody went people will make a 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.730
 pet bottle boat 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.770
 So what are we going to need? 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.070
 make our little boat a bottle 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.930
 water has to be water because 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.310
 Hell, it's an ink that I use 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.679
 central avenue 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.550
 in this case I used the ink 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.610
 Brown 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.250
 so the paint and the brush 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.399
 there the brush stays of you what 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.000
 Do you prefer scissors? 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.250
 We'll need the felt as well. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.840
 felt I used with brown and white 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:57.539
 rasko coca recalls that rococo style 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.430
 We'll need glue too. 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.350
 hot and a van we go there 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.229
 and I got this from here on the internet 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.039
 I picked it out and cut it after it 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.810
 filter 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:13.140
 We're going to need a little chair. 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.110
 ok what we will do first to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.030
 People are going to cut this bottle of water. 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.929
 so we're going to take this unit 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.759
 You're with this bottle and there's a lot of people. 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.759
 will cut it in a way 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.929
 as always leave country 's unity largest 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.039
 so it will stay like this point 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.320
 here o 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.000
 so the front part is more 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.460
 length to give the format of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.340
 marquinhos the back the people 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.479
 matters a little bit less 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.329
 then you cutting them include prayer 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.219
 It will give this format 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:08.220
 I think then we hit here 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.709
 to be very cute after the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.180
 We'll paint this. 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.180
 bottle of brown 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.930
 I do not think there's another color. 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.989
 pretty has to be an honor 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.599
 so I tried she loved 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.090
 after we tried today to dry it 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.329
 we will make our toothpick 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.790
 barbecue proposes to cut a small piece 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.670
 his cup changes very long 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.310
 We're going to get the gilt felt cut 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:44.130
 one strip from another and will roll with the glue 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.000
 Hot, we 'll stick it on the toothpick . 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.810
 so that he stays in the hood is then 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.829
 he will stay 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:58.950
 so here we then stick to the 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:02.730
 Pretty capon passes the hot ball here 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.660
 I never cut a flag 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.840
 white people to speak after the tip 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.700

 client boat that you would see as 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.310
 is that the glue on the side and 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.620
 I put this pamphlet right in the world. 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.849

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.700
