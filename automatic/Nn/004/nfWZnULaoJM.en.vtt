take this whole thing apart and wasn't
much<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.830> take<00:01:26.009> apart<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.330> whole<00:01:27.479> piece

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
much to take apart just that whole piece

much to take apart just that whole piece
there<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.530> servos<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.400> had<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> take<00:01:29.790> all<00:01:29.939> those

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
there the servos I had to take all those

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.230 
there the servos I had to take all those
off<00:01:30.619> just<00:01:31.619> actually<00:01:31.860> put<00:01:32.040> Loctite<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
off just actually put Loctite on that

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.429 
off just actually put Loctite on that
little<00:01:33.420> bad<00:01:33.659> boy<00:01:33.960> right<00:01:34.170> there

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
little bad boy right there

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.890 
little bad boy right there
I<00:01:34.650> don't<00:01:35.579> know<00:01:35.700> why<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.939> came<00:01:36.210> loose<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.720> just

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
I don't know why it came loose it's just

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.730 
I don't know why it came loose it's just
I<00:01:37.020> guess<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.380> factory<00:01:37.799> didn't<00:01:38.070> uh<00:01:39.470> lock<00:01:40.470> tight

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
I guess the factory didn't uh lock tight

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.969 
I guess the factory didn't uh lock tight
it<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.750> which<00:01:42.750> that's<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.170> thing<00:01:43.380> with<00:01:43.530> Redcat

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it in which that's the thing with Redcat

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.480 
it in which that's the thing with Redcat
you<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.659> low<00:01:45.659> C<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.110> HPI<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.920> all<00:01:47.009> those<00:01:47.250> I

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
you know low C and HPI and all those I

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.580 
you know low C and HPI and all those I
mean<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:47.880> they<00:01:48.240> I'm<00:01:48.899> not<00:01:49.200> sure<00:01:49.470> about

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
mean I think they I'm not sure about

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.039 
mean I think they I'm not sure about
that<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.189> think<00:01:50.700> they<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:51.840> bit

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
that but I think they do a little bit

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.929 
that but I think they do a little bit
more<00:01:52.079> lot<00:01:52.350> tighter<00:01:52.590> than<00:01:52.710> Rick<00:01:52.979> yet<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.880> know

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
more lot tighter than Rick yet you know

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.340 
more lot tighter than Rick yet you know
they<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.630> throw<00:01:54.930> those<00:01:55.110> together

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
they kind of just throw those together

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.030 
they kind of just throw those together
and<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.149> see<00:01:57.350> most<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.469> mine<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:58.680> locked

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
and you can see most of mine are locked

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.039 
and you can see most of mine are locked
idea<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.090> that's<00:02:00.180> actually<00:02:00.479> why<00:02:00.780> I'm<00:02:00.840> missing

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
idea and that's actually why I'm missing

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.069 
idea and that's actually why I'm missing
that<00:02:01.469> one<00:02:01.619> there<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.520> uh<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:03.030> mean<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.899> works

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
that one there but uh I mean it works

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.690 
that one there but uh I mean it works
pretty<00:02:04.290> good<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.040> can<00:02:05.159> see<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.490> been

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
pretty good and you can see it's been

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.730 
pretty good and you can see it's been
used<00:02:05.909> before

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
used before

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.199 
used before
right<00:02:07.740> now<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.009> currently<00:02:08.489> doesn't<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:09.000> any

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
right now it currently doesn't have any

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.389 
right now it currently doesn't have any
gasoline

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
gasoline

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.069 
gasoline
