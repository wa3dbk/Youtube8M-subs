00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you can actually reach that time in an

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.760 
you can actually reach that time in an
eclipse<00:01:16.909> ninth<00:01:17.909> point<00:01:18.210> high<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.530> mid<00:01:20.390> 9.8<00:01:21.770> 0.8

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
eclipse ninth point high to mid 9.8 0.8

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.999 
eclipse ninth point high to mid 9.8 0.8
are<00:01:23.159> possible<00:01:24.060> however<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.259> guy<00:01:25.470> had<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
are possible however this guy had a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.480 
are possible however this guy had a
reaction<00:01:26.369> time<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.259> 0.1<00:01:28.259> 42<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.040> basically

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
reaction time of 0.1 42 which basically

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.020 
reaction time of 0.1 42 which basically
means<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.439> it's<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.680> possible

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
means that it's not possible
