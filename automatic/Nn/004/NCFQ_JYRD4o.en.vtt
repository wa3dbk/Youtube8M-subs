recommend<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.720> start<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.320> child<00:00:31.650> with

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
recommend that you start your child with

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.380 
recommend that you start your child with
a<00:00:31.920> balanced<00:00:32.279> bike<00:00:32.550> even<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:33.000> they're<00:00:33.120> two<00:00:33.270> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
a balanced bike even if they're two and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
a balanced bike even if they're two and
a<00:00:33.420> half<00:00:33.600> years<00:00:33.840> old<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.140> eight<00:00:34.380> years<00:00:34.710> old<00:00:34.829> of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
a half years old or eight years old of

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.500 
a half years old or eight years old of
course<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.460> can't<00:00:35.640> get<00:00:35.760> balance<00:00:36.120> bikes<00:00:36.329> for

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
course you can't get balance bikes for

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
course you can't get balance bikes for
eight-year-olds<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.020> what<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.710> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
eight-year-olds but what you can do is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.680 
eight-year-olds but what you can do is
take<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> pedals<00:00:38.610> off<00:00:38.879> lower<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> saddle

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
take the pedals off lower the saddle

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
take the pedals off lower the saddle
right<00:00:39.899> down<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.500> make<00:00:40.739> sure<00:00:40.770> they're<00:00:41.160> able<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
right down and make sure they're able to

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160 
right down and make sure they're able to
get<00:00:41.640> their<00:00:41.790> feet<00:00:42.030> flat<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.719> floor<00:00:43.020> because

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
get their feet flat on the floor because

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.779 
get their feet flat on the floor because
that<00:00:43.379> will<00:00:43.500> give<00:00:43.649> them<00:00:43.770> most<00:00:44.309> amount<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
that will give them most amount of

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.130 
that will give them most amount of
confidence<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> start<00:00:45.989> them<00:00:46.110> with

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
confidence if you start them with

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.260 
confidence if you start them with
stabilizers<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.789> means<00:00:47.969> they<00:00:48.090> get

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
stabilizers like this it means they get

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.459 
stabilizers like this it means they get
used<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.629> being<00:00:48.930> able<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> stay<00:00:49.289> upright

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
used to just being able to stay upright

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.979 
used to just being able to stay upright
without<00:00:50.160> actually<00:00:50.579> having<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.879> balance<00:00:51.329> means

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
without actually having to balance means

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.270 
without actually having to balance means
they<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> learn<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.649> whole<00:00:52.860> technique

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
they have to learn the whole technique

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
they have to learn the whole technique
from<00:00:53.489> scratch<00:00:53.789> once<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.180> take<00:00:54.390> them<00:00:54.539> off<00:00:54.660> if

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
from scratch once you take them off if

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
from scratch once you take them off if
you<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.469> your<00:00:55.559> kids<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:56.070> riding<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.579> very

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
you get your kids into riding very very

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.700 
you get your kids into riding very very
young<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:57.539> are<00:00:57.660> some<00:00:57.930> balance<00:00:58.260> bites<00:00:58.469> like

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
young there are some balance bites like

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.340 
young there are some balance bites like
this<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.160> don't<00:00:59.730> have<00:01:00.030> any<00:01:00.300> brakes<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.109> if

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
this one don't have any brakes but if

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
this one don't have any brakes but if
you<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.559> get<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.980> brakes<00:01:02.219> like<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.910> one

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you do get one with brakes like this one

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.700 
you do get one with brakes like this one
here<00:01:03.270> which<00:01:03.390> he's<00:01:03.539> been<00:01:03.719> using<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.559> good

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
here which he's been using it's a good

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
here which he's been using it's a good
idea<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.010> teach<00:01:05.280> them<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:05.820> them<00:01:06.090> before

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
idea to teach them to use them before

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.850 
idea to teach them to use them before
they<00:01:06.659> actually<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> way<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:07.799> do

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
they actually get on that way if they do

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.830 
they actually get on that way if they do
start<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.250> get<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.549> control<00:01:08.970> or<00:01:09.360> speed<00:01:09.659> up

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
start to get out of control or speed up

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.420 
start to get out of control or speed up
too<00:01:09.990> much<00:01:10.200> they'll<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:10.650> how<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> slow<00:01:11.220> down

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
too much they'll know how to slow down

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.010 
too much they'll know how to slow down
so<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.150> by<00:01:12.270> putting<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.630> next<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so do that by putting them next to the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.510 
so do that by putting them next to the
bike<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.680> getting<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.220> grab<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
bike and getting this just grab the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.370 
bike and getting this just grab the
brake<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:14.970> off<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.229> that

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
brake on and off so they know that that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.200 
brake on and off so they know that that
slows<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> bike<00:01:17.070> down<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.790> once<00:01:17.970> you've<00:01:18.090> got

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
slows the bike down so once you've got

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.820 
slows the bike down so once you've got
your<00:01:18.240> child<00:01:18.600> set<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> bike<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.770> you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
your child set up on the bike and you

something you can grab they do start to

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.929 
something you can grab they do start to
loose<00:01:37.439> bounce<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:37.979> never<00:01:38.340> hold<00:01:38.640> onto<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
loose bounce but never hold onto the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.460 
loose bounce but never hold onto the
handlebars<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.079> important<00:01:40.439> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
handlebars because it's important that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.870 
handlebars because it's important that
they<00:01:40.619> get<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> feel<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:41.850> that

they get the feel of that because that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.499 
they get the feel of that because that
will<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:42.150> later<00:01:42.840> help<00:01:43.170> them<00:01:43.290> balance<00:01:44.509> it's

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
will then later help them balance it's

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.149 
will then later help them balance it's
really<00:01:45.960> important<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.710> remember<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.950> your

the bike it's time to let them go on
their<00:02:00.600> own<00:02:00.780> don't<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.140> anything<00:02:01.290> too<00:02:01.619> drastic

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
their own don't do anything too drastic

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.770 
their own don't do anything too drastic
like<00:02:02.189> made<00:02:02.460> down<00:02:02.850> hills<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.600> some

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
like made down hills but if you get some

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.230 
like made down hills but if you get some
very<00:02:03.930> slight<00:02:04.320> gradual<00:02:05.219> down<00:02:05.430> hills<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:06.060> over

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
very slight gradual down hills with over

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.910 
very slight gradual down hills with over
a<00:02:06.360> flat<00:02:06.630> run<00:02:06.810> off<00:02:06.930> or<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.110> slight<00:02:07.469> uphill<00:02:07.829> which

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
a flat run off or a slight uphill which

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.380 
a flat run off or a slight uphill which
is<00:02:08.009> going<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.190> slow<00:02:08.429> them<00:02:08.580> down<00:02:08.610> they're<00:02:09.270> going

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
is going to slow them down they're going

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.760 
is going to slow them down they're going
to<00:02:09.450> start<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.929> little<00:02:10.140> bit<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.319> speed<00:02:10.530> up

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
to start to get a little bit of speed up

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.680 
to start to get a little bit of speed up
and<00:02:11.099> that's<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.489> point<00:02:11.730> potentially<00:02:12.629> they

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
and that's the point potentially they

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.760 
and that's the point potentially they
can<00:02:12.810> start<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.140> lift

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
can start to lift

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.410 
can start to lift
off<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.070> ground<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.520> really<00:02:15.060> get<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> hang

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
off the ground and really get the hang

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.770 
off the ground and really get the hang
of<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.630> balance<00:02:16.640> right<00:02:17.640> go<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.210> you

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
of that balance right go on and do you

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:26.050 
of that balance right go on and do you
go<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:18.990> your<00:02:19.050> own<00:02:19.110> put<00:02:19.680> your<00:02:19.800> feet<00:02:19.980> up<00:02:24.710> careful

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.730 
good boy so as you can see dude's got
the<00:02:42.210> balance<00:02:42.420> pretty<00:02:42.930> well<00:02:43.140> down<00:02:43.350> I've<00:02:43.590> been

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
the balance pretty well down I've been

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.040 
the balance pretty well down I've been
teaching<00:02:43.950> for<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.610> good<00:02:44.940> few<00:02:45.150> months<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:45.960> he

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
teaching for a good few months but he

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.870 
teaching for a good few months but he
hasn't<00:02:46.200> got<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.470> technique<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.040> pedaling<00:02:47.610> so

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
hasn't got the technique of pedaling so

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.970 
hasn't got the technique of pedaling so
I<00:02:47.910> have<00:02:48.090> put<00:02:48.360> these<00:02:48.540> stabilizers<00:02:49.050> on<00:02:49.470> because

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
I have put these stabilizers on because

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.470 
I have put these stabilizers on because
he's<00:02:50.100> already<00:02:50.280> got<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:50.580> balance<00:02:50.820> behind<00:02:51.330> him

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
he's already got that balance behind him

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.390 
he's already got that balance behind him
and<00:02:51.600> hopefully<00:02:51.840> over<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.680> next<00:02:52.770> 10-15

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
and hopefully over the next 10-15

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.020 
and hopefully over the next 10-15
minutes

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
minutes

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.060 
minutes
maybe<00:02:54.390> two<00:02:54.690> hours<00:02:54.870> gonna<00:02:55.440> teach<00:02:55.680> him<00:02:55.830> how<00:02:55.890> to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
maybe two hours gonna teach him how to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.650 
maybe two hours gonna teach him how to
pedal<00:02:56.520> this<00:02:56.640> bike<00:02:56.880> whilst<00:02:57.270> he's<00:02:57.450> got<00:02:57.600> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
pedal this bike whilst he's got the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.210 
pedal this bike whilst he's got the
balance<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.290> get<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> little<00:02:58.710> bit<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.950> strength

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
balance and get a little bit of strength
