00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.640 
heat up I'm using a nonstick pan so I'm
not<00:04:07.610> going<00:04:07.849> to<00:04:07.939> use<00:04:08.090> any<00:04:08.360> oil<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.110> now<00:04:09.590> the

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
not going to use any oil in it now the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.100 
not going to use any oil in it now the
only<00:04:09.860> problem<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.640> if<00:04:11.269> you<00:04:11.450> have<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.629> pan<00:04:11.959> that's

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
only problem is if you have a pan that's

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.599 
only problem is if you have a pan that's
going<00:04:12.319> to<00:04:12.379> stick<00:04:12.590> a<00:04:12.620> little<00:04:12.890> bit<00:04:13.010> it's<00:04:13.159> okay<00:04:13.549> to

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
going to stick a little bit it's okay to

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.250 
going to stick a little bit it's okay to
spray<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.239> down<00:04:14.390> with<00:04:14.450> a<00:04:14.599> little<00:04:14.810> bit<00:04:14.959> of<00:04:15.019> oil

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
spray it down with a little bit of oil

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.400 
spray it down with a little bit of oil
but<00:04:15.980> if<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.220> use<00:04:16.280> too<00:04:16.820> much<00:04:17.000> oil<00:04:17.299> it'll<00:04:18.259> make

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
but if you use too much oil it'll make

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.909 
but if you use too much oil it'll make
an<00:04:18.620> ugly<00:04:19.120> burrito<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.359> ugly<00:04:20.750> wrap<00:04:21.049> at<00:04:21.680> least

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.800 
it's very white on this side and I'll
let<00:06:14.580> it<00:06:14.640> brown<00:06:14.880> a<00:06:14.940> little<00:06:15.330> more<00:06:15.450> on<00:06:15.540> the<00:06:15.570> other

let it brown a little more on the other

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.510 
let it brown a little more on the other
side<00:06:16.110> but<00:06:16.320> that'll<00:06:16.620> only<00:06:16.710> take<00:06:16.890> about<00:06:17.070> two

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
side but that'll only take about two

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.680
