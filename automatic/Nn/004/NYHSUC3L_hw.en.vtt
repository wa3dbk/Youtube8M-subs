see here it's just a clock kind of done
in<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.550> kind<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.570> kind<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
in this kind of it's kind of like a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.799 
in this kind of it's kind of like a
radio<00:00:37.079> circle<00:00:37.770> thing<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.420> you<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.570> see<00:00:39.600> here

radio circle thing and you can see here
in<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> middle<00:00:39.989> did<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.500> yellow<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.920> is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
in the middle did the yellow one is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.270 
in the middle did the yellow one is
August<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.730> says<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.600> screen<00:00:42.899> one's

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
August and says here the screen one's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.310 
August and says here the screen one's
27th<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.000> orange<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.570> Thursday

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
27th and then the orange is Thursday

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.580 
27th and then the orange is Thursday
blue<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.489> 1:00<00:00:48.059> p.m.<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.110> 49

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
blue one is 1:00 p.m. and then 49

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.900 
blue one is 1:00 p.m. and then 49
minutes<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.160> pink<00:00:50.370> one<00:00:50.489> going<00:00:50.760> around

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
minutes and this pink one going around

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.540 
minutes and this pink one going around
here<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.329> 29<00:00:52.320> seconds<00:00:52.770> less<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> second<00:00:53.309> hands

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
here is 29 seconds less the second hands

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.459 
here is 29 seconds less the second hands
so<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> clock<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.320> done

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
so like it's just like a clock it's done

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.139 
so like it's just like a clock it's done
in<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.710> different<00:00:55.860> way<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> really

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
in a different way so it's a really

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
in a different way so it's a really
simple<00:00:57.360> screen<00:00:57.870> saver<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> doesn't<00:00:58.680> require

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
simple screen saver and doesn't require

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.630 
simple screen saver and doesn't require
a<00:00:59.280> fast<00:00:59.670> computer<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:01.100> that's<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.219> free<00:01:02.399> screen

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
a fast computer so that's a free screen

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.359 
a fast computer so that's a free screen
saver<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:04.199> don't<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> buy<00:01:05.159> those

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
saver and you don't have to buy those

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.130 
saver and you don't have to buy those
eventually<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.630> available<00:01:06.750> for

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
eventually and it's available for

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.750 
eventually and it's available for
actually<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> iPhone<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.189> iPod<00:01:08.400> touch<00:01:08.610> as

so right here again so number four here
we<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.420> dropped<00:01:15.750> clock<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.229> job<00:01:16.710> truck<00:01:16.950> is

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
we have is dropped clock a job truck is

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.510 
we have is dropped clock a job truck is
pretty<00:01:17.400> intensive<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.659> processor<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
pretty intensive on your processor and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.820 
pretty intensive on your processor and
you<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:20.670> kind<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.000> need<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.390> fast<00:01:21.869> computer<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
you do kind of need a fast computer to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.859 
you do kind of need a fast computer to
run<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:23.820> don't<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.600> small

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
run this that's don't really small

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.469 
run this that's don't really small
amount<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.470> full<00:01:25.710> screen<00:01:26.479> right

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
amount and we get full screen right

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.649 
amount and we get full screen right
there<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.170> full<00:01:28.470> screen<00:01:28.729> okay<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
there you go full screen okay so and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.539 
there you go full screen okay so and
what<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.159> for

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
what this really is just it's just for

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.700 
what this really is just it's just for
videos<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> numbers<00:01:33.659> falling<00:01:33.930> into<00:01:34.259> water<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
videos of numbers falling into water and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.469 
videos of numbers falling into water and
you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.430> see<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> number<00:01:36.270> five

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you can see here it's like a number five

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.030 
you can see here it's like a number five
here<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:36.840> pretty<00:01:37.049> good<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.530> pretty<00:01:37.740> slow

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
here it's pretty good going pretty slow

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.249 
here it's pretty good going pretty slow
at<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.189> moment<00:01:38.220> gives<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.840> does<00:01:39.990> require

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
at the moment gives it a it does require

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.340 
at the moment gives it a it does require
like<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> fast<00:01:40.860> computer<00:01:41.540> like<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> mean<00:01:42.780> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
like a fast computer like I mean you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.719 
like a fast computer like I mean you
know<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> had<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> be<00:01:43.860> pretty<00:01:43.979> faster<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.549> this

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
know it had to be pretty faster on this

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.350 
know it had to be pretty faster on this
but<00:01:44.939> I'm<00:01:45.740> see<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:47.009> it's<00:01:47.490> pretty<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.030> not

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
but I'm see here it's pretty it's not

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.120 
but I'm see here it's pretty it's not
much<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.750> screen<00:01:49.020> saver<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.890> bits

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
much of a screen saver if it's this bits

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
see if there's a kind of a gradient down

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.800 
see if there's a kind of a gradient down
here<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.099> there's<00:04:03.000> reflections<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:03.720> they

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
here and there's reflections and they

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.659 
here and there's reflections and they
fly<00:04:04.049> around<00:04:04.290> your<00:04:04.650> desktop<00:04:05.010> wallpaper<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.609> you

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
fly around your desktop wallpaper so you

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.400 
fly around your desktop wallpaper so you
can<00:04:05.790> see<00:04:05.940> here<00:04:06.180> my<00:04:06.569> desktop<00:04:06.900> wallpapers<00:04:07.290> in

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
can see here my desktop wallpapers in

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.140 
can see here my desktop wallpapers in
the<00:04:07.500> middle<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:08.489> can<00:04:08.519> get<00:04:08.730> that<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:09.000> fly

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
the middle you can get that to fly

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.280 
the middle you can get that to fly
around<00:04:09.269> as<00:04:09.540> well<00:04:09.630> if<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.870> like<00:04:09.989> but<00:04:10.169> I<00:04:10.230> think

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
around as well if you like but I think

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.539 
around as well if you like but I think
it's<00:04:10.560> good<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.739> have<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.069> in<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.190> middle<00:04:11.310> and

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
it's good to have it in the middle and

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.280 
it's good to have it in the middle and
then<00:04:12.000> all<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.209> your<00:04:12.389> open<00:04:12.569> windows<00:04:12.720> fly<00:04:13.230> around

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
then all of your open windows fly around

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.190 
then all of your open windows fly around
so<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.739> better<00:04:13.889> if<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.870> more<00:04:15.870> windows

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
so it's better if you have more windows

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.339 
so it's better if you have more windows
open<00:04:16.530> it<00:04:16.799> looks<00:04:16.950> better<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:18.139> this<00:04:19.139> does

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
open it looks better so this does

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.229 
open it looks better so this does
require<00:04:19.530> fast<00:04:19.950> computer<00:04:20.310> as<00:04:20.400> well<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.789> it's

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
require fast computer as well and it's

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.260 
require fast computer as well and it's
only<00:04:21.389> available<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:21.900> Macs<00:04:22.109> unfortunately

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
only available for Macs unfortunately

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.880 
only available for Macs unfortunately
but<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.330> is<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.810> really<00:04:24.990> cool<00:04:25.260> application<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
but it is a really cool application and

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.110 
but it is a really cool application and
it's<00:04:25.979> free<00:04:26.190> it's<00:04:26.400> not<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.580> shareware

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
it's free it's not a shareware

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.629 
it's free it's not a shareware
like<00:04:27.510> that<00:04:27.830> so<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.190> when<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.340> move<00:04:29.490> your

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639

like that so and when you move your
mouse<00:04:29.790> again<00:04:30.090> they<00:04:30.210> all<00:04:30.300> fly<00:04:30.660> back<00:04:30.870> in<00:04:31.050> so

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
mouse again they all fly back in so

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.129 
mouse again they all fly back in so
that's<00:04:32.250> pretty<00:04:32.490> much<00:04:32.639> it<00:04:32.850> that<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:33.419> my<00:04:33.570> top<00:04:33.780> 5
