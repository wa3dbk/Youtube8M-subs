had<00:00:37.050> some<00:00:37.879> exit<00:00:38.879> pipes<00:00:39.120> made<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
had some exit pipes made this is one of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.420 
had some exit pipes made this is one of
the<00:00:40.980> rear<00:00:41.160> exit<00:00:41.370> pipes<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.899> pipe<00:00:43.110> comes<00:00:44.070> up

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the rear exit pipes so the pipe comes up

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.569 
the rear exit pipes so the pipe comes up
the<00:00:44.730> tank<00:00:45.350> drops<00:00:46.350> inside<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.129> tank<00:00:47.340> around

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the tank drops inside the tank around

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.529 
the tank drops inside the tank around
about<00:00:47.820> 50<00:00:48.239> mil<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:49.590> then<00:00:49.770> we've<00:00:49.980> got<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.539> 90

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
about 50 mil and then we've got a 90

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.900 
about 50 mil and then we've got a 90
degree<00:00:51.840> Bend<00:00:52.110> which<00:00:53.070> runs<00:00:53.340> along<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> back<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
degree Bend which runs along the back of

25<00:00:57.210> mil<00:00:59.539> onto<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.690> length<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.859> join

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
25 mil onto the length and then you join

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280 
25 mil onto the length and then you join
it<00:01:02.250> together<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> an<00:01:03.449> tubing<00:01:04.170> that

it<00:01:09.270> all<00:01:09.330> together<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> just

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it all together and then you just

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.760 
it all together and then you just
connect<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:11.689> filter<00:01:12.689> onto<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.560> pretty

any cheap glass this is two millimeter
thick<00:02:19.550> walled<00:02:21.069> so<00:02:22.069> it's<00:02:22.220> not<00:02:22.370> going<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.640> break

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
thick walled so it's not going to break

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.949 
thick walled so it's not going to break
unlike<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:25.130> cheap<00:02:26.050> Chinese<00:02:27.050> imports<00:02:28.959> we've

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
unlike the cheap Chinese imports we've

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.260 
unlike the cheap Chinese imports we've
had<00:02:30.230> we've<00:02:31.130> been<00:02:31.940> able<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.270> get<00:02:32.420> hold<00:02:32.630> of<00:02:32.870> some

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
had we've been able to get hold of some

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.250 
had we've been able to get hold of some
suction<00:02:35.270> cups<00:02:35.630> which<00:02:35.750> fear<00:02:36.230> these<00:02:37.040> spray<00:02:37.670> bars

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
suction cups which fear these spray bars

unfortunately<00:02:39.260> we're<00:02:39.380> struggling<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.920> get

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
unfortunately we're struggling to get

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.920 
unfortunately we're struggling to get
ones<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.520> fit<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.819> 13<00:02:41.270> millimeter<00:02:41.480> at<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
ones to fit the 13 millimeter at the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.140 
ones to fit the 13 millimeter at the
moment<00:02:42.260> but<00:02:43.160> I'm<00:02:43.280> sure<00:02:43.430> we'll<00:02:43.640> come<00:02:43.790> up<00:02:43.850> with<00:02:43.970> a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
moment but I'm sure we'll come up with a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.390 
moment but I'm sure we'll come up with a
remedy<00:02:44.570> for<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.739> these<00:02:45.890> just<00:02:46.160> simply

ends so you can use any combination for
whatever<00:04:25.780> size<00:04:26.020> things<00:04:26.800> you've<00:04:27.010> got<00:04:27.960> maybe
