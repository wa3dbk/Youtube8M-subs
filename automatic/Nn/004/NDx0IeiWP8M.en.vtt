00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.510
 go about the glass itself at first a little 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.969
 prehistory decided still needed 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.250
 To me, this mirror means one fine 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.570
 the day I was going to go to work came 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.489

 missing so here so here guys 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.289
 even in Germany there are people who 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.789
 stealing mirrors 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:55.230
 even if it is not so wrong all 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.090
 good as it seems oh well in 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.710
 the principle is that there is something i think is 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.870
 man it comes around after all 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.180
 life and what comes back like a boomerang 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.280

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.280
 I ordered mirrors such a box 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.110
 the mirror will tell you that it goes very well 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.020
 dangerously located is spinning to look at 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.960
 all sides and a little bit did not break the neck 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.430
 error mirrors are not very convenient 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.570
 ordered it such a mirror and Volska 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.350
 I will show you now how to change it 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.479
 actually how to remove the mirror itself 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.060
 Serbia indicators I can not because you 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.490
 missing can make rotate it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.640
 extreme right position and enter very 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.820
 anything and on trying on a plastic card 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.160

 broken off need to be changed 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.390
 These contacts because I always 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.730
 so it is broken off but the law without heating 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.790

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.840
