00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.860
 with the advancing age you are writing some changes in our 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:09.400
 the skin makes it easier to know how to be 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.290
 changes that are part of aging at some point also 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.750
 our reactive power hit our eyes and diminished due to the fatigue of the 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.899
 and it is at this time that this already 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:25.730
 the minister 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.339
 was limited by a 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:32.929
 reading the next as it says around 30 to 33 cents then 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.530
 the term presbyopia is what applies to tired sight 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.400
 presbyopia or tired sight is a problem that sooner or later will 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.460
 reach all people 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.290
 It's only a matter of time 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.100
 usually the 38 40 years 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520
 as this exists only from the pib 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.240
 with almost everyone 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.870
 the main symptom is the difficulty of arriving at nearby objects 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.980
 natural inhabitants, such as reading a book from a medicine 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.530
 be more complicated 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.570
 what avoids seem to pass in such cases 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.570
 changes are more frequent in the early years 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.119
 the patient 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.030
 complains 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.030
 of progressive quality reduction 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.570
 then normally stabilizes on the plate 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.870
 even though it is a natural condition of age 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.190
 some doubts arise and for this reason we resort to a 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.590
 to clarify the main issues first with the use of the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.510
 computer can harm the eyes and leave married life 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.260
 kuki is known that the irradiation see hear hear that it is clear 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.670
 for several points in the sum of the invoices came out 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.150
 this can actually bring about changes 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.910
 The unit provides no time any command the habit of reading in places with 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.560
 low light but in front of you to reach 3 thousand lines 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.180
 What happens is that you do not have the same income it took a lot of time 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.550
 the signs of visual fatigue 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.300
 It's good and it tires weekly 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.639
 nothing to bring 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.730
 definitive damage since those who are very low and take to have 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:17.599
 looking tired the person he is very unfortunate becomes more demanding 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.279
 it requires a larger sun rope 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.439
 of the best 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.749
 pa price experiences of other problems such as inpe 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.569
 the hypermetropic astigmatism 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.379
 the internet of pierre that is 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.379
 can anticipate 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.629
 delaying the onset of symptoms on the beam 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.069
 well 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.500
 since the sight tired of reaching everyone unfortunately the problem can 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.129
 be corrected 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.809
 putting 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.939
 a lens 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.329
 that makes the approach 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.329
 and there are expanding that through glasses 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.689
 increase mancuso 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:04.059
 for those who do not need otherwise the distance of high optimism 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.469
 just for reading 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.339
 or contact lenses 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.169
 in patients who already have some degree of opacity that this girl 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.619
 in plastic there are many and all 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.249
 are focused in some way 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.700
 not the type to be used 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.830
 but do not forget to take good care of the health of the Azores 

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:29.579
 the businessmen are receiving the visit to the ophthalmologist every two 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.889
 years are enough to guarantee a beautiful vision.
