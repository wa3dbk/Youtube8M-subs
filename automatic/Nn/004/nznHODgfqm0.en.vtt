00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.540 
see the third dish right in here get
three<00:02:08.690> of<00:02:08.720> those<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.920> way<00:02:10.039> it<00:02:10.130> works<00:02:10.340> is

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
three of those and the way it works is

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.370 
three of those and the way it works is
you<00:02:10.580> just<00:02:10.880> push<00:02:11.209> this<00:02:11.450> right<00:02:11.660> here<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.080> very

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
you just push this right here it's very

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.350 
you just push this right here it's very
simple<00:02:12.650> I'm<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.459> move<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:13.790> minifigure

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
simple I'm going to move this minifigure

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.640 
simple I'm going to move this minifigure
make<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> little<00:02:14.870> bit<00:02:15.019> easier<00:02:15.260> for<00:02:15.800> me<00:02:15.920> and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
make it a little bit easier for me and

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.380 
make it a little bit easier for me and
let's<00:02:18.650> see<00:02:18.800> how<00:02:18.950> simple<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.940> it's

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
let's see how simple that is and it's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.300 
let's see how simple that is and it's
also<00:02:20.540> very<00:02:20.780> easy<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.319> load<00:02:21.500> just<00:02:21.980> take<00:02:22.190> your

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
also very easy to load just take your

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.550 
also very easy to load just take your
disc<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.760> push<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.540> right<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.380> front

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
disc and push it right in the front

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.190 
disc and push it right in the front
there<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.269> gets<00:02:26.269> a<00:02:26.330> little<00:02:26.360> holding<00:02:26.870> spot

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
there and gets a little holding spot

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.900 
there and gets a little holding spot
over<00:02:27.560> on<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.799> side<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.310> hold<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.819> extras<00:02:29.450> and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
which i think is really cool this is the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.150 
which i think is really cool this is the
panther<00:02:46.430> version<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:48.260> can<00:02:48.500> turn<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.799> over

panther version and you can turn it over
very<00:02:49.489> easily<00:02:50.390> by<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:51.170> turning<00:02:52.010> this<00:02:52.220> back

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
very easily by just turning this back

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.140 
very easily by just turning this back
piece<00:02:53.109> you<00:02:54.109> turn<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.440> over<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.799> then<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.910> have

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150

it there's also that open mouth which i
think<00:03:14.750> is<00:03:15.049> cool<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.620> way<00:03:15.709> it's<00:03:15.859> designed<00:03:16.329> when

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
think is cool the way it's designed when

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.300 
think is cool the way it's designed when
you<00:03:17.420> have<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.989> tiger<00:03:18.440> mode<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:19.130> have

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
you have it in the tiger mode you have

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.250 
you have it in the tiger mode you have
these<00:03:19.640> kind<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.060> flick<00:03:20.239> fire<00:03:20.450> missiles<00:03:20.930> right

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
these kind of flick fire missiles right

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.680 
these kind of flick fire missiles right
here<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:21.769> when<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:22.850> turn<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.090> back<00:03:23.329> over<00:03:23.359> to

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
here and when you turn it back over to

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.699 
here and when you turn it back over to
the<00:03:24.440> panther<00:03:24.859> mode<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:26.060> have<00:03:26.200> these<00:03:27.200> kind<00:03:27.650> of

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
the panther mode you have these kind of

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.309 
the panther mode you have these kind of
missiles<00:03:28.100> right<00:03:28.850> up<00:03:28.970> here<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:29.959> think<00:03:30.230> it's

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
missiles right up here so I think it's

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.289 
missiles right up here so I think it's
really<00:03:30.500> cool<00:03:30.739> that<00:03:30.799> they<00:03:31.130> have<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:32.239> you

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
really cool that they have it so you

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.110 
really cool that they have it so you
have<00:03:32.600> weaponry<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.950> different<00:03:34.730> weaponry

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
have weaponry and different weaponry

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.229 
have weaponry and different weaponry
actually<00:03:35.900> depending<00:03:36.829> on<00:03:36.920> which<00:03:37.160> way<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.459> want

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
actually depending on which way you want

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.059 
actually depending on which way you want
to<00:03:38.359> turn<00:03:38.569> that<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.590> think<00:03:39.680> that<00:03:39.859> is<00:03:40.010> very

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
to turn that so I think that is very

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.590 
to turn that so I think that is very
cool<00:03:40.519> those

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
cool those

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.550 
cool those
add<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.290> piece<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.590> cheese<00:03:43.040> right<00:03:43.340> here<00:03:43.370> and

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
add a piece of cheese right here and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.460 
add a piece of cheese right here and
here's<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.770> main<00:03:46.700> part<00:03:47.180> here<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.690> kind<00:03:48.410> of

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
here's the main part here that kind of

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.830 
here's the main part here that kind of
turns<00:03:48.770> a<00:03:48.920> little<00:03:49.010> bit<00:03:49.280> just<00:03:49.520> because<00:03:49.840> well

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
turns a little bit just because well

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.630 
turns a little bit just because well
really<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.410> should<00:03:51.710> be<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.980> stable<00:03:52.370> part

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
really that should be the stable part

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.800 
really that should be the stable part
and<00:03:52.850> everything<00:03:53.420> else<00:03:53.630> turns<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:56.030> cool<00:03:56.480> i

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
and everything else turns so cool i

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.780 
and everything else turns so cool i
really<00:03:57.080> really<00:03:57.740> like<00:03:58.070> that<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.490> can<00:03:58.640> actually

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
really really like that you can actually

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.870 
really really like that you can actually
kind<00:03:59.300> of<00:03:59.330> transform<00:04:00.050> it<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:01.430> just<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.700> really

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
kind of transform it it's just a really

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.390 
kind of transform it it's just a really
