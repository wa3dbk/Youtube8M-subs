00:00:05.328 --> 00:00:07.153
 Their numbers have increased, 

00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:08.917
 And you walk. 

00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:12.044
 You will never go through the forest alive. 

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:13.324
 I have an idea. 

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:15.877
 We can ask for help from the eagles. 

00:00:15.878 --> 00:00:17.021
 I love the vultures! Yes! A good idea! 

00:00:17.022 --> 00:00:20.177
 Stop! Stop! Just stop with the Eagles. 

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:23.138
 But they solve every problem we have! 

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:25.181
 No more eagles! - Good. 

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:32.803
 -How Smaug's defeat was supposed to end- 

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:37.463
 Are not you going to scan me? I have something down my pants. 

00:00:37.668 --> 00:00:41.419
 Oh ... Ugh! Do not talk to me with your sexual innuendo, dwarf. 

00:00:42.112 --> 00:00:46.381
 I'm just kidding, I find it so worth it! I'll be in love with you and from now on. 

00:00:46.382 --> 00:00:49.815
 -Yes. Together we link this petty hatred between our two races. 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.378
 Just because you hinted at the contents of your pants. 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:54.379
 Wow! 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.593
 So you let me out? 

00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:57.889
 or not. You're a prisoner, you stay inside. 

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:03.554
 Kill the elf! 

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.964
 Which one is the elf? 

00:01:08.108 --> 00:01:10.668
 You understand that everyone looks the same. 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.650
 We all look the same! 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.404
 You have... 

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:22.400
 Bird's poop! 

00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:25.911
 Why no one said anything. 

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:28.110
 Or ... so embarrassing. 

00:01:29.884 --> 00:01:33.819
 We woke the whole city, because we found these dwarves stealing weapons. 

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:37.351
 We want to return the mountain to us. 

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:41.880
 If we succeed, we will all be rich! 

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:43.459
 Or ... okay. - Yep! 

00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:46.891
 I demand as many black arrows as you can collect. 

00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:53.010
 Because there is a dragon on this mountain and we were just talking about it being the only weapon that could puncture a dragon's skin. 

00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:53.911
 Yes!!! 

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:55.760
 We're not stupid, are we? 

00:01:55.795 --> 00:01:56.588
 No... 

00:01:56.589 --> 00:02:00.279
 Like, it's not like we can just go inside and expect the dragon to be nice. 

00:02:00.884 --> 00:02:05.060
 In fact, dragons are completely unstructured. They are really easy to train. 

00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:07.461
 I raise the dragons as a child. 

00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:11.897
 Lucky Dragon is the only way to go on a journey. 

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:12.898
 or... 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.054
 Okay, so in this case ... 

00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:16.582
 I'm the last one! 

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:18.010
 OK! We understood that! 

00:02:18.282 --> 00:02:20.450
 We'll be friends of the dragon! 

00:02:20.668 --> 00:02:21.839
 Yes Yes Yes!! 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.860
 24 hours later ... 

00:02:31.942 --> 00:02:33.698
 What do you think you're doing? 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:36.831
 Or or. 

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.539
 He does not want to be a friend! "It's a terrible idea." 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.640
 I'll show you what a friend is. 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.916
 What have we done ?! 

00:02:45.917 --> 00:02:51.929
 I am fire! I'm Death ... 

00:02:52.654 --> 00:02:53.591
 Black Arrow! 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.013
 or! Straight on ... or not. 

00:03:02.775 --> 00:03:04.638
 what? how a... 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:05.639
 I caught him! 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.818
 But from where ... How are you ... 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.918
 Do not know. I'm not even supposed to be in this story! 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.395
 -The end- 

00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:27.938
 Or ... Thank you for watching ... surfing the browser ... 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:28.939

00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:30.481
