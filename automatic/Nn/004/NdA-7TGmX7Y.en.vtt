jungle and while playing this i'm going

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.240 
jungle and while playing this i'm going
to<00:00:25.450> show<00:00:25.540> you<00:00:25.570> some<00:00:25.869> strategies<00:00:26.320> that<00:00:26.829> i<00:00:26.890> use

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
to show you some strategies that i use

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.179 
to show you some strategies that i use
within<00:00:28.000> this<00:00:28.210> game<00:00:28.450> now<00:00:29.200> since<00:00:29.529> we<00:00:29.680> spawn<00:00:29.919> this

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
within this game now since we spawn this

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.069 
within this game now since we spawn this
side<00:00:30.460> we<00:00:30.730> i<00:00:31.090> know<00:00:31.149> that<00:00:31.360> they're<00:00:31.750> spawning

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
side we i know that they're spawning

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.720 
side we i know that they're spawning
over<00:00:32.379> there<00:00:32.500> so<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.920> reason<00:00:33.100> why<00:00:33.340> i<00:00:33.370> throw

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
over there so the reason why i throw

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.280 
over there so the reason why i throw
those<00:00:33.940> grenade<00:00:34.360> is<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.750> one<00:00:34.930> to<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.140> left

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
those grenade is the one to the left

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.860 
those grenade is the one to the left
will<00:00:35.770> stun<00:00:36.129> them<00:00:36.309> momentarily<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.719> one

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
will stun them momentarily and the one

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.200 
will stun them momentarily and the one
to<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.050> right<00:00:38.140> will<00:00:38.559> also<00:00:39.430> stone<00:00:39.670> momentarily

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
to the right will also stone momentarily

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.710 
to the right will also stone momentarily
so<00:00:40.450> i<00:00:40.510> could<00:00:40.750> post<00:00:41.140> up<00:00:41.410> within<00:00:41.650> that<00:00:42.720> window

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
so i could post up within that window

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.900 
so i could post up within that window
and<00:00:44.170> that<00:00:44.440> i<00:00:44.470> can<00:00:44.590> see<00:00:44.950> now<00:00:45.190> that<00:00:45.220> i<00:00:45.430> saw<00:00:45.700> that

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.130 
my teammates were rushing forward I
planned<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.790> motion<00:00:49.150> sensor<00:00:49.329> so<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:49.810> I<00:00:49.989> can

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140

my<00:01:27.010> motion<00:01:27.340> sensors<00:01:27.729> also<00:01:27.940> over<00:01:28.299> there<00:01:28.450> but

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
my motion sensors also over there but

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.140 
my motion sensors also over there but
again<00:01:29.290> I<00:01:29.590> see<00:01:29.950> that<00:01:30.159> my<00:01:30.190> teammates<00:01:30.790> are<00:01:30.909> pushed

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
around using this as cover and hopefully

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.990 
around using this as cover and hopefully
picking<00:01:38.260> up<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.500> few<00:01:38.710> i'm<00:01:39.189> still<00:01:39.460> seeing<00:01:39.700> a

bunch of red dots behind me so I'm

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.719 
bunch of red dots behind me so I'm

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
checking it over here let's do see again

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.960 
checking it over here let's do see again
