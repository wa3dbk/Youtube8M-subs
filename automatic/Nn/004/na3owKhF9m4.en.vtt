okay I'm going to show you how to make
swarm<00:00:02.820> traps<00:00:03.120> my<00:00:03.870> style<00:00:04.200> swarm<00:00:04.500> traps<00:00:04.770> I've

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
swarm traps my style swarm traps I've

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.509 
swarm traps my style swarm traps I've
got<00:00:05.960> standard<00:00:06.960> box<00:00:07.200> traps<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:08.040> also<00:00:08.220> have

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
got standard box traps and I also have

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.820 
got standard box traps and I also have
top<00:00:09.179> bar<00:00:09.389> hive<00:00:09.540> traps<00:00:09.900> I'm<00:00:10.469> just<00:00:10.650> going<00:00:10.769> to

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
top bar hive traps I'm just going to

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.850 
top bar hive traps I'm just going to
show<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.010> about<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.730> box<00:00:12.719> type<00:00:13.019> let's<00:00:13.440> form

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
show you about the box type let's form

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.790 
show you about the box type let's form
swarm<00:00:14.549> trap<00:00:14.790> today<00:00:15.059> all<00:00:15.900> right<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.470> do<00:00:16.650> that

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
swarm trap today all right so do that

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.050 
swarm trap today all right so do that
I'm<00:00:17.039> going<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.340> pull<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.550> down<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.880> show<00:00:18.029> you

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
I'm going to pull it down and show you

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.429 
I'm going to pull it down and show you
so<00:00:18.750> hang<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.550> alright<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.880> box<00:00:21.180> trap<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
so hang on alright for this box trap the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.550 
so hang on alright for this box trap the
idea<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.160> get<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.550> ideal<00:00:24.180> volume<00:00:24.810> size<00:00:25.140> and

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
idea is to get the ideal volume size and

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.019 
idea is to get the ideal volume size and
the<00:00:26.340> ideal<00:00:26.760> opening<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> cavity<00:00:29.029> research

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the ideal opening to the cavity research

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.400 
the ideal opening to the cavity research
has<00:00:30.269> pointed<00:00:30.599> out<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.929> that's<00:00:31.109> going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.349> be

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
has pointed out that that's going to be

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.850 
has pointed out that that's going to be
between<00:00:31.830> 30<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.640> 40<00:00:33.180> liters<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.649> your

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
between 30 and 40 liters and that your

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.170 
between 30 and 40 liters and that your
access<00:00:35.370> hole<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:36.510> going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:37.050> around<00:00:38.180> 15

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
access hole is going to be around 15

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.100 
access hole is going to be around 15
centimeters<00:00:40.020> squared<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:41.719> this<00:00:42.719> has<00:00:42.960> been

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
centimeters squared so this has been

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.610 
centimeters squared so this has been
made<00:00:43.640> from<00:00:44.640> scrap<00:00:44.969> wood

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620
