who is loose in the element though they

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.490 
who is loose in the element though they
just<00:00:29.279> slide<00:00:29.730> around<00:00:29.940> if<00:00:30.539> you've<00:00:30.779> got<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.990> crate

it<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> cheap<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:54.149> was<00:00:54.719> able<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.020> find<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
it on the cheap I was able to find it a

it on the cheap I was able to find it a
canard<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> perfect<00:00:57.180> width<00:00:57.840> really

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
canard it's the perfect width really

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.310 
canard it's the perfect width really
easy<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.920> assemble<00:00:59.309> -<00:00:59.960> originally<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.110> came

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
easy to assemble - originally it came

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.490 
easy to assemble - originally it came
with<00:01:01.590> six<00:01:01.920> storage<00:01:02.370> fan<00:01:02.750> of<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:04.079> I<00:01:04.290> took

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
with six storage fan of which I took

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.039 
with six storage fan of which I took
three<00:01:05.010> out<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.119> could<00:01:06.420> create<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
three out so that I could create a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.080 
three out so that I could create a
double-door<00:01:07.770> crate<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.479> god<00:01:09.950> using

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
double-door crate here for my god using

double-door crate here for my god using
disassembled<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.950> disassembled<00:01:15.020> collapsible

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
disassembled a disassembled collapsible

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.109 
disassembled a disassembled collapsible
wire<00:01:16.320> crate<00:01:17.010> you<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.760> took<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
wire crate you know I just took the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.090 
wire crate you know I just took the
panels<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.750> put<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.049> where<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.260> needed<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.920> I

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
panels and put them where I needed it I

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.240 
panels and put them where I needed it I
didn't<00:01:20.790> quite<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.420> enough<00:01:21.920> panels<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
didn't quite have enough panels and I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.950 
didn't quite have enough panels and I
was<00:01:23.369> doing<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:23.970> an<00:01:24.119> experiment<00:01:24.540> not

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
was doing this as an experiment not

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
was doing this as an experiment not
certain<00:01:25.409> whether<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.830> would<00:01:26.040> work<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:27.030> I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
certain whether it would work so I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.289 
certain whether it would work so I
filled<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> gaps<00:01:28.130> with<00:01:29.130> cardboard<00:01:29.939> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
filled in the gaps with cardboard and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.330 
filled in the gaps with cardboard and
bondrée<00:01:30.840> cords<00:01:31.290> my<00:01:31.530> dogs<00:01:31.770> don't<00:01:32.040> try<00:01:32.280> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
bondrée cords my dogs don't try to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.640 
bondrée cords my dogs don't try to
escape<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.180> yours<00:01:33.420> dead<00:01:33.750> it'd<00:01:34.229> be<00:01:34.470> really

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
escape but if yours dead it'd be really

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.850 
escape but if yours dead it'd be really
easy<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.430> replace<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.780> an<00:01:37.049> actual<00:01:37.560> wire

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
easy to replace this with an actual wire

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.380 
easy to replace this with an actual wire
grid<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.700> wire<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.590> frame<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.390> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
grid and wire it to the frame of the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.569 
grid and wire it to the frame of the
storage<00:01:42.780> bin<00:01:43.049> folder

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
storage bin folder

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.060 
storage bin folder
so<00:01:45.240> figured<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> pickup<00:01:46.740> if

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
so figured out if you have a pickup if

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859 
so figured out if you have a pickup if
you<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.399> an<00:01:47.549> element<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.570> another

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you have an element if you have another

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.679 
you have an element if you have another
vehicle<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.399> does<00:01:50.579> double<00:01:51.119> duty<00:01:51.390> it

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
vehicle this really does double duty it

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
vehicle this really does double duty it
does<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.930> fine<00:01:52.320> job<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.950> may<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.280> look<00:01:53.520> so

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
does a fine job it may not look so

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.609 
does a fine job it may not look so
pretty<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.210> way<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.390> did<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.200> bet<00:01:55.439> you're

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
pretty the way I did it but I bet you're

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.210 
pretty the way I did it but I bet you're
better<00:01:56.539> give<00:01:57.539> it<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.720> whirl<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.649> until<00:01:59.070> we

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
better give it a whirl and until we

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.830 
better give it a whirl and until we
speak<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.789> have<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.360> doggone<00:02:00.840> great<00:02:01.590> day
