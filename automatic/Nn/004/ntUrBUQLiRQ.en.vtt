00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.901
What about the here and now?
I don't know.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.033
I don't know what's gonna happen
tomorrow or today.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.901
I wonder: "It's been a while
since nothing happen".

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:40.400
Then it happens.

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:41.501
So...

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:45.467
I think we're always
creating the present.

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:47.334
As Nietzsche said:

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:50.334
"Go down deep...

00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:53.801
but don't keep living
the drama, don't stay there,

00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:57.067
live all the tragedy,
"tragedy, oh!",

00:00:57.467 --> 00:00:59.567
then you arise
as a new being.

00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:02.968
And I always wanna be
those new beings.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.133
Recreating the present...

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.667
What do you mean?
We live the present.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:14.200
It's not to keep living the drama.
"Oh, my God!" "Oh, will he be back?"

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:16.601
-I never do that.
-Then...

00:01:16.634 --> 00:01:19.801
suddenly you say "good-bye"
and it's all over,

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:21.067
now I'm another person.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.200
Look! I'll tell you something:
our experiences aren't useful to anyone,

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:26.534
but to ourselves.

00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:28.701
"Do like this..."
Nope!

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.167
-Wise!
-Being wrong in life is the best thing.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.100
Don't you agree?

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:38.067
THE HERE AND NOW GOES TOO FAST

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.801
You know, I'm a sedimentation.

00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:49.200
One layer, another layer, another...

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:51.968
another... it looks like...
like an assembly,

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:55.234
like those excavations
where they do like this...

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:58.167
then you're able to see the layers.
That's me.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.033
The greatest thing of my life
is that I've always been curious.

00:02:35.067 --> 00:02:36.734
-So have you.
-Me too.

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:37.801
Of course.

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:40.267
I'm loving your words.
I'll copy many things.

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:41.400
Great.

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:45.400
I believe that more than a work of art,
my life is an art installation.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.834
I can't say it's a work of art,
it's an installation,

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:52.634
pieces, and pieces, and pieces...

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:57.000
that I put together.
I love that kind of patchwork.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.501
I don't like definitive stuffs,
I like the patchwork

00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:03.133
for I keep changing...

00:03:28.434 --> 00:03:29.767
HERE, WE SMOKE A LOT

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:35.167
I'm an outsider.

00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:37.934
I don't use GPS...

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.133
I don't like to find myself.

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:43.434
Fabricio has always told me:
"You lose your glasses,

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:47.133
your wallet, everything,
because the joy of finding them later

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:51.100
is so great..."
I love to be lost and then...

00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:52.701
to find myself.

00:03:53.234 --> 00:03:56.367
IT TAKES QUITE A WHILE
FOR US TO BE YOUNG

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.300
Many friends of mine

00:03:58.334 --> 00:04:00.767
that were beautiful,
started to be less beautiful

00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:02.200
and got all desperate.

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:07.000
I didn't.
I thank God for having

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:09.701
almost the same figure
I had before...

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:14.734
I have some goiter and all,
but what's the problem?

00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:18.467
I swear to God I think like that,
otherwise I'd be...

00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:23.000
I saw my friends the other day,
they were all twins,

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:25.734
all going under some shots.

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:31.400
If you take a picture...
Natural light is dreadful at this age.

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:34.100
A group of friends
were like twins.

00:04:34.634 --> 00:04:36.234
-All like this.
-All the same.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.167
Aside from that, I notice
the worry they have

00:04:41.567 --> 00:04:45.300
about being impeccable.
My God!

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:46.801
I take care of myself.

00:04:46.868 --> 00:04:50.133
It takes me an hour to have
my makeup and hair done.

00:04:50.868 --> 00:04:52.033
It's a setting-up.

00:04:52.067 --> 00:04:55.634
The line against the wrinkle
and all...

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.934
Each day it's closer.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:03.334
My love, come here!

00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:06.033
Eye liner... I mean...

00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:09.434
It starts smearing,
so we...

00:05:10.868 --> 00:05:12.033
clean it.

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:13.567
You see?

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:16.567
Because it's sharp.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.067
That's it.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.400
Me too.
I do all that too.

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:26.467
I'm fine as I am.

00:05:26.734 --> 00:05:29.534
Full of wrinkles,
this part has fallen...

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.133
Well, that's aging. I don't want
to look like I'm 40yo,

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.968
I'm 73, you know?

00:05:36.033 --> 00:05:39.300
I think those 12yo ladies
are dreadful.

00:05:39.334 --> 00:05:42.367
It's horrible!
Because they're old.

00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:46.000
They look like they were 12...

00:05:46.467 --> 00:05:48.834
and say things of old people.

00:05:49.634 --> 00:05:52.300
CHANGING IS FOR THE STRONG ONES

00:05:52.334 --> 00:05:55.734
I started to understand
that wrong relationships

00:05:55.767 --> 00:06:01.067
drain your power,
you start being a fossil,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.534
it doesn't work,
it's devastating.

00:06:03.567 --> 00:06:06.067
-That's true.
-I've done that...

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.934
consciously, a couple of times
in my life.

00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:14.567
Relationships that make
you weak.

00:06:14.634 --> 00:06:19.734
If things aren't right,
I prefer to cut it out for good.

00:06:19.834 --> 00:06:26.000
When I do those things...
I'm the master of self-immune diseases,

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:31.434
then my eyes get swollen,
my thyroid gland get swollen,

00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:33.968
-I get all allergic.
-A small cancer.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.234
-Me too.
-Me too.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.400
But we prevent ourselves.
Not you.

00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:41.534
I can't. I like creating a cancer.

00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:44.467
And I think it's a way of
calling some attention.

00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:52.000
Look! My last doctor told me:
"Are you still smoking?" "Yes…

00:06:52.534 --> 00:06:53.934
…and I'll keep smoking.”

00:06:53.968 --> 00:06:58.968
I keep smoking, I'll die
from skin cancer because I sunbathe,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.934
I'll fall from my shoes and break
a foot because I love high heels...

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.234
-I hope not.
-...and I'll keep drinking.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.667
We choose how to die.

00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:12.033
I want to die from smoking,
from sun, and from high heels.

00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:15.234
I want to die tall,
do you understand?

00:07:23.367 --> 00:07:27.000
You're a creative person,
I'm an observer one.

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:29.300
I'm a "voyeuse".

00:07:29.334 --> 00:07:34.334
Next time we'll talk about sex,
since she's talking about voyeurs.
