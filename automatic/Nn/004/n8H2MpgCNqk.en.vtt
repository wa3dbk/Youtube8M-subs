00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
brac like I'm doing bracket to my

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.550

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
fingers if they KO it it just regions

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.410 
fingers if they KO it it just regions
like<00:02:04.649> an<00:02:04.829> eighth<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.280> its<00:02:05.490> health<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.149> have

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
like an eighth of its health so you have

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.089 
like an eighth of its health so you have
to<00:02:06.509> wait<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> get<00:02:06.930> red<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.290> again<00:02:07.560> but

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
to wait for it to get red but again but

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.919 
to wait for it to get red but again but
you<00:02:08.220> actually<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> KO<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.030> now<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> really

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
you actually have to KO it now a really

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.309 
you actually have to KO it now a really
good<00:02:10.110> strategy

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
good strategy

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.959 
good strategy
range<00:02:11.469> apparently<00:02:11.980> range<00:02:12.280> really<00:02:12.549> works<00:02:12.700> mage

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:12.969 
range apparently range really works mage

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.300 
range apparently range really works mage
