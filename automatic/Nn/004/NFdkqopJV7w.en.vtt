I<00:02:32.760> had<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> lot<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.140> learn<00:02:34.320> about<00:02:34.380> videography

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540

really<00:02:36.540> my<00:02:36.750> videos<00:02:37.200> didn't<00:02:37.800> get<00:02:38.010> much<00:02:38.250> better

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.080 
really my videos didn't get much better
for<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.210> long<00:02:39.600> time<00:02:40.080> especially<00:02:40.610> indoor<00:02:41.610> videos

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
for a long time especially indoor videos
