00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
oh it's a great time to soil sample here

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.240 
oh it's a great time to soil sample here
in<00:00:09.090> Maine<00:00:09.300> for<00:00:09.900> one<00:00:10.019> thing<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.380> soils<00:00:10.769> lab<00:00:10.950> is

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
in Maine for one thing the soils lab is

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.520 
in Maine for one thing the soils lab is
less<00:00:11.519> busy<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.330> you'll<00:00:12.570> get<00:00:12.809> your<00:00:12.870> soil<00:00:13.170> test

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
less busy so you'll get your soil test

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.350 
less busy so you'll get your soil test
results<00:00:13.710> quicker<00:00:14.340> now<00:00:14.700> than<00:00:14.969> if<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.210> wait

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
results quicker now than if you wait

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.189 
results quicker now than if you wait
until<00:00:15.540> spring<00:00:15.809> also<00:00:16.619> if<00:00:17.609> your<00:00:18.420> soil<00:00:18.779> needs

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
until spring also if your soil needs

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.320 
until spring also if your soil needs
something<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:19.830> lime<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.520> nutrient<00:00:21.270> that

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
something like lime a nutrient that

that<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.789> send<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.570> garden<00:00:57.870> sample

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that you send in for your garden sample

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.979 
that you send in for your garden sample
so<00:00:58.949> how<00:00:59.160> many<00:00:59.219> samples<00:00:59.760> do<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> take<00:01:00.420> before

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
so how many samples do you take before

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.380 
so how many samples do you take before
you<00:01:01.410> send<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.800> off<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.489> really<00:01:02.910> depends<00:01:03.329> on

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you send it off that really depends on

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
you send it off that really depends on
the<00:01:03.510> size<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:03.960> garden<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.979> most<00:01:05.220> home

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the size of your garden for most home

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
five or six samples mixed into your

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010 
five or six samples mixed into your
buckets<00:01:11.189> will<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.670> well<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:12.930> gonna

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
buckets will do well so we're gonna

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.260 
buckets will do well so we're gonna
wander<00:01:13.439> around<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.740> garden<00:01:14.130> take<00:01:14.700> samples

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
wander around the garden take samples

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.999 
wander around the garden take samples
collecting<00:01:15.930> all<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> samples<00:01:16.710> putting<00:01:16.920> them

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
collecting all the samples putting them

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.620 
collecting all the samples putting them
into<00:01:17.159> our<00:01:17.369> bucket<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.850> we'll<00:01:18.060> take<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.299> sub

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
into our bucket and we'll take a sub

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
into our bucket and we'll take a sub
sample<00:01:18.900> from<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.619> order<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
sample from there in order to have it to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.200 
sample from there in order to have it to
be<00:01:20.670> analyzed<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> here's<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> volume<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.060> soil

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
be analyzed so here's the volume of soil

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.690 
be analyzed so here's the volume of soil
we<00:01:24.450> collected<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.110> five<00:01:25.860> samples<00:01:26.369> taken

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
we collected in five samples taken

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.730 
we collected in five samples taken
around<00:01:26.790> our<00:01:27.030> garden<00:01:27.420> we<00:01:28.110> don't<00:01:28.290> want<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> send

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
around our garden we don't want to send

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.160 
around our garden we don't want to send
this<00:01:29.130> volume<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.670> soil<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> lab<00:01:30.360> what<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
this volume of soil to the lab what you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.010 
this volume of soil to the lab what you
need<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.950> take<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.549> mix<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.090> well<00:01:33.329> so

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
need to do is take it and mix it well so

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.469 
need to do is take it and mix it well so
that<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.829> soil<00:01:35.340> gets<00:01:35.729> thoroughly

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
that all of the soil gets thoroughly

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.780 
that all of the soil gets thoroughly
mixed<00:01:36.750> together<00:01:36.869> your<00:01:37.710> goal<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
mixed together your goal is that the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.510 
mixed together your goal is that the
sample<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.540> sent<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> lab

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
sample that you sent to the lab

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.249 
sample that you sent to the lab
represents<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.820> soil<00:01:42.150> that's<00:01:42.450> over<00:01:43.049> your

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
represents the soil that's over your

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.130 
represents the soil that's over your
entire<00:01:43.710> garden<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.880> I've<00:01:45.090> mixed<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.659> well<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
entire garden so I've mixed it well and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.260 
entire garden so I've mixed it well and
then<00:01:46.320> I'm<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> take<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.520> handful<00:01:48.060> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
then I'm going to take one handful and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.060 
then I'm going to take one handful and
put<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> into<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> soils<00:01:49.619> box<00:01:49.829> that's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
put it into the soils box that's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.910 
put it into the soils box that's
