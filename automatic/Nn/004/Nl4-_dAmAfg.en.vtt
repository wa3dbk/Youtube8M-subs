00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.430 

so<00:00:52.910> I'm<00:00:53.000> going<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.180> use<00:00:53.330> equal<00:00:53.780> quantities<00:00:54.260> of

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
so I'm going to use equal quantities of

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.370 
so I'm going to use equal quantities of
butter<00:00:54.740> and<00:00:54.950> flour<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.640> make<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.910> roux<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.630> in

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.600 

so<00:01:10.750> just<00:01:10.960> make<00:01:11.170> sure<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:11.650> start<00:01:11.979> at<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.250> very

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
so just make sure you start at a very

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.300 
so just make sure you start at a very
low<00:01:12.790> temperature<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:14.229> the<00:01:14.799> color<00:01:15.070> of

whether the roux is cooked or not simply

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.510 

smells<00:01:32.810> like<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.229> is

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.950 

and<00:01:36.609> now<00:01:37.329> hold<00:01:37.750> whisk<00:01:37.990> in<00:01:38.200> one<00:01:38.350> hand<00:01:38.560> and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
have to make this mix a little more

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.460 
have to make this mix a little more

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
solid so that it is easy to bind mix it

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.290 
solid so that it is easy to bind mix it
really<00:02:02.650> well<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:02.950> there<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.370> no<00:02:03.520> lumps<00:02:03.940> inside

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
really well so there is no lumps inside

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.810 
really well so there is no lumps inside
