 hotel are using it for some 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.050
 days and the pool plus that is a bit 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.719
 spa because we have the sting neck of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.949
 there that we are seeing relaxing that yes 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.780
 I'm going to present you again Antonio 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.699
 NÃºÃ±ez who is the marketing director 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.809
 about mercure santodomingo 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.850
 where are we good morning with the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.309
 presentation again we are with a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.330
 envy right now that is a pleasure the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.790
 center of madrid 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.470
 a great day hot but fair and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.480
 a pool to bathe or we the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.460
 we carry digital 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.410
 to stop working and swim well 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.450
 today we can say that the 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.120
 summer because it's warm and makes 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.350
 days not until two days ago the pool 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.180
 we have not had practically clients 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.040
 lodged because they were 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.150
 cold right from the Sunday people 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.250
 still not rise because I still did 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.200
 cold and it's the first day that already eleven 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.770
 the morning and we have people enjoying 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.270
 she 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.820
 good the pool that has as I said 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.160
 before the swan neck as a spa 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.010
 and a jet of this is to swim to 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.260
 exactly countercurrent and this is the 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.060
 point we indicate this way of meeting for 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.350
 celebrate what a party is 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.970
 San Juan, what have you prepared? 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.380
 we go there because everybody 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.119
 think the bonfires but we have already said 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.830
 before these wood and gobela like 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.930
 that is not going to be going to be complicated was 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.690
 it's complicated here we can can put together 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.030
 a good a good problem then what 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.580
 you have organized is another tradition of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.160
 the night of san juan and the day of san 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.770
 Juan who is 24 who is the one who collects 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.080
 a series of plants besides that has 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.100
 qualities for health during that 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.069
 night is supposed to power all 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.300
 yes theoretically the word verbena of 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.100
 san juan were born because there is a 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.870
 plant is called verbena together with the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.730
 clover and the valerian that was collected the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.350
 San Juan night and a verbena was made 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.060
 and some broths with this valerian because 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.350
 just that night he had everything all his 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.870
 qualities and all their effects 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.610
 then you give to all 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.050
 clients because yes the pool of 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.180
 moment only for the clients because it is 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.500
 little girl for now if we do not know in the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.150
 future but for now for clients 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.069
 because if it really is a pool, 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.630
 very big then we can 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.540
 find with an overbooking are where 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.769
 we are in a future will be studied 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.870
 probably good at the moment for 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.060
 make this pool you have to be clients 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.650
 the prices of the room how much for 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.780
 let's get an idea right now 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.300
 we will be around 130 140 euros 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.620
 per double room and at night because 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.709
 he already says that tourists do not come 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.519
 of good outside we said before that what 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.470
 is offered is valerian verbena and three 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.870
 volleyball and are three plants that are 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.280
 they picked up that particular night in the 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.540
 in which rand was collected and that's why 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.850
 comes the word is the verbena that 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.140
 picked up on the night of the 24th and then with 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.490
 broths she did and said that 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.680
 properties 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.930
 they were especially powerful at night 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.090
 of San Juan, since you already know one 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.280
 original idea to celebrate whoever 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.810
 today and go to collect verbena I do not know in 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.750
 where a little mother will be collected well 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.640
 neither verbena clover and or valerian and 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.440
 if not then a bag to take it 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.150
 we are going to celebrate it like this now 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.510
 I 'm going to ask you to put me to me 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.030
 a verbena for trying a form we say 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.560
 originals of celebrating the night of san 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.710
 Juan who has no chance to leave 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.660
 to lift with a bonfire or some of 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.370
 those celebrations are magical that 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.350
 they have and we are going to finish with this image 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.350
 apart from the verbena that will serve me 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.450
 to me of this wonderful pool that we 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.280
 It gives a tremendous envy and tourists 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.280
 As you can see, they are taking advantage now 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.650
 arrival of summer 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.510
 send the fire through the water in this case 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.020
 to celebrate san juan thank you very much 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.020
