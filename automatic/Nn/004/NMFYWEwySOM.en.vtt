00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
one of the most common used hitting

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.590 
one of the most common used hitting
phrases<00:00:35.440> around<00:00:35.740> the<00:00:35.860> cage<00:00:36.130> is<00:00:36.670> get<00:00:37.240> inside

phrases around the cage is get inside
the<00:00:37.750> baseball<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.470> get<00:00:39.160> inside<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.580> baseball

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
the baseball and get inside the baseball

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.490 
the baseball and get inside the baseball
to<00:00:40.210> me<00:00:40.330> is<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.600> equivalent<00:00:41.050> of<00:00:41.080> a<00:00:41.170> pitching

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
to me is the equivalent of a pitching

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.410 
to me is the equivalent of a pitching
coach<00:00:41.530> telling<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.190> to<00:00:42.310> throw<00:00:42.550> strikes<00:00:42.910> it's

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
coach telling you to throw strikes it's

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.740 
coach telling you to throw strikes it's
obvious<00:00:43.960> I<00:00:44.430> also<00:00:45.430> compare<00:00:45.760> this<00:00:45.910> to<00:00:46.180> a<00:00:46.210> math

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
obvious I also compare this to a math

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.840 
obvious I also compare this to a math
teacher<00:00:47.110> giving<00:00:47.830> you<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.010> answer<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.580> very

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
teacher giving you the answer to a very

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
process on how to get there and then

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.820 
process on how to get there and then
telling<00:00:52.960> you<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:53.140> do<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.410> rest<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.710> the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
telling you to do the rest of the

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.430 
telling you to do the rest of the
assignment<00:00:54.220> yourself<00:00:54.750> getting<00:00:55.750> inside<00:00:56.170> the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
assignment yourself getting inside the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.830 
assignment yourself getting inside the
baseball<00:00:56.890> is<00:00:57.160> always<00:00:57.879> achieved<00:00:58.480> if<00:00:58.780> the

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
baseball is always achieved if the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.320 
baseball is always achieved if the
hitter<00:00:59.230> is<00:00:59.379> in<00:00:59.500> sequence<00:00:59.980> so<00:01:00.760> teaching<00:01:01.210> the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
hitter is in sequence so teaching the

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.660 
hitter is in sequence so teaching the
sequence<00:01:01.809> of<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.350> swing<00:01:02.680> from<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.100> ground<00:01:03.400> up

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
sequence of the swing from the ground up

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.480 
sequence of the swing from the ground up
and<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.449> loading<00:01:04.900> unloading<00:01:05.140> process<00:01:05.800> of<00:01:06.369> the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
and the loading unloading process of the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.249 
and the loading unloading process of the
body<00:01:06.700> will<00:01:07.000> always<00:01:07.330> keep<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.660> hitter<00:01:07.840> inside

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
body will always keep the hitter inside

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.830 
body will always keep the hitter inside
so<00:01:09.190> what<00:01:09.369> hitting<00:01:09.610> coaches<00:01:09.910> tend<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.479> do<00:01:10.630> is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
so what hitting coaches tend to do is

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.840 
so what hitting coaches tend to do is
focus<00:01:11.200> on<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.740> contact<00:01:12.280> portion<00:01:12.640> of<00:01:12.729> the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
focus on the contact portion of the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.999 
focus on the contact portion of the
swing<00:01:13.119> telling<00:01:13.900> hitters<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.290> get<00:01:14.500> inside<00:01:14.830> the

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
swing telling hitters to get inside the

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.440 
swing telling hitters to get inside the
baseball<00:01:15.190> with<00:01:15.550> their<00:01:15.700> hands<00:01:16.060> without

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
baseball with their hands without

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.780 
baseball with their hands without
getting<00:01:17.320> them<00:01:17.470> through<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.830> process<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.580> the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
getting them through the process of the

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.180 
getting them through the process of the
sequence<00:01:19.210> what<00:01:20.050> this<00:01:20.229> leads<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.649> is<00:01:20.800> hitters

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
sequence what this leads to is hitters

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.889 
sequence what this leads to is hitters
that<00:01:21.340> typically<00:01:21.820> push<00:01:22.210> their<00:01:22.450> hands<00:01:22.660> on<00:01:22.840> our

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
that typically push their hands on our

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.960 
that typically push their hands on our
upper<00:01:23.200> body<00:01:23.380> dominant<00:01:23.950> this<00:01:24.580> leads<00:01:24.850> to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
upper body dominant this leads to

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.730 
upper body dominant this leads to
hitters<00:01:25.210> early<00:01:25.660> committing<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.290> ball<00:01:26.470> and

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
hitters early committing to the ball and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.260 
hitters early committing to the ball and
committing<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.640> ball<00:01:27.790> before<00:01:28.090> they<00:01:28.180> get

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
the pitch was hitting coaches that are

her to push his hands and telling them
how<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.130> get<00:02:24.340> inside<00:02:24.700> often<00:02:25.510> means<00:02:25.690> we're

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
how to get inside often means we're

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.600 
how to get inside often means we're
going<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.989> swing<00:02:26.350> from<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.620> top<00:02:26.950> down<00:02:27.310> and

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
going to swing from the top down and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.280 
going to swing from the top down and
you're<00:02:28.000> going<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.180> lose<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.720> kinetic<00:02:29.170> energy

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
you're going to lose the kinetic energy

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.440 
you're going to lose the kinetic energy
transfer<00:02:30.130> from<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.610> biggest<00:02:30.910> muscles<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
transfer from the biggest muscles of the

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.800 
transfer from the biggest muscles of the
body

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
body

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.039 
body
the<00:02:32.200> legs<00:02:32.500> into<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.489> core<00:02:33.760> feeding<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.810> upper

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
the legs into the core feeding the upper

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.140 
the legs into the core feeding the upper
body<00:02:35.230> arms<00:02:35.829> and<00:02:36.040> then<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.400> whip<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.970> bat

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
body arms and then the whip of the bat

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.660 
body arms and then the whip of the bat
so<00:02:37.810> we're<00:02:38.140> going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.290> swing<00:02:38.709> with<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.220> lot<00:02:39.520> more

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
so we're going to swing with a lot more

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.699 
so we're going to swing with a lot more
force<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.360> muscle<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:40.810> lot<00:02:41.020> more<00:02:41.200> effort<00:02:41.380> in

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
force and muscle a lot more effort in

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.380 
force and muscle a lot more effort in
the<00:02:41.800> upper<00:02:42.040> body<00:02:42.220> with<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.910> lot

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
the upper body with a lot

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.870 
the upper body with a lot
bat<00:02:43.630> speed<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.470> it's<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.680> big<00:02:44.890> drawback<00:02:45.250> when<00:02:45.790> we

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
bat speed so it's a big drawback when we

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.910 
bat speed so it's a big drawback when we
tell<00:02:46.090> hitters<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.480> get<00:02:46.630> inside<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.290> they<00:02:47.740> end

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
tell hitters to get inside and they end

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.699 
tell hitters to get inside and they end
up<00:02:48.040> pushing<00:02:48.990> finally<00:02:49.990> there<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.200> very<00:02:50.530> little

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
up pushing finally there is very little

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.860 
up pushing finally there is very little
barrel<00:02:51.220> whip<00:02:51.490> or<00:02:51.730> delivery<00:02:52.209> for<00:02:52.450> hitters<00:02:52.720> that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
barrel whip or delivery for hitters that

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
barrel whip or delivery for hitters that
push<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:53.380> way

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
push this way

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.040 
push this way
they<00:02:54.190> often<00:02:54.400> stay<00:02:54.940> inside<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.600> ball<00:02:55.630> very

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
they often stay inside the ball very

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.930 
they often stay inside the ball very
well<00:02:56.140> but<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:56.950> barrel<00:02:57.220> stays<00:02:57.340> in<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.730> lag

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
well but the barrel stays in the lag

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.580 
well but the barrel stays in the lag
position<00:02:58.540> for<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> bit<00:02:59.020> longer

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
position for a bit longer

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.710 
position for a bit longer
these<00:02:59.860> guys<00:03:00.100> are<00:03:00.340> typically<00:03:00.850> right-center

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
these guys are typically right-center

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.780 
these guys are typically right-center
field<00:03:02.050> type<00:03:02.410> hitters<00:03:02.770> with<00:03:03.250> very<00:03:03.490> little

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
field type hitters with very little

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.220 
field type hitters with very little
force<00:03:04.060> behind<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> ball<00:03:04.690> you'll<00:03:04.870> often<00:03:05.050> see

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
force behind the ball you'll often see

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.190 
force behind the ball you'll often see
the<00:03:05.470> ball<00:03:05.620> flaring<00:03:06.160> off<00:03:06.250> so<00:03:07.240> for<00:03:07.480> us<00:03:07.630> we<00:03:07.990> want

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
the ball flaring off so for us we want

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.140 
the ball flaring off so for us we want
to<00:03:08.260> teach<00:03:08.440> hitters<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.920> get<00:03:09.190> inside<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.000> ball

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
to teach hitters to get inside the ball

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.120 
to teach hitters to get inside the ball
the<00:03:10.330> correct<00:03:10.660> way<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.500> do<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.770> by<00:03:11.950> being

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
the correct way and you do that by being

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.430 
the correct way and you do that by being
in<00:03:12.340> sequence<00:03:12.760> teach<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.239> process<00:03:13.480> teach<00:03:14.170> how

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
in sequence teach the process teach how

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.590 
in sequence teach the process teach how
to<00:03:14.500> be<00:03:14.680> in<00:03:14.800> sequence<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.520> as<00:03:15.970> for<00:03:16.300> me<00:03:16.450> as<00:03:16.570> a

to be in sequence and as for me as a
hitting<00:03:16.900> instructor<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.500> never<00:03:18.070> have<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.489> tell

hitting instructor I never have to tell
a<00:03:18.730> hitter<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.330> get<00:03:19.450> inside<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.900> ball<00:03:20.050> because

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
a hitter to get inside the ball because

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.500 
a hitter to get inside the ball because
they<00:03:20.920> always<00:03:21.310> will<00:03:21.580> be<00:03:21.790> if<00:03:22.000> you're<00:03:22.420> in
