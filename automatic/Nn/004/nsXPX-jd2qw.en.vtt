00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.710
 it is still under study the new occupant of the car is more dangerous 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.710
 that driving drunk or under the influence of drugs 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.880
 may seem like an attitude in traffic but distraction for a few seconds 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.829
 can cause serious accidents 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.480
 I directed that talking on the phone does not combine 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.930
 worse when you are writing text messages to the reader and this can 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.539
 Distraction in traffic can be fatal 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.480
 according to research by the British research laboratory on transport 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.719
 explains Ariel and there was the message that this sweet dollar while driving a 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.660
 car is more dangerous than driving drunk or under the influence of drugs. 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.140
 use of portable devices 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.520
 Chris hill tragically and look away from the street with the road creates the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.630
 false sensation tike in these few minutes nothing will happen to drive that 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.280
 uses an electronic device often strips the driver's weight with 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.130
 he also has less control over the machine. 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.010
 is using a hand to handle the appliance 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.750
 how does this lack of attention of the driver work when the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.720
 driving use stated in the message three men 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.930
 to such driving should not be 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.270
 shared no other activity 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.720
 therefore the driver must keep both hands on the steering wheel 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.240
 with a Brazilian transit pair 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.270
 and not divide this tension told afp no other activity this is a 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.189
 problem that happens worldwide 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.570
 around 32 countries including Brazil have laws restricting the use of 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.950
 mobile handsets in the direction of the mobile phone industry including 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.670
 manufacturers of handsets and some internet tickets supports the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.740
 efforts to ban sms in transit what is missing and 

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:43.810
 awareness by drivers of the Institute of 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.630
 Virginia Tech University in the United States have found that the use of 

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:52.959
 text messaging at the time of driving and make more distraction than 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.520
 cellular the only object 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.530
 one in five drivers even sending text messages over the cell phone 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.900
 while driving in Brazil we still do not have this statistic if we attack 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.440
 talk about the increasing number of accidents caused by the use of 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.189
 cerol crop 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.189
 encountered some accidents that have been increasing teaching 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.989
 the recklessness of the drivers of the UN 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.899
 by cellphone 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:20.769
 the fractions of a second 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.959
 will meet a war scenario cosmic years receive messaging happens this 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.440
 very big and the city so this has caused some accidents the study 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.769
 discovered that skill only makes a point of 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.029
 distance of 40 g other vehicles 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.079
 is worse than that of motors and under the influence of drugs 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.689
 the results of this research 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.719
 shows how dangerous it is to drive that type a text 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.029
 in reality the use of text messages is incompatible with security the 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.879
 this combination of factors results in a loss in 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.909
 reaction and in the control of the vehicle put the driver at greater risk of 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.729
 who have consumed the legal limit of alcohol generally so we are 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.519
 guiding drivers and passengers and collisions when they are using 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.299
 electronic devices are aggravated 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.749
 has been notable in the statistics with higher incidence day 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:15.149
 accidents caused by people use exercise to overcome 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:19.349
 I go for example motorcyclist and the ride on the growth all will receive 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.379
 training at your side the conscious traffic consulting firm of our 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.699
 partnership in many areas 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.439
 made a test track where we show how it works the direction was 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.589
 that associates dollar to single as it will work that destiny the case the first 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:34.239
 stop the show 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.030
 from the statement making use of both hands correctly as he drove 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.499
 Let's do it the wrong way. 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:49.749
 took in brings no joy and many had customarily vtv staff but triggered 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:51.859
 we will know salary 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.699
 nuno valente in the field and image will come out besides overturning several cones the 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.230
 car even more with the wheels during braking 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.420
 the fact of splitting being mature and steering can be tragic so 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.590
 we set up a circuit follows and during the whole time we were accompanied by 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.040
 professionals who will provide 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.060
 the result is expected some points being barred after the test showing 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.780
 that it really becomes difficult the act of driving that took a phone call and that 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.000
 situation may be even worse as it is not in 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 you think it's comfortable to send the message 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.059
 therefore the connection 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.059
 a show with pride to do in irs 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.930
 we built with years ago 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.729
 now they will try to leave 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.689
 could be the bumper of the car in front some past paints 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.830
 there would have already been a collision 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.189
 with illegal passages each 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.849
 make your message fish botafogo is a much safer way 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.990
 during the direction any second the defense the request can be fatal 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.780
 so avoid diverting concentration and ensure your control over the 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.939
 car is much safer 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:15.419
 you saw during the test who uses the cell phone I dropped some icons everything 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.419
 done in greater safety but this on the street 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.220
 could be a victim
