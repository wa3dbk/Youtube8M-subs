be checked from the side from above or

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.919 
be checked from the side from above or
below<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:37.429> fine-tune<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.179> positioning<00:01:38.810> of

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
below to fine-tune the positioning of

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.420 

the<00:01:49.300> fact<00:01:49.690> that<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.050> orientation<00:01:50.650> planes<00:01:51.160> are

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
the fact that the orientation planes are

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.790 
the fact that the orientation planes are
shown<00:01:51.640> also<00:01:52.030> makes<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.420> easier<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.930> align<00:01:53.560> the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
shown also makes it easier to align the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.910 
shown also makes it easier to align the
model<00:01:54.070> properly<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.930> once<00:01:59.230> the<00:01:59.470> model<00:01:59.830> is

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
model properly so once the model is

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.710 
model properly so once the model is
aligned<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.580> can<00:02:00.760> be<00:02:00.880> constructed<00:02:01.600> and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
aligned it can be constructed and

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.980 
aligned it can be constructed and
changed<00:02:02.290> as<00:02:02.470> normal<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.070> Zurich<00:02:06.660> we<00:02:07.660> now<00:02:07.810> have

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
changed as normal in Zurich we now have

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.600 
changed as normal in Zurich we now have
the<00:02:08.110> advantage<00:02:08.619> that<00:02:08.650> we<00:02:08.980> can<00:02:09.100> actually

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
the advantage that we can actually

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.520 
the advantage that we can actually
assess<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.000> construction<00:02:10.810> in<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.020> context

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
assess the construction in the context

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.500 
assess the construction in the context
of<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.740> patient<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.550> can<00:02:12.940> therefore<00:02:13.150> better

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
of the patient and can therefore better

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.150 
of the patient and can therefore better
assess<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.170> effect<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.740> tools<00:02:15.010> that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
assess the effect of the tools that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.670 
assess the effect of the tools that
we're<00:02:15.430> using<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.600> case<00:02:16.870> for<00:02:17.110> instance<00:02:17.140> we

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
we're using in this case for instance we

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.370 
we're using in this case for instance we
use<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.130> symmetry<00:02:18.700> tool<00:02:18.970> or<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:20.200> group<00:02:20.470> tool

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
use the symmetry tool or the group tool

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.050 
use the symmetry tool or the group tool
this<00:02:23.380> allows<00:02:23.710> us<00:02:23.740> to<00:02:23.980> change<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.550> entire
