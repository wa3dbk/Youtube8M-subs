booster<00:00:20.220> again<00:00:20.689> anyways<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.260> a

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
booster again anyways this is just a

quick way of checking the performance of
the<00:00:29.150> vacuum-assisted<00:00:30.150> brake<00:00:30.750> booster<00:00:30.929> you're

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the vacuum-assisted brake booster you're

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.569 
the vacuum-assisted brake booster you're
gonna<00:00:31.320> find<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.710> most<00:00:31.890> vehicles<00:00:31.949> found

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
gonna find on most vehicles found

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.490 
gonna find on most vehicles found
everywhere<00:00:33.510> some<00:00:33.780> are<00:00:35.180> some<00:00:36.290> have<00:00:37.290> different

type<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> operations<00:00:38.520> most<00:00:39.030> vehicles<00:00:39.890> today

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
type of operations most vehicles today

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.760 
type of operations most vehicles today
have<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.180> vacuum-assisted<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.500> just

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
have just this vacuum-assisted it just

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.520 
have just this vacuum-assisted it just
uses<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> brake<00:00:44.430> power<00:00:45.149> booster<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.289> got<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
uses a brake power booster it's got a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.330 
uses a brake power booster it's got a
diaphragm<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.739> what<00:00:49.739> happens<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.219> basically

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
diaphragm and what happens is basically

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.450 
diaphragm and what happens is basically
when<00:00:50.820> your<00:00:50.969> engines<00:00:51.360> running<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:53.309> have

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
when your engines running you have

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.010 
when your engines running you have
vacuum<00:00:53.910> coming<00:00:54.210> from<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> engine<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.840> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
vacuum coming from the engine to the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.779 
vacuum coming from the engine to the
other<00:00:55.170> side<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.559> diaphragm<00:00:56.309> when<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.579> push

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
other side this diaphragm when you push

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.849 
other side this diaphragm when you push
down<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.690> pushes<00:00:58.050> down<00:00:58.199> also<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
down on this it pushes down also on the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.950 
down on this it pushes down also on the
master<00:00:59.160> cylinder<00:00:59.340> through<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> piston<00:01:00.210> but

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
master cylinder through the piston but

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.310 
master cylinder through the piston but
to<00:01:01.260> help<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.620> piston<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.309> help<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:04.110> push

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
to help that piston and help to to push

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.649 
to help that piston and help to to push
this<00:01:04.470> down<00:01:04.530> easier<00:01:05.220> when<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.210> push<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.600> down

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
this down easier when you push this down

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.320 
this down easier when you push this down
it<00:01:07.530> relieves<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.220> valve<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> valve

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it relieves the valve and the valve

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.780 
it relieves the valve and the valve
allows<00:01:09.840> air<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.200> come<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.710> way<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.159> then

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
allows air to come in this way and then

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
allows air to come in this way and then
it<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.960> allows<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.400> suction<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.600> suck<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.130> so

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it it allows the suction to suck it so

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.850 
it it allows the suction to suck it so
it<00:01:17.430> basically<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.330> helps<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.619> don't

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it basically it just helps so you don't

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
it basically it just helps so you don't
have<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> push<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.310> hard<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.060> thing<00:01:21.299> when

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
have to push so hard on this thing when

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.190 
have to push so hard on this thing when
you're<00:01:22.610> when<00:01:23.610> you're<00:01:23.729> braking<00:01:24.210> because

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
you're when you're braking because

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.600 
you're when you're braking because

they don't want to have to put tons of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.140 
they don't want to have to put tons of
force<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.509> their<00:01:33.720> pedal<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.610> brake<00:01:35.640> pedal

get the rule every time I pump up and
down<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:24.790> should<00:04:25.270> raise<00:04:26.230> it<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.530> little<00:04:26.800> bit

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
down it should raise it a little bit

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.790 
down it should raise it a little bit
higher<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.790> reserve<00:04:28.350> see<00:04:29.350> now<00:04:29.500> it<00:04:29.650> won't

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
higher to the reserve see now it won't

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.490 
higher to the reserve see now it won't
go<00:04:29.950> down<00:04:30.130> as<00:04:30.310> far<00:04:30.340> now<00:04:31.210> even<00:04:31.900> won't<00:04:32.020> go<00:04:32.170> down<00:04:32.350> as

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
go down as far now even won't go down as

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.360 
go down as far now even won't go down as
far<00:04:32.530> now<00:04:32.950> it's<00:04:33.160> nice<00:04:33.670> and<00:04:33.910> tight<00:04:35.370> basically

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
far now it's nice and tight basically

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.710 
far now it's nice and tight basically
what's<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:36.760> doing<00:04:37.120> is<00:04:37.240> checking<00:04:37.450> the

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
what's that doing is checking the

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.010 
what's that doing is checking the
powerful<00:04:38.200> power<00:04:39.160> brake<00:04:39.490> booster<00:04:39.660> when<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.720> had

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
powerful power brake booster when I had

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.630 
powerful power brake booster when I had
it<00:04:41.170> like<00:04:41.320> this<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:41.920> started<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.490> vehicle

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
it like this and I started the vehicle

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.120 
it like this and I started the vehicle
and<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.210> went<00:04:43.420> down<00:04:43.630> that's<00:04:44.410> telling<00:04:44.890> me<00:04:44.920> that

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
and it went down that's telling me that

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.980 
and it went down that's telling me that
this<00:04:45.280> thing<00:04:45.340> is<00:04:45.670> getting<00:04:45.850> vacuumed<00:04:46.360> it's

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
this thing is getting vacuumed it's

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.220 
this thing is getting vacuumed it's
telling<00:04:47.380> me<00:04:47.470> that<00:04:47.620> it's<00:04:47.800> working<00:04:47.980> properly

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
telling me that it's working properly

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.320 
telling me that it's working properly
after<00:04:50.230> I<00:04:50.290> start<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.680> stop<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.280> vehicle<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.880> I

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
after I start to stop the vehicle and I

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.590 
after I start to stop the vehicle and I
hold<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.660> like<00:04:52.840> this<00:04:53.790> and<00:04:54.790> it<00:04:55.360> raises

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
hold it like this and it raises

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.650 
hold it like this and it raises
basically<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.800> first<00:04:56.980> pump<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:58.030> goes<00:04:58.270> all<00:04:58.600> the

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
basically the first pump it goes all the

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.659 
basically the first pump it goes all the
way<00:04:58.810> down<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.320> then<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.919> more<00:05:00.070> pump<00:05:00.340> it<00:05:00.460> keeps

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
way down and then the more pump it keeps

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.110 
way down and then the more pump it keeps
going<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:02.080> goes<00:05:02.260> it<00:05:03.010> raises<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.610> higher<00:05:03.790> higher

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
going it goes it raises it higher higher

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.230 
going it goes it raises it higher higher
this<00:05:04.390> way<00:05:04.570> so<00:05:05.410> it'll<00:05:05.710> be<00:05:05.830> down<00:05:06.010> here<00:05:06.040> then<00:05:06.970> when

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
this way so it'll be down here then when

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.300 
this way so it'll be down here then when
I<00:05:07.270> pump<00:05:07.540> it<00:05:07.660> it'll<00:05:07.900> go<00:05:08.020> up<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:08.470> pump<00:05:08.980> it<00:05:09.070> again

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
I pump it it'll go up I pump it again

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.540 
I pump it it'll go up I pump it again
it'll<00:05:09.490> go<00:05:09.700> up<00:05:09.730> like<00:05:10.540> that<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.140> that<00:05:12.130> tells<00:05:12.430> you

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
it'll go up like that and that tells you

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.230 
it'll go up like that and that tells you
also<00:05:12.730> that<00:05:13.060> that<00:05:13.320> that<00:05:14.320> it's<00:05:14.530> sealing

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
also that that that it's sealing

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.130 
also that that that it's sealing
properly<00:05:16.240> um<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:18.419> basically<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.900> final

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
properly um and basically the final

right there that's the final check you

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.920 
right there that's the final check you
need<00:05:59.110> to<00:05:59.320> check<00:05:59.530> the<00:05:59.710> power<00:06:00.580> booster<00:06:01.120> brake

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
need to check the power booster brake

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.250 
need to check the power booster brake
power<00:06:02.140> booster

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
power booster

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.730 
power booster
if<00:06:04.040> at<00:06:04.310> this<00:06:04.520> moment<00:06:04.730> with<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.090> vehicle<00:06:05.450> off

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
if at this moment with the vehicle off

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.990 
if at this moment with the vehicle off
iComfort<00:06:06.740> like<00:06:06.980> this<00:06:07.160> then<00:06:07.400> I<00:06:07.430> hold<00:06:07.700> it<00:06:07.880> like

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
iComfort like this then I hold it like

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.670 
iComfort like this then I hold it like
this<00:06:08.180> if<00:06:08.450> it<00:06:08.720> starts<00:06:09.020> going<00:06:09.170> farther<00:06:09.500> and

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
this if it starts going farther and

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.650 
this if it starts going farther and
farther<00:06:09.860> farther<00:06:10.220> farther<00:06:10.910> and<00:06:11.180> down<00:06:11.390> like

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
farther farther farther and down like

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.690 
farther farther farther and down like
that<00:06:11.840> then<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:12.830> might<00:06:13.010> have<00:06:13.190> some<00:06:13.430> kind<00:06:13.550> of

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
that then you might have some kind of

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.200 
that then you might have some kind of
leak<00:06:13.910> in<00:06:14.120> the<00:06:14.810> system<00:06:15.200> so<00:06:16.070> uh<00:06:16.100> at<00:06:16.910> that<00:06:16.970> point

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
leak in the system so uh at that point

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.570 
leak in the system so uh at that point
you'd<00:06:17.570> want<00:06:17.840> to<00:06:17.930> check<00:06:18.200> the<00:06:18.620> the<00:06:18.980> hoses<00:06:19.430> and

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
you'd want to check the the hoses and

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.500 
you'd want to check the the hoses and
everything<00:06:19.700> and<00:06:20.180> it<00:06:20.750> might<00:06:20.900> be<00:06:20.930> a<00:06:22.510> problem

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
everything and it might be a problem

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.130 
everything and it might be a problem
with<00:06:23.720> the<00:06:24.020> booster<00:06:24.380> itself<00:06:24.860> um<00:06:26.140> oftentimes

with the power booster because it's

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.340 
with the power booster because it's
connected<00:06:31.490> to<00:06:31.580> the<00:06:31.670> vacuum<00:06:31.850> itself<00:06:32.390> you<00:06:33.170> might

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
connected to the vacuum itself you might

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.590 
connected to the vacuum itself you might

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
p01 74 or 72 you might get a lien code

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.050 
p01 74 or 72 you might get a lien code
you're<00:06:41.600> getting<00:06:41.840> a<00:06:41.930> lien<00:06:42.170> code<00:06:43.060> because

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
you're getting a lien code because

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.060 
you're getting a lien code because
basically<00:06:44.570> when<00:06:44.720> you<00:06:44.810> pump<00:06:45.050> it<00:06:45.230> right<00:06:45.830> here

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
basically when you pump it right here

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.800 
basically when you pump it right here
it's<00:06:46.280> letting<00:06:46.700> air<00:06:46.970> in<00:06:47.180> through<00:06:47.480> the<00:06:47.630> back

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
it's letting air in through the back

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.140 
it's letting air in through the back
user<00:06:48.260> too<00:06:48.890> much<00:06:49.070> air<00:06:49.340> and<00:06:49.610> then<00:06:49.730> your<00:06:49.910> your

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
user too much air and then your your

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.140 
user too much air and then your your
engine<00:06:50.660> sees<00:06:50.930> that<00:06:51.080> as<00:06:51.290> as<00:06:51.560> a<00:06:52.550> lean<00:06:52.910> condition

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
engine sees that as as a lean condition

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.090 
engine sees that as as a lean condition
because<00:06:53.630> it's<00:06:53.780> letting<00:06:54.080> more<00:06:54.260> unmeet<00:06:54.770> or<00:06:54.890> air

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
because it's letting more unmeet or air

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.820 
because it's letting more unmeet or air
it's<00:06:55.520> unmetered<00:06:56.000> air<00:06:56.300> not<00:06:57.020> passing<00:06:57.650> through

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
it's unmetered air not passing through

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
it's unmetered air not passing through
the<00:06:57.890> mass<00:06:58.040> airflow<00:06:58.280> sensor

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:58.850 
the mass airflow sensor

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.330 
the mass airflow sensor
getting<00:06:59.270> through<00:06:59.450> there<00:06:59.600> so<00:07:00.470> thanks<00:07:01.250> for
