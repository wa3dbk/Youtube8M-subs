00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.899

 this sum we get 1 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.789
 that's eight dead 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.300
 two stations of the park 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 except that these differences an association that says 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.770

 note, however, 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.530
 all my first games 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.580

 I invested myself the premises undergo erosion 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.670
 still a good time that the back 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.300
 so he's really top 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.130

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.400
 what I'm doing very well 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.760
 I take the whole tournament 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.760
 these investments 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.050
 I hope 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.700
 but at least once 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.449
 beaten on his chair at his payroll 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.879
 why fashion 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.209
 - find the stable solution when he counts the sub for them 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.569
 I do not exactly know very well in housekeeping 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.829

 tonight evening 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.089

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.399

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.389
 40a 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.389
