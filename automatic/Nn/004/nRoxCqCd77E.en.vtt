00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.080 

it's<00:00:06.960> out<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.200> order<00:00:07.550> yes<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.670> can<00:00:08.820> read<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
it's out of order yes I can read the

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.030 
it's out of order yes I can read the
sign<00:00:09.120> I'm<00:00:09.420> just<00:00:09.630> pondering<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.349> implications

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
sign I'm just pondering the implications

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.990 
sign I'm just pondering the implications
I<00:00:12.830> think<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.160> implies<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.880> elevator

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
I think it implies that the elevator

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.230 
I think it implies that the elevator
doesn't<00:00:15.480> work<00:00:17.900> again<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.439> read<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.740> sign

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
doesn't work again I can read the sign

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.609 
doesn't work again I can read the sign
but<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.359> sign<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.810> taper<00:00:22.020> covered<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.560> a

but the sign of the taper covered with a

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.650 
but the sign of the taper covered with a
layer<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:23.010> dust<00:00:23.279> which<00:00:23.640> indicates<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
layer of dust which indicates that the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.570 
layer of dust which indicates that the
elevator<00:00:24.689> has<00:00:25.230> been<00:00:25.439> non-functional<00:00:26.340> for<00:00:26.550> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
significant amount of time which

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.410 
significant amount of time which
suggests<00:00:28.410> either<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.189> remarkable<00:00:29.939> passivity

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
suggest that many who go into the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.219 
suggest that many who go into the
Performing<00:02:05.040> Arts<00:02:05.610> suffer<00:02:06.030> from<00:02:06.180> an<00:02:06.390> external

Performing Arts suffer from an external

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.130 
Performing Arts suffer from an external
locus<00:02:07.470> of<00:02:07.830> identity<00:02:11.360> yeah<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.810> don't<00:02:12.959> know<00:02:13.020> what

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
locus of identity yeah I don't know what

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.920 
locus of identity yeah I don't know what
that<00:02:13.230> means

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
that means

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.990 
that means
well<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.050> means<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.350> value<00:02:16.920> yourself<00:02:17.100> only<00:02:17.730> as

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
well it means you value yourself only as

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000 
well it means you value yourself only as
others<00:02:18.450> value<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.290> which<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.650> often<00:02:19.950> the
