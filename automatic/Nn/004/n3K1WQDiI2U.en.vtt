00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
Chevron case because I really think the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.469 
Chevron case because I really think the
Chevron<00:01:23.549> which<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> white<00:01:24.119> one<00:01:24.270> would

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
Chevron which is the white one would

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.840 
Chevron which is the white one would
look<00:01:24.659> great<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> white<00:01:25.500> iPhone<00:01:25.850> and

pretty<00:01:27.090> much<00:01:27.150> would<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.320> look

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
front part of the case that it is a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.280 
front part of the case that it is a
two-part<00:02:52.830> case<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.210> very<00:02:54.930> easy<00:02:55.170> to

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
two-part case and it's very easy to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.190 
two-part case and it's very easy to
apply<00:02:55.710> onto<00:02:56.130> your<00:02:56.580> iPhone<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.930> doesn't

mean<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.800> comes<00:02:59.340> off<00:02:59.520> easily<00:02:59.760> it<00:03:00.060> stays

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
mean that it comes off easily it stays

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.900 
mean that it comes off easily it stays
on<00:03:00.600> very<00:03:00.630> well<00:03:01.110> for<00:03:01.320> being<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.740> really<00:03:02.370> thin

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910

it's<00:03:41.700> incredibly<00:03:42.180> thin<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.430> now<00:03:44.520> we're

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
it's incredibly thin and so now we're

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.430 
it's incredibly thin and so now we're
going<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.760> apply<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.720> all<00:03:46.020> you<00:03:46.140> have<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.320> do

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
going to apply it so all you have to do

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.630 
going to apply it so all you have to do
is<00:03:46.680> peel<00:03:47.670> off<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.120> plastic<00:03:48.240> which<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.870> inside

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
is peel off the plastic which is inside

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.300 
is peel off the plastic which is inside
just<00:03:50.640> like<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.360> as<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.320> can<00:03:52.380> see<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:52.830> then

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
just like that as you can see and then

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.550 
just like that as you can see and then
you<00:03:53.460> can<00:03:53.610> place<00:03:53.880> your<00:03:53.910> phone<00:03:54.330> inside<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.410> it

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
before that does not mean that it's

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.940 
before that does not mean that it's
really<00:04:44.669> easy<00:04:44.700> to<00:04:44.940> take<00:04:45.180> off<00:04:45.389> like<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:45.960> said<00:04:46.139> this

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
really easy to take off like I said this

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.590 
really easy to take off like I said this

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
is not a sticker you can't just peel it

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.550 
is not a sticker you can't just peel it
off

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
off

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.409

and it's not easy to take off you know
it's<00:04:54.780> not<00:04:54.930> like<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:56.040> it's<00:04:56.340> impossible<00:04:56.790> to

it's not like you it's impossible to

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.390 
it's not like you it's impossible to
take<00:04:57.060> off<00:04:57.240> but<00:04:57.480> it<00:04:57.750> stays<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.260> pretty<00:04:58.320> well<00:04:58.740> so

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
take off but it stays on pretty well so

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.790 
take off but it stays on pretty well so
I<00:04:59.430> used<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.150> case<00:05:00.780> for<00:05:01.050> around<00:05:01.230> 15<00:05:01.650> minutes

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
think the wood and the chevron would

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.760 
think the wood and the chevron would
look<00:05:41.280> great<00:05:41.520> too<00:05:41.870> so<00:05:42.870> I<00:05:43.200> was<00:05:43.440> just<00:05:43.470> blown<00:05:43.740> away

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.020 
by the design of it I really truthfully
I<00:05:46.530> had<00:05:46.740> lower<00:05:46.919> expectations<00:05:47.580> for<00:05:47.669> this<00:05:47.760> case

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
I had lower expectations for this case

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.050 
I had lower expectations for this case
but<00:05:48.300> after<00:05:48.600> using<00:05:48.780> it<00:05:48.990> it<00:05:49.260> is<00:05:49.440> amazing<00:05:49.979> for<00:05:50.280> the
