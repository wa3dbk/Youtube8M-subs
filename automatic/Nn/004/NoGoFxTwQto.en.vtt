00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.320
 hello it's hard to say when 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.720
 first appeared dick our apartments 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.480
 it was a long time ago but it was a dick 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.560
 beautiful wooded when she started 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.360
 blossom all the neighbors resorted to admire 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.119
 over this plant and enjoy 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.000
 smell this plant but time is running 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.949
 implacably new varieties appear but to 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.550
 Sorry our region get a new one 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.220
 Honey variety 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.980
 very difficult if someone on some 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.320
 exhibition bought a small stalk 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.180
 or mailed he tries 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.610
 I can not express that of course 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.210
 big tragedy and today tell you how 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.440
 to grow soybeans properly 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.230
 above all, they decided to buy 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.320
 think about such a stalk 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.780
 place so what soon how does it 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.420
 growing there are varieties that grow 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.920
 like little bushes but there are such varieties 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.229
 how here is our she is so small 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.630
 compact bush she curly us very 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.640
 you will not be competently everything depends on 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.610
 your apartment and what a shuttle you 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.740
 managed to get take a small 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.710
 cutting but better today one 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.720
 several cuttings because when we 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.460
 we put a little pot a few pieces 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.820
 it starts esthete more spectacle 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.450
 much nicer nicely but we cut 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.450
 twitching 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.810
 which the landing students break off the bottom 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.820
 2 leaves on each stem under 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.439
 with running water we wash this this 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.840
 cherenochki since they are not so far away 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.909
 sticky he juice after this brion root 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.399
 and 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.979
 here's the tips of this puppy dipped in 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:58.409
 this powder to not faster 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.549
 we have rooted omit kaledin here 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.689
 if our cherenochka 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.299
 Further we plant any ground or not 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.390
 Fill a glass of water and land or 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.610
 in perlite and vermiculite is a good capacious 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.930
 substrate in which the plant is very fast 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.299
 puts roots 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.630
 in this substrate me nutrients 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:21.739
 due to this very fast datacenter we 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.739
 plant a pot 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.440
 and after we planted laying 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.860
 or the film I wrote a fan package 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.860
 or just need to build a mini greenhouse 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.900
 for these cuttings and find the very light 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.030
 to a warm place the thing is that 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.310
 hoya likes a lot of light on doesn't like 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.560
 direct sunlight and blueberries are also 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.650
 love a lot of light they quickly let 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.069
 roots on a bright place for two or three 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.269
 weeks, the first root appears 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.000
 novice flower growers still sushi and water 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.930
 plant a bush mass cups to be visible 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 there were roots 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.950
 then you transplant them into 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.410
 little potty 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.290
 Here I will pot the pot on a lot 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.660
 less than they grow with me so 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.260
 as hoya in the first year does not like big 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.360
 pot 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.579
 a little pot spent on very 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.910
 fast field quiet 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.709
 only as the earthy coma dries 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.380
 she does not like water she likes very much 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.459
 the more light will be light on not accept 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.489
 sun rays 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.349
 the faster she blooms often heard 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.269
 complaints that water correctly 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.280
 feeds find the brightest 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.160
 place for some reason does not want to grow 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.829
 bring together you know every grower there 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.579
 my secret for my being she 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.790
 annually 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.440
 i keep i cool in winter in summer and 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.069
 our fresh air is not a nail 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.940
 trees 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.650
 she blooms me every year I wish you find 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.480
 cuttings of such a plant 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.220
 admire the flowering of this plant 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.220
 annually goodbye
