00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
ring space off better instead of follow

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.679 
ring space off better instead of follow
us<00:02:04.500> around<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.950> if<00:02:05.130> George<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.790> moving<00:02:06.329> he's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
got to just put the ring space off here

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.570 
got to just put the ring space off here
okay<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.479> economical<00:02:10.259> with<00:02:10.530> these<00:02:10.709> jobs<00:02:11.069> but

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
okay be economical with these jobs but

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.979 
okay be economical with these jobs but

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
just could the ring space off basically

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.800 
just could the ring space off basically
rather

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810

you<00:03:17.859> couldn't<00:03:18.130> do<00:03:18.280> that<00:03:18.310> yeah<00:03:19.239> but<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.630> need

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
you couldn't do that yeah but I need

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.900 
you couldn't do that yeah but I need
what<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.350> time<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.650> did<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.130> ninth<00:03:21.370> round<00:03:21.670> he

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
what the time I did the ninth round he

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.910 
what the time I did the ninth round he
was<00:03:22.030> all<00:03:22.120> over<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.359> place<00:03:22.600> but<00:03:23.170> what<00:03:23.410> I<00:03:23.650> didn't

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
was all over the place but what I didn't

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.150 
was all over the place but what I didn't
have<00:03:23.950> i<00:03:24.250> 100%<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.540> think<00:03:26.140> he<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.859> going<00:03:27.070> to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
have i 100% I think he is going to

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.620 
have i 100% I think he is going to
probably<00:03:27.310> be<00:03:27.459> down<00:03:27.820> but<00:03:28.060> he's<00:03:28.120> gonna<00:03:28.329> stop<00:03:28.510> and

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
probably be down but he's gonna stop and

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.720 
probably be down but he's gonna stop and
lay<00:03:28.750> on<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:29.140> think<00:03:29.829> for<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.010> first<00:03:30.040> light<00:03:30.549> for

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
lay on I think for the first light for

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.190 
lay on I think for the first light for
the<00:03:30.790> earth<00:03:30.940> for<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.269> early<00:03:31.510> round<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.930> agree

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
the earth for the early round I agree

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.229 
the earth for the early round I agree
yeah<00:03:32.560> groves<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.190> gonna<00:03:33.370> be<00:03:33.549> on<00:03:33.640> top<00:03:33.910> or<00:03:33.940> not

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
yeah groves is gonna be on top or not

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.360 
yeah groves is gonna be on top or not
well<00:03:34.510> not<00:03:34.720> on<00:03:34.810> top<00:03:34.989> just<00:03:35.200> nicking<00:03:35.620> around<00:03:35.890> and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
well not on top just nicking around and

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.250 
well not on top just nicking around and
late<00:03:36.579> on<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.850> with<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.000> key<00:03:37.239> for<00:03:37.630> success<00:03:37.780> for

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
late on it with a key for success for

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.750 
late on it with a key for success for
groves<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.739> definitely<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.250> movement<00:03:39.670> but

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
groves is definitely the movement but

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.550 
groves is definitely the movement but
it's<00:03:39.910> how<00:03:40.090> long<00:03:40.420> he<00:03:40.600> can<00:03:40.630> keep<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:41.079> going<00:03:41.319> and

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
it's how long he can keep it going and

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.720 
it's how long he can keep it going and
only<00:03:41.829> that<00:03:42.010> he's<00:03:42.190> got<00:03:42.340> out<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.549> mental

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
only that he's got out of the mental

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.050 
only that he's got out of the mental
strength<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.540> keep<00:03:44.049> a<00:03:44.530> much<00:03:45.160> stronger<00:03:45.549> man<00:03:45.910> at

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
strength to keep a much stronger man at

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.870 
strength to keep a much stronger man at
bay<00:03:46.299> for<00:03:46.690> 12<00:03:46.959> rounds<00:03:47.079> and<00:03:47.530> that's<00:03:47.799> that's<00:03:48.579> the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
bay for 12 rounds and that's that's the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.090 
bay for 12 rounds and that's that's the
real<00:03:49.090> task<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:50.170> he's<00:03:50.290> got<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.680> do<00:03:50.859> and

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
real task that he's got to do and

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.250 
real task that he's got to do and
there's<00:03:51.670> no<00:03:51.819> real<00:03:52.060> signs<00:03:52.359> in<00:03:52.630> his<00:03:52.750> career<00:03:53.049> as

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
there's no real signs in his career as

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.140 
there's no real signs in his career as
yet<00:03:53.530> he's<00:03:53.709> never<00:03:53.889> been<00:03:54.100> tested<00:03:54.459> he's<00:03:54.970> never

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
yet he's never been tested he's never

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.819 
yet he's never been tested he's never
been<00:03:55.329> in<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.510> territory<00:03:55.959> this<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.620> why<00:03:56.769> it's

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
been in that territory this is why it's

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.500 
been in that territory this is why it's
a<00:03:56.950> big<00:03:57.100> question<00:03:57.519> mark<00:03:57.549> over<00:03:57.910> George<00:03:58.239> Groves

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
a big question mark over George Groves

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.349 
a big question mark over George Groves
think<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.959> big<00:03:59.170> key<00:03:59.500> is<00:04:00.220> George<00:04:00.670> gets<00:04:00.970> off<00:04:01.180> to

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
think the big key is George gets off to

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.349 
think the big key is George gets off to
a<00:04:01.420> good<00:04:01.600> start<00:04:01.660> if<00:04:02.530> cow<00:04:03.400> gets<00:04:03.760> him<00:04:04.000> early<00:04:04.329> and

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
a good start if cow gets him early and

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.539 
a good start if cow gets him early and
nails<00:04:04.750> him<00:04:05.019> I<00:04:05.200> think<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.859> know<00:04:05.980> George<00:04:06.220> could

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
nails him I think you know George could

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.059 
nails him I think you know George could
could<00:04:07.030> could<00:04:07.060> crumble<00:04:07.720> if<00:04:08.290> he<00:04:08.500> gets<00:04:08.709> off<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.040> a

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
could could crumble if he gets off to a

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.099 
could could crumble if he gets off to a
good<00:04:09.280> start<00:04:09.340> makes<00:04:09.970> him<00:04:10.180> misuse<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.750> movement

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
good start makes him misuse the movement

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.539 
good start makes him misuse the movement
and<00:04:11.170> puts<00:04:11.380> maybe<00:04:11.590> two<00:04:11.799> or<00:04:11.829> three<00:04:11.950> rounds<00:04:12.459> under

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
and puts maybe two or three rounds under

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.490 
and puts maybe two or three rounds under
the<00:04:12.730> bag<00:04:12.910> I<00:04:13.120> think<00:04:13.510> George's<00:04:13.989> confidence

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
the bag I think George's confidence

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.319 
the bag I think George's confidence
could<00:04:14.709> grow<00:04:14.980> and<00:04:15.310> he<00:04:15.579> could<00:04:15.760> warm<00:04:16.000> into<00:04:16.299> the

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
could grow and he could warm into the

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.520 
could grow and he could warm into the
fight<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:16.810> know<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.049> that<00:04:17.169> land<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.500> could
