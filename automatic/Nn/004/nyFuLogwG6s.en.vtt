think<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> lot<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.719> other<00:00:39.899> people<00:00:40.020> said<00:00:40.260> this

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
think a lot of other people said this

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.260 
think a lot of other people said this
but<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:41.129> isn't<00:00:41.399> exactly<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:42.000> we're<00:00:42.180> going

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
but this isn't exactly what we're going

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.380 
but this isn't exactly what we're going
to<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.989> what's<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.800> our<00:00:43.829> wish<00:00:44.100> list
