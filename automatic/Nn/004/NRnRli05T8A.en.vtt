00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.679
 Hello everyone, Michael, I have not been long 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:17.050
 I could hear very sorry for that 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:18.820
 sorry i want to start the series 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.980
 micro jig issues 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.640
 This will be the first release which will 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.169
 Dedicated to the overview tackle 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.439
 tackle on microjig 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.320
 and what do we need for this to succeed 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.920
 catch on microjig like this dressed 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.879
 and the current 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.100
 Now I am writing in more detail 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.680
 directly by my example 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.579
 that is, I will show you what set 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.039
 gear set 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.320
 such a set of nastya namely I catch 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.010
 and what angle did I prepare for 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.600
 this year so what do we need for 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.410
 successful fishing on microjig 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.840
 This is a standard set that is spinning 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.950
 coil cord well and no i don't take water of the hour 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.490
 consumables 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.950
 that's as far as my mean for me 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.049
 spinning is still the same from that year it's 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.689
 bluebird favorite with dough 0 5 5 grams 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.880
 I currently have three coils of it 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.970
 An old kind shaman who never 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.619
 did not let down then his cross and new 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.409
 the coil that was purchased in this 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.909
 For the year they will not speak so far as 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.189
 not yet tried in catching how 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.670
 Please just try to take you further 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.540
 in sensations so a little cord 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.500
 cord means I have 01 by our standards 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.729

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.810
 blue color I'm all this year 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.540
 interesting try it it will be it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.310
 three-core flat means cross section 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:06.430

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.520

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.580
 say the winter version but I'm still 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.170
 I plan to catch probably start with 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.770
 small probably all the same okushkov 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.050
 That was not quite the Flyura course 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.930
 I still get more thick then 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.250
 there is a fit 014 0 16 Carbon 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.770
 great for fishing 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.830

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.990
 consumables that is, it sinker hooks and 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:40.210

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:46.820

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.010

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.770

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.730
 under the winter spinners very well they 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.700

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.430
 on my left side I loaded right 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.070
 me hooks all of them by numbers in different 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.489
 cells so that it is convenient to extract them 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.810
 let's say with quick installation and so 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.630
