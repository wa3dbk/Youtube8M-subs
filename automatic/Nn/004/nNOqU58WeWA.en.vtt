example with the farmer and the autumn
and<00:02:55.290> spring<00:02:55.410> grain<00:02:55.860> suggest<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.820> there<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.209> a

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
and spring grain suggest that there is a

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.170 
and spring grain suggest that there is a
process<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:58.140> development<00:02:59.010> there<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.790> growth

and<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:01.590> know<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.220> theory<00:03:02.930> but<00:03:03.930> when

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
and we know this in theory but when

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.920 
and we know this in theory but when
we're<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> pressure<00:03:05.790> when<00:03:06.360> we<00:03:06.540> are<00:03:06.600> over
