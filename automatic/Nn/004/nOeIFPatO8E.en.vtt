00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:19.780
 the person who prevent this is the bet 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.680
 to work with the Soviet model knife 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.700

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.210

00:03:45.820 --> 00:04:28.260
 Normal cimpor in 2011 but it is an average of 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.720
 almost a knife 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:36.070

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:42.310
 wood for her too 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:44.980
 she has both she made the temper 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.190

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.570

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.850
 team 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.290

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:26.920
 here is more useful in the woods and is if 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.910
 this model that is very perfect I think 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.560
 that this really Soviet model 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.560
 really stepped forward 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.820
 is a very perfect template for scrap 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.940
 into the bush 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:45.940
