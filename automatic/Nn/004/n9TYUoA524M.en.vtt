here<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.070> test<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.259> construction

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
here and test you know construction

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.889 
here and test you know construction
scenarios<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.009> how<00:01:53.220> does<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.460> driver<00:01:53.899> safely

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
scenarios so how does a driver safely

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.139 
scenarios so how does a driver safely
get<00:01:55.110> through<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.560> construction<00:01:56.130> zone<00:01:56.579> when

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
get through this construction zone when

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.880 
get through this construction zone when
all<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> sudden<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.810> pedestrian<00:01:58.350> pops<00:01:58.560> out

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
all of a sudden of pedestrian pops out

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.289 
all of a sudden of pedestrian pops out
and<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.460> that's<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.729> they<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:00.210> at

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and so that's what they have here at

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.090 
and so that's what they have here at
this<00:02:00.390> facility<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.170> these<00:02:01.259> robots<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
this facility they have these robots and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.730 
this facility they have these robots and
and<00:02:02.250> dummies<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.570> pedestrian<00:02:04.259> will<00:02:04.350> pop<00:02:04.560> out

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and dummies so a pedestrian will pop out

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.620 
and dummies so a pedestrian will pop out
at<00:02:04.920> any<00:02:04.979> moment<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:05.729> they'll<00:02:05.939> teach<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
at any moment and then they'll teach the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.499 
at any moment and then they'll teach the
car<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.469> actually<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.829> car<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.220> learn<00:02:08.550> while

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
car and actually the car can learn while

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.910 
car and actually the car can learn while
it's<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.780> these<00:02:09.929> courses<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.590> areas<00:02:10.890> like

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
it's on these courses in in areas like

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.309 
it's on these courses in in areas like
this<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.610> really<00:02:11.910> cool<00:02:12.090> downtown<00:02:12.989> part

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
this this is a really cool downtown part

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.490 
this this is a really cool downtown part
of

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.160 
of
the<00:02:13.560> Astros<00:02:14.010> 0<00:02:14.220> facility<00:02:14.940> okay<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.140> just

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
the Astros 0 facility okay so you just

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.200 
the Astros 0 facility okay so you just
saw<00:02:16.500> how<00:02:16.740> Volvo<00:02:17.190> Tessa's<00:02:17.640> cars<00:02:17.940> for

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
saw how Volvo Tessa's cars for

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.970 
saw how Volvo Tessa's cars for
autonomous<00:02:18.690> driving<00:02:18.930> at<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.440> Astra<00:02:19.740> zero

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
autonomous driving at the Astra zero

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.430 
autonomous driving at the Astra zero
track<00:02:20.700> now<00:02:20.970> we're<00:02:21.240> here<00:02:21.480> at<00:02:21.660> headquarters<00:02:21.900> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
track now we're here at headquarters and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.930 
track now we're here at headquarters and
we're<00:02:22.560> going<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.740> watch<00:02:22.920> how<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.760> actually

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
we're going to watch how it actually

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.800 
we're going to watch how it actually
tests<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.830> xc90<00:02:25.830> for<00:02:26.280> safety<00:02:26.670> when<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.600> rolls

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
tests is xc90 for safety when it rolls

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.360 
tests is xc90 for safety when it rolls
into<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.080> ditch<00:02:28.350> or<00:02:28.590> actually<00:02:28.950> hits<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.190> ditch

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
into a ditch or actually hits a ditch

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.890 
into a ditch or actually hits a ditch
and<00:02:29.550> you're<00:02:29.940> going<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> see<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.360> cars<00:02:30.570> behind

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
and you're going to see the cars behind

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.330 
and you're going to see the cars behind
me<00:02:31.170> right<00:02:31.260> here<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.590> going<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.770> hit<00:02:31.830> 50<00:02:32.010> miles

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
me right here it's going to hit 50 miles

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.580 
me right here it's going to hit 50 miles
an<00:02:32.520> hour<00:02:32.640> run<00:02:33.360> into<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.690> ditch<00:02:33.870> behind<00:02:34.110> me<00:02:34.470> and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
an hour run into the ditch behind me and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.500 
an hour run into the ditch behind me and
then<00:02:34.740> crash<00:02:35.130> pretty<00:02:35.880> much<00:02:36.060> right<00:02:36.270> where<00:02:36.300> I'm

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
then crash pretty much right where I'm

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.900 
then crash pretty much right where I'm
standing<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.320> we<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:37.650> saw<00:02:37.890> was<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> xc90

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
standing so we just saw was the xc90

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.300 
standing so we just saw was the xc90
coming<00:02:39.510> through<00:02:39.870> 50<00:02:40.470> miles<00:02:40.650> an<00:02:40.800> hour<00:02:40.890> hit<00:02:41.220> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
coming through 50 miles an hour hit the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.610 
coming through 50 miles an hour hit the
ditch<00:02:41.720> jumped<00:02:42.720> out<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.990> ditch<00:02:43.110> as<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.380> saw

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
ditch jumped out of the ditch as you saw

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.550 
ditch jumped out of the ditch as you saw
and<00:02:43.860> then<00:02:43.920> settle<00:02:44.340> behind<00:02:44.820> me<00:02:45.000> right<00:02:45.209> now

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
and then settle behind me right now

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.199 
and then settle behind me right now
against<00:02:46.560> another<00:02:46.800> embankment<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.910> spoke

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
against another embankment and I spoke

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.340 
against another embankment and I spoke
with<00:02:48.239> one<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.630> engineers<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.200> what

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
with one of the engineers and what

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.190 
with one of the engineers and what
happened<00:02:49.950> basically<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.970> looks<00:02:51.720> like<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> car

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
happened basically is looks like the car

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.990 
happened basically is looks like the car
might<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:52.500> total<00:02:53.040> he's<00:02:53.220> not<00:02:53.370> completely<00:02:53.820> sure

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
might be total he's not completely sure

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.699 
might be total he's not completely sure
but<00:02:54.180> something<00:02:54.720> probably<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.320> insurance

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
but something probably the insurance

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.660 
but something probably the insurance
company's<00:02:55.980> going<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.160> want<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.310> take<00:02:56.459> care<00:02:56.610> of

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
company's going to want to take care of

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.729 
company's going to want to take care of
thankfully<00:02:57.480> though<00:02:57.570> everybody<00:02:57.959> inside<00:02:58.140> he

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
thankfully though everybody inside he

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.350 
thankfully though everybody inside he
thinks<00:02:59.100> would<00:02:59.520> probably<00:02:59.910> have<00:03:00.000> walked<00:03:00.239> away

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
thinks would probably have walked away

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.870 
thinks would probably have walked away
from<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.690> accident<00:03:01.489> entirely<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.670> looked

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
from that accident entirely so I looked

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.090 
from that accident entirely so I looked
at<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> car<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.840> had<00:03:03.989> both<00:03:04.230> airbags<00:03:04.470> deployed

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
at the car you had both airbags deployed

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.590 
at the car you had both airbags deployed
you<00:03:05.280> also<00:03:05.489> had<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.700> curtain<00:03:06.000> side<00:03:06.209> airbag

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
you also had the curtain side airbag

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.110 
you also had the curtain side airbag
deployed<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.350> then<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.190> infant<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.970> back

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
deployed and then the infant in the back

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.630 
deployed and then the infant in the back
seat<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.420> 18<00:03:09.720> month<00:03:09.900> old<00:03:10.140> was<00:03:10.890> protected<00:03:11.459> with

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
seat the 18 month old was protected with

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.060 
seat the 18 month old was protected with
the<00:03:11.820> rear-facing<00:03:12.390> seat<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.680> seems<00:03:13.890> like

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
the rear-facing seat and it seems like

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.710 
the rear-facing seat and it seems like
everybody<00:03:14.489> would<00:03:14.940> walk<00:03:15.120> away<00:03:15.300> from<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.570> that

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
everybody would walk away from this that

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.140 
everybody would walk away from this that
this<00:03:15.840> was<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.080> real-world<00:03:16.320> test<00:03:16.910> ok<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
this was a real-world test ok so the

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.320 
this was a real-world test ok so the
xc90<00:03:18.750> is<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.080> first<00:03:19.670> xc90<00:03:20.670> model<00:03:21.180> that

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
xc90 is the first xc90 model that

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.240 
xc90 is the first xc90 model that
Volvo's<00:03:21.690> completely<00:03:22.230> redesigned<00:03:22.799> in<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
Volvo's completely redesigned in the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.910 
Volvo's completely redesigned in the
last<00:03:23.430> 12<00:03:23.820> years<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:25.140> got<00:03:25.290> improved<00:03:25.560> tech

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
last 12 years it's got improved tech
