okay guys getting pretty far along with

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.550 
okay guys getting pretty far along with
the<00:00:05.370> antec<00:00:05.730> 400<00:00:06.390> mil<00:00:06.569> here<00:00:06.930> so<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.170> thought<00:00:07.379> I'd

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
the antec 400 mil here so I thought I'd

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.370 
the antec 400 mil here so I thought I'd
uh<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:08.040> show<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.870> waterfall

reservoir I've got the jumper power
supply<00:00:13.740> i<00:00:13.799> use<00:00:14.240> hooked<00:00:15.240> up<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.750> pump<00:00:16.139> into

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
supply i use hooked up to the pump into

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.640 
supply i use hooked up to the pump into
the<00:00:16.560> lights<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.070> everything<00:00:18.140> okay<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.199> there

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
the lights and everything okay so there

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.519 
the lights and everything okay so there
we<00:00:19.680> go<00:00:20.240> now<00:00:21.240> right<00:00:21.570> now<00:00:21.779> I've<00:00:21.930> got<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.260> pump

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
we go now right now I've got the pump

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.320 
we go now right now I've got the pump
turned<00:00:22.890> way<00:00:23.220> down<00:00:23.250> low<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> variable

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
turned way down low it's a variable

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.050 
turned way down low it's a variable
speed<00:00:24.570> pump<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:25.109> when<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.949> high<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
speed pump because when it's on high the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.259 
speed pump because when it's on high the
effect<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.630> almost<00:00:27.990> overwhelming<00:00:29.060> you<00:00:30.060> turn

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
effect is almost overwhelming you turn

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.340 
effect is almost overwhelming you turn
on<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.449> light<00:00:30.720> yet<00:00:32.120> now<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.390> not<00:00:33.750> dyed

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
on the light yet now this is not dyed

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.889 
on the light yet now this is not dyed
water<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.920> just<00:00:35.160> regular<00:00:35.460> old<00:00:35.670> Kepler<00:00:38.600> or<00:00:39.600> do

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
water it's just regular old Kepler or do

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.250 
water it's just regular old Kepler or do
here<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:41.030> zoom<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.239> there<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
here is a zoom in there so you can get a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.619 
here is a zoom in there so you can get a
good<00:00:44.210> view<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.210> I'll<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.510> I'll

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
good view of it and what I'll do is I'll

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.450 
good view of it and what I'll do is I'll
dial<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.050> speed<00:00:52.410> up<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.770> down<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.280> can

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
dial the speed up and down and you can

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.090 
dial the speed up and down and you can
see<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.570> difference<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.170> also<00:00:55.590> i'll<00:00:55.710> cut<00:00:55.920> off

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
see the difference and also i'll cut off

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.720 
see the difference and also i'll cut off
the<00:00:57.079> shop<00:00:58.079> light<00:00:58.379> there<00:00:58.649> since<00:00:59.219> we'll<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the shop light there since we'll get a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.149 
the shop light there since we'll get a
better<00:01:00.859> picture<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.100> it

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
better picture of it

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.779 
better picture of it
pretty<00:01:04.909> entertaining<00:01:05.420> as<00:01:05.689> it<00:01:05.869> is<00:01:06.020> but<00:01:06.789> get

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:07.789 
pretty entertaining as it is but get

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:17.140 
pretty entertaining as it is but get
over<00:01:07.880> here

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.020 

that's<00:01:18.010> all<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.280> way<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.450> very<00:01:20.480> lowest

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
that's all the way to the very lowest

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.330 
that's all the way to the very lowest
set

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.430 

truly<00:01:28.340> hard<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.990> see<00:01:29.990> in<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.350> dark<00:01:30.380> do<00:01:31.010> this

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
truly hard to see in the dark do this

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:45.849 
truly hard to see in the dark do this
that's<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.680> most

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:45.859 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.459 

here<00:01:46.859> we<00:01:46.979> jacking<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.899> that's<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.320> way

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
here we jacking it up that's all the way

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.249 
here we jacking it up that's all the way
to<00:01:50.429> the<00:01:50.549> lowest<00:01:50.759> okay<00:01:51.299> that's<00:01:51.509> Louis<00:01:51.960> like

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
to the lowest okay that's Louis like

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.740 
to the lowest okay that's Louis like
then

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.380 

so<00:01:56.410> that<00:01:56.650> works<00:01:56.860> like

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
so that works like

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.660 
so that works like
the<00:01:58.810> water<00:01:59.140> she's<00:01:59.440> barely<00:01:59.740> flowing<00:02:00.340> over<00:02:00.460> a

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
the water she's barely flowing over a

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.240 
the water she's barely flowing over a
furry<00:02:00.970> mellow<00:02:01.750> hardly<00:02:02.170> makes<00:02:02.350> any<00:02:02.470> noise<00:02:02.620> like

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
furry mellow hardly makes any noise like

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.960 
furry mellow hardly makes any noise like
that<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:04.570> should<00:02:04.870> turn<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.200> up<00:02:05.550> if<00:02:06.550> we<00:02:06.760> get<00:02:06.940> a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
that we should turn it up if we get a

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.699 
that we should turn it up if we get a
good<00:02:08.490> flow<00:02:09.490> right<00:02:09.819> over<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:11.370> waterfall<00:02:13.709> we

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
good flow right over the waterfall we

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.920 
good flow right over the waterfall we
can<00:02:14.890> jack<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.610> sucker<00:02:15.940> all<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.360> way<00:02:16.450> up

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:29.210 

that's<00:02:19.930> what<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.230> pump<00:02:21.330> absolutely<00:02:23.400> blasted

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.310 

what's<00:02:30.220> happening<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.030> water<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.780> hitting

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
what's happening is the water is hitting

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.180 
what's happening is the water is hitting
that<00:02:32.470> first<00:02:32.920> shelf<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:35.110> then<00:02:35.350> bouncing<00:02:36.070> up

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
that first shelf and then bouncing up

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.500 
that first shelf and then bouncing up
off<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:37.000> top<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.870> reservoir<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.850> hitting

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
off the top of the reservoir and hitting

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.940 
off the top of the reservoir and hitting
the<00:02:40.540> filled<00:02:41.140> court<00:02:43.050> step<00:02:44.050> that<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.560> put<00:02:44.830> in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
the filled court step that I put in

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.790 
the filled court step that I put in
there<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:46.230> blasting<00:02:47.230> off<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
there and blasting off of that and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.449 
there and blasting off of that and
creating<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.340> really<00:02:48.400> interesting<00:02:50.459> not

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
creating this really interesting not

00:02:51.459 --> 00:03:11.520 
creating this really interesting not
like<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.019> pretty<00:02:53.019> cool<00:02:54.420> closer<00:02:55.420> to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.510 

the<00:03:12.530> light<00:03:12.770> off<00:03:14.140> if<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.320> was<00:03:15.470> just<00:03:15.500> died<00:03:16.040> water

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
the light off if it was just died water

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.220 
the light off if it was just died water
that<00:03:16.820> would<00:03:16.940> still<00:03:17.210> look<00:03:17.300> pretty<00:03:17.480> cool<00:03:20.230> light

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
that would still look pretty cool light

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.980 
that would still look pretty cool light
on<00:03:21.530> that's<00:03:22.400> just<00:03:22.700> some<00:03:22.850> LEDs<00:03:23.330> underneath<00:03:23.810> it

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
on that's just some LEDs underneath it

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.890 
on that's just some LEDs underneath it
going<00:03:24.200> through<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.440> piece<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.620> frosted<00:03:25.250> acrylic

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
going through a piece of frosted acrylic

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.620 
going through a piece of frosted acrylic
spreads<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.020> light<00:03:27.230> up<00:03:27.410> real<00:03:27.680> nice<00:03:28.420> back<00:03:29.420> it

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
spreads the light up real nice back it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.020 
spreads the light up real nice back it
up<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.840> little<00:03:29.990> bit<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:30.380> can<00:03:30.730> get<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.880> whole

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030
