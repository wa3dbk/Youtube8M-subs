00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.130
 there are very good soil we are here in 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.690
 minecraft to make a new tutorial 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.460
 of networks tonci before I start I have 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.960
 to apologize for this absence 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.940
 who has these last two weeks 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.890
 basically it 's the most together of exams 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.859
 end with other things if I could not 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.510
 record anything and well today we continue with 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.039
 the leston tutorials and today we're going to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.920
 see a pretty interesting tutorial 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.359
 high we are here no I do not want to throw 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.280
 because if I'm not going to do a lot of damage 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.079
 yes that to use my new system of descent 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.809
 and what I'm seeing is surfing 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.170
 in the air if the descent system is 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.390
 how to see is a surfboard like me 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.250
 I call it basically it's very simple 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.070
 here we have the system that makes it 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.839
 which is a pulse limiter with two 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.729
 repeaters are a bit more with law and 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.620
 another with less what allows this is 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.500
 that sends a small pulse of the plate 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.469
 of pressure and this first the first one this one 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.570
 he understands it and the other one takes it away 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.820
 client to create a very sheet 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.710
 small water as we can see and clear 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.899
 if we go down bank we do not make ourselves 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.030
 damage that is very useful for example for 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.409
 adventure maps for for example 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.149
 we have a platform in the air 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.360
 we want to lower inverted and jumping 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.770
 stairs then use this system we went out 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.979
 and no button is pushed 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.049
 as we can see we go down without problem 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.579
 you have to be careful a lot in it 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.649
 because we can not fall but that the 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.020
 system is very simple if we are of 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.369
 Christmas well what materials like 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.039
 use projects are this is how 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.630
 move are very simple and easy to 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.610
 get and well let's start 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.350
 build it up here okay guys 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.929
 first let's make the platform 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.860
 where will the reston mechanism be worth 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:49.590
 we will put a repeater and so here 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.909
 we will put where we will pass perfect and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.720
 here we are going to make limited systems of 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.220
 pulse we put here the piston sand and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.789
 now we have to be is the inputs 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:04.439
 one here and another here this will be with more 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:06.600
 of law so perfect and this such that 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.600
 here we put a little 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.880
 well and now this is something here and here 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.770
 we put the special 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.020
 thinking must be put in a way 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.210
 that looks like this is here we put a 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.370
 cubito de agua and this we can already 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.100
 cover is already made the mechanism as 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.580
 we can observe now let's go to this like this 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.580
 so that it looks nice 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.629
 and we would have done the mechanism as 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.560
 we can see now I run around here 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.560
 let's do this longer 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.630
 so we run right here and as 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.870
 he throws the water plate and we go down 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.250
 suffering from the heights in case 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.230
 you ask what I'm going to try now in your 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.580
 rival so you can see that nothing happens 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.500
 well I'm instructing and we're going to 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.310
 try right now as you see it does not happen 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.570
 nothing you have to be careful of not 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.640
 move many professionals we can 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.040
 to fall and as we can see we arrived without 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.720
 do us any harm well this is the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.030
 reston tutorial of today I hope that you 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.160
 you liked it and well you know use taste 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.930
