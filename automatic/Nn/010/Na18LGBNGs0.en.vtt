00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
of the animal blood bank and it's was

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.220 
of the animal blood bank and it's was
started<00:00:16.699> just<00:00:16.939> out<00:00:17.210> of<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:17.630> development<00:00:18.170> of

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
started just out of the development of

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.100 
started just out of the development of
need<00:00:18.500> for<00:00:19.189> blood<00:00:19.820> for<00:00:20.119> our<00:00:20.150> patients<00:00:20.689> here<00:00:20.869> at

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
need for blood for our patients here at

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.310 
need for blood for our patients here at
Georgia<00:00:21.800> so<00:00:22.220> it<00:00:22.759> started<00:00:23.449> small<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:23.779> now<00:00:24.079> has

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
Georgia so it started small and now has

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.069 
Georgia so it started small and now has
expanded<00:00:24.500> to<00:00:24.949> where<00:00:25.220> it's<00:00:25.430> at<00:00:25.610> so<00:00:26.239> the<00:00:26.719> donors

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
expanded to where it's at so the donors

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.869 
expanded to where it's at so the donors
are<00:00:27.200> pretty<00:00:27.590> much<00:00:29.529> in-house<00:00:30.550> what<00:00:31.550> I<00:00:31.579> mean<00:00:31.759> by

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
using we use the exact same bags that we

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.200 
using we use the exact same bags that we
would<00:01:54.740> use<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.190> human<00:01:55.520> donation<00:01:56.030> and

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
would use in a human donation and

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.850 
would use in a human donation and
there's<00:01:56.510> a<00:01:56.600> set<00:01:56.990> amount<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.440> blood<00:01:57.620> that<00:01:57.740> you

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
there's a set amount of blood that you

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.040 
there's a set amount of blood that you
need<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:58.160> have<00:01:58.370> in<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.730> bag<00:01:58.940> because<00:01:59.810> there's

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
need to have in that bag because there's

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.800 
need to have in that bag because there's
a<00:02:00.760> anticoagulant<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:01.850> preservative<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:02.690> the

a anticoagulant and preservative in the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.270 
a anticoagulant and preservative in the
bag<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:03.440> have<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.890> have<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.100> correct

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
bag and you have to have the correct

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.460 
bag and you have to have the correct
ratios<00:02:04.760> can<00:02:04.970> we<00:02:05.060> centrifuge<00:02:05.660> it<00:02:05.810> down<00:02:05.990> and

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
ratios can we centrifuge it down and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.149 
ratios can we centrifuge it down and
then<00:02:06.650> we<00:02:06.890> divide<00:02:07.370> it<00:02:07.580> out<00:02:07.820> into<00:02:08.409> the<00:02:09.409> sizes

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
then we divide it out into the sizes

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.300 
then we divide it out into the sizes
