for<00:00:14.920> this<00:00:15.010> trail<00:00:15.309> we're<00:00:15.519> writing<00:00:15.790> and<00:00:16.270> that

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
for this trail we're writing and that

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.590 
for this trail we're writing and that
will<00:00:16.810> involve<00:00:17.080> changing<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:18.240> position<00:00:19.240> of

about 25 to 30 percent sag as measured

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.479 
about 25 to 30 percent sag as measured
by<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.420> o-ring<00:00:43.930> so<00:00:44.680> that's<00:00:44.890> all<00:00:45.040> ready<00:00:45.280> to<00:00:45.370> go

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
by the o-ring so that's all ready to go

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.549 
by the o-ring so that's all ready to go
we<00:00:46.390> just<00:00:46.540> want<00:00:46.690> to<00:00:46.780> make<00:00:46.809> sure<00:00:46.930> I'm<00:00:47.320> getting

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
we just want to make sure I'm getting

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.930 
we just want to make sure I'm getting
the<00:00:47.650> right<00:00:47.799> response<00:00:48.070> out<00:00:48.400> of<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.580> magic

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
the right response out of the magic

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.460 
the right response out of the magic
length<00:00:49.150> for<00:00:49.479> the<00:00:49.690> terrain<00:00:50.049> and<00:00:50.379> the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
length for the terrain and the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.520 
length for the terrain and the
conditions<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.129> were<00:00:51.250> writing<00:00:51.580> today<00:00:51.760> and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
conditions that were writing today and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.640 
conditions that were writing today and
so<00:00:53.760> start<00:00:54.760> by<00:00:54.879> climbing<00:00:55.299> up<00:00:55.420> this<00:00:55.570> hill<00:00:55.650> where

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
so start by climbing up this hill where

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.259 
so start by climbing up this hill where
the<00:00:56.769> magic<00:00:56.920> link<00:00:57.280> actually<00:00:57.699> will<00:00:57.850> be<00:00:58.000> staying

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
the magic link actually will be staying

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.000 
the magic link actually will be staying
in<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.570> forward<00:00:58.930> climbing<00:00:59.379> position<00:00:59.830> it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
in the forward climbing position it

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.119 
in the forward climbing position it
won't<00:01:00.250> be<00:01:00.400> activating<00:01:01.059> at<00:01:01.180> all<00:01:01.979> that'll<00:01:02.979> put

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
won't be activating at all that'll put

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.469 
won't be activating at all that'll put
me<00:01:03.159> in<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.460> better<00:01:03.610> climbing<00:01:04.030> position

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
me in the better climbing position

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.780 
me in the better climbing position
steeper<00:01:05.440> seat<00:01:05.650> angle<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.159> I'm<00:01:06.280> up<00:01:06.430> over<00:01:06.700> the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
steeper seat angle so I'm up over the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.510 
steeper seat angle so I'm up over the
bars<00:01:07.380> suitable<00:01:08.380> for<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.680> climb<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.159> then

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
bars suitable for the climb and then

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.940 
bars suitable for the climb and then
I'll<00:01:09.610> come<00:01:09.790> back<00:01:09.850> down<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.590> we'll<00:01:11.590> see<00:01:11.799> how

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
I'll come back down and we'll see how

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.859 
I'll come back down and we'll see how
the<00:01:12.010> magic<00:01:12.880> link<00:01:13.060> is<00:01:13.210> acting<00:01:13.570> through<00:01:13.750> this

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
the magic link is acting through this

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.539 
the magic link is acting through this
rough<00:01:14.080> section<00:01:14.380> of<00:01:14.590> trail<00:01:14.830> that<00:01:15.040> we've<00:01:15.189> picked
