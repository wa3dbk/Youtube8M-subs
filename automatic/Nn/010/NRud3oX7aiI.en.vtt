00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
I want to be good at blank and if it's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.420 
I want to be good at blank and if it's

it's making quilts or if it's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.859 
it's making quilts or if it's
photography<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.490> boils<00:02:05.909> down<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.090> doing<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
photography it all boils down to doing a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.290 
photography it all boils down to doing a
few<00:02:07.320> key<00:02:07.560> things<00:02:07.590> right<00:02:08.220> every<00:02:08.550> time<00:02:09.030> and

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
few key things right every time and

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.910 
few key things right every time and
understanding<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> elements<00:02:10.110> within<00:02:10.590> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
understanding the elements within that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.860 
understanding the elements within that
discipline<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.060> your<00:02:12.239> results<00:02:12.599> become

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
discipline so your results become

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.790 
discipline so your results become
predictable

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
predictable

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.130 
predictable
like<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.490> photography<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.330> tell<00:02:15.810> people<00:02:15.960> a

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
like in photography I tell people a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.540 
like in photography I tell people a
couple<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.830> things<00:02:17.040> they<00:02:17.190> need<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.370> think

couple of things they need to think
about<00:02:17.700> all<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:17.970> time<00:02:18.150> they<00:02:18.300> need<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.540> think

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
about all the time they need to think

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.270 
about all the time they need to think
about<00:02:18.810> light<00:02:19.140> first<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.680> foremost<00:02:20.070> whether
