00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.970
 my 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.320
 dummy children need only the first 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.170
 months of life she satisfies 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.490
 physiological need for sucking 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.230
 calms and helps to sleep 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.390
 if the baby requires a dummy in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.070
 waking state then it talks about 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.800
 the fact that he has excited the bark of the head 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.140
 brain and sucking up to 5 what does 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 relaxes the brain and the child calms down 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.899
 after three months for babies and 6 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120
 for the art of physiological nicknames 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.739
 need for sucking baby's dummies 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.829
 no longer now it becomes 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.679
 habit and harmful nipple interferes 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.190
 child to develop correctly because 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:50.039
 his brain on and active stage 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.399
 development and when he is awake 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.469
 he needs to look hear that is 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.899
 use all your five organs 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.469
 senses in order for the brain to develop 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.239
 well let's say well and when he 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.790
 waking state continues to suck 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.190
 dummy then what does he do except so 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.530
 relax your brain they burn on 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.090
 him some important necessary for 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.090
 he does not give him information 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.950
 how to get rid of this harmful 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.110
 habits gradually 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.780
 do not throw out the pacifier in the same 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.060
 the day when mom decided it was about time 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.710
 just take her out of sight of the child and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.770
 reach out only if 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.869
 baby asks for example at bedtime 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.479
 but at night a dummy in the mouth should 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.030
 be only for a while if 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.670
 baby starts to worry starts 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.579
 cry then you can carry it away 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.159
 huge range of switching into account 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.700
 this books are educational toys 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:57.930
 is to take the child to talk on the handle 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.880
 and the little ones need to be distracted with those 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.270
 who are older you can already agree 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.640
 Offer to give a cat dog pacifier 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.530
 a child who needs more or 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.170
 change for something valuable for example 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.989

 for a child is a big loss 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.670
 need to help him deal with these 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.349
