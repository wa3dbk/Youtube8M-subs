00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
the process of choosing the pattern well

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.500 
the process of choosing the pattern well
I<00:00:34.280> didn't<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.520> much<00:00:35.550> choice<00:00:35.969> because

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
I didn't really have much choice because

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
I didn't really have much choice because
ask<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.559> much<00:00:37.739> better<00:00:37.980> than<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.190> am<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
two longer patents so he left one of the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.280 
two longer patents so he left one of the

other two so I just decided to be the
one<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> best<00:00:43.980> artists<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.370> big

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
one that I was the best artists my big

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.670 
one that I was the best artists my big
fight<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> pick<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> Viper<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.620> do

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
fight so you pick the Viper so how do

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.250 
fight so you pick the Viper so how do
the<00:00:46.890> lines<00:00:47.100> play<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.059> Viper<00:00:48.239> pattern<00:00:48.660> well

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the lines play on the Viper pattern well

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.569 
the lines play on the Viper pattern well
it's<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> shorter<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.980> all<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> patterns

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
it's the shorter of all of the patterns

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.330 
it's the shorter of all of the patterns
so<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.449> my<00:00:51.600> ball<00:00:51.809> speed<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.170> quite<00:00:52.920> end<00:00:53.160> over

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
so with my ball speed and quite end over

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
so with my ball speed and quite end over
n<00:00:53.520> roll<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.059> seems<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.539> work<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:54.840> better<00:00:55.050> for

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
n roll it seems to work out better for

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.360 
n roll it seems to work out better for
me<00:00:55.289> than<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> longer<00:00:55.739> part<00:00:55.980> where<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.280> have

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
me than the longer part where you have

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610 
me than the longer part where you have
to<00:00:56.489> generate<00:00:56.699> more<00:00:57.030> hawk<00:00:57.210> down<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.109> Dom<00:00:58.379> how

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
to generate more hawk down and Dom how

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.920 
to generate more hawk down and Dom how
do<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.800> match<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.399> Viper<00:00:59.930> you're

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
do you match up to the Viper you're

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.569
