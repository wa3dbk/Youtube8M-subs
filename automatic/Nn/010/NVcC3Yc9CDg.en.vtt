00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.270
 revolverlab.com with an eye on technology 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.710
 nfc or as we affectionately call it 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.990
 bluetooth on steroid 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.990
 seemingly all modern wireless 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.980
 technologies solve all the necessary tasks 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.139
 and scenarios 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.980
 Why else is needed such an option as 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.170
 nfc 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 but it turned out not so simple 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.279
 Today I will talk about the differences and 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.050
 the advantages of nfc over bluetooth 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.760
 and you can draw conclusions about 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.010
 need it in your phone 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.380
 standard en and everything has perry modes 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.180
 Works for compatible devices mode 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.700
 peer toupper when both devices 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.920
 switches between active moment 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.620
 data transfer and passive mode 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.129
 the moment of receiving tanks reading mode and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 a record 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.390
 when an active smartphone connects with 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.250
 other reading devices 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.980
 information from it emulation mode 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.420
 bank card when smartphone prices are all 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.469
 can be used as 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.480
 smart cards 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.059
 or wireless bank card 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
 pay any fees and travel to 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 public transport 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.230
 you ask why you need nfc if there is 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.480
 bluetooth 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.850
 I will answer there are several important and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.770
 fundamental differences between these two 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.320
 let's compare technologies 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.040
 nfc and bluetooth first argument 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.670
 nfc 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.500
 he does not eat battery power 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.360
 more economical than bluetooth 40 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.330
 bluetooth low energy 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.130
 so nfc is the perfect technology for 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.229
 passive devices and not all transmits 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.439
 information is much slower than 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.380
 bluetooth max at 424 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.590
 kilobits per second bluetooth 21 does 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.329
 it's at a speed of two point one tenth 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.490
 megabits per second but nfc technology 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.770
 to establish a connection, you need only 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.320
 one tenth of a second so quickly able 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.810
 only bluetooth 40 and finally 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.479
 and one more major difference which 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 same time a key feature she is not all 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.110
 a field communications 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.360
 it's the ability to work recipients 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.120
 give data only on very close 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.160
 the distance 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.650
 between two devices which 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.570
 equipped with nfc chips maximum 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.060
 the distance at which it works for everything 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.860
 This is 10 centimeters as a rule and not all 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.960
 chips are located on the back cover 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.060
 smartphone or on its battery 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.640
 some operators are trying now 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.620
 integrate sim card into nfc chip 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.180
 physical need to bring closer 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.090
 devices to each other at the same time 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.980
 is an express identification method 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.320
 which eliminates the need for long 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.740
 pairing as opposed to technology 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.110
 bluetooth 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.300
 surely wouldn't shoot this video in 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.400
 mfc if i google guys 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.580
 it was they who first drew our attention 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.980
 the fact that with this technology your 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.700
 smartphone can be a great billing 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.520
 tool 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.070
 if before this through their google app 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.900
 hurts you tie your credit cards 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.370
 total to your smartphone 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.740
 distribution of this billing 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.600
 technology will be possible then when 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.780
 the main problem is solved 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.950
 smartphone user identification 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.410
 simply speaking how to ban 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.240
 pay with your smartphone if its 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.060
 stolen today the device is equipped 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.800
 nfc have become a convenient way to pay for travel. 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.110
 in public transport 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.330
 in the meantime, this technology is growing 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.760
 other useful features for example 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.110
 this use of others seemed you can 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.450
 program this tag 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.730
 feature set to your liking through 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.110
 special applications which list you 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.270
 find on our website 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.800
 place in such a label next to your 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.110
 desk and only 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.450
 by touching it with your smartphone you 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.880
 immediately turn on the set of necessary functions 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.600
 that will save you from long inclusions 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.150
 off and on 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.380
 each function individually or all of it 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.989
 future technology 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.120
 I am sure it will be applied in 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.250
 as electronic keys in a hotel 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.900
 or in the office you will use it 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.690
 to pay for travel in public 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.940
 transport or just for identification 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.530
 personalities now they are all on 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.870
 the initial stage of development of the frame 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.069
 or not will show the future keep up with 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.020
 modern technology 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.459
