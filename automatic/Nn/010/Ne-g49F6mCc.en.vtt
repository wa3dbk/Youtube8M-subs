louisvuitton bucket bag um the only

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.800 
louisvuitton bucket bag um the only
thing<00:01:04.920> about<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:06.030> only<00:01:06.360> came<00:01:06.689> with

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
thing about it is that it only came with

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.719 
thing about it is that it only came with
one<00:01:07.080> handle<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.400> did<00:01:08.520> was

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
one handle so what I did was

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.840 
one handle so what I did was
crisscrossed<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.770> inside<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.670> looks

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
crisscrossed it and inside it just looks

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.499 
crisscrossed it and inside it just looks
like<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:13.400> don't<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.670> bag<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.030> like

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
like this I don't think this bag is like

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
like this I don't think this bag is like
the<00:01:15.750> real<00:01:15.930> deal<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.009> looks<00:01:17.250> pretty<00:01:17.369> real

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
the real deal but it looks pretty real

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
the real deal but it looks pretty real
to<00:01:18.030> me<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.420> even<00:01:18.869> has<00:01:19.049> likes<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.530> little<00:01:20.840> Fame

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to me it even has likes a little Fame

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.499 
to me it even has likes a little Fame
and<00:01:22.650> stuff<00:01:23.009> but<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.820> only<00:01:24.000> reason<00:01:24.360> why<00:01:24.479> I

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and stuff but the only reason why I

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.090 
and stuff but the only reason why I
don't<00:01:24.689> think<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.020> real<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.530> because<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.070> has

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
don't think it's real is because it has

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.260 
don't think it's real is because it has
a<00:01:26.280> close<00:01:27.259> thing<00:01:28.259> which<00:01:29.100> mostly<00:01:29.609> the<00:01:29.909> tons<00:01:30.119> you

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
new I think that Nordstrom's just sent

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.400 
new I think that Nordstrom's just sent
it<00:03:50.709> over<00:03:50.879> because<00:03:51.879> in<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.359> back<00:03:52.599> it<00:03:53.019> has<00:03:53.199> like

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
it over because in the back it has like

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.449 
it over because in the back it has like
this<00:03:53.620> do<00:03:54.069> you<00:03:54.400> like<00:03:54.669> this<00:03:55.510> water<00:03:56.169> stain<00:03:56.739> so<00:03:57.430> I

this do you like this water stain so I

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.640 
this do you like this water stain so I
guess<00:03:57.609> notion<00:03:58.329> was<00:03:58.540> like<00:03:58.750> nobody's<00:03:59.440> gonna

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
guess notion was like nobody's gonna

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.520 
guess notion was like nobody's gonna
want<00:03:59.739> to<00:04:00.010> buy<00:04:00.129> that<00:04:00.370> for<00:04:00.579> 172<00:04:01.419> just<00:04:02.109> give<00:04:02.410> it

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
want to buy that for 172 just give it

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.780 
want to buy that for 172 just give it
away<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.790> that's<00:04:04.389> probably<00:04:04.780> what<00:04:05.049> they<00:04:05.169> did

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790
