00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
 hello people welcome to further 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.750
 recording by gta 4 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.490
 I have one at the last shot 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.090
 very small problem in the new round 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.940
 had and indeed crass roadblock and 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.800
 a vehicle that unfortunately too fast in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.359
 the air has gone I guess that 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.789
 Say out of the customer because I'm too long 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.289
 I've been under attack now 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.480
 also made me a little one 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.170
 wanted to have little heavy vehicle and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.080
 although I thought now of the ford f 150 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.860
 svt raptor I think so häser 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.620
 Anyway, and I have to say this 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.559
 thunderstorm what I heart again that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.020
 should show how serious this story 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.840
 is with the policeman and me so 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.180
 that ki police not me anyway 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.239
 hope it works this time the oars 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.440
 stay the same and nothing is this 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.309
 given route and then here the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:04.019
 then bridge over here and it's goal 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.519
 this funny heli points as well 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.470
 This is always because I have to 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.950
 I honestly did not know 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.170
 that it is there but in any case exactly 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.119
 I want to go up there and up there 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.720
 I hope I am with these now 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.659
 raptor will be a lot easier but both 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.850
 Police now either do it now 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.340
 the individual was so easy that I did 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.140
 also creates something very small 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.610
 traitor 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:39.000
 and know what's the best I need 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:41.850
 still armor and weapons but this one 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.540
 when the police are so nice to me 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:51.210
 because I take a micro with ok 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.920
 normal for 50 balls small value 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.840
 little denied and ever my goal 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.030
 it is not a war with the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.470
 It is only intended to stop the police 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:08.640
 little to the distraction of the nokia 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:10.830
 3210 and I hope the police drive 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.890
 it really is not who slower me 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.430
 none on more than music and 50 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.769
 shot stuck god no i again 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.120
 this no no no no no there 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:29.450
 I can play you a game 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.440
 my god is already behind 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.590
 but not too far behind 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.790
 that does not really really calm down like 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:43.790
 fbi audience I'm sorry 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:47.720
 the cup and bfb ford crown victoria 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.610
 that's really awful 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.710
 because I'm used to a tactful 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:00.990
 or have not become one of those 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:07.060
 come to me at 200 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:08.830
 that meant I happen to be able to 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.410
 do not commit myself 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.080
 now there is a roadblock 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.350
 normal police vehicles usually 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.700
 stand top bands and it looks very 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:24.820
 bad for me I really have to 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.890
 say oh god we have the today about the 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.520

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.730
 please tell me that was someone i believe 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.100

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.580

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.600

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:44.280
 oh god so people this is really new 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.680
 and at the police 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.200
 Let me go maybe it 's two 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.200
 meter further of course that was clear 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:03.709
 star worked out right now 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:08.000
 jammed my god in a row 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.500
 I do not think it was necessary me 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.579
 really has to say i really like that 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.959
 sea ​​that fits perfectly but beautiful too 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.889
 See that it's not direct 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.430
 it does not affect my phone 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:24.710
 normal 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.910
 believe me the way out there would have been 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.910
 Maybe I should not do it 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:36.039
 ok everything is okay no one is angry at 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.039
 me or something and up there is the dfb 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.060
 actors 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.100
 what did I give the fritz no 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.050
 no do not steer my direction 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:52.540
 thank you could not be easy as a whole 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.300
 ordinary gravel and straw doms 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.110
 bath towel male dangers 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.390
 Give an engine if there is an engine 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.220
 maybe if it does not work 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.460
 start because the goal is right there 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:11.180
 front, maybe no you do not want 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.139
 understand ok 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.940
 Yes 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.820
 I mean many policemen have to 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.199
 I say 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:24.610
 and with me it was so damn loud 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:25.449
 people with me that was as loud as I have to 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.580
 really say 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.680
 while the vans would have been there 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.889
 probably not made at all 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.479
 I really have to be a random one 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.210
 at least not further than that 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.280
 subaru because the police are making it so 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.030
 live difficult no matter how good handling 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.830
 No matter how fast the vehicle is 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.010
 if you can not handle it 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.460
 Being agile and having a good handling 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.979
 has madness at this 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.320
 then I do something like that from which 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.210
 had him could be seen as people that as that 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.370
 me more shots of gta 4 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.260
 I hope you enjoyed it and now 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.260
