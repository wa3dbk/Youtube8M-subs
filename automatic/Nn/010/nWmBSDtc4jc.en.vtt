00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270 

this<00:00:00.329> is<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.539> panel<00:00:01.020> saw<00:00:01.230> that<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:01.620> made<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:01.860> couple

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
this is a panel saw that I made a couple

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.869 
this is a panel saw that I made a couple
of<00:00:02.399> years<00:00:02.639> ago<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:03.410> needed<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.770> panel<00:00:05.160> saw<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.759> I

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
of years ago I needed a panel saw and I

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.589 
of years ago I needed a panel saw and I
needed<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.270> place<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.540> store<00:00:07.020> my<00:00:07.319> clamps<00:00:08.570> so<00:00:09.570> I

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
needed a place to store my clamps so I

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.169 
needed a place to store my clamps so I
decided<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.469> combine<00:00:10.860> them<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.550> one<00:00:11.790> unit<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
decided to combine them in one unit and

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.109 
decided to combine them in one unit and
I<00:00:15.179> found<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.929> heavy-duty<00:00:16.550> electronics<00:00:17.550> rack<00:00:17.820> in

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
I found a heavy-duty electronics rack in

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.310 
I found a heavy-duty electronics rack in
a<00:00:18.960> used<00:00:19.230> computer<00:00:19.500> store<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.400> $100<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.359> that

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
a used computer store for $100 and that

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.560 
a used computer store for $100 and that
was<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.740> foundation<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.580> my<00:00:24.170> unit<00:00:25.170> here<00:00:25.560> and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
was the foundation of my unit here and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.540 
was the foundation of my unit here and
it<00:00:28.699> it<00:00:29.840> rests<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:30.960> four<00:00:31.260> heavy-duty<00:00:31.890> casters

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
it it rests on four heavy-duty casters

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.970 
it it rests on four heavy-duty casters
so<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> whole<00:00:33.090> thing<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.770> moved

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
so the whole thing is can be moved

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
so the whole thing is can be moved
around<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.550> needed<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> back<00:00:46.969> are<00:00:47.969> all

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
around if needed so in the back are all

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.920 
around if needed so in the back are all
my

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.900 

slots<00:00:54.710> that<00:00:54.920> I<00:00:55.100> made<00:00:55.490> for<00:00:56.210> storing<00:00:56.930> clamps<00:00:59.470> and

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
slots that I made for storing clamps and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.230 
slots that I made for storing clamps and
those<00:01:01.910> are<00:01:02.060> made<00:01:02.210> out<00:01:02.420> of<00:01:03.070> five-eighths<00:01:04.240> inch

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
those are made out of five-eighths inch

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.580 
those are made out of five-eighths inch
plywood<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:06.080> I<00:01:06.140> had<00:01:06.470> on<00:01:06.680> hand<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:08.320> it's<00:01:09.320> all

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
plywood that I had on hand and it's all

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.860 
plywood that I had on hand and it's all
bolted<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.010> original<00:01:13.630> electronics<00:01:14.630> rack

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
bolted to the original electronics rack

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.090 
bolted to the original electronics rack
frame<00:01:15.230> and<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.960> way<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.410> clamps<00:01:18.860> help

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
frame and the way that the clamps help

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:28.330 
frame and the way that the clamps help
stabilize<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.790> saw<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.770> all<00:01:27.979> is<00:01:28.160> on<00:01:28.310> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
stabilize the saw so this all is on the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:39.150 
stabilize the saw so this all is on the
other<00:01:28.550> side<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:36.250> framework<00:01:37.300> that<00:01:38.300> the

plywood<00:01:40.160> rests<00:01:40.700> against<00:01:41.000> when<00:01:41.210> you're<00:01:41.360> sawing

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
plywood rests against when you're sawing

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.109 
plywood rests against when you're sawing
it<00:01:41.869> is<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.229> section<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:42.979> metal<00:01:43.310> fencing<00:01:43.790> I<00:01:43.940> got

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
it is a section of metal fencing I got

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:57.120 
it is a section of metal fencing I got
at<00:01:44.300> Home<00:01:44.479> Depot

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.100 

so<00:01:57.729> I<00:01:57.760> made<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.299> saw<00:01:58.810> apart<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.509> motor<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:01.840> got

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
so I made the saw apart the motor I got

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.490 
so I made the saw apart the motor I got
from<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.439> surplus<00:02:02.860> store<00:02:03.159> it<00:02:03.310> was<00:02:03.729> originally

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
from a surplus store it was originally

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.950 
from a surplus store it was originally
built<00:02:05.500> for<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.950> Sears<00:02:06.549> direct<00:02:07.000> drive<00:02:07.240> portable

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
built for a Sears direct drive portable

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.220 
built for a Sears direct drive portable
table<00:02:08.170> saw<00:02:08.289> and<00:02:08.739> it<00:02:09.580> came<00:02:09.850> with<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.479> switch

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
table saw and it came with the switch

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.320 
table saw and it came with the switch
which<00:02:11.500> was<00:02:11.680> handy<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.790> made<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.360> shroud

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
which was handy and I made a shroud

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.460 
which was handy and I made a shroud
around<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.480> blade<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:26.020> whole<00:02:26.200> thing

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
around the blade and the whole thing

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.340 
around the blade and the whole thing
slides<00:02:26.830> on<00:02:27.130> eight<00:02:29.760> ball<00:02:30.760> bearings<00:02:31.239> two<00:02:32.170> on

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
slides on eight ball bearings two on

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.660 
slides on eight ball bearings two on
each<00:02:32.500> corner<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.569> put<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.870> track<00:02:38.110> together

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
each corner and I put the track together

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.620 
each corner and I put the track together
the<00:02:39.670> old-fashioned<00:02:40.360> way<00:02:40.510> with<00:02:40.840> rivets<00:02:41.140> I

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
the old-fashioned way with rivets I

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.699 
the old-fashioned way with rivets I
didn't<00:02:43.630> want<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.870> weld<00:02:44.050> them<00:02:44.230> because<00:02:44.530> what

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
didn't want to weld them because what

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.590 
didn't want to weld them because what
the<00:02:44.890> heat<00:02:45.100> from<00:02:45.340> welding<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:45.940> cause<00:02:46.239> things

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
the heat from welding can cause things

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
the heat from welding can cause things
to<00:02:46.780> warp<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:51.760> saw<00:02:51.970> part<00:02:52.600> is<00:02:52.840> all<00:02:53.019> bolted

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
to warp the saw part is all bolted

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:03.610 
to warp the saw part is all bolted
together<00:02:55.560> and

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.250 

there's<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.819> counterweight<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.329> goes<00:03:06.540> over<00:03:07.049> a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
there's a counterweight that goes over a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:17.899 
there's a counterweight that goes over a
couple<00:03:07.799> of<00:03:08.159> pulleys<00:03:12.200> and<00:03:13.310> I<00:03:14.310> made<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:16.909> dust

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
couple of pulleys and I made a dust

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:23.690 
couple of pulleys and I made a dust
collection<00:03:21.409> trough<00:03:22.409> out<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.950> a<00:03:23.040> section<00:03:23.489> of

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
collection trough out of a section of

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:55.030 
collection trough out of a section of
galvanized<00:03:24.480> gutter

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.900 

the<00:03:56.040> dust<00:03:56.280> collection<00:03:56.670> hose<00:03:58.280> connects<00:03:59.280> down

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
the dust collection hose connects down

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.590 
the dust collection hose connects down
at<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.210> bottom<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:02.640> then<00:04:03.390> I<00:04:03.420> have<00:04:03.780> another

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
at the bottom and then I have another

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.310 
at the bottom and then I have another
hose<00:04:06.600> that<00:04:07.020> connects<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.740> the<00:04:08.030> shroud<00:04:09.030> as<00:04:09.630> you

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
hose that connects to the shroud as you

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.590 
hose that connects to the shroud as you
can<00:04:10.500> see<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:10.860> doesn't<00:04:11.130> collect<00:04:11.850> all<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.360> dust

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
can see it doesn't collect all the dust

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:21.070 
can see it doesn't collect all the dust
but<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.050> gets<00:04:13.230> quite<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> bit<00:04:14.130> of<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.370> and

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.910 

there's<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.350> blade<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:23.850> shroud<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.150> hinged

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
there's the blade the shroud is hinged

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:33.740 
there's the blade the shroud is hinged
and<00:04:27.440> window<00:04:28.440> lock<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:29.070> what<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.340> use<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:32.540> hold<00:04:33.540> it

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
and window lock is what I use to hold it

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:43.580 
and window lock is what I use to hold it
in<00:04:33.870> place<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.900> track<00:04:40.280> is<00:04:41.280> all<00:04:42.590> adjustable

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
in place and the track is all adjustable
