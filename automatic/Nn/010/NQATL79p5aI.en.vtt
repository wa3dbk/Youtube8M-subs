years this lighted solution means that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.319 
years this lighted solution means that
we<00:00:40.760> can<00:00:40.970> produce<00:00:41.090> really<00:00:41.899> tasteful<00:00:42.350> Tomatoes

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
we can produce really tasteful Tomatoes

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.360 
we can produce really tasteful Tomatoes
even<00:00:44.329> in<00:00:44.450> December

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
even in December

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.500 
even in December
we're<00:00:46.370> continued<00:00:46.850> with<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.059> same<00:00:47.270> irrigation

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
we're continued with the same irrigation

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.710 
we're continued with the same irrigation
system<00:00:48.020> used<00:00:48.320> for<00:00:48.470> many<00:00:48.680> years<00:00:48.980> NFT<00:00:49.790> and<00:00:50.600> we

to a drain in the middle of the row down
there<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.800> plants<00:01:07.220> take<00:01:07.430> what<00:01:07.670> nutrients

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
there the plants take what nutrients

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.670 
there the plants take what nutrients
they<00:01:08.210> want<00:01:08.450> they<00:01:08.869> don't<00:01:08.990> want<00:01:09.200> it<00:01:09.470> gets

they want they don't want it gets

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.490 
they want they don't want it gets
recycled<00:01:09.860> round<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:10.670> round<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.300> it's<00:01:12.290> very

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
recycled round and round so it's very

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.800 
recycled round and round so it's very
efficient<00:01:13.010> on<00:01:13.130> water<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:13.729> nutrients<00:01:16.750> one<00:01:17.750> of

efficient on water and nutrients one of

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.060 
efficient on water and nutrients one of
the<00:01:17.900> advantage<00:01:18.320> with<00:01:18.440> the<00:01:18.500> Philips<00:01:18.770> inital

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
the advantage with the Philips inital

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.130 
the advantage with the Philips inital
icing<00:01:19.310> is<00:01:19.490> we<00:01:19.610> can<00:01:19.729> hang<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.360> lights<00:01:20.750> within

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
icing is we can hang the lights within

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.820 
icing is we can hang the lights within
the<00:01:21.350> canopy<00:01:21.799> and<00:01:22.030> we<00:01:23.030> can<00:01:23.180> also<00:01:23.330> target<00:01:23.830> that

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
the canopy and we can also target that

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.890 
the canopy and we can also target that
part<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.369> canopy<00:01:25.760> so<00:01:25.939> what<00:01:26.600> we're<00:01:26.720> finding

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
part of the canopy so what we're finding

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.380 
part of the canopy so what we're finding
is<00:01:27.229> that<00:01:27.260> we<00:01:28.010> can<00:01:28.189> leave<00:01:28.400> leaf<00:01:28.700> on<00:01:28.939> the<00:01:29.119> plant

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
is that we can leave leaf on the plant

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.179 
is that we can leave leaf on the plant
longer<00:01:29.930> because<00:01:30.260> it's<00:01:30.409> still<00:01:30.619> working<00:01:30.860> it's

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
longer because it's still working it's

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.010 
longer because it's still working it's
still<00:01:31.360> photosynthesizing<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.659> it's<00:01:32.810> still

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
still photosynthesizing so it's still

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.250 
still photosynthesizing so it's still
productive<00:01:34.030> it's<00:01:35.030> it's<00:01:35.479> still<00:01:35.840> active<00:01:36.229> so

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
productive it's it's still active so

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.609 
productive it's it's still active so
it's<00:01:36.650> developing<00:01:37.310> still<00:01:38.049> yeah<00:01:39.049> I<00:01:39.290> think<00:01:39.470> it's

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
it's developing still yeah I think it's

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.539 
it's developing still yeah I think it's
fine<00:01:39.880> yeah<00:01:41.229> with<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.320> help<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.950> Philips

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
fine yeah with the help of the Philips

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.600 
fine yeah with the help of the Philips
team<00:01:43.790> we've<00:01:44.509> we've<00:01:45.080> also<00:01:45.259> found<00:01:45.740> that<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.280> can

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
team we've we've also found that you can

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.130 
team we've we've also found that you can
run<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.880> LEDs<00:01:47.180> a<00:01:47.210> lot<00:01:47.570> during<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.900> summer

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
run the LEDs a lot during the summer

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.830 
run the LEDs a lot during the summer
which<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.220> still<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.460> huge<00:01:49.700> benefit<00:01:50.119> even<00:01:50.479> under

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
which is still a huge benefit even under

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.950 
which is still a huge benefit even under
quite<00:01:51.259> light<00:01:51.770> conditions<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:53.509> just<00:01:53.750> means

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
quite light conditions and just means

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.300 
quite light conditions and just means
you<00:01:54.229> can<00:01:54.350> keep<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.619> product<00:01:54.950> production

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
you can keep the product production

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.090 
you can keep the product production
consistent<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:56.530> keep<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.619> plant<00:01:57.860> in<00:01:57.950> more

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
consistent and keep the plant in more

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.969 
consistent and keep the plant in more
balanced<00:01:59.079> we're<00:02:00.079> now<00:02:00.170> producing<00:02:00.350> our<00:02:00.710> winter

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
balanced we're now producing our winter

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.670 
balanced we're now producing our winter
crop<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.939> two<00:02:02.090> varieties<00:02:02.540> are<00:02:02.750> elegance<00:02:03.590> and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
crop the two varieties are elegance and

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.030 
crop the two varieties are elegance and
piccolo<00:02:04.600> piccolo<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.930> can<00:02:06.530> see<00:02:06.649> it's<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.860> nice
