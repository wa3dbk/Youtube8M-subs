00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:40.840
 tonight I prepare a dance team of 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:45.850
 eggplant with basmati rice we see the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:50.200
 ingredients 200 g of basmati rice I have 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.720
 I have already prepared it and jacques 84 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:01:00.400
 aubergines cut into chunks and then 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:03.880
 fried grated Parmesan 8 10 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:09.700
 pro basil leaves you want 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:12.509
 or the melting cheese of the sauce of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.509
 tomato basil 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:24.759
 pour the basmati rice into a bowl e 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:33.119
 now at least two nice ladles of salsa di 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:33.119
 tomato and mix 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.610
 add eggplant now or not 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.120
 oil was dried in 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.120
 excess 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:02:03.250
 stir, add the basil and 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.770
 so the melting cheese is fine 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.210
 even the test read the provola 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:15.700
 smoked but a scamorza would not be 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:19.480
 working we continue to reach the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.910
 our format this time the Parmesan 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.130
 here too parmesan but the choice 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:32.410
 could also fall for gorino and we give 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:40.840
 another little bit of sauce is enough 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:43.870
 so and we still mix in a baking dish and 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:52.630
 put a bottom of oil and some 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:58.350
 Breadcrumbs Now transfer all the rice 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:03:02.310
 and the eggplant seasoned in this pan 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:09.550
 from you have to fill well either 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:16.300
 amass here it is here compact belen cloth 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:20.530
 and meanwhile preheat the oven to 160 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.250
 degrees around 10 to 15 minutes not to 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.840
 more so it is all already cultured 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.720
 especially informed 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:39.000
 we told him about a quarter of an hour 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:46.950
 and shortly and here it is a freshly baked 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.819
 beauty and face we eat here or not is 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:55.019
 noon and you hear the bells 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:57.950
 it's eight o'clock in the evening and this is the part 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.950
 of the mother- in- law 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.760
 and here it is 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.600
 this is where the heart is 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.600
 cheese 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.810
 it's a luxury 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:52.520
 let's say more parmigiana di 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:54.890
 eggplant then the flavors decided goods and 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.640
 then the part with a barge wash them 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:07.650
 cheese the stringy and snow a 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:09.139
 very good niches 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:18.069
 the city 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:18.069
 wet myth and bye bye
