hi<00:00:05.220> my<00:00:05.670> name's<00:00:05.879> Stefan<00:00:06.390> I'm<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.140> math

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
hi my name's Stefan I'm a math

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.320 
hi my name's Stefan I'm a math
professional<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.309> today<00:00:08.849> I'm<00:00:08.970> gonna<00:00:09.150> be

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
professional and today I'm gonna be

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.680 
professional and today I'm gonna be
speaking<00:00:09.809> on<00:00:09.929> how<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.290> find<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.769> estimates<00:00:11.340> of

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
speaking on how to find the estimates of

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.470 
speaking on how to find the estimates of
mixed<00:00:12.690> numbers<00:00:13.099> now<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> mixed<00:00:14.700> number<00:00:14.940> is

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
mixed numbers now a mixed number is

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.380 
mixed numbers now a mixed number is
basically<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:16.440> whole<00:00:16.890> number<00:00:17.270> with<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
basically a whole number with the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.630 
basically a whole number with the
fractions<00:00:18.930> attached<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:20.160> let's<00:00:20.400> say

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
fractions attached to it like let's say

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:29.620 
fractions attached to it like let's say
2<00:00:21.320> in<00:00:22.320> 1/2<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:25.529> another<00:00:26.430> number<00:00:26.720> like<00:00:27.720> 3<00:00:28.650> and

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
2 in 1/2 and another number like 3 and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.650 
2 in 1/2 and another number like 3 and
1/3<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:32.489> first<00:00:32.759> thing<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.030> want<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.450> is

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
1/3 the first thing you want to do is

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.280 
1/3 the first thing you want to do is
you<00:00:34.440> want<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> convert<00:00:35.430> these<00:00:35.670> numbers<00:00:36.360> into

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you want to convert these numbers into

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.540 
you want to convert these numbers into
their<00:00:37.800> decimal<00:00:38.460> point<00:00:38.730> equivalents<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.550> this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
their decimal point equivalents so this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.020 
their decimal point equivalents so this
number<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.350> it'll<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:44.329> 2.5<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.730> number

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
number here it'll be 2.5 and this number

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.689 
number here it'll be 2.5 and this number
over<00:00:48.149> here<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.870> will<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.200> 3<00:00:50.160> point<00:00:50.700> 3<00:00:51.390> 3<00:00:52.370> 3<00:00:53.370> on

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
over here this will be 3 point 3 3 3 on

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.330 
over here this will be 3 point 3 3 3 on
and<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.530> we're<00:00:55.530> repeating<00:00:56.280> 3<00:00:58.190> usually<00:00:59.190> when

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and on we're repeating 3 usually when

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.349 
and on we're repeating 3 usually when
rounding<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.300> want<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.629> round<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.620> nearest

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
rounding we want to round to the nearest

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.830 
rounding we want to round to the nearest
whole<00:01:03.359> number<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> ones<00:01:04.320> place<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.840> you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
whole number of the ones place so you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.210 
whole number of the ones place so you
look<00:01:07.020> at<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> number<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> tenths<00:01:08.130> place

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
look at the number in the tenths place

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.890 
look at the number in the tenths place
in<00:01:09.080> this<00:01:10.080> case<00:01:10.380> it's<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.770> 5<00:01:11.040> now<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.600> 5<00:01:12.869> or

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
in this case it's a 5 now if it's a 5 or

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.280 
in this case it's a 5 now if it's a 5 or
better<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.619> want<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> round<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.290> rounding

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
better you want to round up and rounding

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.770 
better you want to round up and rounding
up<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.850> change<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.180> zero<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
up you just change this to a zero and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.560 
up you just change this to a zero and
add<00:01:18.930> 1<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> number<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> ones<00:01:20.970> place<00:01:21.119> so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
add 1 to the number in the ones place so

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.770 
add 1 to the number in the ones place so
we<00:01:21.990> move<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:23.540> we<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.720> 3<00:01:26.270> now<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.540> number

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
we move up we get 3 now with this number

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.700 
we move up we get 3 now with this number
over<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:29.119> 3.3333<00:01:32.329> the<00:01:33.329> number<00:01:33.659> point<00:01:33.930> 3<00:01:34.350> here

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
over here 3.3333 the number point 3 here

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.789 
over here 3.3333 the number point 3 here
it's<00:01:35.579> less<00:01:35.970> than<00:01:36.240> 5<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.229> what<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> want<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> do

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
it's less than 5 so what you want to do

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.020 
it's less than 5 so what you want to do
is<00:01:37.950> round<00:01:38.310> down

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
is round down

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.300 
is round down
so<00:01:39.659> when<00:01:39.869> rounded<00:01:40.229> down<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.560> basically<00:01:40.950> just

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
so when rounded down you basically just

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.480 
so when rounded down you basically just
eliminate<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> decimal<00:01:42.780> point<00:01:43.070> giving<00:01:44.070> us<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
eliminate the decimal point giving us a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.130 
eliminate the decimal point giving us a
value<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.210> 3<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> that's<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.899> good<00:01:49.049> example

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
value of 3 so that's a good example

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.929 
value of 3 so that's a good example
there<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:50.659> how<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.950> find<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> estimates<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
there of how to find the estimates of

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.710 
there of how to find the estimates of
mixed<00:01:54.810> numbers

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
mixed numbers

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.780 
mixed numbers
you
