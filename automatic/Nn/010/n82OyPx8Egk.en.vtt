just<00:04:26.510> whoever<00:04:26.870> hit<00:04:27.110> it<00:04:27.229> right<00:04:27.380> at<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.560> right

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
just whoever hit it right at the right

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.250 
just whoever hit it right at the right
time<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:28.639> then<00:04:29.120> that<00:04:29.300> yellow<00:04:29.600> felt<00:04:29.930> just

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
time and and then that yellow felt just

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.400 
time and and then that yellow felt just
right<00:04:30.470> for<00:04:30.770> Brad<00:04:30.979> and<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.690> but<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.810> was<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.260> hell

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
right for Brad and and but it was a hell

right for Brad and and but it was a hell
of<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.530> race<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.919> watch<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.970> yellow<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.300> think<00:04:35.630> if

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
of a race to watch the yellow I think if

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.390

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
I was going to have a shot I didn't need

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.879 
I was going to have a shot I didn't need
the<00:04:37.580> yellow<00:04:37.990> but<00:04:38.990> that's<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.590> way<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.710> goes

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
the yellow but that's the way it goes

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.909 
the yellow but that's the way it goes
