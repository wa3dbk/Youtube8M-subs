the description on the box but

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.700 
the description on the box but
nevertheless<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.510> quite<00:00:51.989> pleased<00:00:52.289> with<00:00:52.559> this

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.689 
nevertheless I'm quite pleased with this
car<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:54.660> doesn't<00:00:54.870> look<00:00:55.350> too<00:00:55.770> small<00:00:56.160> compared

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
car it doesn't look too small compared

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.439 
car it doesn't look too small compared
with<00:00:56.789> my<00:00:57.300> other<00:00:57.449> diecast<00:00:58.020> cars<00:00:59.449> considering

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
with my other diecast cars considering

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.139 
with my other diecast cars considering
this<00:01:00.660> car<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.050> quite<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.590> older<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
this car is quite a lot older so the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.750 
this car is quite a lot older so the
design<00:01:03.510> back<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.619> there<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.519> cars

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
design back then was that there the cars

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.300 
design back then was that there the cars
were<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.330> general<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.780> lot<00:01:06.900> smaller

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.080 

it<00:01:14.310> doesn't<00:01:14.580> look<00:01:14.700> too<00:01:14.880> bad

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
it doesn't look too bad

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.539 
it doesn't look too bad
I<00:01:15.590> haven't<00:01:16.590> measured<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.520> card<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:19.250> see<00:01:20.250> if

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
I haven't measured this card to see if

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.840 
I haven't measured this card to see if
it's<00:01:20.939> actually<00:01:21.450> 1:18<00:01:22.320> scale<00:01:22.470> or<00:01:22.830> 1:19<00:01:23.580> scale

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
it's actually 1:18 scale or 1:19 scale

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.080 
it's actually 1:18 scale or 1:19 scale
but<00:01:24.090> I'm<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.320> curious<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.790> doesn't

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
but I'm not that curious it doesn't

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.719 
but I'm not that curious it doesn't
really<00:01:27.180> matter<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.540> much<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.080> me<00:01:28.170> unless

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
really matter that much to me unless

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
really matter that much to me unless
yeah<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> mean<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.509> doesn't<00:01:30.810> matter<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.110> much

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
yeah I mean it doesn't matter that much

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.910 
yeah I mean it doesn't matter that much
to<00:01:31.650> me<00:01:31.829> since<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> an<00:01:32.880> old<00:01:33.060> car<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.920> it's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
to me since this is an old car and it's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:43.679 
to me since this is an old car and it's
already<00:01:35.250> smaller

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.850 

here<00:01:44.689> in<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.869> front<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:47.450> gaps<00:01:47.659> are<00:01:47.899> pretty

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
here in the front the gaps are pretty

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.090 
here in the front the gaps are pretty
consistent<00:01:49.640> they're<00:01:50.630> pretty<00:01:50.869> flush<00:01:52.030> and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
consistent they're pretty flush and

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.010 
consistent they're pretty flush and
these<00:01:55.100> headlights<00:01:55.549> they<00:01:56.060> have<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.270> peg<00:01:56.659> in<00:01:56.689> them

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
these headlights they have a peg in them

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.660 
these headlights they have a peg in them
but<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:58.490> doesn't<00:01:58.759> look<00:01:58.909> too<00:01:59.149> bad<00:01:59.179> because<00:02:00.670> you

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
but it doesn't look too bad because you

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.749 
but it doesn't look too bad because you
can't<00:02:01.939> see<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.329> that<00:02:02.360> clearly<00:02:03.459> the<00:02:04.459> chrome

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759

seems<00:03:11.989> rather<00:03:12.410> large<00:03:12.829> but<00:03:13.790> since<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.329> cars

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
seems rather large but since the cars

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.629 
seems rather large but since the cars
painted<00:03:14.959> black<00:03:15.170> it's<00:03:15.440> not<00:03:15.530> that<00:03:15.829> obvious<00:03:16.069> and

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
painted black it's not that obvious and

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.890 
painted black it's not that obvious and
unless<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.299> look<00:03:17.480> closely<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:20.060> paint<00:03:20.359> job<00:03:20.660> is

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
unless you look closely the paint job is

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.259 
unless you look closely the paint job is
I<00:03:21.170> would<00:03:21.920> say<00:03:22.099> decent<00:03:22.670> it's<00:03:23.120> not<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.780> great

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
I would say decent it's not that great

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.729 
I would say decent it's not that great
compared<00:03:26.269> with<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.599> hurdle<00:03:28.030> but<00:03:29.030> it's<00:03:29.739> still

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
compared with the hurdle but it's still

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.530 
compared with the hurdle but it's still
not<00:03:30.919> the<00:03:30.980> worst

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.850 

the<00:03:36.540> Wilson<00:03:37.250> look<00:03:38.480> they<00:03:39.480> look<00:03:39.629> pretty

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
the Wilson look they look pretty

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.020 
the Wilson look they look pretty
accurate<00:03:40.860> but<00:03:41.690> you<00:03:42.690> there<00:03:43.080> is<00:03:43.200> no<00:03:43.670> brake<00:03:44.670> drums

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
accurate but you there is no brake drums

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.140 
accurate but you there is no brake drums
behind<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.959> wheels<00:03:46.819> it<00:03:47.819> doesn't<00:03:48.060> really

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
behind the wheels it doesn't really

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.940 
behind the wheels it doesn't really
bother<00:03:48.360> me<00:03:48.599> because<00:03:49.019> you<00:03:49.170> can't<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.709> wouldn't

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
bother me because you can't you wouldn't

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:58.039 
bother me because you can't you wouldn't

there's I'm not sure if it comes out on
the<00:04:01.200> camera<00:04:01.560> but<00:04:01.769> there<00:04:02.400> are<00:04:03.319> four

quite a large gap the engine is a beetle

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:46.700 
quite a large gap the engine is a beetle
engine<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.080> it<00:04:46.229> doesn't<00:04:46.590> look<00:04:46.680> that

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
engine so it doesn't look that

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.029 
engine so it doesn't look that
impressive<00:04:47.030> but<00:04:48.289> you<00:04:49.289> can<00:04:49.470> see<00:04:49.680> all<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.919> way

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
impressive but you can see all the way

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.460 
impressive but you can see all the way
down<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.580> it's<00:04:51.300> not<00:04:51.539> one<00:04:51.840> big<00:04:52.169> plastic<00:04:52.470> piece

the<00:04:55.470> interior<00:04:55.919> is<00:04:56.039> pretty<00:04:56.130> depressing

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
the interior is pretty depressing

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.779 
the interior is pretty depressing
there's<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.410> lot<00:04:58.979> of<00:05:00.800> things<00:05:01.800> details<00:05:02.460> on<00:05:02.700> the

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
there's a lot of things details on the

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.000 
there's a lot of things details on the
doors<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.940> seeps<00:05:06.590> actually<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.620> bit

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
doors and the seeps actually a bit

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.760 
doors and the seeps actually a bit
adjustable<00:05:08.780> like<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.260> then<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.590> can

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
adjustable like that and then you can

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.980 
adjustable like that and then you can
fold<00:05:11.729> it<00:05:11.880> forward

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.679 

these<00:05:15.990> also<00:05:16.229> move

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.839 

and<00:05:21.689> the<00:05:23.090> gearshifter<00:05:24.289> she<00:05:25.289> does<00:05:25.699> little<00:05:26.699> room

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
and the gearshifter she does little room

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.610 
and the gearshifter she does little room
I'm<00:05:27.210> not<00:05:27.270> sure<00:05:27.599> if<00:05:27.719> it's<00:05:27.840> supposed<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.139> be<00:05:28.379> like

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.709 
I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like
that<00:05:28.830> but<00:05:29.069> it's<00:05:29.849> not<00:05:29.969> gonna<00:05:30.180> break<00:05:30.449> anytime

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
that but it's not gonna break anytime

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.499 
that but it's not gonna break anytime
soon<00:05:31.139> or<00:05:31.289> anything<00:05:31.499> like<00:05:31.770> that<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.509> these

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
soon or anything like that and these

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.309 
soon or anything like that and these
buttons<00:05:34.080> they<00:05:34.439> actually<00:05:35.009> press<00:05:35.759> but<00:05:36.150> I<00:05:36.360> don't

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
buttons they actually press but I don't

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:38.390 
buttons they actually press but I don't
think<00:05:37.499> it's<00:05:37.620> supposed<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:37.979> be<00:05:38.069> like<00:05:38.219> that<00:05:38.370> I

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
think it's supposed to be like that I

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.610 
think it's supposed to be like that I
think<00:05:38.699> it's<00:05:38.849> because<00:05:39.300> it<00:05:39.479> wasn't<00:05:39.629> fitted

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
think it's because it wasn't fitted

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.510 
think it's because it wasn't fitted
tightly<00:05:42.229> again<00:05:43.229> it's<00:05:43.439> not<00:05:43.590> gonna<00:05:43.710> break<00:05:43.949> but

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
tightly again it's not gonna break but

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.580 
tightly again it's not gonna break but
it's<00:05:45.270> just<00:05:45.419> it's<00:05:45.749> it's<00:05:45.990> actually<00:05:46.199> kind<00:05:46.560> of

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
it's just it's it's actually kind of

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.719 
it's just it's it's actually kind of
cool<00:05:47.960> the<00:05:48.960> -<00:05:49.169> actually<00:05:49.919> doesn't<00:05:50.400> look<00:05:50.520> that

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
cool the - actually doesn't look that

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.200 
cool the - actually doesn't look that
great<00:05:51.120> because<00:05:51.680> you<00:05:52.680> have<00:05:52.710> this<00:05:53.039> huge<00:05:53.789> sticker

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
great because you have this huge sticker

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.800 
great because you have this huge sticker

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.260 

there's<00:06:10.650> this<00:06:10.889> part<00:06:11.279> where<00:06:11.340> if<00:06:11.879> you<00:06:12.060> use<00:06:12.089> a

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
there's this part where if you use a

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.189 
there's this part where if you use a
toothpick<00:06:14.270> there's<00:06:15.270> an<00:06:15.479> extra<00:06:15.810> compartment

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
toothpick there's an extra compartment

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.800 
toothpick there's an extra compartment
behind<00:06:16.589> there<00:06:16.949> but<00:06:17.819> without<00:06:18.089> the<00:06:18.360> toothpick

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
behind there but without the toothpick

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:29.460 
behind there but without the toothpick
it's<00:06:18.990> pretty<00:06:19.379> hard<00:06:19.589> to<00:06:19.620> get<00:06:20.129> out<00:06:20.279> you<00:06:20.639> have<00:06:20.729> to

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:36.990 

and<00:06:30.250> undreamed<00:06:35.190> it's<00:06:36.190> not<00:06:36.490> that<00:06:36.700> impressive

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
and undreamed it's not that impressive

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.860 
and undreamed it's not that impressive
but<00:06:38.100> it's<00:06:39.100> pretty<00:06:39.970> much<00:06:40.150> the<00:06:40.300> same<00:06:40.450> with<00:06:40.600> all

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
but it's pretty much the same with all

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:47.370 
but it's pretty much the same with all
as<00:06:41.620> with<00:06:42.340> all<00:06:42.520> budget<00:06:43.120> cars<00:06:46.050> there's<00:06:47.050> some

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
as with all budget cars there's some

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:53.040 
as with all budget cars there's some
steering<00:06:48.190> detail<00:06:48.640> here<00:06:50.790> but<00:06:51.790> it's<00:06:52.000> it<00:06:52.390> is<00:06:52.450> just

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
steering detail here but it's it is just

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.260 
steering detail here but it's it is just
one<00:06:53.230> big<00:06:53.590> plastic<00:06:53.920> piece<00:06:54.340> except<00:06:55.030> for<00:06:55.150> in<00:06:55.240> the

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
one big plastic piece except for in the

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.970 
one big plastic piece except for in the
back<00:06:55.510> right<00:06:55.750> here<00:06:55.930> the<00:06:56.110> back<00:06:56.260> is<00:06:56.470> actually<00:06:56.680> not

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
back right here the back is actually not

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.890 
back right here the back is actually not
too<00:06:57.130> bad

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
too bad

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.350 
too bad
this<00:06:58.900> chrome<00:06:59.350> piece<00:06:59.680> is<00:06:59.950> actually<00:07:00.850> has<00:07:01.240> the

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
this chrome piece is actually has the

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.420 
this chrome piece is actually has the
texture<00:07:01.780> to<00:07:01.960> it<00:07:01.990> so<00:07:02.260> it<00:07:02.980> doesn't<00:07:03.010> look<00:07:03.370> the

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430 
texture to it so it doesn't look the

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.520 
texture to it so it doesn't look the
same<00:07:03.580> type<00:07:04.210> of<00:07:04.240> chrome<00:07:04.600> nose<00:07:04.780> you<00:07:05.170> have<00:07:05.230> on<00:07:05.440> the

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
same type of chrome nose you have on the

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:22.040 
same type of chrome nose you have on the
bumpers<00:07:07.080> so<00:07:08.080> that's<00:07:08.260> nice

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.700 

I<00:07:22.139> would<00:07:22.800> recommend<00:07:23.310> this<00:07:23.520> car<00:07:23.849> to<00:07:24.120> somebody

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.490 
I would recommend this car to somebody
who<00:07:25.710> likes<00:07:26.190> old<00:07:26.610> cars<00:07:27.060> but<00:07:27.659> if<00:07:27.870> you<00:07:28.020> don't<00:07:28.229> like

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.070 
who likes old cars but if you don't like
old<00:07:28.710> cars<00:07:28.979> I<00:07:29.340> I<00:07:29.970> wouldn't<00:07:30.419> get<00:07:30.629> it<00:07:30.780> because

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 
old cars I I wouldn't get it because

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.089 
old cars I I wouldn't get it because
it's<00:07:31.710> not<00:07:31.979> the<00:07:32.159> best<00:07:32.340> model<00:07:32.699> out<00:07:32.849> there<00:07:34.099> so

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:35.099 
it's not the best model out there so

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:37.159 
it's not the best model out there so
