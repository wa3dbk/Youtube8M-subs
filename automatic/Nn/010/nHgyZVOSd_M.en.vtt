00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.350
 well then we continue with the second 

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:07.360
 part of this series of 60 programs 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.639
 free for windows this next 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.519
 program that I want to present to you perhaps 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.159
 is not necessary for many of us 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.490
 because this program is a screen 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:20.109
 capture or capture what is a portion 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.029
 of what you are seeing at this moment 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.400
 on your monitor or maybe the screen 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.230
 complete as we know the windows already 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.359
 has that functionality integrated and 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.910
 there are other types of programs 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.680
 quite efficient to do this 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.300
 purpose but well it's a 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.670
 excellent option in the event that 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.530
 Would you like to try some alternative this 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.500
 program like many good 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.750
 It has basic functions for you 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.329
 You can capture certain sections of 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.730
 some page even gives you a kind 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.609
 as a program where you can 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.710
 additionally add some kind of 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.109
 edition that you require as for example 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.840
 you can put pictures you can put 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.359
 shadows texts among many things 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.399
 more this in the case that really in 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.070
 your screenshot would you like to add 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.050
 other type of elements that were 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.060
 required 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.980
 so you could do it that way 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 share it with someone the program is 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.190
 100% free you can come to the page 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.290
 that you saw on the screen and download it and 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.900
 well then we continue with this other 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.260
 program called green name master 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.510
 I want to mention that this tool 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.380
 so to speak, it will allow you to do 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.540
 simultaneous editions of files for 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.480
 that you do not have to do it manually and 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.060
 one by one I want to mention to you that this 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.270
 It serves to rename files either from 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.700
 music photographs videos and so on in 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.650
 different formats also includes the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.860
 functionality to edit 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.600
 mp3 tags among many 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.340
 other things the program is completely 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.160
 Free the page in view on the screen 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.010
 and then you can come and from that 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.380
 way to edit many files at 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.660
 same time without having to do it 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.540
 one by one is another program that we have 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.460
 also here on the screen is very similar 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.619
 to the previous one that I just showed you this 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.049
 it will also allow you to edit 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.690
 what are the labels of those 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.430
 especially music files in 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.590
 sometimes we have music in 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.060
 our computer and the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.489
 name of the artist or the name of the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.170
 song and so on this program is a 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.409
 excellent tool so that you can 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.540
 do all that work simultaneously to 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.480
 several files at the same time so that 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.150
 that way you can even add a 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.150
 image to them and that way in 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.920
 your player looks spectacular this 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.840
 program is also free you can 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.430
 try the website I just did it 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.799
 show a moment ago we are going to 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.870
 continue and then I present you 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.150
 the productivity category we are going to 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.489
 start with one of the programs that 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.220
 many of you already know libreoffice 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.170
 if you do not have microsoft installed 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.049
 office or you do not have the possibility of 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.099
 get it because it is very expensive and so on 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.329
 libreoffice is the excellent alternative 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.180
 completely free so that this 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.519
 way you can work with very programs 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.389
 similar to microsoft office as per 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.330
 example text editor for example 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:20.420
 excel etc. among other things 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.310
 you can come to your page and investigate 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.430
 a little bit more and from this side 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.440
 you could directly download it to your 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.020
 computer they have a new 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.380
 versions but it really works for you and 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.780
 will serve as a substitute for Microsoft 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.120
 office this next that I present to you 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.980
 call x main and its page at the same time 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.130
 screen and to my point of view this 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.530
 program is excellent especially if 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.480
 you are a student or suddenly you have 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.580
 children who go to school is 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.000
 extremely common that they always 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.700
 order and create mental maps maps 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.430
 conceptual and so on this program is 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.430
 an excellent tool for you 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.160
 can you make those school projects 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.720
 in a super super easy way them 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.940
 they have two versions one version 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.100
 free a paid version you can 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.020
 maybe use the free one and if more 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.660
 forward do you think you are going to use it 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.370
 much more time then perhaps acquire it 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.160
 This application also allows you 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.410
 add items such as figure numbers 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.970
 images so that in that way you 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.250
 I work a lot 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.890
 attractive we continue with the next and 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.720
 we have this call in skate this 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.640
 program is very useful for those 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.980
 people who are designers in which 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.590
 it's going to work on the basis of very vectors 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.230
 similar to the illustrator program of 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.930
 adobe in which you can really create 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.740
 everything that comes to mind in this 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.090
 program its use looks pretty enough 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.070
 simple obviously has 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.100
 a lot of tools just like what 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.230
 you can see but then taking one by one 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.540
 and observing what it does then 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.790
 good would be the best way for you 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.830
 learned to use it quickly if 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.110
 you already know the use of illustrator and not 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.060
 you have the possibility of acquiring it 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.700
 It would be an excellent alternative because 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.860
 the tools are very similar and you 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.210
 you will be really saving a lot of money 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.130
 and well, let's go with the 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.770
 next I want to mention that this 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.500
 program is called universal bieber is 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.970
 pretty but quite interesting to me 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.880
 It caught a lot of attention with this 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.550
 program you can open from this 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.890
 same application different types of 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.650
 files without having to worry about 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.990
 what program is going 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.150
 in many occasions we have formats 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.979
 strangers of files that we can not 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.009
 open we have to choose an application 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.139
 and we do not know which of them to use in 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.300
 this case this program allows you not 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.810
 just open images in all of these 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.400
 formats that you see here but also 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.000
 multimedia as video will allow you 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:57.100
 also open documents in word format 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.650
 in excel in pdf in rtf formats 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.630
 text internet files and also 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.370
 plugins the advantage that this has 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.880
 program is that in many cases you 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.740
 you can make edits in it for 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.199
 Then make the changes 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.169
 necessary to the particular file that you 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:17.080
 you have opened I repeat you I think 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.720
 pretty but pretty interesting I think 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.210
 that would be worth trying here 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.550
 you can give an account of how it looks and is a 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.190
 excellent alternative when you need 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.650
 open a document which you have 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.419
 problems opening we're going to happen with 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.760
 last three programs before 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.590
 continue in the next video I want to 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.280
 introduce yourself to teamviewer many of 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.770
 you already 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.850
 they use this program is completely 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:46.030
 free and it's 100% effective for maybe 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.740
 offer remote support so that you 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.230
 you can connect from a computer to 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.560
 another in a fairly simple way and 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.300
 effective the program is free here is 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.730
 your screen page can come 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.460
 download it and try it by the way if you 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.770
 You are looking for teamviewer in my channel 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.870
 find a video about the 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.460
 same way I present you filezilla for 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.830
 those people who have pages 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.770
 websites and do not know how to upload files 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.600
 manually to your hosting one of the 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.550
 better programs to do this 

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.740
 purpose is called filezilla here has 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.890
 your screen page downloads the 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.840
 client and then you only place the 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.060
 access information of your service 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.720
 hosting so that you can then 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.000
 enter 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.820
 we also have inside this last 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.070
 series the tweetdeck program this more 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.290
 that a program is an application that 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.470
 it works in your browser where you 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:41.770
 You can add different accounts 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.260
 diverse social networks and from a single 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.970
 location 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.980
 this application is effective for 

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.620
 those people who have different 

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.660
 social networks and do not want to enter 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.210
 one in one if they would not like to have 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.400
 all together in one location 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:00.490
 to read the news in that way 

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:03.310
 read your messages and maybe share 

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.260
 since I repeat the same location 

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:08.500
 to make it much easier then 

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:11.620
 we go to the next video because I have 

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:14.850
 many more programs quite a lot 

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.850
 good for windows
