00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and now this is the weirdest glitch ever

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.390 
and now this is the weirdest glitch ever
on<00:02:13.739> this<00:02:13.860> game<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.250> ever<00:02:14.280> seen<00:02:15.980> maybe<00:02:16.980> even<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
on this game I ever seen maybe even the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.259 
on this game I ever seen maybe even the
first<00:02:17.610> glitch<00:02:17.910> I've<00:02:18.060> ever<00:02:18.209> seen<00:02:19.519> but<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.549> just

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
first glitch I've ever seen but I just

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:27.680 
first glitch I've ever seen but I just
watched<00:02:21.510> coming<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:26.239> it's<00:02:27.239> when<00:02:27.390> i<00:02:27.420> try<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
watched coming up it's when i try to

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.949 
watched coming up it's when i try to
enter<00:02:27.989> this<00:02:28.200> level<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.239> i<00:02:30.239> did<00:02:30.420> not<00:02:30.450> use<00:02:30.780> any

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
enter this level and i did not use any

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.809 
enter this level and i did not use any
hacks<00:02:31.319> because<00:02:31.799> i<00:02:32.130> really<00:02:32.400> don't<00:02:32.549> know<00:02:32.670> how<00:02:32.790> to

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
hacks because i really don't know how to

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.190 
hacks because i really don't know how to
do<00:02:33.030> any<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:34.849> see<00:02:35.849> right<00:02:36.120> here<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
do any of that so see right here the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.020 
do any of that so see right here the
screen<00:02:37.560> turns<00:02:37.769> blue<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.549> I<00:02:38.640> can't<00:02:38.880> do

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
screen turns blue and I can't do

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.970 
screen turns blue and I can't do
anything<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:42.239> what<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.720> do<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:42.989> try<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.380> view<00:02:43.830> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
anything so what I do is try to view the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.670 
anything so what I do is try to view the
math<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.090> doesn't<00:02:48.420> show<00:02:48.570> anything<00:02:48.840> then

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
math and it doesn't show anything then

the hell that is and now I'm under the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.180 
the hell that is and now I'm under the
map<00:02:59.670> lying<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:02.989> don't<00:03:03.989> even<00:03:04.079> know<00:03:04.319> what<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:04.859> did

map lying I don't even know what I did

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.580 
map lying I don't even know what I did
but<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:06.030> trying<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.810> go<00:03:06.959> into<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.290> level

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
but just trying to go into the level

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.800 
but just trying to go into the level
when<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:07.799> happened<00:03:10.639> so<00:03:11.639> on<00:03:12.000> now<00:03:12.480> what<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> have

when this happened so on now what I have

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.500 
when this happened so on now what I have
to<00:03:12.989> do<00:03:13.139> is<00:03:13.440> go<00:03:13.859> back<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.459> map<00:03:14.639> since<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.299> was

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
to do is go back to the map since it was

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.470 
to do is go back to the map since it was
working<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:19.370> go<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.549> different<00:03:20.609> level<00:03:21.090> and

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
working and go to a different level and

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.379 
working and go to a different level and
that<00:03:21.980> i'ma<00:03:22.980> have<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.250> exit<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.880> level<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.299> go

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
that i'ma have to exit the level and go

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.280 
that i'ma have to exit the level and go
back<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.900> 1i<00:03:25.079> just<00:03:25.470> glitched<00:03:26.010> out<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:27.290> so

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
back to the 1i just glitched out of so

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.360 
back to the 1i just glitched out of so
kind<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.859> weird<00:03:29.100> glitch<00:03:30.650> I'm<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.280> have

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
kind of a weird glitch I'm going to have

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.920 
kind of a weird glitch I'm going to have
to<00:03:32.519> figure<00:03:32.700> out<00:03:32.880> how<00:03:33.000> i<00:03:33.209> did<00:03:33.359> that<00:03:33.569> glitch

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
to figure out how i did that glitch

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.740 
to figure out how i did that glitch
because<00:03:34.170> i<00:03:34.650> might<00:03:35.130> post<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.519> video<00:03:35.700> if<00:03:36.180> i<00:03:36.389> find

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
because i might post a video if i find

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.520 
because i might post a video if i find
out<00:03:36.900> how<00:03:37.049> i<00:03:37.079> did<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:41.209> so<00:03:42.209> let's<00:03:42.840> try<00:03:43.109> not<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.410> get

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
out how i did it so let's try not to get

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.220 
out how i did it so let's try not to get
glitched<00:03:44.010> out<00:03:44.220> again<00:03:44.519> and<00:03:45.000> go<00:03:45.750> back<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.049> this

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
glitched out again and go back to this

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.120 
glitched out again and go back to this
level

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.860 

go<00:03:52.130> into<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.520> treads<00:03:53.150> called<00:03:53.390> treasure<00:03:53.660> in

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
go into the treads called treasure in

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:02.860 
go into the treads called treasure in
the<00:03:54.020> depths<00:04:00.940> should<00:04:01.940> be<00:04:02.090> an<00:04:02.180> interesting

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
the depths should be an interesting

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:11.290 
the depths should be an interesting
commentary<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:08.120> basically<00:04:09.430> right<00:04:10.430> here<00:04:10.460> um<00:04:10.910> I

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
commentary so basically right here um I

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.940 
commentary so basically right here um I
have<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.170> take<00:04:12.950> out<00:04:13.100> these<00:04:13.250> crabs<00:04:13.640> because

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
have to take out these crabs because

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.020 
have to take out these crabs because
supposedly<00:04:15.950> you<00:04:16.220> need<00:04:16.370> these<00:04:16.580> treasure

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
supposedly you need these treasure

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.420 
supposedly you need these treasure
chests<00:04:17.750> we<00:04:18.380> need<00:04:18.530> to<00:04:18.650> like<00:04:18.799> shoot<00:04:19.040> them<00:04:19.190> until

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
chests we need to like shoot them until

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.729 
chests we need to like shoot them until
they<00:04:19.519> explode<00:04:19.840> then<00:04:20.840> that's<00:04:21.260> how<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.470> collect

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
they explode then that's how you collect

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.130 
they explode then that's how you collect
them<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.400> need<00:04:22.550> I<00:04:22.730> think<00:04:23.090> 40<00:04:23.660> of<00:04:23.750> them<00:04:23.900> and

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
them you need I think 40 of them and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.940 
them you need I think 40 of them and
then<00:04:24.800> you<00:04:24.920> unlock<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.430> key<00:04:29.560> it's<00:04:30.560> pretty<00:04:30.740> easy

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
then you unlock the key it's pretty easy

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.510 
then you unlock the key it's pretty easy
to<00:04:31.100> maneuver<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:32.000> submarine<00:04:33.490> shooting<00:04:34.490> is

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
to maneuver the submarine shooting is

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.190 
to maneuver the submarine shooting is
pretty<00:04:34.850> good<00:04:35.060> because<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.870> could<00:04:35.990> rotate

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
pretty good because you could rotate

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.960 
pretty good because you could rotate
really<00:04:36.650> fast<00:04:37.960> so<00:04:38.960> i<00:04:38.990> may<00:04:39.170> get<00:04:39.380> these<00:04:39.970> treasure

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
really fast so i may get these treasure

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:51.559 
really fast so i may get these treasure
chests<00:04:41.450> or<00:04:42.400> whatever<00:04:43.400> they<00:04:43.580> are

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569
