each and every day when we go to sleep
we<00:03:33.269> want<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.599> take<00:03:33.780> healing<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.409> the<00:03:34.530> next

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
we want to take healing to the next

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.280 
we want to take healing to the next
level<00:03:35.280> we<00:03:35.549> actually<00:03:36.120> during<00:03:36.780> our<00:03:37.019> waking

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
level we actually during our waking

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.610 
level we actually during our waking
hours<00:03:37.620> we<00:03:38.519> extend<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.150> fast<00:03:39.599> especially<00:03:40.199> to

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
hours we extend that fast especially to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.520 
hours we extend that fast especially to
fresh<00:03:41.040> coconut<00:03:41.519> water<00:03:41.870> which<00:03:42.870> I<00:03:43.019> believe<00:03:43.319> is

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
fresh coconut water which I believe is

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.770 
fresh coconut water which I believe is
the<00:03:43.560> number<00:03:43.919> one<00:03:44.040> food<00:03:44.280> on<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.579> planet<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.209> has

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
the number one food on the planet it has

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.309 
the number one food on the planet it has
the<00:03:46.430> dual<00:03:47.430> distinction<00:03:48.299> of<00:03:48.449> being<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.959> water

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
the dual distinction of being a water

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.520 
the dual distinction of being a water
and<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.799> whole<00:03:49.949> food<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.970> will<00:03:51.329> go<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:51.930> clean

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
and a whole food that will go and clean

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.069 
and a whole food that will go and clean
out<00:03:52.709> our<00:03:52.859> whole<00:03:53.040> system<00:03:53.519> we<00:03:53.940> can<00:03:54.209> extend<00:03:54.900> the

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
out our whole system we can extend the

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.099 
out our whole system we can extend the
healing<00:03:55.409> process<00:03:56.069> but<00:03:56.639> only<00:03:56.849> when<00:03:57.239> we<00:03:57.389> fast

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
healing process but only when we fast

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.770 
healing process but only when we fast
so<00:03:58.349> yeah<00:03:58.560> certain<00:03:58.979> foods<00:03:59.250> can<00:03:59.549> certainly<00:04:00.000> you

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
so yeah certain foods can certainly you

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.559 
so yeah certain foods can certainly you
know<00:04:00.959> help<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:01.650> assist<00:04:02.159> us<00:04:02.569> nutritionally

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
know help and assist us nutritionally

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.719 
know help and assist us nutritionally
and<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:04.260> can<00:04:04.409> nourish<00:04:04.620> us<00:04:04.919> on<00:04:05.189> a<00:04:05.220> certain<00:04:05.549> level

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
and it can nourish us on a certain level

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.199 
and it can nourish us on a certain level
when<00:04:06.419> you<00:04:06.540> connect<00:04:06.930> with<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.349> lifestyle<00:04:07.889> of
