00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540 

hi<00:00:00.960> so<00:00:01.290> I<00:00:01.350> was<00:00:01.680> making<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.040> spaghetti<00:00:02.370> sauce

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hi so I was making the spaghetti sauce

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.930 
hi so I was making the spaghetti sauce
and<00:00:02.909> in<00:00:03.659> my<00:00:03.810> spaghetti<00:00:04.020> sauce<00:00:04.380> I<00:00:04.759> planned<00:00:05.759> on

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
and in my spaghetti sauce I planned on

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.459 
and in my spaghetti sauce I planned on
putting<00:00:06.259> frozen<00:00:07.259> cauliflower<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:09.260> this<00:00:10.260> gave

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
putting frozen cauliflower and this gave

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.249 
putting frozen cauliflower and this gave
me<00:00:10.650> an<00:00:10.740> idea<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.580> compare<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.389> proctor<00:00:12.990> silex

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
me an idea to compare the proctor silex

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.400 
me an idea to compare the proctor silex
food<00:00:13.769> processor<00:00:14.400> versus<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.269> ninja<00:00:15.660> 1,100

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
food processor versus the ninja 1,100

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.870 
food processor versus the ninja 1,100
watts

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
watts

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.920 
watts
so<00:00:17.960> we'll<00:00:18.960> see<00:00:19.170> how<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.380> goes<00:00:23.750> here's<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
so we'll see how it goes here's the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:34.000 
so we'll see how it goes here's the
proctor<00:00:25.289> silex<00:00:25.640> food<00:00:26.640> processor

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:51.180 

approximately<00:00:35.010> 10<00:00:35.340> seconds

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.569 

and<00:00:52.190> this<00:00:53.000> is<00:00:53.269> how<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:54.050> comes<00:00:54.289> out<00:00:54.579> there's

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
and this is how it comes out there's

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.420 
and this is how it comes out there's
still<00:00:55.850> some<00:00:58.359> pieces<00:00:59.649> it's<00:01:00.649> finely<00:01:01.129> chopped

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
still some pieces it's finely chopped

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:46.710 
still some pieces it's finely chopped
but<00:01:02.409> we'll<00:01:03.409> see<00:01:03.589> how<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.739> ninjagos

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:02:00.670 

so<00:01:47.720> here<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.110> is<00:01:52.360> ten<00:01:53.360> seconds<00:01:53.930> each<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:59.680> this

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
so here it is ten seconds each and this

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:11.650 
so here it is ten seconds each and this
is<00:02:00.979> what<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.280> new<00:02:01.400> jiggy<00:02:01.700> though<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:11.390> test

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
is what the new jiggy though so the test

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.230 
is what the new jiggy though so the test
with<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.900> cauliflower<00:02:12.170> went<00:02:12.680> well<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.240> I

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
with the cauliflower went well and I

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.870 
with the cauliflower went well and I
figured<00:02:14.600> I'd<00:02:14.750> try<00:02:14.990> with<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.230> carrots<00:02:15.530> now<00:02:15.880> so

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
figured I'd try with the carrots now so

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.490 
figured I'd try with the carrots now so
we're<00:02:17.450> going<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.630> try<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.900> with<00:02:18.050> three<00:02:18.350> carrots

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
we're going to try it with three carrots

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.130 
we're going to try it with three carrots
in<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.770> food<00:02:21.950> processor

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
in the food processor

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:43.120 
in the food processor
we'll<00:02:24.140> try<00:02:24.320> for<00:02:24.350> five<00:02:24.740> seconds<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:42.260> as<00:02:42.769> you<00:02:43.040> can

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
we'll try for five seconds so as you can

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.610 
we'll try for five seconds so as you can
see<00:02:43.190> it's<00:02:43.820> straw<00:02:44.269> but<00:02:44.900> there's<00:02:45.350> still

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
see it's straw but there's still

00:02:45.620 --> 00:03:25.530 
see it's straw but there's still
something<00:02:46.120> carrots<00:02:50.260> try<00:02:51.260> with<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.500> ninja<00:02:51.769> now

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.870
