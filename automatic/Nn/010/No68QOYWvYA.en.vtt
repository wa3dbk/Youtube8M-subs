now<00:01:48.790> in<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:49.210> case<00:01:49.540> most<00:01:50.259> of<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.619> seeds<00:01:50.920> I've

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
now in this case most of the seeds I've

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.870 
now in this case most of the seeds I've
already<00:01:51.400> harvested<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.750> I've<00:01:53.650> already

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.770 
carefully those are precious seeds and
then<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.840> go<00:02:50.650> down<00:02:50.680> on<00:02:51.159> the<00:02:51.280> ground<00:02:51.519> right<00:02:52.389> close

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
then I go down on the ground right close

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.690 
then I go down on the ground right close
by<00:02:53.170> if<00:02:53.409> I<00:02:53.620> want<00:02:53.859> to<00:02:54.010> thicken<00:02:54.250> up<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.790> area<00:02:55.120> with

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
by if I want to thicken up the area with

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.319 
by if I want to thicken up the area with
New<00:02:57.700> England<00:02:58.180> after<00:02:58.389> I<00:02:59.730> spread<00:03:00.730> some<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:01.150> that

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
New England after I spread some of that

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.020 
New England after I spread some of that
fully<00:03:02.260> from<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.129> ground<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:05.730> get<00:03:06.730> right<00:03:06.970> down

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
fully from the ground I get right down

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.890 
fully from the ground I get right down
to<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.659> ground<00:03:08.819> now<00:03:09.819> we're<00:03:10.090> coming<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.599> freeze

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
to the ground now we're coming to freeze

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.960 
to the ground now we're coming to freeze
up<00:03:11.139> and<00:03:11.319> this<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.739> pretty<00:03:12.069> close<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.400> freeze<00:03:12.939> up

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
up and this is pretty close to freeze up

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.089 
up and this is pretty close to freeze up
right<00:03:13.419> now<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.819> I'm<00:03:15.819> not<00:03:16.299> sure<00:03:16.709> this<00:03:17.709> ground

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
right now so I'm not sure this ground

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.610 
right now so I'm not sure this ground
will<00:03:18.370> just<00:03:18.669> barely<00:03:19.030> accept<00:03:19.720> these<00:03:19.959> because

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
will just barely accept these because

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.440 
will just barely accept these because
the<00:03:20.829> ground<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.189> getting<00:03:21.549> pretty<00:03:21.730> frozen<00:03:22.060> but

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
the ground is getting pretty frozen but

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.629 
the ground is getting pretty frozen but
we're<00:03:22.629> going<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.959> cover<00:03:23.139> it<00:03:23.379> up<00:03:23.530> again<00:03:23.889> so<00:03:24.609> I

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
we're going to cover it up again so I

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.940 
we're going to cover it up again so I
put<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.269> seeds<00:03:25.599> down<00:03:25.989> here<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:27.329> then

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
put the seeds down here and then

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.559 
put the seeds down here and then
hopefully<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:29.980> have<00:03:30.340> garden<00:03:30.790> gloves<00:03:30.970> on<00:03:31.359> it's

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
hopefully I have garden gloves on it's

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.990 
hopefully I have garden gloves on it's
too<00:03:31.780> cold<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.229> have<00:03:32.500> garden<00:03:32.889> gloves<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.729> then<00:03:33.970> I

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
too cold to have garden gloves so then I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.869 
too cold to have garden gloves so then I
take<00:03:34.449> that<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.199> I<00:03:35.769> just<00:03:36.069> worked<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.579> around

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
take that and I just worked it around

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.559 
take that and I just worked it around
like<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.449> and<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:38.590> does<00:03:38.919> it<00:03:39.209> then<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:40.299> put

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
like that and that does it then I put

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.520 
like that and that does it then I put
the<00:03:40.599> fleas<00:03:41.169> back<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.269> see<00:03:43.690> when<00:03:44.379> I

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
the fleas back on so you see when I

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.920 
the fleas back on so you see when I
clean<00:03:44.949> up<00:03:44.979> at<00:03:45.400> my<00:03:45.639> place<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.629> place<00:03:46.900> doesn't

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
clean up at my place the place doesn't

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.170 
clean up at my place the place doesn't
look<00:03:47.440> any<00:03:47.739> cleaner<00:03:48.190> than<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.519> did<00:03:48.849> when<00:03:49.120> I

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
look any cleaner than it did when I

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.449 
look any cleaner than it did when I
started<00:03:49.780> because<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.290> put<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.859> leaves<00:03:51.069> all

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
started because I put the leaves all

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.819 
started because I put the leaves all
back<00:03:51.760> where<00:03:52.090> they<00:03:52.269> were<00:03:52.409> because<00:03:53.409> the<00:03:53.590> leaves

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
back where they were because the leaves

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.750 
back where they were because the leaves
are<00:03:54.220> nutrition<00:03:54.970> for<00:03:55.209> my<00:03:55.389> plants<00:03:56.579> you<00:03:57.579> have

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
are nutrition for my plants you have

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.920 
are nutrition for my plants you have
some<00:03:58.060> choices<00:03:58.739> about<00:03:59.739> how<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.120> collect<00:04:01.120> seed<00:04:01.599> I

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
some choices about how to collect seed I

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.240 
some choices about how to collect seed I
have<00:04:02.859> some<00:04:03.849> people<00:04:04.299> collect<00:04:04.510> them<00:04:05.109> in<00:04:05.409> a<00:04:05.739> gunny

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
have some people collect them in a gunny

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.319 
have some people collect them in a gunny
sacks<00:04:06.729> or<00:04:07.090> in<00:04:07.930> paper<00:04:08.290> bags<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:09.549> me<00:04:09.849> that<00:04:10.299> that

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
sacks or in paper bags to me that that

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.920 
sacks or in paper bags to me that that
that's<00:04:10.989> okay<00:04:11.560> but<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.790> me<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.120> creates<00:04:13.569> too

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
that's okay but to me it creates too

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.360 
that's okay but to me it creates too
much<00:04:14.169> waste<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:15.099> and<00:04:15.599> cumbersome<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:18.340> I

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
much waste and and cumbersome so I

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.469 
much waste and and cumbersome so I
collect<00:04:18.970> in<00:04:19.180> jars<00:04:19.599> and<00:04:20.409> on<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.220> jar<00:04:21.579> I<00:04:21.849> put<00:04:22.330> the
