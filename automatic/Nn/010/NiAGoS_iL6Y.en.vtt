00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 deputy of rpg mort for found in this 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.870
 new video 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.730
 given that I was able to meet 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.889
 a dear friend 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.820
 had to find from naples and we did 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.160
 some practice matches in the evening 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.079
 after a sacrosanct drink in one 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.939
 meeting talk and then you will have 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:25.320
 soon lots of new ones 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.789
 matches the magic the live match 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.560
 gathering seen a bunch of this mine 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.199
 friend who has me particularly 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.780
 impressed interested I want 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.750
 show you one of the combos that this 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.170
 deck uses to win to implement 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.899
 this this combo you will need 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.420
 three things obviously human blue one 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.059
 creature called the great architect 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.050
 which is a creature basically a 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.890
 this 3 a colorless 2 blue hand and says 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.750
 creatures that are blue controls take 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.539
 plus one was one and this is already beautiful 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.630
 additional advantage to mobility at cost 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:12.690
 of blue mana that says a creature 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.420
 target artifact turns blue up 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.800
 at the end of the shift and then at a third 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.990
 skill that says stage a blue creature 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.050
 uncorked you check add two hands 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.020
 in colors you can spend it in your hand 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.530
 this evil only to cast the magi 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.950
 art made or activate artifact abilities 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.950
 the third 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.470
 let's say paper we need to 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.580
 generate this combo and the flickering 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:49.049
 o pd pala is a creature costing two in 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.900
 art colors made flying is a skill 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.259
 particular using two hands e 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.570
 colorless and uncorking the creature you can 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.250
 add human jumps asi color 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.250
 to our hand reserve 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.850
 the use of this condo is simple 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.800
 to generate infinite hand you use 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.539
 the blue mana available for 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.030
 use the first skill 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.000
 of the architect thus making 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.470
 blue our flickering a 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.480
 this point we can use the 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.330
 third ability of the architect there 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.030
 lets you tap a creature to one 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.040
 blue creature to generate 2 mana 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.860
 colorless that can be spent on 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.019
 activate or an artifact ability or 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.790
 to cast an artifact 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.230
 in this case we will use these 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.090
 two colorless hands to activate the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.790
 second ability of the pd pala or del 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.280
 Flickering that precisely consists in 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.440
 pay two hands in colors uncork the 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.360
 philip ale general human of any 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.140
 color we decide to add to the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.970
 our reserve 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.709
 this allows us to create precisely the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.260
 infinite cycle in fact we return to the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.390
 situation that we still have a pd shovel 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
 blue color until the end of the shift 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.459
 the architect who allows us to be able to 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.590
 then reuse his third skill 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.070
 or reappears lipa la for rare dinners 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.680
 2 colorless mana and reuse the 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.420
 same mana in colors to activate the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.670
 second ability of the pallante staff 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.019
 that is, that it uncovers degenerate 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.159
 clearly with this infinite way there 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:21.250
 we must create a closing action 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:25.500
 basically of our deck the three 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.500
 more incisive are the following 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.560
 obviously how not to use like 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.230
 zenith closure of the blue sun is a card 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.819
 blue to point an instant that costs 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.980
 tremana blue and colorless hicks and his 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.040
 function is the following a player a 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.049
 iscat fishing target then shuffles it 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.640
 zenith of the blue sun in the grimoire of his 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.420
 owner we obviously don't play it 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.910
 on ourselves but we play it on ours 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.459
 opponent to make them and catch hicks 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.129
 cards where hicks and the total number 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.730
 of his primary papers this 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:10.690
 precisely to make him lose by the end 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:13.810
 grimoire the second possible closure 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.150
 use a red card that is your own 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.000
 a fire of doom is a sorcery 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.820
 in this case then the play on 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.610
 our round red human cost and hicks e 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.919
 says the fire of doom inflicts hicks 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.979
 damage to a creature or player 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.050
 extra target if hicks is even or 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.770
 greater than 5 in our case is 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.740
 superior since they give infinite the 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.150
 fire of doom cannot be 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.250
 neutralized by magic or skill 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.960
 opponent so there is no way to 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.960
 avoid defeat 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.949
 the other closure comes from the green the 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.900
 spiral naples and a spell that 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:05:02.050
 it cost 1 and 2 skills the first and veil 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.199
 so in short beautiful evasive difficult 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.130
 that if they take it off, it has the ability 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:12.430
 build hicks markers on the 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.699
 spiral pinnacle these tokens if 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.840
 there are 100 or more they make us win the 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.580
 game 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.710
 then of the same in turn in which 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.330
 we get there by coming down who else 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.060
 hopefully we basically have them 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.440
 instantly won I thank you 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.250
 for the attention 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.900
 if you enjoyed this video 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.190
 descriptive of a combo invitation 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.610
 to leave a comment 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.550

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.889
 on its possible use or others 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.659
 valid and efficient combos to generate 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:53.090
 infinite hand thank you and to 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:55.639

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.520
 definitely at least for this video 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.639
 I want to remind you that if you are 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.229
 interested in buying cards from 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.759
 these cards I showed you both for 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.740
 generate a combo that to generate a 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.330
 eventual and closing in a hypothetical 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.580
 deck that if all just this combo 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.180
 and closures to win must 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:18.169
 absolutely go to visit magic but 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.659
 magic market the beautiful site link 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:24.099

 magic grava market 2 points and the link 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:29.539
 go there because the prices are really 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:32.000
 really really low compared to

 those who can care for you 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:42.529
