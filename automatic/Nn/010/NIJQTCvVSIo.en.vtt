00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:53.559 

I<00:00:51.219> can<00:00:52.219> turn<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.489> camera<00:00:52.850> on<00:00:52.909> when<00:00:53.179> come<00:00:53.420> on

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:53.569 
I can turn the camera on when come on

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:58.599 
I can turn the camera on when come on
like<00:00:53.749> so<00:00:55.510> why<00:00:56.510> we<00:00:56.659> sat<00:00:56.870> down<00:00:56.899> here<00:00:57.579> we've<00:00:58.579> seen

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
like so why we sat down here we've seen

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.660 
like so why we sat down here we've seen
as<00:00:58.879> a<00:00:58.909> crosswind<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.139> I<00:01:00.440> fear<00:01:01.129> you're<00:01:01.309> watching

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
as a crosswind so I fear you're watching

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.240 
as a crosswind so I fear you're watching
on<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:01.999> way<00:01:02.149> I<00:01:02.679> want<00:01:03.679> to<00:01:03.739> watch<00:01:03.889> right<00:01:04.100> here<00:01:04.129> I

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
on that way I want to watch right here I

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.820 
on that way I want to watch right here I
figured<00:01:05.000> eventually<00:01:05.320> about<00:01:06.320> where<00:01:06.560> diners

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
figured eventually about where diners

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.060 
figured eventually about where diners
out<00:01:07.130> here<00:01:07.310> standing<00:01:07.550> and<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:09.440> kite<00:01:09.680> appeared

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
out here standing and the kite appeared

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.920 
out here standing and the kite appeared
over<00:01:10.340> here<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:11.000> comes<00:01:11.210> straight<00:01:11.420> downwind

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
over here it comes straight downwind

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.570 
over here it comes straight downwind
like<00:01:12.140> it<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:12.380> know<00:01:12.500> like<00:01:12.650> they<00:01:13.040> do<00:01:13.190> so<00:01:13.370> often

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
like it you know like they do so often

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.000 
like it you know like they do so often
and<00:01:14.180> right<00:01:14.960> about<00:01:15.170> where<00:01:15.380> we<00:01:15.470> initially<00:01:15.800> set

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
and right about where we initially set

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.550 
and right about where we initially set
up<00:01:16.040> is<00:01:16.280> exactly<00:01:16.700> where<00:01:16.940> he<00:01:16.970> pretty<00:01:17.270> much<00:01:17.420> was

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
up is exactly where he pretty much was

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.120 
up is exactly where he pretty much was
taken<00:01:18.560> out<00:01:18.830> to<00:01:19.010> snow<00:01:19.220> I<00:01:20.380> take<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.410> runny<00:01:21.680> shot<00:01:21.920> on

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
taken out to snow I take a runny shot on

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.420 
taken out to snow I take a runny shot on
it

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
it

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.890 
it
take<00:01:22.670> her<00:01:22.760> bunny<00:01:22.910> shot<00:01:23.210> making<00:01:23.480> me<00:01:23.570> work<00:01:23.720> today

that's<00:01:24.230> all<00:01:24.350> right<00:01:24.440> but<00:01:25.340> he<00:01:25.400> was<00:01:25.520> starting<00:01:25.670> to

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
that's all right but he was starting to

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.180 
that's all right but he was starting to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.350 
peel straightaway yeah yeah you saw if
he<00:01:28.340> would<00:01:28.490> go<00:01:28.580> inside<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.940> sign<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.240> what

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
he would go inside to sign it what

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.300 
he would go inside to sign it what
everyone<00:01:29.630> knows<00:01:29.750> yeah<00:01:30.260> I<00:01:30.590> don't<00:01:30.980> have<00:01:31.160> the

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310

experience<00:01:31.400> on<00:01:31.940> yeah

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
experience on yeah

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.870 
experience on yeah
one<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.120> money<00:01:33.240> kites<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:35.310> we're<00:01:35.430> done<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
one of money kites that we're done as a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.600 
one of money kites that we're done as a
midday<00:01:36.180> Wendy<00:01:37.080> yeah<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.400> think

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
midday Wendy yeah but what we think

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.320 
midday Wendy yeah but what we think
about<00:01:38.700> 15<00:01:39.150> mile<00:01:39.330> an<00:01:39.479> hour<00:01:39.570> wind<00:01:39.930> yeah<00:01:40.530> yeah<00:01:41.159> our

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
about 15 mile an hour wind yeah yeah our

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.790 
about 15 mile an hour wind yeah yeah our
way<00:01:42.330> we're<00:01:42.570> calling<00:01:42.869> cross<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:46.500> we'll<00:01:46.619> take

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
way we're calling cross and we'll take

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.899 
way we're calling cross and we'll take
cover<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.250> me<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:47.580> when<00:01:47.729> they<00:01:47.820> up

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
cover with me when they when they up

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.200 
cover with me when they when they up
here<00:01:48.150> you're<00:01:48.900> probably<00:01:49.050> looking<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.670> 150<00:01:50.670> 60

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
here you're probably looking at 150 60

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.210 
here you're probably looking at 150 60
yards<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.720> statistic<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.470> when<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.770> first<00:01:53.070> saw

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
yards a statistic here when I first saw

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.510 
yards a statistic here when I first saw
a<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.610> bit<00:01:53.790> down<00:01:53.940> below<00:01:54.210> great<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.750> so

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
a little bit down below great here so

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
a little bit down below great here so
when<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.610> appear<00:01:56.909> they're<00:01:57.540> gonna<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.780> close

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
when they appear they're gonna be close

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.210 
when they appear they're gonna be close
enough<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.619> bust<00:01:58.890> you

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
enough to bust you

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.770 
enough to bust you
yeah<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.790> that's<00:01:59.880> why<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.360> important

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
yeah so that's why I was so important

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
yeah so that's why I was so important
that<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> think<00:02:02.100> even<00:02:02.340> told<00:02:02.550> me<00:02:02.670> hold

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
that and you I think even told me hold

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.760 
that and you I think even told me hold
up<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.270> he<00:02:03.900> was<00:02:04.020> looking<00:02:04.080> right<00:02:04.259> back<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.680> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
up and he was looking right back if I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
up and he was looking right back if I
were<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> try<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.160> adjust<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.729> him<00:02:05.910> we<00:02:06.479> might

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
were to try to adjust on him we might

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.020 
were to try to adjust on him we might
have<00:02:06.750> saw<00:02:06.899> tail<00:02:07.200> mmm<00:02:07.950> bear<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.640> walk<00:02:08.820> up

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
have saw tail mmm bear just to walk up

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.850 
have saw tail mmm bear just to walk up
they<00:02:09.720> turned<00:02:10.080> his<00:02:10.229> head<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.410> since<00:02:10.679> he<00:02:10.739> turned

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
they turned his head and since he turned

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.290 
they turned his head and since he turned
his<00:02:11.039> head<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.880> when<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.150> get

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
his head I think when we get

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.370 
his head I think when we get
repositioned<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:13.019> him

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
repositioned on him

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.560 
repositioned on him
yeah<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.340> he<00:02:14.670> started<00:02:14.940> charging<00:02:15.120> again

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
yeah and then he started charging again

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.330 
yeah and then he started charging again
and<00:02:15.750> we<00:02:15.810> should<00:02:15.870> end<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.470> being<00:02:16.530> exactly<00:02:16.830> where

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and we should end up being exactly where

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.979 
and we should end up being exactly where
I<00:02:17.370> initially<00:02:17.790> had<00:02:17.910> set<00:02:18.180> up<00:02:18.300> but<00:02:18.540> that's<00:02:18.780> it

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
I initially had set up but that's it

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.449 
I initially had set up but that's it
that's<00:02:19.470> just<00:02:19.620> how<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:19.860> works<00:02:20.010> out<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:20.370> it

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
that's just how it works out but it

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.820 
that's just how it works out but it
worked<00:02:20.610> out<00:02:20.730> good<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.150> come<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.510> down<00:02:21.830> yeah

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
worked out good we come on down yeah

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.470 
worked out good we come on down yeah
when<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.160> gets<00:02:23.340> windy<00:02:23.489> head<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.390> know

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
when it gets windy head to the you know

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.300 
when it gets windy head to the you know
head<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.050> brush<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.470> series<00:02:25.950> he<00:02:26.100> got

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
head to the brush here series he got

00:02:26.310 --> 00:03:05.490 
head to the brush here series he got
that's<00:02:26.610> what<00:02:26.790> we<00:02:26.880> did

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.199 

thirty-eight<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:10.099> was<00:03:10.190> probably<00:03:10.459> about<00:03:10.550> 24

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
thirty-eight so it was probably about 24

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.170 
thirty-eight so it was probably about 24
yards<00:03:11.660> before<00:03:11.870> it
