00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
key features so this is ip67 waterproof

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.880 
key features so this is ip67 waterproof
sand<00:00:36.840> proof<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> pretty<00:00:37.530> much<00:00:37.620> everything

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
sand proof and pretty much everything

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.220 
sand proof and pretty much everything
proof<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.730> claim<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.629> can<00:00:39.809> float<00:00:40.110> in

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
proof is what they claim it can float in

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.900 
proof is what they claim it can float in
water<00:00:40.290> which<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.190> new<00:00:41.340> feature<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
of different stuff right here pretty

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.790 
of different stuff right here pretty
much<00:00:53.850> goes<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.180> further<00:00:54.899> detail<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.620> what

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
much goes into further detail of what

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.220 
much goes into further detail of what
the<00:00:55.890> speaker<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:57.329> anyways<00:00:57.660> let's<00:00:57.960> get

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the speaker can do but anyways let's get

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
into the actual box itself and I think

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.979 
into the actual box itself and I think
there's<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.460> little<00:01:02.579> little<00:01:03.270> tabs<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:03.690> down

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
there's a little little tabs right down

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.929 
there's a little little tabs right down
here<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.580> go<00:01:05.700> think

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
here that you can do there you go think

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.160 
here that you can do there you go think
it<00:01:06.000> figured<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:06.479> right<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.020> get<00:01:07.110> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it figured it out right here you get a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
it figured it out right here you get a
push<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.860> those<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:08.189> tabs<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> bottom

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
push on those two tabs and the bottom

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.840 
push on those two tabs and the bottom
part<00:01:09.450> will<00:01:09.570> actually<00:01:09.810> come<00:01:10.260> off<00:01:10.340> get<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.640> side

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
part will actually come off get one side

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.370 
part will actually come off get one side
off<00:01:12.060> there's<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> other<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.990> comes<00:01:13.170> off

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
off there's the other so it comes off

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
off there's the other so it comes off
like<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.939> looks<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.750> just

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
like that and then looks like you just

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.780 
like that and then looks like you just
slide<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.590> out<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.159> actually<00:01:17.460> get<00:01:17.700> this

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
slide it on out here actually get this

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760 
slide it on out here actually get this
little<00:01:18.030> white<00:01:18.210> box<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.140> let's<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.560> what's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
little white box so let's see what's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.730 
little white box so let's see what's
inside<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.400> first<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.409> wish<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.530> had<00:01:22.619> my

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
inside of this first I wish I had my

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.890 
inside of this first I wish I had my
knife<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.130> me<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> don't<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.570> actually

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
knife on me but I don't so actually

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.580 
knife on me but I don't so actually
let's<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.200> rip<00:01:25.770> open<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.250> box<00:01:26.990> like<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
let's just rip open the box like this so

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.170 
let's just rip open the box like this so
that<00:01:28.619> only<00:01:28.950> weighs<00:01:29.040> too<00:01:29.250> much<00:01:29.280> time<00:01:29.610> unboxing

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
that only weighs too much time unboxing

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140 
that only weighs too much time unboxing
here<00:01:30.829> so<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.310> go<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.729> what's<00:01:33.030> inside

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
here so here we go this is what's inside

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.749 
here so here we go this is what's inside
the<00:01:33.450> white<00:01:33.659> little<00:01:33.840> package<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.860> get<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.040> 3.5

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the white little package you get a 3.5

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.960 
the white little package you get a 3.5
millimeter<00:01:36.320> line<00:01:37.320> right<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.460> also<00:01:38.640> get

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
millimeter line right here you also get

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.399 
millimeter line right here you also get
one<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.180> those<00:01:39.270> Carbineers<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:40.079> I'm<00:01:40.200> saying
