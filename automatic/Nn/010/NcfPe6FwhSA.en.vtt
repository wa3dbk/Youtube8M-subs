00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.469
 to climb a lot less modern warfare 3 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.180
 now now that it is not fun 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.620

 stop uploading you know lately 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.269
 I'm varying a lot on the subject of 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.519
 the call of duty and I have become 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.949
 returned to play black ops these states 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.390

 battlefield 3 so I'll be alternating 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.000
 between the call of duty and bates filtres 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.080
 in this youtube channel obviously in 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.350
 the walt channel but stay with 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.539

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.520
 of which trucks in quotation marks when 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.080
 finish jack 2 and I have a desire for 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.960
 I really want to start the new ones 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.640
 games because mother of mine jack 2 already at 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.560
 final it is not that it is getting tired 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.380
 but I want to finish it a fucking time already 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.010
 power and I want to start the new world 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.650
 3 what will be 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.240
 feels feels safe among those who 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.810
 those who see me jacques 2 surely 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.360
 you know what games are and if you do not know 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.650
 please therefore attend not the video itself 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.850
 but also the comments because I 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.860
 you have asked and I have answered 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.590
 so there's no problem surely 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.240
 when the new one starts which contest does not 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.430
 you know today, you know, I'll do it here because 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.740
 I also want to attract followers in the 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.330
 new series obviously what I want 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.090
 are subscribers in the other channel and 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.340
 How many more as if we are better so 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.020
 so there is no kind of problem and 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.260
 Well, if I told you why you have 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.630
 been half an hour watching one thing 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.760
 this half hour watching me create a 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.400
 class changing the logo I think that 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.320
 also and good if I told you that this is 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.470
 the first game with 50 megabytes in the 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.120
 Warfare mode 3 would you believe me if children and 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.360
 believe me fuck believe me that is the first 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.310
 game with 50 megabytes and my mother goes like 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.070
 a fucking shot is awesome four 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.410
 stripes obviously before with six megabytes 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.240
 with open ports is certainly 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.950
 if you have mega of timphonica and do not open 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.080
 the ports are going pretty bad so 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.890
 open the ports and thus they assure you 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.380
 to have 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.510
 it's nothing open that gives you but it's not 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.069
 a security to have at least 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.420
 I move when missing is three stripes three stripes 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.459
 almost always, even if you play at 2 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.590
 the morning the truth is that the search 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.690
 of modern warfare 3 is what 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.520
 better than there is a lot better than 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.220
 modern warfare 2 much better than in 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.010
 black ops and the truth is that even with 6 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.120
 megas the connection is quite good 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.010
 obviously with 50 megabytes subject with a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.510
 fucking shots to it is as if it were 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.280
 playing online and that's what happens today 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.110
 I'm with witnesses as if he lives as if 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.910
 had playing land in fact in the 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.880
 first streak I get with 50 megabytes 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.040
 is 17 and I have been dotted to dot 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.110
 to get my mother out okay, I killed an uncle 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.760
 that surely the mere 50 megabytes had 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.100
 100 because it kills me one on one 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.959
 you know that with 50 megabytes or having better 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.120
 connection that the other ones against 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.680
 ones because it gives you a pretty advantage 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.170
 pretty clear the people who say that 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.570
 but if having 50 megabytes does not give you almost 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.690
 nothing security lie lie man 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.640
 lie gives you a lot of much 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.770
 security in yourself and I do not know how 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.210
 explain it but it gives you an advantage 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.700
 pretty pretty clear enemy but 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.200
 but awesome I already say it helps 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.240
 like a shot as you will me the land 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.550
 and before with 6 megabytes obviously 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.190
 the heene markers I shot by 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.020
 true is the typical the typical shot of 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.000
 swords with modern warfare2 shoot 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.670
 yes to the medium according to new to the second 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.370
 they are the hit marker and it gives you more 50 than 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.690
 right now with 50 megabytes it is 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.010
 instantaneous I think that before 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.200
 shoot him before giving the trigger to the 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.000
 xbox is already one at the most 57 jean marker 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.950
 because yes it is impressive as 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.360
 I say it's impressive and good because I think 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.430
 that I'm going to stop going up as I tell you 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.609
 modern warfare 3 or at least I'll upload 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.549
 one a video or two as much very much 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.170
 a week because as I say neither nor 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.750
 You really like modern warfare 3 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.090
 I do not like it that much, so we're going to 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.160
 erase it not today man is not not that 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.870
 I like it a lot because I'm going to play it 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.700
 keep playing but you end up getting tired 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.530
 it's impossible to play an afternoon 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.450
 whole this game is also impossible 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.160
 play the xbox a whole afternoon then 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.540
 imagine with this game in the modern 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.050
 warfare2 maybe yes I can but this 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.050
 game is that it is 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.020
 maybe I have things have good things 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.300
 but there comes a moment that you say is that 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.910
 no no I do not know a game more than what for 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.700
 because for a bad game does not yield 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.140
 Sincerely, maybe it's an ether of 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.880
 modern warfare 3 as I am also from 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.260
 battlefield 3 by the way shortly 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.630
 you also have a video of battlefield 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.220
 clarifying the gameplay of the other day of 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.140
 battlefield 3 so we are attentive 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.370
 I also do not know if when I do not know when 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.350
 it will be what I have pointed the time is 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.540
 that lately I'm doing a 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.400
 Schedule pretty clear weekly schedule 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.280
 Weekly cons with all the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.040
 gameplays of the week and so well I 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.180
 I organize better obviously and good as 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.100
 I tell you 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.660
 within little also have the gameplay of 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.220
 battlefield 3 and good already finishing the 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.370
 gameplay I do not know how much is left will be a 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.440
 minute or minute and little else I do not know 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.419
 I really do not know and well, the game 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.190
 easy enough I obviously leader 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.080
 I do not know if it was host I think it was not game 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.479
 it's because the game 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.270
 I did not find the bus 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.069
 that I believe the game so it was not 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.659
 host but but my mother is that as 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.879
 I say it goes like a bloody extra shot with 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.949
 these faces that is a gun cucumber the 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:49.259
 I prefer I liked car l with 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.629
 recoil that the acr with recoil me 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.879
 like it's better weapon more powerful kills 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:55.409
 three bullets with good muffler 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:58.110
 cadence from the hip goes pretty 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.430
 well now is that it is a very very very very weapon 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.199
 good and very interesting 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.270
 obviously I like it more because there are other 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.129
 I like the type but but is 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.280
 face raised it goes like a shot goes to me 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.599
 the luxury good eye and there and almost me 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.340
 kill kill me but that is just the 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.379
 departure sorry mother does not designate me 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.120
 that I have by the way my mother and good 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:18.930
 you see the four stripes that I have that go 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.090
 as a shot cons are 4 1 2 3 4 mother 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.219
 diagnosis that I always count 5 and it's that 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.569
