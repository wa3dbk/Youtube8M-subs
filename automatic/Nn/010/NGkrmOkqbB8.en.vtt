00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
for a while after that's really the test

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.900 
for a while after that's really the test
for<00:01:54.720> me<00:01:54.870> is<00:01:55.020> how<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.980> keep<00:01:56.220> thinking<00:01:56.670> about

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
for me is how do I keep thinking about

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.460 
for me is how do I keep thinking about
it<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.479> how<00:01:57.600> long<00:01:57.660> do<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.200> keep<00:01:58.410> thinking

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
it and for how long do I keep thinking

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.280 
it and for how long do I keep thinking
about<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.390> but<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.750> just<00:02:00.990> wasn't

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
about it and but then it just wasn't

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.540 
about it and but then it just wasn't
possible<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.890> together<00:02:02.040> because<00:02:02.310> I

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
possible to get it together because I

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.719 
possible to get it together because I
was<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> middle<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> making<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.479> film<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
was in the middle of making a film and

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.010 
was in the middle of making a film and
you<00:02:05.729> know<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:06.300> just<00:02:06.360> wasn't<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:06.960> happen

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
you know it just wasn't going to happen

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.040 
you know it just wasn't going to happen
um<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.160> then<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.240> was<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.390> kind<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.959> was

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
um and then it was just kind of it was

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.600 
um and then it was just kind of it was
actually<00:02:10.380> quite<00:02:10.590> impulsive<00:02:10.920> i<00:02:11.280> called<00:02:11.490> up

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
actually quite impulsive i called up

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.600 
actually quite impulsive i called up
Scott<00:02:12.650> just<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.740> be<00:02:13.830> supportive<00:02:14.340> because<00:02:14.459> I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
Scott just to be supportive because I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.949 
Scott just to be supportive because I
assumed<00:02:14.940> he'd<00:02:15.090> moved<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.660> he<00:02:15.750> would<00:02:15.870> have
