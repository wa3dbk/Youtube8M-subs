00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
quitting call of duty I thought that was

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
quitting call of duty I thought that was
kind<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.130> interesting<00:00:23.279> because<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:24.180> quit<00:00:24.600> call

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
kind of interesting because I quit call

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990 
kind of interesting because I quit call
of<00:00:25.170> duty<00:00:25.439> recently<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.609> know<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.880> not

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
of duty recently to you know it's not

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
just something that he's going through I

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.980 
just something that he's going through I
think<00:00:29.580> many<00:00:30.000> people<00:00:30.269> are<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.539> through<00:00:30.689> this

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
think many people are going through this

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.330 
think many people are going through this
and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.560> trying<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.830> understand<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
and I was trying to understand the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.150 
and I was trying to understand the
reason<00:00:32.640> why<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.350> did<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.680> didn't<00:00:34.920> want<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
reason why I did I just didn't want to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
reason why I did I just didn't want to
play<00:00:35.250> call<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.550> duty<00:00:35.700> anymore<00:00:36.590> when<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> was

younger<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.190> used<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.579> always<00:00:38.610> get<00:00:39.120> hype<00:00:39.480> over<00:00:39.870> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
younger I used to always get hype over a

younger I used to always get hype over a
new<00:00:40.739> game<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.010> came<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.430> or<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> new<00:00:42.059> game<00:00:42.329> in

a franchise that I like came out and
that's<00:00:44.730> all<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.149> cared<00:00:45.510> about<00:00:45.600> was<00:00:45.899> I

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that's all I really cared about was I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.590 
that's all I really cared about was I
really<00:00:46.170> cared<00:00:46.410> about<00:00:46.500> only<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.520> game<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.059> I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
really cared about only the game and I

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.990 
really cared about only the game and I
didn't<00:00:48.899> really<00:00:48.989> look<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.590> who<00:00:50.160> actually<00:00:50.430> made

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
didn't really look at who actually made

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000 
didn't really look at who actually made
the<00:00:51.030> game<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.079> found<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.829> grow

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the game but I I found that as I grow

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.240 
the game but I I found that as I grow
older<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.370> started<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.360> take<00:00:54.960> notice<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.949> who

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.630 
are the creators of these games and it
doesn't<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.530> apply<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> only<00:00:59.070> games<00:00:59.460> it

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
they made so many other great things in

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.770 
they made so many other great things in
the<00:01:34.979> past<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:36.150> sort<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.479> has<00:01:36.630> this

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
the past this sort of has this

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
the past this sort of has this
reputation<00:01:37.170> tied<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.130> whatever<00:01:38.400> valve<00:01:38.700> makes

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
reputation tied to whatever valve makes

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.490 
reputation tied to whatever valve makes
and<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.479> probably<00:01:40.020> valve<00:01:40.320> has

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and that I know probably valve has

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.740 
and that I know probably valve has
really<00:01:41.070> high<00:01:41.250> standards<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.240> production

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
really high standards for production

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.179 
really high standards for production
stuff<00:01:42.930> before<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.409> know<00:01:43.649> their<00:01:43.799> production

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
stuff before you know their production

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.649 
stuff before you know their production
quality<00:01:44.399> before<00:01:44.670> anything<00:01:45.119> gets<00:01:45.210> released

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
quality before anything gets released

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.080 
quality before anything gets released
and<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.920> kind<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.250> company<00:01:47.790> who

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and I like that kind of company who

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.260 
and I like that kind of company who
takes<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.110> time<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.740> say<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.310> yeah<00:01:50.850> it's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
takes the time to say like yeah it's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
takes the time to say like yeah it's
gonna<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.630> released<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.680> done<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
gonna be released when it's done you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.100 
gonna be released when it's done you
know<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> whole<00:01:53.549> valve<00:01:53.850> type<00:01:54.149> thing<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.990> know

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
know the whole valve type thing you know

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.380 
know the whole valve type thing you know
the<00:01:55.649> reason<00:01:55.979> why<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> think<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.090> create

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the reason why I think that they create

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.120 
the reason why I think that they create
such<00:01:57.570> great<00:01:57.869> things<00:01:58.110> because<00:01:58.619> they<00:01:58.770> really

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
such great things because they really

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.740 
such great things because they really
think<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.579> through<00:01:59.610> that's<00:02:00.240> why<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:00.600> had<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
think it through that's why they had to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.810 
think it through that's why they had to
invent<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.409> whole<00:02:01.619> valvetime<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.520> sort<00:02:02.790> of

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
invent this whole valvetime as sort of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.050 
invent this whole valvetime as sort of
an<00:02:02.969> excuse<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:04.020> say<00:02:04.229> guys<00:02:04.649> hold<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.880> gonna

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
an excuse to say guys hold on it's gonna

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.359 
an excuse to say guys hold on it's gonna
be<00:02:06.270> done<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.840> done<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:07.920> gonna<00:02:08.160> be

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
be done when it's done but it's gonna be

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.240 
be done when it's done but it's gonna be
awesome<00:02:09.229> now<00:02:10.229> I'm<00:02:10.349> not<00:02:10.410> saying<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.009> these

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
awesome now I'm not saying that these

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.090 
awesome now I'm not saying that these
companies<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:12.030> do<00:02:12.300> no<00:02:12.540> wrong

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
companies can do no wrong

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.370 
companies can do no wrong
because<00:02:13.370> sometimes<00:02:13.610> I<00:02:14.150> feel<00:02:14.750> like<00:02:14.780> they<00:02:15.170> might

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
because sometimes I feel like they might

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.990 
because sometimes I feel like they might
have<00:02:15.560> screwed<00:02:15.800> up<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.160> little<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:16.520> something

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
have screwed up a little on something

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.850 
have screwed up a little on something
and<00:02:17.270> I<00:02:17.450> okay<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:17.900> say<00:02:18.200> even<00:02:18.380> though<00:02:18.560> I'm<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> big

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
and I okay to say even though I'm a big

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.780 
and I okay to say even though I'm a big
fan<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.250> company<00:02:19.640> I'm<00:02:20.030> okay<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.510> say<00:02:20.780> that

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
fan the company I'm okay to say that

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.830 
fan the company I'm okay to say that
something<00:02:22.790> might<00:02:22.970> have<00:02:23.090> failed<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.810> it

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
something might have failed and it

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.840 
something might have failed and it
probably<00:02:24.320> is<00:02:24.560> not<00:02:24.680> going<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.040> way<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.310> they

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
probably is not going the way that they

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.310 
probably is not going the way that they
expected<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.420> i<00:02:26.510> think<00:02:26.780> that's<00:02:26.990> what<00:02:27.140> they<00:02:27.260> did

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
expected it i think that's what they did

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.810 
expected it i think that's what they did
with<00:02:27.530> alien<00:02:27.950> swarm<00:02:28.250> i<00:02:28.340> think<00:02:28.550> that's<00:02:28.670> one

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
with alien swarm i think that's one

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.280 
with alien swarm i think that's one
example<00:02:28.940> i'm<00:02:29.360> trying<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.900> think<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:30.170> that

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
example i'm trying to think of that

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.530 
example i'm trying to think of that
valve<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.310> know<00:02:31.430> like<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.850> didn't<00:02:32.390> seem<00:02:32.510> like

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
valve you know like it didn't seem like

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.840 
valve you know like it didn't seem like
alien<00:02:33.020> swarm<00:02:33.380> lived<00:02:33.680> up<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.100> expectation

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
alien swarm lived up to the expectation

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.540 
alien swarm lived up to the expectation
of<00:02:35.030> what<00:02:35.300> valve<00:02:35.570> usually<00:02:36.050> makes<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.070> in<00:02:37.430> that

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
of what valve usually makes so in that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.160 
of what valve usually makes so in that
case<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:38.330> might<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.660> been<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.780> fail<00:02:39.140> but

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
case that might have been a fail but

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.650 
case that might have been a fail but
they<00:02:40.160> created<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:40.730> many<00:02:40.850> great<00:02:41.120> things<00:02:41.180> i

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
they created so many great things i

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.930 
they created so many great things i
think<00:02:41.900> i<00:02:42.080> can<00:02:42.140> let<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.410> one<00:02:42.710> go<00:02:42.920> now<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
think i can let that one go now the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.670 
think i can let that one go now the
steam<00:02:44.420> box<00:02:44.450> which<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:44.960> supposed<00:02:45.350> to<00:02:45.470> come<00:02:45.650> out

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
steam box which is supposed to come out

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.370 
steam box which is supposed to come out
this<00:02:46.040> year<00:02:46.100> i'm<00:02:46.850> not<00:02:47.210> so<00:02:47.420> sure<00:02:47.450> about<00:02:47.900> because

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
this year i'm not so sure about because

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.860 
this year i'm not so sure about because
valve<00:02:48.710> to<00:02:48.950> me<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.670> software<00:02:50.180> company<00:02:50.480> that's

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
valve to me is a software company that's

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.360 
valve to me is a software company that's
what<00:02:51.050> they<00:02:51.200> excel<00:02:51.560> at<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:51.890> that's<00:02:52.010> what<00:02:52.220> they

services<00:02:55.240> but<00:02:56.240> this<00:02:56.660> is<00:02:56.810> their<00:02:56.990> first<00:02:57.020> attempt

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
services but this is their first attempt

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.890 
services but this is their first attempt
at<00:02:57.740> doing<00:02:57.980> something<00:02:58.340> hardware<00:02:59.240> related<00:02:59.480> now

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
at doing something hardware related now

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.990 
at doing something hardware related now
I'm<00:03:00.110> not<00:03:00.410> really<00:03:00.620> sure<00:03:00.740> if<00:03:00.950> valve<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.610> going<00:03:01.850> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
I'm not really sure if valve is going to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.730 
I'm not really sure if valve is going to
they're<00:03:02.480> probably<00:03:02.690> going<00:03:02.960> to<00:03:03.140> but<00:03:03.440> I'm<00:03:03.590> not

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
they're probably going to but I'm not

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.770 
they're probably going to but I'm not
sure<00:03:03.770> they're<00:03:04.010> gonna<00:03:04.070> make<00:03:04.400> their<00:03:04.670> own<00:03:05.000> steam

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
sure they're gonna make their own steam

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.300 
sure they're gonna make their own steam
machine<00:03:06.200> because<00:03:06.500> they've<00:03:06.650> asked<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.040> lot<00:03:07.250> of

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
machine because they've asked a lot of

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.830

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
was just talking with the developers of

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.080 
was just talking with the developers of
steam<00:03:33.890> boxes<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.460> thought<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.760> was<00:03:34.970> pretty

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
steam boxes I thought that was pretty

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.930 
steam boxes I thought that was pretty
funny<00:03:35.240> but<00:03:35.890> yeah<00:03:36.890> valve<00:03:37.250> moving<00:03:37.640> into<00:03:37.820> this

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
funny but yeah valve moving into this

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.520 
funny but yeah valve moving into this
hardware<00:03:38.390> space<00:03:38.630> is<00:03:38.780> going<00:03:38.960> to<00:03:39.020> be<00:03:39.110> kind<00:03:39.410> of

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
hardware space is going to be kind of

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.140 
hardware space is going to be kind of
interesting<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.190> kind<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.430> weird<00:03:40.700> for<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.030> lot

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
interesting and kind of weird for a lot

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.120 
interesting and kind of weird for a lot
of<00:03:41.180> people<00:03:41.300> but<00:03:41.720> I<00:03:41.780> think<00:03:42.080> more<00:03:42.650> people<00:03:42.920> are

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
of people but I think more people are

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.890 
of people but I think more people are
gonna<00:03:43.250> be<00:03:43.430> willing<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.910> adopt<00:03:44.330> a<00:03:44.600> steam

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
gonna be willing to adopt a steam

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.920 
gonna be willing to adopt a steam
machine<00:03:45.320> because<00:03:46.160> valve<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:47.270> behind<00:03:47.630> this

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
machine because valve is behind this

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.300 
machine because valve is behind this
whole<00:03:48.170> thing<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:48.500> think<00:03:48.680> if<00:03:48.770> it<00:03:48.890> was<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.040> random

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
whole thing I think if it was a random

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.550 
whole thing I think if it was a random
company<00:03:49.880> that<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.090> didn't<00:03:50.420> know<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:51.020> would<00:03:51.200> be<00:03:51.260> a

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
company that I didn't know it would be a

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.800 
company that I didn't know it would be a
bigger<00:03:51.980> risk<00:03:52.370> for<00:03:52.520> me<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.210> try<00:03:53.420> and<00:03:53.450> get<00:03:53.720> this

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
bigger risk for me to try and get this

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.050 
bigger risk for me to try and get this
brand<00:03:54.170> new<00:03:54.410> thing<00:03:54.710> but<00:03:55.160> because<00:03:55.460> valve<00:03:55.790> has

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
brand new thing but because valve has

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.330 
brand new thing but because valve has
this<00:03:56.150> reputation<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.960> creating<00:03:57.650> great<00:03:58.010> things

decided
quit<00:04:26.090> call<00:04:26.360> of<00:04:26.510> duty<00:04:26.780> is<00:04:26.960> because<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.680> started

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
quit call of duty is because I started

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.070 
quit call of duty is because I started
to<00:04:28.070> notice<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.760> developers<00:04:29.390> of<00:04:29.420> call<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:29.780> duty

to notice the developers of call of duty

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.900

franchise<00:05:53.990> they're<00:05:54.500> creating<00:05:55.010> important

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.130 
franchise they're creating important
technologies<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:56.240> can<00:05:56.390> be<00:05:56.510> used<00:05:56.780> in<00:05:57.020> other

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
technologies that can be used in other

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.290 
technologies that can be used in other
ways<00:05:57.410> and<00:05:57.710> in<00:05:57.770> different<00:05:57.800> games<00:05:58.460> and<00:05:58.820> I<00:05:59.150> can

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
ways and in different games and I can

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.630 
ways and in different games and I can
just<00:05:59.330> imagine<00:05:59.720> what<00:06:00.680> battlefront<00:06:01.370> is<00:06:01.460> gonna

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
just imagine what battlefront is gonna

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.090 
just imagine what battlefront is gonna
look<00:06:01.880> like<00:06:02.090> and<00:06:02.390> feel<00:06:02.630> like<00:06:02.660> when<00:06:03.620> they<00:06:04.070> used

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
look like and feel like when they used

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.580 
look like and feel like when they used
the<00:06:04.970> Frostbite<00:06:05.660> 3<00:06:05.690> engine<00:06:05.960> I<00:06:06.260> think<00:06:06.470> it's

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
the Frostbite 3 engine I think it's

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.650 
the Frostbite 3 engine I think it's
going<00:06:06.710> to<00:06:06.770> be<00:06:06.920> pretty<00:06:07.100> cool<00:06:07.460> so<00:06:08.090> I<00:06:08.330> sort<00:06:08.600> of

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
going to be pretty cool so I sort of

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.160 
going to be pretty cool so I sort of
have<00:06:08.900> this<00:06:09.140> expectation<00:06:09.820> for<00:06:10.820> dice<00:06:11.420> creating

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
have this expectation for dice creating

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.220 
have this expectation for dice creating
new<00:06:12.440> games<00:06:13.060> now<00:06:14.060> I'm<00:06:14.240> not<00:06:14.420> saying<00:06:14.720> that<00:06:14.930> only
