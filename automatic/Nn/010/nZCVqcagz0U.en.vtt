and that's how to make it and again it

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.699 
and that's how to make it and again it
doesn't<00:04:06.979> curtain<00:04:07.979> make<00:04:08.340> this<00:04:08.639> and<00:04:09.000> crooked

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
doesn't curtain make this and crooked

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.140 
doesn't curtain make this and crooked
