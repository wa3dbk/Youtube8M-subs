00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.420

 mister pomeroy christian and perky as well 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.369
 for fabio and madison this applies 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.260
 wisdom especially for you 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 stories are the stories of one 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.539
 great friendship between human and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.640
 animal vita assistant dogs is a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.619
 nonprofit association of people with 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 Disabilities an animal helper 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.970
 on the side is the assistant dog 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.190
 helps to more independence and 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.980
 Quality of life is partner and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.809
 icebreaker also the social pedagogue 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.930
 tatjana kreidler has been in existence since its founding 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.489
 of their club 40 teams of human and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.980
 dog successfully brought together around the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.289
 People benefit so much that they return 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.789
 are integrated into the society that 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.010
 Just live a whole again 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.050
 It's great to have another meaning 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.960
 what to feel there you do something 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.000
 right that fits together vita is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.789
 internationally certified and 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.979
 integrated as the first association in europe 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:11.479
 also disabled children and 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.479
 Adolescents in the project 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.360
 i have a lot of kids right now 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.680
 watching how sad children are and 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.480
 like withdrawn and isolated and there 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.250
 I even have it ok, why not 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.180
 it must be easy for children 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.530
 function 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.200
 the problem is simply the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.380
 responsibility the child grows along with it 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.280
 The dog just and the dog grows with 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.050
 the child in a harmonious relationship 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.070
 it is hard to see what is going on 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.770
 develop from it 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.630
 the most important prerequisite for this is 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.500
 that dog and owner really are together 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.450
 fit 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.880
 The right matching is very important 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.440
 that the dog fits the child the child 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.900
 to the dog or the dog in 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.030
 things fit in the family and we 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.790
 really build these relationships completely 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.560
 slowly open up and leave the dog so much 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.600
 time as he just needs also he 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.310
 says okay, I can get involved 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.030
 and then we basically start at first 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.580
 work 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.950
 Tobias and Tom have been here for several months 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.550
 a team also with them was first 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.120
 pay close attention to the character 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.739
 when matching in the spring of this year 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.230
 was looked at which and best 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.450
 fits and then ran on the tree 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.570
 out there because too easy 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.519
 handle is out of the wheelchair and 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.400
 we just have his character 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.950
 I like what he likes in a happy round 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.280
 wants and it ran then so from the beginning 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.350
 until the official handover of the dog 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.290
 his training includes his training 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.320
 around 400 to 500 common 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.450
 have tobias and camera exercise 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.030
 which are now completed and become 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.480
 soon home for the first time together 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.030
 drive 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.330
 that will be very exciting and completely different 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.610
 live a big conversion with gassi 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.709
 go and labor market will be yes 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.090
 also nice if we can then help as 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.000
 friend stands to the side 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.310
 The six-year-old Fabio is from birth 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.769
 limited in his motor skills since 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.230
 Only a few months later he has madison 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.170
 by his side 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.629
 we have some progress in the 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.540
 Merger found it were 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:24.310
 moor his feet so i believe 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.280
 It was two years and we got it 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.900
 always tried no chance and 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.049
 Here it was like that at the first unit 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.810
 the tatjana kreidler has declared that it 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.190
 so is not that constantly the madison 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.780
 is kicked and it's totally dark 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.540
 uncomfortable as it would not at 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.430
 stay with him and since that day it is 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.750
 actually no topic anymore and 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.370
 The first is when you are in a wheelchair 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.370
 fix feet 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.549
 Fabio can not speak and calls 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.620
 Madison therefore with a loud one 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.680
 Friendship like hers does not need any 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.599
 words and motivates fabio to ever new ones 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.579
 respectively 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.650
 At the beginning we have oatmeal 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.420
 between forefinger dream and have 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.030
 then of the urban, that is enough 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.099
 we do a lot and now he gets out of that 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.720
 bag out and on the lap and it is 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.900
 for us, of course, every time was robin 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.530
 and its bidder and connor are since 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.419
 2012 a team 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.130
 he is also suffering from a disease 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.169
 restricted for the everyday 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:35.720
 Therefore , connor is a twelve-year-old 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:41.090
 friend and helper can also tasks what 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.130
 falls down robin communicates 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.440
 meanwhile very different with people in 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.000
 his environment 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.800
 Quite similar is it with christian 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.110
 and his dog biscuit 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.360
 For four years, the two are one 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.750
 Team Christian's mother is thrilled 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.780
 how cheeky her son's life 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:03.250
 has been changed by the dog 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.080
 demanded that way in a manner 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.060
 not at all he would be different 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.229
 perceived as a dog owner 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.159
 perceived and I 'll do it 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.229
 wheelchair Accessibility 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:13.340
 that makes quite a lot out of many 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.139
 people do not dare either 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.599
 someone in the rolli and handicapped 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.919
 to address and about a dog 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.440
 Simplify is simply a bridge and 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.110
 Door opening really in the truest sense 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.909
 of the word as a therapist four paws 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.130
 Kristen has changed incredibly 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.120
 Christian is more self-confident 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.860
 he has a completely different one 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.440
 charisma just works a lot differently 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.210
 self-confident awake so I can 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.070
 no longer imagine how that was without 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.260
 without a click 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.300
 tatjana kreidler has many 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.660
 impressive stories like designer 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:55.790
 experienced that was also my first child 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:58.250
 At one point, Tatjana is said to be the team 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.760
 best medicine around the world said 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.280
 okay, why the never goes to the end and that 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.050
 are the moments where you know that yes 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.300
 right thing even make the 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.990
 Initial training of a assistant dog 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.970
 costs an average of 25,000 euros 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.250
 Hardly a competitor can muster 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.840
 and again funded 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.950
 exclusively through donations and 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.770
 conveying members 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.230
 For many years Fressnapf supports 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.390
 the work of vita with it also in 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.560
 future friendship can arise 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.560
 change lives
