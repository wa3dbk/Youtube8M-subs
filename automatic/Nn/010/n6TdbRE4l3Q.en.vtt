00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.840 
that on a piece of paper or something
just<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> true<00:01:44.460> essence<00:01:44.759> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
just so you can get the true essence of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.600 
just so you can get the true essence of
the<00:01:44.939> sentence<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.420> how<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.659> works<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.170> you

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
the sentence and how it works for you

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.560 
the sentence and how it works for you
okay<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:49.909> definitely<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.210> black

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
okay so I definitely get that black

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.690 
okay so I definitely get that black
raspberry<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.470> mean<00:01:52.740> that's<00:01:52.920> very<00:01:53.009> prominent

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
raspberry I mean that's very prominent

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.270 
raspberry I mean that's very prominent
and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.049> Mirabelle<00:01:55.470> plum<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:56.100> don't

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and I think that Mirabelle plum I don't

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.260 
and I think that Mirabelle plum I don't
really<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> difference<00:01:56.850> between<00:01:57.119> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
really know the difference between a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.420 
really know the difference between a
Mirabelle<00:01:57.659> plum<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.320> plum<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:01:59.280> just

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
Mirabelle plum and a plum so I'm just

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.910 
Mirabelle plum and a plum so I'm just
going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.640> say<00:01:59.790> plum<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:00.780> smell<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.469> it's<00:02:01.740> I

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
going to say plum I do smell that it's I

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.870 
going to say plum I do smell that it's I
think<00:02:02.130> that's<00:02:02.250> what<00:02:02.399> makes<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.790> little

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
think that's what makes it a little

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.480 
think that's what makes it a little
richer<00:02:03.710> it's<00:02:04.710> nice

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
richer it's nice

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.749 
richer it's nice
in<00:02:05.910> cents<00:02:06.500> definitely<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> get<00:02:07.980> a<00:02:08.220> lot<00:02:08.640> of

a little bit before going into a crowded
room<00:04:44.820> I<00:04:46.050> have<00:04:47.050> noticed<00:04:47.410> some<00:04:47.440> differences

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
room I have noticed some differences

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.890

within<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.370> products<00:04:48.820> with<00:04:49.330> instead<00:04:49.690> wise

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
within the products with instead wise

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.570 
within the products with instead wise
which<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.680> think<00:04:50.860> it's<00:04:50.950> a<00:04:51.010> good<00:04:51.160> thing<00:04:51.220> because

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
which I think it's a good thing because

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.420 
which I think it's a good thing because
I<00:04:51.790> think<00:04:51.880> when<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:52.690> layer<00:04:52.900> it<00:04:52.930> all<00:04:53.230> it<00:04:54.160> really

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
I think when you layer it all it really

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.220 
I think when you layer it all it really
comes<00:04:54.640> together<00:04:54.880> as<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.240> fragrance<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.020> like

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
the EDT would do because in my

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.300 
the EDT would do because in my
experience<00:05:19.479> I<00:05:20.110> wouldn't<00:05:20.380> even<00:05:20.440> need<00:05:20.770> an<00:05:20.860> EDT

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
experience I wouldn't even need an EDT

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.620 
experience I wouldn't even need an EDT
so<00:05:22.150> that's<00:05:23.110> cool<00:05:23.580> one<00:05:24.580> big<00:05:24.850> difference<00:05:25.300> I

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
so that's cool one big difference I

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.690 
so that's cool one big difference I
noticed<00:05:25.990> is<00:05:26.200> the<00:05:26.229> difference<00:05:26.680> between<00:05:26.740> the

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
noticed is the difference between the

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.969 
noticed is the difference between the
body<00:05:28.090> cream<00:05:28.390> and<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.720> body<00:05:28.840> lotion<00:05:29.320> the

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
body cream and the body lotion the

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.770 
body cream and the body lotion the
lotion<00:05:30.400> in<00:05:30.550> my<00:05:30.580> opinion<00:05:31.120> that<00:05:31.150> has<00:05:31.479> a<00:05:31.540> lot<00:05:31.750> more

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
lotion in my opinion that has a lot more

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.080 
lotion in my opinion that has a lot more
consents<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.620> this<00:05:33.070> has<00:05:33.250> a<00:05:33.280> lot<00:05:33.460> more<00:05:33.490> berries

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
consents and this has a lot more berries

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.670 
consents and this has a lot more berries
so<00:05:34.600> if<00:05:34.660> you're<00:05:34.780> looking<00:05:34.870> for<00:05:35.140> more<00:05:35.290> of<00:05:35.320> a<00:05:35.440> berry

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
so if you're looking for more of a berry

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.080 
so if you're looking for more of a berry
scent<00:05:35.979> I<00:05:36.160> would<00:05:36.310> definitely<00:05:36.669> recommend<00:05:36.729> the

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
scent I would definitely recommend the

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.240 
scent I would definitely recommend the
body<00:05:37.240> cream<00:05:37.570> if<00:05:38.290> you're<00:05:38.470> looking<00:05:38.710> for<00:05:38.979> kind<00:05:39.130> of

body cream if you're looking for kind of

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.400 
body cream if you're looking for kind of
more<00:05:39.900> complex

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
more complex

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.650 
more complex
go<00:05:42.250> for<00:05:42.490> lotion<00:05:42.669> this<00:05:43.120> is<00:05:43.270> just<00:05:43.419> my<00:05:43.540> opinion

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
go for lotion this is just my opinion

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.750 
go for lotion this is just my opinion
people<00:05:44.500> could<00:05:44.800> interpret<00:05:45.040> this<00:05:45.310> differently

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
people could interpret this differently
