other day with the TNT mega bomb which

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.290 
other day with the TNT mega bomb which
was<00:00:28.619> essentially<00:00:28.950> like<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.250> million<00:00:29.669> minecarts

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
was essentially like a million minecarts

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.749 
was essentially like a million minecarts
with<00:00:30.540> TNT<00:00:31.020> on<00:00:31.259> top<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.619> each<00:00:31.680> other<00:00:31.829> a<00:00:32.099> lot<00:00:32.610> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
with TNT on top of each other a lot of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.370 
with TNT on top of each other a lot of
people<00:00:32.850> said<00:00:33.090> well<00:00:33.239> hey<00:00:33.450> why<00:00:33.989> don't<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.200> use

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
people said well hey why don't you use

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.050 
people said well hey why don't you use
that<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.680> kill<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> wither<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.850> thought

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
that to kill the wither and I thought

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.260 
that to kill the wither and I thought
wow<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.989> know<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.739> might<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.220> work<00:00:38.550> so

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
wow you know that might actually work so

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.850 
wow you know that might actually work so
that<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.660> our<00:00:39.750> plan<00:00:39.870> today<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.770> are

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
that is our plan today so here we are

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.800 
that is our plan today so here we are
coming<00:00:41.100> down<00:00:41.130> into<00:00:41.579> our<00:00:41.730> bunker<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.510> death

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
coming down into our bunker of death

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.200 
coming down into our bunker of death
which<00:00:43.380> unfortunately<00:00:44.130> typically<00:00:44.820> results<00:00:45.180> in

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
which unfortunately typically results in

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.520 
which unfortunately typically results in
our<00:00:45.360> death<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.720> opposed<00:00:45.990> to<00:00:46.080> that<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.380> wear

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
our death as opposed to that of the wear

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
our death as opposed to that of the wear
but<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.970> horrible<00:00:48.390> horrible

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
but you can see the horrible horrible

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.000 
but you can see the horrible horrible
effects<00:00:48.990> of<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.290> last<00:00:49.470> time<00:00:49.680> we<00:00:49.770> tried<00:00:49.920> this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
effects of the last time we tried this

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.070 
effects of the last time we tried this
and<00:00:50.360> so<00:00:51.360> we're<00:00:51.480> gonna<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.720> ahead<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.870> try<00:00:51.990> it

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
and so we're gonna go ahead and try it

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.990 
and so we're gonna go ahead and try it
again<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.950> you<00:00:53.520> know<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.850> life

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
again because you know what is life

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.970 
again because you know what is life
you're<00:00:54.270> afraid<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.570> everything<00:00:54.750> right<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.650> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you're afraid of everything right so to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.840 
you're afraid of everything right so to
start<00:00:56.130> off<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.490> we're<00:00:56.580> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.760> go<00:00:56.820> ahead

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
start off what we're going to go ahead

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.570 
start off what we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:57.150> do<00:00:57.240> is<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.540> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.960> turn<00:00:58.170> off<00:00:58.580> mob

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
and do is I'm going to turn off mob

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.430 
and do is I'm going to turn off mob
griefing<00:01:00.150> so<00:01:00.720> that<00:01:00.870> he<00:01:00.960> doesn't<00:01:01.200> totally

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
griefing so that he doesn't totally

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.009 
griefing so that he doesn't totally
destroy<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.010> area<00:01:02.310> again<00:01:02.490> and<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.960> we

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
destroy this area again and so that we

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.450 
destroy this area again and so that we
can<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.379> actually<00:01:04.680> kill<00:01:05.100> him<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
can really actually kill him with the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
can really actually kill him with the
TNT<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.810> need<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.530> just

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
TNT so what we need to do here is just

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.069 
TNT so what we need to do here is just
make<00:01:07.829> a<00:01:07.979> very<00:01:08.369> quick<00:01:08.579> TNT<00:01:09.210> mega<00:01:09.509> bomb<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
bonds it shouldn't it should it

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.039

so he shouldn't be able to destroy the
landscape<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:03.029> fact<00:02:03.149> i<00:02:03.270> was<00:02:03.389> going<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.569> go

and turn off TNT explodes just to make

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.309 
and turn off TNT explodes just to make
sure<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.189> doesn't<00:02:05.219> happen<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.049> then<00:02:07.049> I'm

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
sure that doesn't happen and then I'm

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.020 
sure that doesn't happen and then I'm
gonna<00:02:07.649> wait<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> couple<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.369> seconds<00:02:08.670> after<00:02:09.000> he

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
gonna wait a couple of seconds after he

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.370 
gonna wait a couple of seconds after he
spawned<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.660> make<00:02:09.810> sure<00:02:09.929> his<00:02:10.080> blast

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
spawned to make sure his blast

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.320 
spawned to make sure his blast
resistance<00:02:10.920> which<00:02:11.370> apparently<00:02:11.700> he<00:02:12.000> has<00:02:12.180> when

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
resistance which apparently he has when

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.540 
resistance which apparently he has when
he<00:02:12.420> first<00:02:12.660> bond<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.890> thing<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.490> I'm

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
he first bond is a thing and so I'm

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.890 
he first bond is a thing and so I'm
gonna<00:02:14.610> make<00:02:14.790> sure<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.120> off<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.630> then

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
gonna make sure that's off and then

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.420 
gonna make sure that's off and then
we're<00:02:16.110> going<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.260> push<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> TNT<00:02:16.920> mine<00:02:17.130> carts

go and turn on TNT explodes whoa there
ok<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:39.090> he's<00:02:40.090> not<00:02:40.120> dead<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:42.540> ok<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.810> only

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
ok and he's not dead so ok so the only

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.930 
ok and he's not dead so ok so the only
other<00:02:43.990> way<00:02:44.200> i<00:02:44.230> think<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.620> test<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.190> if

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
other way i think we can test this is if

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.030 
other way i think we can test this is if
i<00:02:46.030> go<00:02:46.210> ahead<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:48.120> um<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.530> turn<00:02:50.710> off<00:02:50.770> TNT

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
i go ahead and I um so I turn off TNT

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.920 
i go ahead and I um so I turn off TNT
explodes<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:52.420> think<00:02:52.660> he's<00:02:52.750> just<00:02:52.810> gonna

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
explodes and I think he's just gonna

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.330 
explodes and I think he's just gonna
shoot<00:02:53.200> constantly<00:02:53.740> I'm<00:02:53.830> not<00:02:53.950> even<00:02:54.130> sure<00:02:54.160> what

he<00:02:54.430> shooting<00:02:54.610> at<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:55.090> think<00:02:55.810> he<00:02:55.870> just<00:02:55.900> wants<00:02:56.200> to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260
