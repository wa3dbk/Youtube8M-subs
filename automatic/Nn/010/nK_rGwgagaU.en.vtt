00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.219
 in this video tutorial we are going to review 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:09.650
 the way of working with the leaves of 

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:12.049
 cascade style this we will do to 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.209
 through the creation of rules that I 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.460
 they will allow me to work with what 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.040
 is the design of the labels that 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:24.100
 we are working on html we are just going to 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:27.020
 do with the styles panel css css 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.180
 first we have to link 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.310
 a stylesheet for that we're going to 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.460
 create and we will do it in the next 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.460
 route 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.140
 from fancy www and the project that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.180
 we are working that is pot site we are going 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:52.090
 to create a folder called css 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.090
 and within this we are going to create 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.120
 We will do a file here 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.120
 through again 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.570
 blank page and here is the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.570
 css document 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.659
 we will save them as 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.960
 in the folder that we just created what 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.860
 we will save as a style css 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.860
 style 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.130
 and save 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.760
 now we are going to go to our template 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.970
 to the w document and what are we going to do 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.370
 is to link that style sheet we're going to 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.420
 do in the same style panel to 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.420
 through this icon 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.450
 examine and here we look for the folder that 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.350
 we just created 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.000
 css and we attach the document style 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.000
 and accept 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.479
 ready now if we detailed we are already 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.860
 linked our style sheet to this 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.860
 document to this template 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.259
 Now we are going to do everything that is the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.450
 part of the measures of the layout 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.310
 that we are going to work to start 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.709
 create different rules regarding 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.780
 my my high and wide as if 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.300
 the background color is required let's go to the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.580
 good container page in the bar 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.670
 been we created that division we're going to 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.970
 Add 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.410
 or add rule style and if the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.560
 we detail here we are going to tell you that we are going 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.080
 create that style through d 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.890
 type of composite selector based on 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.340
 rules 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.740
 in box we use with let's give the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.500
 container width that are exactly 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.569
 900 pixels and we're going to give it a halt 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.609
 735 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.609
 high accept 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.770
 now we 're going for the division of 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.110
 spin again apply we apply 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.200
 here in the status bar we added 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.069
 a new rule also composed and 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.069
 to accept 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.900
 picture again 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:19.420
 well let's give it a background with color 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.130
 in the background let's leave blue 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.819
 now yes picture we are going to give you the 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:29.080
 measurements we will leave a width too 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.470
 of 900 and the height we will make of 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.330
 100 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.880
 accept that now let's set the 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.270
 main division of main we added a 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.270
 ruler 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.770
 to accept 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.420
 let's leave a background can be 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.420
 grays and you like to differentiate 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:58.870
 and this will also be 900 wide 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.870
 we're going to give you a halt of 35 accept 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.110
 now we're going to our division is 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.420
 for the side 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:14.230
 left click and we go here we added 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.230
 the new rule rule css we accept 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.010
 let's give it a blue background 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:30.830
 and in box 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:34.650
 the width that we will leave 200 px 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.050
 wide and high 550 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.870
 eye here we have to have in 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.370
 account that this part will be towards the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.850
 left side we are going to tell you that 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.530
 float to the left side so you do not 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.860
 let's have problems with this 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.860
 division 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.899
 now let's go to containers 2 remember 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:57.989
 that this container has to go to the 

00:04:54.899 --> 00:05:01.229
 right side and that this container has 

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:05.660
 the layer or the cutting divisions and the 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:10.310
 wright division 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.480
 come on here block 4 sorry in box you 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.480
 let's give a width 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.090
 t 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:25.950
 700 and a stop the same from 550 and here 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.500
 remember that this layer or is edition 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.880
 I would have to rub the left side of 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.370
 sorry to my right drive 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.320
 good now what we are going to do 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.180
 we are to start working with what 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:43.620
 what is the content part 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:48.120
 happy let's leave a picture with 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:52.050
 a width of 500 px and the height also of 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.530
 550 and that has to float next 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.650
 right of the layer that we have 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.090
 of contagious we are going to look at what would happen 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.759
 in case we did not have it 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.669
 we did it floated next time sorry 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:07.139
 left comes how it would look low what 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.169
 which is the layer that we have at 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.030
 side let's edit it again and you 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:16.229
 let's say here that I float next 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.270
 left accept and now if it goes up or me 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.599
 allows to have next to the layer of 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.599
 wright 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:27.609
 well now let's make the rule for 

00:06:24.459 --> 00:06:31.389
 Wright, we are going to give a fund like the 

00:06:27.609 --> 00:06:34.809
 menu is blue and in box we're going to 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:38.439
 leave also the width of 200 and the height 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:41.860
 of 550 and this layer would have to place 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:44.139
 the right side 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.840
 to accept 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.689
 perfect here that little part as they will tell 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.870
 the two of you are only going to have my coat 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:54.460
 coaching and the white edition layer 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.889
 take out the layer that contains the layer of 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.879
 wright then then we can take them 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.879
 the little messenger he had 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:05.389
 perfect we are then now in the 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.199
 bottom part to see what happens with the 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:07.099
 fÃ¼hrer 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:10.610
 at that moment we need 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:14.990
 configure it let's create the new 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:18.190
 style rule accept and let's leave 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.170
 a gray background 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:24.580
 and here a box that is the width would be 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:28.390
 exactly also of 900 px and the high 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:30.070
 we are going to leave it of 50 px and then in this 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.720
 case not to float and here what we have is 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.480
 to tell him the skin inym floated 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.090
 existing and clean it on both sides and 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.010
 accept clear wood 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.919
 here you need a little part if 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.030
 we review how to look because it's here in 

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:46.580
 the top still we have not 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.710
 erased the message that was had of 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.030
 content this is what we are going to do 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:55.620
 is to erase it 

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:58.460
 and ready until we would finish 

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.460
 perfect
