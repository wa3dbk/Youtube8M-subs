off<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:49.180> again<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:50.410> I<00:02:50.500> take<00:02:50.740> it<00:02:50.770> maybe<00:02:51.040> 10

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
off and on again so I take it maybe 10

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.850 
off and on again so I take it maybe 10
minutes<00:02:51.580> for<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.360> whole<00:02:52.570> process<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.200> take<00:02:53.650> us

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
minutes for the whole process to take us

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.240 
minutes for the whole process to take us
to<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.040> main<00:02:54.400> screen<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.470> like<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.680> said<00:02:56.740> if<00:02:57.070> the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
to the main screen so like I said if the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.060 
to the main screen so like I said if the
screen<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.360> was<00:02:58.570> blocking<00:02:59.320> also<00:02:59.860> with

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
screen it was blocking also with

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.810 
screen it was blocking also with
passcode<00:03:00.640> or<00:03:01.000> stream<00:03:01.990> pattern<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:05.820> reset

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
passcode or stream pattern this reset

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.860 
passcode or stream pattern this reset
with<00:03:07.480> using<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.140> volume<00:03:08.410> down<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:08.980> power<00:03:09.040> key

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
with using the volume down and power key

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.380 
with using the volume down and power key
remove<00:03:10.870> all<00:03:11.230> those<00:03:11.380> accounts<00:03:11.860> also<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.670> we

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
remove all those accounts also and we

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.500 
remove all those accounts also and we
will<00:03:13.420> be<00:03:13.690> able<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.110> use<00:03:15.010> this<00:03:15.400> tablet<00:03:15.790> again

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
will be able to use this tablet again

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.509 
will be able to use this tablet again
ok<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:17.560> these<00:03:17.709> are<00:03:17.920> going<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.100> take<00:03:18.250> a<00:03:18.280> few

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
ok so these are going to take a few

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.460 
ok so these are going to take a few
minutes<00:03:18.910> so<00:03:18.970> Chevys<00:03:19.390> be<00:03:19.630> very<00:03:19.959> very<00:03:20.170> patient

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
minutes so Chevys be very very patient

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.900 
minutes so Chevys be very very patient
and<00:03:21.400> also<00:03:21.700> if<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.300> tablet<00:03:23.250> stucked<00:03:24.250> on<00:03:24.670> the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
and also if the tablet stucked on the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.259 
and also if the tablet stucked on the
RCA<00:03:25.540> logo<00:03:25.930> in<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.470> said<00:03:26.650> it<00:03:26.920> doesn't<00:03:27.269> fully

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
RCA logo in the said it doesn't fully

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:35.340 
RCA logo in the said it doesn't fully
power<00:03:28.600> on<00:03:28.810> or<00:03:30.600> turn<00:03:31.600> off<00:03:33.060> once<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.269> while<00:03:34.510> by

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
power on or turn off once in a while by

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.150 
power on or turn off once in a while by
itself<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.910> this<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:38.410> option<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.010> these

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
itself so this is this option and these

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.680 
itself so this is this option and these
steps<00:03:39.459> also<00:03:39.760> help<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.269> calibrate<00:03:40.600> the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
steps also help to calibrate the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.040 
steps also help to calibrate the
motherboard<00:03:41.320> to<00:03:42.040> help<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.910> device<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.600> work<00:03:43.810> a

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
motherboard to help the device to work a

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.830 
motherboard to help the device to work a
better<00:03:44.340> ok<00:03:45.340> so<00:03:45.400> if<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.480> is<00:03:46.660> your<00:03:46.870> case<00:03:48.840> these

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
better ok so if that is your case these

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.460 
better ok so if that is your case these
logo<00:03:50.709> at<00:03:50.830> this<00:03:51.040> time<00:03:51.310> step<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:52.330> will<00:03:52.570> take<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:52.900> at

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
logo at this time step we will take a at

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.600 
logo at this time step we will take a at
the<00:03:53.650> most<00:03:53.890> 5<00:03:54.459> minutes<00:03:54.970> ok<00:03:55.890> so<00:03:56.890> if<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.400> takes

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
the most 5 minutes ok so if it takes

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.240 
the most 5 minutes ok so if it takes
more<00:03:57.850> than<00:03:57.910> five<00:03:58.269> minutes<00:03:58.600> then<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.980> means

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
more than five minutes then that means

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.350 
more than five minutes then that means
that<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:02.680> motherboard<00:04:03.250> still<00:04:03.760> experience

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
that the motherboard still experience

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.770 
that the motherboard still experience
and<00:04:04.980> experiencing<00:04:05.980> some<00:04:06.160> problems<00:04:06.700> if<00:04:07.510> the

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
and experiencing some problems if the

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.210 
and experiencing some problems if the
problem<00:04:08.260> will<00:04:08.440> be<00:04:08.590> wise<00:04:08.830> it<00:04:09.400> was<00:04:09.670> like

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
problem will be wise it was like

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.710 
problem will be wise it was like
stack<00:04:12.220> on<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.550> RCA<00:04:12.909> logo<00:04:13.150> it<00:04:13.300> doesn't<00:04:13.569> fully

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
stack on the RCA logo it doesn't fully

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.780 
stack on the RCA logo it doesn't fully
coming<00:04:14.019> on<00:04:14.140> so<00:04:14.920> just<00:04:15.159> power<00:04:15.340> off<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.610> device

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
coming on so just power off the device

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.090 
coming on so just power off the device
and<00:04:16.329> redo<00:04:16.840> them<00:04:17.019> in<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.380> can<00:04:17.410> do<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.919> same

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
and redo them in you can do the same

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.580 
and redo them in you can do the same
process<00:04:18.340> up<00:04:18.699> to<00:04:18.850> five<00:04:19.090> or<00:04:19.120> six<00:04:19.359> times<00:04:19.780> until

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
process up to five or six times until

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.020 
process up to five or six times until
you<00:04:22.380> get<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.620> point<00:04:23.889> of<00:04:24.130> calibrated

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
you get to the point of calibrated

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.290 
you get to the point of calibrated
motherboard<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.750> make<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.199> device<00:04:27.090> turn<00:04:28.090> on

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
motherboard and make the device turn on

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.939 
motherboard and make the device turn on
completely<00:04:29.130> okay<00:04:30.130> so<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:31.630> this<00:04:31.930> logo<00:04:32.710> takes

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
completely okay so this this logo takes

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.140 
completely okay so this this logo takes
more<00:04:33.280> than<00:04:33.600> five<00:04:34.600> minutes<00:04:34.810> then<00:04:35.790> just<00:04:36.790> power

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
more than five minutes then just power

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.350 
more than five minutes then just power
off<00:04:37.479> the<00:04:37.810> device<00:04:38.350> and<00:04:38.979> we<00:04:39.550> do<00:04:39.729> the<00:04:40.000> same

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
off the device and we do the same

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.939 
off the device and we do the same
process<00:04:40.740> okay<00:04:41.740> so<00:04:42.690> we're<00:04:43.690> gonna<00:04:43.810> let<00:04:44.110> this<00:04:44.380> RCA

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
process okay so we're gonna let this RCA

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.480 
process okay so we're gonna let this RCA
Ronnie<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:47.020> we<00:04:47.680> will<00:04:47.830> take<00:04:47.979> us<00:04:48.100> to<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.310> main
