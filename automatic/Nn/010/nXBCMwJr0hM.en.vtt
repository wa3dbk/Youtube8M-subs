00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.830
 welcome to mallorca we compare 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.450
 Today, two vehicle concepts like her 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.400
 could not be more different 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.650
 on one side the alfa romeo 4c 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.660
 on the other the abarth the post o 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 but both the only one purpose driving fun 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.400
 pure two power piccolos from bella italia 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:32.270
 an idea driving tour with a lot of power and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.900
 little weight is the alfa romeo 4c 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:40.070
 flat like a flounder the abarth 695 b 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.110
 post hot as peperoncino in both 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.500
 special equipment drives the price in 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.469
 the amount up to around 65,000 euros 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.960
 of course, which sports car wonders 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.690
 more momentum from the fiat group 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.980
 money offers the alpha or the abarth 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.600
 now for the performance data and here 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.079
 Both vehicles really have a lot 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.270
 to offer 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.110
 ours the post oh yes there is a 1.4 liter 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.649
 engine 190 hp 100 out of it 250 newton meters 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.690
 torque 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.910
 I think that speaks for itself 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.490
 a weight of less than 1,000 kilograms 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.590
 our alfa 4c here is thanks to a carbon 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.770
 chassis a real lightweight 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.340
 dare has 240 hp which fetches from 1 8 liters 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.959
 capacity 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.840
 the beautiful here is we have one 

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:26.209
 Performance weight of 4.2 kilograms per 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.830
 ps and so this car is fast 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:30.430
 Acceleration on the way from zero 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.440
 one hundred only 45 seconds 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.750
 the bbi posto of abarth is considered as 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.760
 fastest kinky ball of all time 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:43.090
 in numbers 230 km h and from 0 to 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.390
 100 in less than six seconds with 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.340
 only 52 kilograms per ps power weight 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.680
 the Italian rennsemmel is considered as 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.150
 currently the smallest supercar of the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.490
 world 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.920
 the post is called the two-seater 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.680
 purism of the technician for the back seat 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 of the base car fiat 500 complete with 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.920
 Victim 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.150
 although I'm almost two meters tall for 70 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.920
 in the post very well I have space 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.479
 enough that bothers me a bit 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 Steering wheel is only height adjustable i 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.690
 So I can not wear it anymore 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.819
 and for his purebred athlete there 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.830
 I just expect something pleasant 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.590
 has extended 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.080
 What the post offers is a 4 point belt 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.220
 and of course, to feel the shell seats 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.020
 I am very safe in the car 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.460
 big advantage if you have to go fast 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.170
 should there is also a very normal 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.730
 strapped so I am unbound strapped 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.000
 unbolted if I'm in the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.000
 took place 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:42.840
 the name of the group brother alfa romeo 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.599
 4c represents quattro goal in three so 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.319
 four cylinders by its proportions 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:53.159
 the alfa romeo 4c looks very crisp only 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:57.780
 a meter 18 flat proud 1 meter 97 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:03:00.239
 wide but only three meters 99 short with 18 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.590
 inch wheels in the front and 19 meters in the back 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:08.370
 he is full on the street 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.469
 the 240 hp 1.8 liter turbo seat 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.239
 as a so-called mid-engine before 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.780
 rear axle and fighting like in the but 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.909
 breathes less than a ton of ballast 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.500
 mid-engined sports car again 14 apply 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.949
 because of the favorable weight distribution 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.989
 as particularly agile in the interior pass the 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:28.349
 material impression not so much to 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.239
 exclusive appearance more suitable 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:35.189
 there are the alu pedalerie as well as the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.290
 tight sports seats in the ride spoiled the 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.799
 dynamic ragazzo with go kart haffter 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.000
 agility and feathery spritzigkeit 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.889
 that steering is completely without 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.500
 Servo support acts falls 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.049
 at the most when shunting on plentiful 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.229
 Carbon and magnesium save weight and 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.930
 so drive the turbo ps the small 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.979
 papagallo in just 45 seconds on tempo 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.699
 100 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:02.939
 only ends at 2 158 kilometers per hour 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:05.280
 the propulsion of alfa romeo 4c alfa 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.479
 Romeo 4c means lightweight construction that 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.870
 In turn, the insulation also includes 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.510
 on 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.069
 accordingly loud it is here in the car 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.590
 I can really well hear the engine 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.459
 Feel it almost and the beautiful is radio 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.320
 do not turn it on anymore 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.820
 although the 40 also in the 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.680
 standard configuration very much 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.930
 is on the road is offering alpha 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.250
 Here are additional driving modes on one 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.380
 is called dynamic because the vehicle leaves 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.570
 a little more with a switch 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.070
 virtually all electronic helpers out and 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.639
 then you should go under with the gasfu 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.680
 brake to be very careful 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.389
 the six- speed dual - clutch transmission 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.990
 fits perfectly with the engine 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:43.590
 characteristic proud 350 newton meters 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.780
 Torque bring necessary thrust with 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.880
 the 4c alfa remembers his 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.810
 sporting roots and that on 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.810
 imposing way 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.139
 the story also quotes the 695 posto 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.630
 because exactly 50 years ago there was one 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.630
 eponymous prototype from the home abt 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.610
 The power dwarf is pure racing for 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:15.740
 public roads fully equipped 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.900
 drives the price up to 65,000 euros 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.789
 this includes, among other things, a clown 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.070
 Racing gearbox with open shifting gate 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.380
 a differential lock 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.060
 Four points separate straps tight fitting 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.270
 sport seats and plenty of 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.490
 weight saving carbon fiber of the post 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.110
 shines with driving dynamics but thanks 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.849
 slightly elevated seating position and 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.099
 ample storage space behind the two 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.099
 still sit relatively useful 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:51.360
 alfa romeo 4c and abarth 695 b-post o2 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.250
 extremely fast Italians themselves 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.290
 but in one point strong 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.910
 distinguish 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.460
 the alfa is from scratch for 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.410
 sporty driving designed the abarth 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.350
 was in the holy halls of the 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.500
 Fiat daughter first the sportiness 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:09.540
 trained in both cases are round 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.060
 65,000 euro unconditional requirement around 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.660
 at the end a lot of sports cars for 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.660
 to get money 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.290
 That was our comparison between the 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:22.060
 post and the alfa romeo 4c which 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.620
 this thoroughbred athlete is the better one 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.010
 that is probably the personal responsibility 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.870
 taste 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.290
 I could not do it right now 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.290
 decide
