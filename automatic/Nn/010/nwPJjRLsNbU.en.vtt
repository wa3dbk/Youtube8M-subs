00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
like always here in Southern California

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.830 
like always here in Southern California
so<00:00:22.670> before<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> start<00:00:23.970> my<00:00:24.090> day<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.359> actually

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
so before I start my day I actually

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.960 
so before I start my day I actually
wanted<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.410> share<00:00:25.680> something<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.699> found

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

interested<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.599> decided<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.500> do<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> quick

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
interested in so I decided to do a quick

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.209 
interested in so I decided to do a quick
video<00:00:32.279> about<00:00:33.170> Murano<00:00:34.170> glass<00:00:34.440> because<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> found

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
video about Murano glass because I found

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.979 
video about Murano glass because I found
a<00:00:35.370> Murano<00:00:35.670> glass<00:00:35.910> which<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.480> never<00:00:36.660> seen

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
a Murano glass which I have never seen

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.209 
a Murano glass which I have never seen
actually<00:00:37.170> before<00:00:37.649> um<00:00:38.300> that<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.420> broken<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
actually before um that is broken and

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.470 
actually before um that is broken and
the<00:00:41.219> funny<00:00:41.399> thing<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.120> play<00:00:42.329> with

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the funny thing is that I play with

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.450 
the funny thing is that I play with
Murano<00:00:42.780> glass<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.290> time<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.160> throw<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
Murano glass all the time and I throw it

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.700 
Murano glass all the time and I throw it
on<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> floor<00:00:44.940> because<00:00:45.390> um<00:00:45.870> from<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:46.680> I

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
on the floor because um from what I

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.580 
on the floor because um from what I
learned<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.190> has<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.579> 7<00:00:48.120> or<00:00:48.300> 9<00:00:48.539> layer<00:00:48.989> baking

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
learned it has like 7 or 9 layer baking

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.369 
learned it has like 7 or 9 layer baking
process<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.969> color<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.390> actually<00:00:52.079> baked

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
process so the color is actually baked

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.979 
process so the color is actually baked
inside<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.789> pretty<00:00:54.059> much<00:00:54.120> unbreakable

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
inside and it's pretty much unbreakable

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.889 
inside and it's pretty much unbreakable
but<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:56.100> one<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.180> one<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.539> came<00:00:57.750> from

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
but this one was the one that came from

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479 
but this one was the one that came from
one<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> ladies<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.649> came<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> clean

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
one of the ladies that came in to clean

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.270 
one of the ladies that came in to clean
the<00:00:59.640> bracelet<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:00.480> be<00:01:01.170> honest<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.800> think

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the bracelet but be honest I think

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.670 
the bracelet but be honest I think
something<00:01:02.879> happened<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.870> her<00:01:04.350> full

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
something happened because her full

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.490 
something happened because her full
bracelet<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:06.150> absolutely<00:01:06.869> messed<00:01:07.290> up

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
bracelet was just absolutely messed up

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.789 
bracelet was just absolutely messed up
I've<00:01:07.830> never<00:01:08.310> seen<00:01:08.640> anything<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.900> um<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
I've never seen anything like it so um I

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
I've never seen anything like it so um I
do<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> either<00:01:12.150> was<00:01:12.450> run<00:01:12.840> over<00:01:12.869> by

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
do think that it either was run over by

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.740 
do think that it either was run over by
a<00:01:13.350> car<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:14.159> something<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.000> because<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
a car or something like that because the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.780 
a car or something like that because the
damage<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.350> other<00:01:16.560> beads<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.490> so

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
damage to other beads was just so

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.490 
damage to other beads was just so
excessive<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:21.420> wanted<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.229> show<00:01:22.439> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
excessive but I I wanted to show you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.420 
excessive but I I wanted to show you
this<00:01:22.830> thing<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.750> basically<00:01:24.979> what<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.130> is

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
this thing so basically what it is is

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.730 
this thing so basically what it is is
that<00:01:26.460> Murano<00:01:27.240> glass<00:01:27.479> gives<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.140> sort<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.560> an

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
that Murano glass gives you sort of an

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.450 
that Murano glass gives you sort of an
illusion<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.680> baked<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.189> either

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
illusion that that it baked like either

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.999 
illusion that that it baked like either
on<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> top<00:01:33.090> or<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> bottom<00:01:34.259> or<00:01:34.439> inside

for me to look inside the Murano glass
so<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:51.060> actually<00:01:51.240> figure<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.930> how<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
so I can actually figure out how the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.139 
so I can actually figure out how the
heck<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.970> thing<00:01:54.030> work<00:01:54.780> um<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:56.430> my

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
curiosity was definitely tickled and I

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.920 
curiosity was definitely tickled and I
was<00:02:00.979> hoping<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.310> some<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.360> are<00:02:03.390> just

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
was hoping that some of you are just

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.830 
was hoping that some of you are just
offensive<00:02:04.469> as<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.280> am<00:02:05.520> about<00:02:06.000> things<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
offensive as I am about things like that

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.309 
offensive as I am about things like that
and<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.200> wanted<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.920> know<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.539> just

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
and just wanted to know so here is just

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.490 
and just wanted to know so here is just
the<00:02:10.670> regular<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:12.239> guess<00:02:12.750> like<00:02:12.930> silver

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the regular I guess like silver

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.290 
the regular I guess like silver
or<00:02:13.560> singing<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.370> holding<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.000> Murano

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
or singing that is holding the Murano

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.970 
or singing that is holding the Murano
glass<00:02:15.540> which<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.050> figured<00:02:16.380> out<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.770> it's

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
glass which I figured out that it's

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.680 
glass which I figured out that it's
going<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.220> be<00:02:17.370> something<00:02:17.610> like<00:02:17.820> that<00:02:18.000> inside

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
going to be something like that inside

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.690 
going to be something like that inside
but<00:02:19.680> what<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.910> didn't<00:02:21.240> know<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.050> one<00:02:22.290> is<00:02:22.740> I

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
but what I didn't know and this one is I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.940 
but what I didn't know and this one is I
call<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.510> actually<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.050> Jewish<00:02:25.410> bead<00:02:25.680> because

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
call it actually the Jewish bead because

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.870 
call it actually the Jewish bead because
it's<00:02:26.280> blue<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.610> white<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:28.490> we<00:02:29.490> have<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> lot<00:02:29.850> of

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
it's blue and white and we have a lot of

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.000 
it's blue and white and we have a lot of
people<00:02:30.240> buying<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:31.080> around<00:02:31.440> Hanukkah

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
people buying this one around Hanukkah

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.640 
people buying this one around Hanukkah
but<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.910> look<00:02:33.120> from<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.540> side<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:34.620> can

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
but if you look from the side you can

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.110 
but if you look from the side you can
actually<00:02:34.980> see<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:36.360> it's<00:02:36.780> big<00:02:37.140> oh<00:02:37.550> wait<00:02:38.550> it

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
actually see that it's big oh wait it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.360 
actually see that it's big oh wait it
baked<00:02:39.480> right<00:02:40.080> on<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.500> edge<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.130> or

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
baked right on the edge of it or

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.850 
baked right on the edge of it or
actually<00:02:41.880> more<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.360> inside<00:02:42.990> but<00:02:43.560> if<00:02:43.830> you

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
actually more of the inside but if you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.740 
actually more of the inside but if you
look<00:02:44.100> from<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.520> side<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:45.180> looks<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.600> it's

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
look from this side it looks like it's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.460 
look from this side it looks like it's
on<00:02:45.959> top<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.930> know<00:02:49.050> there's<00:02:49.290> not

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
on top so and you know there's not

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.890 
on top so and you know there's not
really<00:02:49.709> an<00:02:49.950> optical<00:02:50.459> illusion<00:02:50.670> here<00:02:51.360> because

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
really an optical illusion here because

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.790 
really an optical illusion here because
it's<00:02:52.739> truly<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.640> baked<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.470> inside<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
it's truly is baked on the inside and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.920 
it's truly is baked on the inside and
the<00:02:55.950> color<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:56.790> intense<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.540> feel<00:02:57.900> like

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
the color is so intense so I feel like

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.870 
the color is so intense so I feel like
there's<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.380> couple<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.890> layers<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.340> just

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
there's a couple of layers of just

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.600 
there's a couple of layers of just
complete<00:03:00.600> blue<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.350> there<00:03:01.590> that's<00:03:02.220> what<00:03:02.459> it

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
complete blue in there that's what it

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.260 
complete blue in there that's what it
seems<00:03:02.880> like<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.390> then<00:03:03.900> only<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.650> top<00:03:05.100> layer

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
seems like and then only the top layer

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.530 
seems like and then only the top layer
we<00:03:06.270> have<00:03:06.920> like<00:03:07.920> camera<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.489> only<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.239> top

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
we have like camera and only the top

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.960 
we have like camera and only the top
layer<00:03:09.570> has<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.590> white<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.730> blue

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
layer has the white and the blue

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.080 
layer has the white and the blue
striping<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:12.959> there<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:14.040> it's<00:03:14.280> kind<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.640> really

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
striping in there so it's kind of really

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.300 
striping in there so it's kind of really
interested<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.840> bit<00:03:16.080> interesting<00:03:16.470> I've<00:03:16.890> been

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
interested a bit interesting I've been

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.190 
interested a bit interesting I've been
looking<00:03:17.610> at<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.880> bead<00:03:18.209> for<00:03:18.510> quite<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> while

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
looking at this bead for quite a while

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.410 
looking at this bead for quite a while
almost<00:03:19.769> like<00:03:19.950> want<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.610> take<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.120> top

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
almost like want to take like the top

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.630 
almost like want to take like the top
part<00:03:21.450> of<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:22.350> just<00:03:23.130> see<00:03:24.000> how<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.840> me<00:03:25.080> but

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
it's really strange because this one has

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.640 
it's really strange because this one has
almost<00:03:28.500> like<00:03:28.980> clear<00:03:29.430> cuts<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.470> I've<00:03:31.470> never

almost like clear cuts and I've never
seen<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.010> Murano<00:03:32.310> glass<00:03:32.519> break<00:03:33.390> like<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.900> but

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
seen a Murano glass break like that but

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.620 
seen a Murano glass break like that but
just<00:03:34.890> never<00:03:35.190> know<00:03:35.459> what<00:03:35.820> happened<00:03:36.269> with<00:03:36.480> this

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
are interested in this and it might be

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.199 
are interested in this and it might be
just<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.670> fun<00:03:45.030> thing<00:03:45.329> to<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:47.160> look<00:03:47.370> at<00:03:47.549> but<00:03:47.850> the

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
just a fun thing to to look at but the

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.090 
just a fun thing to to look at but the
thing<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.810> I<00:03:49.019> know<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.440> not<00:03:49.769> every

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
thing is that I know that not every

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.920 
thing is that I know that not every
single<00:03:50.250> Murano<00:03:50.730> glass<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.239> made<00:03:51.480> like<00:03:51.690> that

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
single Murano glass is made like that

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.560 
single Murano glass is made like that
because<00:03:52.440> after<00:03:53.280> looking<00:03:53.940> at<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.209> one<00:03:54.420> I

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
because after looking at this one I

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.479 
because after looking at this one I
looked<00:03:54.810> at<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.989> couple<00:03:55.140> of<00:03:55.410> others<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.430> do

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
looked at a couple of others and I do

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.610 
looked at a couple of others and I do
know<00:03:56.880> that<00:03:57.120> some<00:03:57.360> of<00:03:57.390> them<00:03:57.690> have<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.200> begin

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
know that some of them have the begin

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.030 
know that some of them have the begin
process<00:03:59.160> on<00:03:59.370> top<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.690> not<00:04:01.320> every<00:04:01.680> single<00:04:01.890> one

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
process on top so not every single one
