 so max yes it's a little boy 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.410
 I confirm you were dreaming to Lyon who 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.060
 parked his max flow katrina it takes 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.479
 that we were offered a Hans tale 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.920
 would be private but I would like 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.750
 whether it's you just now 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.770
 before I did ask two 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.410
 three small questions 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.940
 this man will not talk about it but 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:46.830
 he is still please nine 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:49.600
 times champion of France before I 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.429
 think I can tell you they 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.229
 stopped a lot of writing a lot for 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.090
 his opponent nice to not come from 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.960
 debate there is a real job at that and we 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.080
 will also say twice no the mode 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.509
 of play you get in a half times to 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.409
 two fingers or nerves his champion 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.840
 of the world and I was right 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.349
 selection you have face to you then 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.480
 full track and seasoned athlete but 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.150
 for two days it's true that I have a 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.430
 little put aside the competition because 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.349
 I was not bad at television show 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.510
 before these rates did not want that 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.330
 did not arrive so that's true 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.349
 that then I often try to hear 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.760
 you have not ballroom dancing term 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.410
 do you prefer that we call it 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.599
 otherwise I like the term dance 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.299
 couple dancing more referencing but 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.950
 in a living room it's a little cheesy 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.440
 do not do it it's true it's true that 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.120
 sorry but sorry I did not know 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.129
 me your art before seeing you at the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.450
 cross rate television no but serena 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.400
 time this show for me it's waltzes 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.110
 Viennese it was very nice very nice 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.790
 but it's a little old school rapeseed to your 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.890
 eyes anyway when it was going to me 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.170
 surprise it was that and you got yourself 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.840
 popularize his harem pants there were 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.129
 prejudices actually but I hope that 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.170
 you were little that people are idiots 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.250
 did not do it's not it 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.690
 simply for a category of 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.430
 people it's really for all the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.790
 world I started I'm in May 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.260
 have started an all age and that is in 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.819
 leisure in competition and then the show 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.950
 my watch though we can dance some cha 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.319
 cha saga or whatever that end full of 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.790
 kinds of music so 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.489
 so that's it's really popularized 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.930
 that's the art you practice 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.579
 how many hours 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.950
 daily workout to get to 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:35.220
 that's what it takes four hours per 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.150
 day 2000 to the mayor go we can re 4 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.540
 hours every day you train 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.489
 here is another signal it's a kind 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.030
 dance that ten years ago without 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.739
 competition 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.000
 so that 's ok standard dances 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.760
 all the waltzes tangos all that to 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.530
 latin dances cha cha samba etc 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.900
 to dance there is a lot of 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.000
 work so when you arrived 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.920
 to want to do this sport we saw 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.590
 and well, I can not answer you 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.450
 I do not know, it's not me but 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.640
 after we dropped 6 euros and then buy 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.810
 mobile in time and is since first 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.599
 course I fell in love with these 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.739
 dances malin china and beautiful mills 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:11.079
 was a passion I never had to 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.220
 doubt not since the very first 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.799
 year I knew that with my job 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:21.820
 when you close your eyes you imagine yourself 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:27.220
 in ten years how like that no no 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.539
 but how and what is the future not 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.610
 to remain merciless at the level as 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:34.720
 always but life is made of full 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.190
 surprises and the center of my life 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.500
 pass of screw of my passion I am 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.600
 happy with the TV shows that qu 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.460
 can be the competition do it and 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.889
 in ten years maybe I 'll be 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.590
 engaged somewhere to make 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.479
 choreographies where in the whole world 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.070
 it does not matter it would do you something 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.060
 something which delights beating think dijon 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.500
 that it will be retirement 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.560
 and yes is that what you know 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.789
 that the agent maxim not the very good china 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.789
 manages okay anyway 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:16.000
 brandon is introduced there are reasons 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.710
 to be in jeans and I dream so at 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.840
 forty years in five years killer to 40 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.360
 years here is simple japan retirement at 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.010
 performance level will not dance 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.100
 as we enter now and suddenly 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.930
 maybe the choreography will take 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.240
 place a law on it maybe too 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.590
 maybe I like talking on TV 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.090
 or maybe there are chronicles of 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.770
 things like that we do not know he tried me 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.910
 massy the future reserve happens to who knows 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.630
 never what I expect is 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.540
 frankly no but I dream but no 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.150
 very well then maxim we saw you dancing 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.430
 in the show with shy'm bah yes that 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.700
 went pretty well really rather 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.830
 very well thought had already seen shy'm 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.990
 in those 125 and that you watched it 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.550
 of course not everyone 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.840
 what are they for those who 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.770
 have seen it but also those who are there 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.620
 and who have not seen what are the 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.520
 advice you gave to shy'm then 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.880
 the advice I tell him then casserole 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.350
 Anyway, it's madelon casserole you go 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:18.790
 ram then already much more 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:20.170
 sensual denounced by the asset no I 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.870
 gave him technical advice 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.040
 because at the level of communication 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.920
 with the public 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:31.210
 she was already extra she does not know who 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.340
 saw it in concert in colmar i will also 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.180
 a yes I was daddy yes I know that is the l 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.890
 enemy people 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:41.680
 yeah with alma there is not even 4 4 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.610
 August here and so I let go 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.919
 little problem 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.569
 of foot stopped like that that I am 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.210
 remember so had returned in case of a 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:51.580
 weight and a sheila like that I spent 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.639
 has appreciated from time to time i have 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.550
 is stupid but that's it so courses 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:59.740
 could let go because it sticks his 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.030
 image she sings like that but it's 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.840
 what these dances did wrong but I 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:07.180
 the impression of being a crowd and everything 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.259
 damaged at sea no but we laughed 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.479
 but in the meantime the woman to the 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:11.949
 hide his flaws and I think the 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:14.530
 rendering is rather nice you have it 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:16.300
 found well shy'm in the show then 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.860
 you know I would have that since you have 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.939
 gave her advice to shine that you 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.770
 wanted to give to us tonight 

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:22.300
 sault-sainte-marie the sea ben there 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.860
 why not then we will do a dance 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.990

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.990
