gallon batch which is what your brewer
is<00:02:30.300> programmed<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.840> do<00:02:31.100> so<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.190> push<00:02:32.520> that

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
is programmed to do so you push that

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.850 
is programmed to do so you push that
down<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.330> highlighted<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.930> then<00:02:34.620> push

now<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> recommend<00:03:08.580> grinding<00:03:09.180> four<00:03:09.540> or<00:03:09.780> five

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990
