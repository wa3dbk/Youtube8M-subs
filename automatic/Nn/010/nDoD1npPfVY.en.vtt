so<00:00:04.430> I<00:00:04.460> want<00:00:04.700> to<00:00:04.760> mark<00:00:05.000> the<00:00:06.340> throw<00:00:07.340> bar

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
so I want to mark the throw bar

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.590 
so I want to mark the throw bar
positions<00:00:08.120> now

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:08.600 
positions now

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.580 
positions now
now<00:00:09.170> these<00:00:09.320> pet<00:00:09.620> code<00:00:09.940> switches<00:00:11.200> the<00:00:12.200> built-in

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
now these pet code switches the built-in

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.790 
now these pet code switches the built-in
spring<00:00:13.040> which<00:00:13.400> makes<00:00:13.640> it<00:00:13.820> snap<00:00:14.650> I'll<00:00:15.650> be

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
spring which makes it snap I'll be

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.279 
spring which makes it snap I'll be
removing<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:16.460> spring<00:00:16.789> from<00:00:17.060> the<00:00:17.289> switches

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
removing the spring from the switches

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.290 
removing the spring from the switches
before<00:00:18.650> I<00:00:18.680> mount<00:00:18.920> them<00:00:19.130> this<00:00:19.910> is<00:00:20.060> all<00:00:20.119> allow

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
before I mount them this is all allow

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.880 
before I mount them this is all allow
for<00:00:20.539> smoother<00:00:20.960> action<00:00:21.349> of<00:00:21.499> the<00:00:21.589> tortoise

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
for smoother action of the tortoise

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.359 
for smoother action of the tortoise
machine<00:00:22.810> but<00:00:23.810> to<00:00:23.990> mark<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:24.410> throat<00:00:24.679> mock<00:00:25.189> my

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
machine but to mark the throat mock my

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.919 
machine but to mark the throat mock my
hole<00:00:25.579> for<00:00:25.820> my<00:00:25.970> tortoise<00:00:26.300> which<00:00:26.509> I<00:00:26.689> need<00:00:26.839> to

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
hole for my tortoise which I need to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.190 
hole for my tortoise which I need to
hold<00:00:27.079> throw<00:00:27.529> bar<00:00:28.359> into<00:00:29.359> the<00:00:29.480> center<00:00:29.779> position

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.680 

and<00:00:33.200> very<00:00:33.560> funny<00:00:33.920> I<00:00:34.100> just<00:00:34.220> mark<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:35.420> cork

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
and very funny I just mark the cork

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.880 
and very funny I just mark the cork
underneath<00:00:37.480> so<00:00:38.480> where<00:00:38.719> you<00:00:38.750> mark<00:00:39.109> them<00:00:39.320> here<00:00:39.680> I

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
underneath so where you mark them here I

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.250 
underneath so where you mark them here I
got<00:00:40.160> two<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:40.940> I'm<00:00:41.329> gonna<00:00:41.449> pre-drill<00:00:42.019> now

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
got two and I'm gonna pre-drill now

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
got two and I'm gonna pre-drill now
pilot<00:00:42.739> holes<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:44.920> then<00:00:45.920> I'll<00:00:46.010> come<00:00:46.250> through

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
pilot holes and then I'll come through

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.650 
pilot holes and then I'll come through
now<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.030> then<00:00:47.120> with<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.539> quarter<00:00:48.320> inch<00:00:48.530> bit

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.990 

so<00:00:53.660> I've<00:00:53.750> drilled<00:00:53.989> two<00:00:54.140> holes<00:00:54.370> I<00:00:55.370> use<00:00:55.969> a

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
so I've drilled two holes I use a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.819 
so I've drilled two holes I use a
slightly<00:00:56.449> larger<00:00:56.750> bit<00:00:57.170> than<00:00:57.320> quarter<00:00:57.649> inch

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
slightly larger bit than quarter inch

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.349 
slightly larger bit than quarter inch
just<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.219> be<00:00:58.309> sure<00:00:58.339> hopefully<00:00:58.789> there's<00:00:59.149> enough

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
just to be sure hopefully there's enough

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.240 
just to be sure hopefully there's enough
movement<00:01:01.359> now<00:01:02.359> the<00:01:02.800> instruction<00:01:03.800> manual<00:01:04.129> has

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
movement now the instruction manual has

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.850 
movement now the instruction manual has
a<00:01:04.280> template<00:01:04.760> here<00:01:05.440> so<00:01:06.440> I'm<00:01:06.500> gonna<00:01:06.620> go<00:01:06.830> ahead

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
a template here so I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.730 
a template here so I'm gonna go ahead
now<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.310> now<00:01:07.930> both<00:01:08.930> tortoise<00:01:09.380> machines

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
now and now both tortoise machines

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.999 
now and now both tortoise machines
underneath<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.900> then<00:01:12.079> I'm<00:01:12.350> just<00:01:12.409> gonna<00:01:12.590> pin

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
underneath and then I'm just gonna pin

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.090 
underneath and then I'm just gonna pin
down<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:15.770> switches<00:01:17.409> I'm<00:01:18.409> gonna<00:01:18.560> wire<00:01:18.829> up<00:01:18.979> the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
down the switches I'm gonna wire up the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.340 
down the switches I'm gonna wire up the
tortoise<00:01:19.490> now<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.729> see<00:01:20.030> if<00:01:20.210> we<00:01:20.810> have<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.020> smooth

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
tortoise now to see if we have a smooth

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.219 
tortoise now to see if we have a smooth
action<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:23.030> if<00:01:23.119> everything<00:01:23.479> worked<00:01:23.899> quite

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
action and if everything worked quite

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.830 
action and if everything worked quite
well<00:01:24.259> then<00:01:24.710> I'm<00:01:25.340> gonna<00:01:25.490> go<00:01:25.670> ahead<00:01:25.939> didn't<00:01:26.270> put

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
well then I'm gonna go ahead didn't put

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.240 
well then I'm gonna go ahead didn't put
the<00:01:26.930> track<00:01:27.170> down<00:01:29.649> okay<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:30.860> flipped<00:01:31.159> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
the track down okay so I flipped the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.840 
the track down okay so I flipped the
table<00:01:31.579> over<00:01:31.700> now<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:33.460> I'll<00:01:34.460> here's<00:01:34.759> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
table over now and I'll here's the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.060 
table over now and I'll here's the
template<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:35.600> I've<00:01:35.750> glued<00:01:36.079> template<00:01:36.649> down<00:01:36.829> to

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
template and I've glued template down to

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.730 
template and I've glued template down to
a<00:01:37.100> bit<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.369> three<00:01:37.670> mil<00:01:37.939> MDF<00:01:38.479> let's<00:01:39.380> just<00:01:39.619> make

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
a bit of three mil MDF let's just make

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.069 
a bit of three mil MDF let's just make
it<00:01:39.860> easier<00:01:40.189> to<00:01:40.219> set<00:01:40.430> out<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:41.630> here<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.899> holes

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
it easier to set out so here the holes

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.120 
it easier to set out so here the holes
I've<00:01:42.500> drilled<00:01:43.009> through<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.880> cork<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.860> I<00:01:45.950> just

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
I've drilled through the cork and I just

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.389 
I've drilled through the cork and I just
simply<00:01:46.310> line<00:01:46.700> up<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:47.030> holes<00:01:48.100> I'll<00:01:49.100> check<00:01:49.369> for

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
simply line up the holes I'll check for

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.289 
simply line up the holes I'll check for
the<00:01:50.180> square<00:01:50.539> off<00:01:50.810> this<00:01:50.960> end<00:01:51.759> I'll<00:01:52.759> mark<00:01:53.060> those

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
the square off this end I'll mark those

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.029 
the square off this end I'll mark those
holes<00:01:54.969> those<00:01:55.969> holes<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.689> then<00:01:56.960> simply<00:01:57.829> just

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
holes those holes and then simply just

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.179 
holes those holes and then simply just
mount<00:01:58.939> the<00:01:59.030> machine<00:01:59.619> so<00:02:00.619> see<00:02:00.799> how<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.070> goes

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
mount the machine so see how that goes

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.630 
mount the machine so see how that goes
so<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:04.729> holes<00:02:04.909> are<00:02:05.119> drilled<00:02:05.240> now<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:06.799> just<00:02:06.950> I

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
so the holes are drilled now I just I

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.420 
so the holes are drilled now I just I
put<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:08.060> template<00:02:08.509> over<00:02:08.539> like<00:02:09.380> such<00:02:09.710> and<00:02:10.310> I

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
put the template over like such and I

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.479 
put the template over like such and I
just<00:02:10.640> got<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.880> drill<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:12.040> pre-drilled<00:02:13.040> the

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
just got the drill and pre-drilled the

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.640 
just got the drill and pre-drilled the
four<00:02:13.730> holes<00:02:15.670> now<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.900> tortoise<00:02:18.290> machine

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
four holes now the this tortoise machine

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.229 
four holes now the this tortoise machine
is<00:02:18.890> actually<00:02:19.190> going<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.430> sit<00:02:19.580> very<00:02:19.610> close<00:02:20.060> to

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
is actually going to sit very close to

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.240 
is actually going to sit very close to
this<00:02:20.390> cross<00:02:20.690> rail<00:02:20.959> here<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.379> install<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.040> wire

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
this cross rail here so install the wire

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.809 
this cross rail here so install the wire
already<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:23.290> now<00:02:24.290> we'll<00:02:24.769> just<00:02:24.890> should<00:02:25.670> be

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
already and now we'll just should be

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.100 
already and now we'll just should be
just<00:02:26.060> be<00:02:26.209> able<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:27.310> insert<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.489> into<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.879> hole

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
just be able to insert it into the hole

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.320 
just be able to insert it into the hole
okay<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.680> now<00:02:31.160> I'm<00:02:31.280> going<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.489> screw<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.730> down

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.050 

okay<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:38.110> both<00:02:39.010> machines<00:02:39.400> are<00:02:39.610> now<00:02:39.730> screwed

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
okay so both machines are now screwed

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.390 
okay so both machines are now screwed
down<00:02:40.210> really<00:02:40.540> go<00:02:40.770> now<00:02:41.770> when<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.040> comes<00:02:42.160> to<00:02:42.310> the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
down really go now when it comes to the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.500 
down really go now when it comes to the
wiring<00:02:42.640> up<00:02:43.210> these<00:02:43.600> machines<00:02:44.050> I've<00:02:44.260> got<00:02:44.470> these

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
wiring up these machines I've got these

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.860 
wiring up these machines I've got these
edge<00:02:46.510> connectors<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.920> I've<00:02:47.980> soldered<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:49.690> why

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
edge connectors so I've soldered to why

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.310 
edge connectors so I've soldered to why
they<00:02:50.260> already<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:52.570> he's<00:02:52.750> simple<00:02:53.050> matter<00:02:53.230> of

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
they already so he's simple matter of

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.030 
they already so he's simple matter of
this<00:02:53.730> slipping<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.850> on<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.380> contact<00:02:56.800> point

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
this slipping it on to the contact point

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.760 
this slipping it on to the contact point
here<00:02:57.250> now<00:02:57.430> if<00:02:58.000> for<00:02:58.240> any<00:02:58.450> reason<00:02:59.020> these<00:02:59.530> are

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
here now if for any reason these are

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.100 
here now if for any reason these are
running<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.490> opposite<00:03:00.880> way<00:03:00.940> that<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.810> need

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
running in the opposite way that I need

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.870 
running in the opposite way that I need
I<00:03:02.140> just<00:03:02.350> simply<00:03:03.010> have<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.190> turn<00:03:03.550> this<00:03:03.730> around

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
I just simply have to turn this around

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.910 
I just simply have to turn this around
to<00:03:05.130> fix<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.220> problem<00:03:07.530> okay<00:03:08.530> so<00:03:08.560> I'm<00:03:08.740> going<00:03:08.830> to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
to fix the problem okay so I'm going to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.350 
to fix the problem okay so I'm going to
flip<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.190> board<00:03:09.400> back<00:03:09.580> over<00:03:09.910> now<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.270> we'll

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
flip the board back over now and we'll

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.360 
flip the board back over now and we'll
have<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.510> look<00:03:10.630> at<00:03:10.780> what<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.410> switches<00:03:12.220> will

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
have a look at what the switches will

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.949 
have a look at what the switches will
play

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.770 

right<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:18.799> I<00:03:18.829> flip<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.219> board<00:03:19.370> over<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.909> you

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
right so I flip the board over and you

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.360 
right so I flip the board over and you
can<00:03:20.900> just<00:03:21.079> see<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.319> wires<00:03:21.530> poking<00:03:21.859> up<00:03:22.159> through

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
can just see the wires poking up through

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.459 
can just see the wires poking up through
the<00:03:22.459> holes<00:03:22.640> now<00:03:23.560> I'm<00:03:24.560> just<00:03:24.769> gonna<00:03:24.920> try<00:03:25.219> and<00:03:26.469> put

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:27.469 
the holes now I'm just gonna try and put

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:42.420 
the holes now I'm just gonna try and put
these<00:03:27.799> onto<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.459> throw<00:03:28.730> bar

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.320 

here<00:03:43.269> we<00:03:43.359> go

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
here we go

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.050 
here we go
all<00:03:45.870> right<00:03:46.310> so<00:03:47.310> I'm<00:03:47.370> just<00:03:47.400> gonna<00:03:47.580> pin<00:03:47.880> these

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
all right so I'm just gonna pin these

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.730 
all right so I'm just gonna pin these
down<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:50.370> then<00:03:51.090> we'll<00:03:51.210> wire<00:03:51.420> up<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.810> switch

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
down and then we'll wire up the switch

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.350 
down and then we'll wire up the switch
machines

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.010 

so<00:03:58.930> if<00:03:59.050> hitting<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.410> track<00:03:59.650> down<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:01.020> I'm

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
so if hitting the track down and I'm

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.630 
so if hitting the track down and I'm
going<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.200> test<00:04:02.380> out<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.830> The<00:04:03.400> Tortoise

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
going to test out the The Tortoise

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.450 
going to test out the The Tortoise
machines<00:04:04.060> now<00:04:04.270> so<00:04:04.510> I've<00:04:05.140> got<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.350> 7.2<00:04:06.070> volt

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
machines now so I've got a 7.2 volt

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.990 
machines now so I've got a 7.2 volt
battery<00:04:06.760> here<00:04:08.370> I'm<00:04:09.370> just<00:04:09.520> going<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.730> take<00:04:09.880> the

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
battery here I'm just going to take the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.970 
battery here I'm just going to take the
Y's<00:04:11.460> and<00:04:12.900> put<00:04:13.900> them<00:04:14.050> straight<00:04:14.380> on<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.890> the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
Y's and put them straight on to the

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.710 
Y's and put them straight on to the
contacts<00:04:15.430> see<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:15.790> see<00:04:15.970> what<00:04:16.060> happens<00:04:18.720> okay

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
contacts see and see what happens okay

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.440 
contacts see and see what happens okay
so<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:20.049> need<00:04:20.170> to<00:04:20.290> go<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.500> other<00:04:20.560> way

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.230 

tastes<00:04:28.450> up<00:04:28.540> through<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:29.380> way<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:29.860> if<00:04:29.980> I

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
tastes up through that way and if I

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.430 
tastes up through that way and if I
reverse<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.420> was<00:04:32.550> back<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.670> other<00:04:33.790> way<00:04:36.240> okay

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
reverse the was back the other way okay

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.870 
reverse the was back the other way okay
so<00:04:38.440> I'm<00:04:38.500> pretty<00:04:38.620> happy<00:04:38.830> with<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.160> so

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
so I'm pretty happy with that so

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.170 
so I'm pretty happy with that so
everything's<00:04:40.180> working<00:04:40.240> good<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:40.750> I'm<00:04:41.260> gonna

everything's working good and I'm gonna

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.460 
everything's working good and I'm gonna
I'll<00:04:43.180> test<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.630> other<00:04:43.750> machine<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.200> make<00:04:44.350> sure

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
I'll test the other machine to make sure

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.380 
I'll test the other machine to make sure
that<00:04:44.620> one<00:04:44.920> working<00:04:45.160> fine<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.850> then<00:04:46.120> I'm<00:04:46.300> gonna
