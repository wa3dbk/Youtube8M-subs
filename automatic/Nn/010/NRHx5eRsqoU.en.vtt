00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.400
 I have found that some of you 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.650
 would like to know the secrets of 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.379
 shaved something that I would love 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.960
 share however given that we are 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.720
 in a period of celebrations and 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.539
 meet with our loved ones 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:28.480
 today I want to present to you the protocol of 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.480
 champagne let's proceed 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.230
 before tasting this sparkling wine 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.900
 loaded with glamor that we should have in 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.750
 Count your previous cooling during 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.260
 two and a half hours at a temperature of 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.230
 around 8 degrees the right one for your 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.870
 consumption and always with the bottle in 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.960
 horizontal position to ensure a 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.500
 homogeneous cold in all its content 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.500
 do not 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.960
 First of all we will hold the bottle 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.060
 in vertical position and we will present it 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.760
 then we will detach from the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.729
 label and we will remove the staple that 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.450
 protects the stopper by means of a gesture of 6 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.270
 twists 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.810
 we will firmly grasp the cork for its 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.329
 base plugging with our thumb and 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.640
 with our left hand we will proceed to 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.329
 turn the ass of the bottle until the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.329
 uncorked 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.460
 at the time of serving we will place our 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.310
 thumb inside the concave base of the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.640
 bottle and we will proceed to fill the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.640
 glasses 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.850
 after filling we will check that 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.460
 our liquid has been well poured 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.930
 thanks to the appearance of subtle 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.930
 Bubble lines 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.780

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.080
