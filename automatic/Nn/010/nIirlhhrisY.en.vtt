and<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.299> arm<00:01:15.479> goes<00:01:15.570> over<00:01:16.049> now<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.470> there

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and my right arm goes over now is there

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.460 
and my right arm goes over now is there
a<00:01:17.130> little<00:01:17.369> bit<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.820> what<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> would<00:01:18.210> call<00:01:18.600> wrist

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
a little bit of what I would call wrist

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.340 
a little bit of what I would call wrist
hinge<00:01:19.799> yeah<00:01:20.189> maybe<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> biggest

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
hinge yeah maybe but I think the biggest

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.440 
hinge yeah maybe but I think the biggest
problem<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.100> most<00:01:23.280> people<00:01:23.460> have<00:01:23.729> when<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.180> get

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
problem that most people have when I get

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.749 
problem that most people have when I get
them<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.750> try<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.020> think<00:01:25.380> about<00:01:25.610> doing<00:01:26.610> this

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
them to try to think about doing this

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.120 
them to try to think about doing this

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
a hinge there's not a conscious hinge

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.510 
a hinge there's not a conscious hinge
the<00:01:47.729> conscious<00:01:48.240> hinge<00:01:48.540> would<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.140> this

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
the conscious hinge would be like this

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.080 
the conscious hinge would be like this
now<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.579> more<00:01:51.090> angles<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.689> produce<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.409> way

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
now the more angles I produce this way

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.090 
now the more angles I produce this way
the<00:01:54.090> more<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.140> put<00:01:55.380> your<00:01:55.560> club<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.920> this

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
the more if you put your club in this

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.190 
the more if you put your club in this
position<00:01:56.640> you're<00:01:56.790> going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.000> feel<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.509> lot<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
position you're going to feel a lot of

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.469 
position you're going to feel a lot of
tension<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:58.770> forearm<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.670> both<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.180> them

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
tension in your forearm and both of them

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.060 
tension in your forearm and both of them
there's<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.840> lot<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.200> weight<00:02:01.409> there<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.890> is

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
there's a lot of weight there this is

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.760 
there's a lot of weight there this is
the<00:02:02.189> heaviest<00:02:02.579> way<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> club<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.600> be<00:02:03.810> now<00:02:04.530> if

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the heaviest way the club can be now if

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.819 
the heaviest way the club can be now if
I<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.189> golf<00:02:05.399> club<00:02:05.670> more<00:02:06.240> vertical<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.649> the

I get the golf club more vertical to the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.400 
I get the golf club more vertical to the
sky<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.670> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:09.179> past<00:02:09.599> we'll<00:02:10.200> call

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
o'clock because a moment--

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.680 
o'clock because a moment--
-<00:02:14.069> but<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:14.849> going<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.209> in<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.390> lighter

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
- but it's going to be in a lighter

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.199 
- but it's going to be in a lighter
position<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.220> thing<00:02:17.489> that<00:02:17.730> Tammy<00:02:18.060> I

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
position and the thing that Tammy I

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.390 
position and the thing that Tammy I
would<00:02:18.510> say<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.110> need<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.500> watch<00:02:19.709> for<00:02:19.739> is

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
would say that you need to watch for is

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.119 
would say that you need to watch for is
if<00:02:21.209> you're<00:02:21.390> losing<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.200> top<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.800> would

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
if you're losing it at the top I would

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.860 
if you're losing it at the top I would
tend<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.700> think<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.180> you're<00:02:24.330> not<00:02:24.360> gripping

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
tend to think that you're not gripping

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.680 
tend to think that you're not gripping
the<00:02:25.140> golf<00:02:25.349> club<00:02:25.650> properly<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:27.030> am<00:02:27.180> gripping

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.390 
it in the last three fingers of my left
hand<00:02:30.590> properly<00:02:31.590> and<00:02:31.830> that's<00:02:32.040> where<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
hand properly and that's where the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.509 
hand properly and that's where the
tension<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.480> left<00:02:33.840> hand<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.470> should<00:02:35.310> be

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
tension is in that left hand I should be

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.910 
tension is in that left hand I should be
able<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.819> go<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.390> top<00:02:36.660> without<00:02:37.200> losing

it<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.940> thumb<00:02:39.180> should<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.480> not<00:02:40.170> at<00:02:40.380> 12

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
it and the thumb should be not at 12

the best thing to do is really practice
in<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.959> mirror<00:02:49.260> because<00:02:49.980> if<00:02:50.130> you're<00:02:50.340> used<00:02:50.640> to

going all the way up and doing this now
here<00:02:53.940> I'm<00:02:54.060> letting<00:02:54.360> go<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.720> golf<00:02:54.900> club<00:02:55.110> a

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
here I'm letting go of the golf club a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.270 
here I'm letting go of the golf club a
little<00:02:55.290> bit<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.769> see<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.040> way<00:02:56.250> past

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
little bit you can see it's way past

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.240 
little bit you can see it's way past
parallel<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.900> if<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:58.260> work<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.739> just<00:02:59.010> going

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
parallel but if you work on just going

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.970 
parallel but if you work on just going
straight<00:02:59.579> up<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.269> straight<00:03:01.019> down<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.739> up
