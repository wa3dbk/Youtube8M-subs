00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello in this video we're going to help you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.160
 choose between galaxy 3 and galaxy 5 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.620
 so let's start are two 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.090
 saint devices very similar but 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.889
 at the same time they have some differences 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 significant that will help you 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.119
 make the right decision both 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 devices are very good but there 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.920
 decisive things that can help you 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.260
 to decide if a device is for you or 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.359
 not to start one of the main 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.970
 differences is the material used in 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.850
 the design in galaxy 3 we are going to 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.790
 find metal so it's one more design 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.070
 delicate more premium very elegant but 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.110
 this material is easily grated and 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.420
 also when it falls it is much more 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 likely to be scraped or bruised 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.280
 on the other side the galaxy is 5 us 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 offers in plastic material a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.780
 cover that makes you not feel so 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.180
 premium in the hand but it's much more 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.500
 scratch resistant and falls 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.809
 any way if you have planned 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.359
 use a sleeve on any of the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.370
 devices maybe this point is not 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.350
 determinant for you something very 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.360
 related is the size of the device 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.030
 since the galaxy 3 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.670
 It is a bit smaller and lighter 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.620
 his part the 5 is not so compact so 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.570
 It also depends on you the size of 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.700
 screen that you prefer is true that a 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.980
 galaxy 3 you can take it with greater 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.250
 comfort and use it with just one more hand 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.960
 easily but the 5 offers you greater 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.700
 space for multimedia content or 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.800
 games and since we 're talking about the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.800
 screen let's describe them the galaxy 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.410
 3 has a 4.5 screen 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.070
 inches with resolution qhd and a 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.840
 pixel density of 244 this number 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.390
 will help you know what screen is 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.880
 sharper for its part the e5 has a 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.320
 5 inch screen with hd resolution 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.850
 and a pixel density of 293 both 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.770
 screens feature super technology 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.780
 amoled from samsung that gives you a few 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.240
 very intense colors but as I told you 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.430
 the determining number here is the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.250
 density of pixels per inch and here 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.380
 the winner is the galaxy is 5 although not 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.509
 there is too much difference but the galaxy 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.369
 of 5 has a sharper screen the 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.989
 camera is not a determining point in 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.840
 these devices since they have 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.269
 exactly the same resolutions 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.940
 front camera is 5 megapixels for 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.069
 your cel fish with a wide lens and the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.810
 subsequent 8 megapixels in both 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.180
 cases so results are expected 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.129
 practically equal therefore not you 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.930
 I recommend that this be a parameter 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.940
 to decide your purchase talking about 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.860
 software that bring both integrated 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.530
 devices are practically the same 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.360
 both come with kitkat and will be 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.099
 updated to lollipop have 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.950
 added functions of samsung as the 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.750
 ultra energy saving however the 5 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.420
 also has the multi tasking 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.920
 while the a3 can not open two 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.019
 applications at the same time 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.970
 mainly because of the size of your 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.709
 screen so if you are a person that 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.930
 he likes to be chatting while watching 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.090
 some video on youtube would be better than 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.040
 you will buy the galaxy 5 all 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.650
 functions of galaxy 3 you're going to 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.720
 find in 5 but not all 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.150
 functions of 5 you will find them in 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.340
 the galaxy 3 and finally let's go to a 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.769
 little more of your processor numbers 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.599
 ram and storage both 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.660
 devices come with a processor 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:19.620
 four cores to 1.2 gigahertz but the 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.209
 galaxy is 5 has 1.5 gb of ram memory 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.819
 that you realize with a gigabyte 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.769
 only this means that he is 5 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.319
 You can have a better experience of 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.599
 multitasking and supports having more open 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.940
 applications at the same time so in 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.440
 both will give you a better result both 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.090
 have 16 gigabytes of 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.379
 internal storage which you 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.659
 allows you to install enough 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:43.200
 applications and games and also have a 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.519
 microsd slot up to 64 gb so 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.470
 in performance they are practically 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.659
 same but something that can decide you 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.090
 definitely your purchase is the battery 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.670
 the galaxy and 3 has a battery 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.340
 thousand 900 milliamps while the 5 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.650
 has a battery of 2400 thousand a 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.250
 perth this definitely makes the 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.500
 galaxy 5 has a very good autonomy and 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.569
 the galaxy a 3 was a little short 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.590
 so if you are very interested in 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.049
 battery duration 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.329
 could you decide for l5 now 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.950
 you know their differences and you could 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:19.070
 decide your purchase if you ask me 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.070
 I would buy the galaxy is 5 see you
