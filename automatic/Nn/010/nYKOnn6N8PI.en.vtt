00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello at the sims 4 tips and tricks 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.790
 Today I want to hide you 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.330
 Exploring land and there I send 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.630
 they mean! Posted way we 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.430
 So now click on it 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.800
 the hut so family run and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.220
 let's see if we have this magic there 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.630
 where you should look at one to 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.500
 Door will also be found 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.840
 the song and loads and only that we 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.879
 arrived in the small hut remembered 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.350
 gave me a bit of harry potter 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.170
 it is not such a hut but that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.989
 I do not think creaking hut but 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.910
 no matter we have here anyway 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.410
 found this magic tree and we 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.610
 have to look at this magic tree 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.879
 Funnily, he does not leave me there 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.539
 down 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.539
 but now 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.049
 I will come there do not actually go 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.049
 I'm wondering hello 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.880
 I definitely have to do it frequently 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.750
 look at this tree and do not mess with 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.710
 no idea xy entertained 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.409
 I 'm actually wondering work now 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.490
 just why not me that way 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:31.170
 right now somehow ran it has 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.170
 somehow works better 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.720
 this game introduces me to you she can 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.020
 Incidentally, water the tree as well 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.580
 I think he sees a bit 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.149
 glamor moderately somehow too 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.399
 perhaps due to my search 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.659
 it may be up to my sup though 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.659
 I would like to search now synonymous 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.600
 larissa does not let up larissa 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.590
 I really want to chat with me 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.840
 actually have now 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.090
 no bock it 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:16.239
 I want to look at this tree now 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:18.670
 and not with al alam a tussi as us 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.840
 because he wants to lea with me brandenburg 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.110
 do not talk now 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.140
 Damn it, I want that one 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.580
 offenders the door there is the door hh now 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.280
 Of course, I really want it at home 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.010
 the door to win but this great 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.510
 camera here or 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.340
 I can not think what else 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.220
 I'm really surprised because it already has 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.840
 works as I said well anyway 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.930
 we have to get in each case 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.450
 and this tree and will be 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.450
 explore what drives us there like that 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.170
 It took a long time for this 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.540
 somehow to explore a come now 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.849
 The first question this tree has died is 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.500
 much bigger than expected it is dark 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.319
 but not here at all 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.180
 scary is a pale glow 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.280
 the only source of light and a gentle one 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.810
 rip the only sound now 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.060
 we can choose to follow noise or 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.060
 Light follow games noisily 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.380
 curious what comes next task 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.569
 Exact adventures still know 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.319
 tree adventure larissa continues into 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.989
 dark down 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.389
 a gentle babble tells her that she is 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.160
 has risen in a slight flow 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.169
 so now we can at training 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.829
 going downriver or river uphill 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.299
 go 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.299
 I would go downhill 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.000
 especially since he is still silent about lea 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.920
 brandenburg also wants mehdi kaan but 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.650
 not having white can only make sense 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.810
 enter this entrance, even if all 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.280
 family members entered this 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.380
 already found it can only ever 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.570
 sits a meaningful go in there asking 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.820
 he again me that larissa follows that 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.990
 flow down and hopes that he will not 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.400
 in a sewer 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.650
 I hope for her too, so she has to 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.470
 she will shower again 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.750
 ethereal mist that the etheric 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.540
 ethereal mist attentive 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.130
 ominous lights up so I would say 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.350
 we'll go in the middle 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:21.180
 We want to experience a few adventures 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:24.750
 here and are curious what next 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.910
 Exactly one tree clears of the fog 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.820
 is warm and pleasant as far as the vom 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.870
 fog can claim 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.960
 without warning will be larissa 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.300
 thrown around and found on 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.920
 exit again with we can to 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.690
 go clear or back to the tree 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.890
 entrance we would like to 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.480
 We want to go clear and now 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.980
 is that means we have it 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.270
 actually done we have that 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.270
 hidden property found 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.490
 and now look at us like that 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.349
 whole looks 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.669
 when it had finished loading three 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:02.479
 years so exactly because the light and we 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.569
 are now on the glade 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.009
 arrived when we zoom away 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:07.669
 we can do it all from the top 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.009
 look at 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.759
 when I was a bit like that 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.930
 haunted place 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.990
 we can do different here now 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.069
 We can do things 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.880
 we can of course be fruits too 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:24.050
 play violin like my nice lady here 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.400
 but we can for example fish 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.080
 go here in this pond if you have it 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.120
 because sometimes we can do it at the same time 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.759
 but also frogs search go tackle 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.009
 we can also back here so to you 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:49.909
 there's another bigger one in the back 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:51.380
 waters I say so right here 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.620
 I mean the thing in the back too 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:58.340
 this sweet rainbow and this one 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.409
 waterfall long ripples and here are 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.550
 even a small angel fields on it 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.400
 So here we can not just 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.750
 Need You and tell everyone here in 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.050
 water but we got this 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.810
 small angel signs we also out 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.900
 know the normal game and there can 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.820
 they also simply go fishing for him 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.030
 we can stand under a tree 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.620
 we are looking for frogs and otherwise are like that 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:26.419
 a lot to discover so we can 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:30.380
 here small plants to view or rehearse 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:32.659
 are also other plants than collecting 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.690
 So you can buy as normal and 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:37.669
 you can do different things anyway 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.770
 also collect and what you can do 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.569
 you can get other sims afterwards 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.819
 So once you're in, you can 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.770
 someone invite someone here from his 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.930
 friends 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.539
 no matter who you want to have there 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.960
 you can just invite it so 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:55.980
 call and that is actually 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.130
 which I of course 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.360
 very impressive, however, must find 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.310
 I honestly say in this place 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.260
 you can just collect different seeds 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.590
 frogs angel and so but you can 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.170
 not entertained any longer or 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:12.000
 employ or do anything else 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:15.510
 So it really is one 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.070
 pure collection or no idea 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.260
 maybe you can marry here too 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.760
 or if you want that but me 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.500
 I have not tried it yet 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.690
 times make in any case you can here 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.090
 do nothing 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:31.620
 By the way, here is my weather 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:34.710
 Invited landgrave buddy he 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.330
 of course calls again right now so 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.050
 that works you can people here him 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.120
 invite 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.580
 may go home is easy 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.650
 go home or go back to the tree 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.540
 click occurred to man is the 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.210
 You can also come back home 

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.550
 everything very easy the invited guests 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:53.450
 you just let them free themselves 

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:56.430
 then somehow you yourself hopes 

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.900
 and yes I hope you have a lot of fun 

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.920
 This plot will find interesting 

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:03.300
 seeds are interesting fish and 

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:08.480
 then we'll take a look if white 

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.480
 springs also find such a plot
