so you guys are kind of clear on what a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.670 
so you guys are kind of clear on what a
good<00:00:18.300> template<00:00:18.720> looks<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:21.020> well<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.470> truth

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
good template looks like well the truth

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.700 
good template looks like well the truth
is<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.369> reason<00:00:23.699> why<00:00:23.880> me<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.570> fingerman<00:00:25.140> love

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
is the reason why me and fingerman love

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.189 
is the reason why me and fingerman love
artist<00:00:26.130> er<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.490> because<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.330> really<00:00:27.539> hard<00:00:27.900> to

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
artist er is because it's really hard to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.070 
artist er is because it's really hard to
go<00:00:28.500> wrong<00:00:28.849> like<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> basic<00:00:30.449> layout<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
go wrong like in the basic layout the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.830 
go wrong like in the basic layout the
only<00:00:31.260> thing<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.560> could<00:00:31.679> probably<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.840> go

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
only thing you could probably like go

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.170 
only thing you could probably like go
wrong<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.579> some<00:00:35.820> weird

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
wrong on is if you have some weird

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.619 
wrong on is if you have some weird
colors<00:00:39.950> like<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> rule<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.550> thumb<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.149> always

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
colors like a rule of thumb is always

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.069 
colors like a rule of thumb is always
have<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> white<00:00:43.200> background<00:00:44.180> I<00:00:45.180> think<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.050> just

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
have a white background I think it just

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.049 
have a white background I think it just
goes<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.800> better<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.940> Adsense<00:00:49.039> formats

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
goes way better with the Adsense formats

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.760 
goes way better with the Adsense formats
but<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.120> did<00:00:51.480> experiment<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> couple<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> times

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
but I did experiment a couple of times

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.299 
but I did experiment a couple of times
in<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> past<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:53.730> different<00:00:54.360> formats<00:00:55.250> but<00:00:56.250> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
in the past with different formats but I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
in the past with different formats but I
never<00:00:56.610> saw<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:57.420> big<00:00:57.660> jump<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.199> I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
never saw like a really big jump so I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.209 
never saw like a really big jump so I
think<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.530> white<00:00:58.710> background<00:00:58.920> and<00:01:00.020> on<00:01:01.020> both<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
think a white background and on both the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.620 
think a white background and on both the
team<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.489> Adsense<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:04.199> key<00:01:05.240> so<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> few

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
team and Adsense is really key so a few

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.210 
team and Adsense is really key so a few
personal<00:01:07.590> preferences<00:01:09.290> first<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.770> usually

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
eventually added amazon so what I did

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:20.450 
eventually added amazon so what I did
was<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:14.370> added<00:05:15.080> a<00:05:16.080> second<00:05:16.830> side<00:05:17.130> bar<00:05:18.229> so<00:05:19.229> I<00:05:19.800> did

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
was I added a second side bar so I did

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.890 
was I added a second side bar so I did
like<00:05:20.669> a<00:05:21.650> two<00:05:22.650> column<00:05:22.949> thing<00:05:23.280> like<00:05:23.460> this<00:05:23.900> are

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
like a two column thing like this are

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.559 
like a two column thing like this are
actually<00:05:25.409> in<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.550> future<00:05:26.909> if<00:05:26.970> I<00:05:27.090> ever<00:05:27.240> had<00:05:27.449> to

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
actually in the future if I ever had to

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.420 
actually in the future if I ever had to
do<00:05:27.720> it<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:27.930> probably<00:05:28.380> would<00:05:28.620> use<00:05:28.979> this<00:05:29.190> one

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
do it I probably would use this one

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.850 
do it I probably would use this one
instead<00:05:29.460> so<00:05:30.270> maybe<00:05:30.449> like<00:05:30.659> have<00:05:30.930> Amazon<00:05:31.530> here

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
instead so maybe like have Amazon here

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.320 
instead so maybe like have Amazon here

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
here and search the reason why i rarely

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.020
