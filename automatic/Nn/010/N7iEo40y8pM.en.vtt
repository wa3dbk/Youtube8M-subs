that<00:01:38.640> kind<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.880> stuff<00:01:39.090> that's<00:01:40.079> 399<00:01:40.799> focus

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that kind of stuff that's 399 focus

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.950 
that kind of stuff that's 399 focus
points<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:41.850> makes<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> autofocus<00:01:42.540> really

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
points which makes the autofocus really

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480 
points which makes the autofocus really
really<00:01:43.140> fast<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.040> shoot<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.340> five

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
really fast and you can shoot up to five

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.639 
really fast and you can shoot up to five
frames<00:01:44.700> per<00:01:44.880> second<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.360> will<00:01:45.899> say<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
frames per second I will say this the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.080 
frames per second I will say this the
battery<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.310> very<00:01:47.490> small<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.970> keep

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
battery and this is very small to keep

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.760 
battery and this is very small to keep
the<00:01:48.180> package<00:01:48.479> down<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:49.079> Sony<00:01:49.380> does<00:01:49.530> give<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the package down but Sony does give you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.770 
the package down but Sony does give you
two<00:01:49.950> batteries<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.000> you're<00:01:51.119> running

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
two batteries so if you're running

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.880 
two batteries so if you're running
around<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.140> you're<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.380> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> use<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
around and you're not going to use the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.490 
around and you're not going to use the
Wi-Fi<00:01:52.979> functionality<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.909> your<00:01:53.939> phone<00:01:54.470> then<00:01:55.470> I

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
Wi-Fi functionality to your phone then I

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
Wi-Fi functionality to your phone then I
would<00:01:55.649> turn<00:01:55.860> off<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> airplane<00:01:56.369> mode<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.759> make

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
would turn off the airplane mode to make

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.959 
would turn off the airplane mode to make
it<00:01:56.939> last<00:01:57.030> longer<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.500> a7r<00:01:59.189> too<00:01:59.460> has<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it last longer so the a7r too has the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.660 
it last longer so the a7r too has the
same<00:02:00.119> ISO<00:02:00.509> ranges<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:00.930> u<00:02:01.079> 7r<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.250> with<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
same ISO ranges that u 7r but with a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.039 
same ISO ranges that u 7r but with a
different<00:02:03.180> sensor<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> give<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
different sensor it's going to give you

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.810 
different sensor it's going to give you
a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.439> bit<00:02:04.590> better<00:02:04.860> quality<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.729> low

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
a little bit better quality and low

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.370 
a little bit better quality and low
light<00:02:06.030> less<00:02:06.210> noise<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.930> you're<00:02:07.049> looking<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.259> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
light less noise if you're looking for a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.900 
light less noise if you're looking for a
really<00:02:07.740> good<00:02:07.890> low-light<00:02:08.429> camera<00:02:08.729> you

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
really good low-light camera you

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.100 
really good low-light camera you
probably<00:02:09.119> wanna<00:02:09.270> stick<00:02:09.420> with<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.599> a7s

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
probably wanna stick with the a7s

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.710 
probably wanna stick with the a7s
although<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.860> much<00:02:11.039> fewer<00:02:11.250> megapixels<00:02:11.879> so

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
although with much fewer megapixels so

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.610 
although with much fewer megapixels so
this<00:02:13.080> camera<00:02:13.319> can<00:02:13.349> shoot

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
this camera can shoot

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.410 
this camera can shoot
4k<00:02:13.950> internally<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.580> said<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:15.180> shoot

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
4k internally as I said you can shoot

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.300 
4k internally as I said you can shoot
that<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:15.659> either<00:02:15.780> 30<00:02:16.200> frames<00:02:16.470> or<00:02:16.680> 24<00:02:17.040> frames

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
that in either 30 frames or 24 frames

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.210 
that in either 30 frames or 24 frames
you<00:02:18.269> can<00:02:18.299> also<00:02:18.540> shoot<00:02:18.810> Full<00:02:19.200> HD<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.680> 60<00:02:19.980> frames

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
you can also shoot Full HD and 60 frames

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.410 
you can also shoot Full HD and 60 frames
and<00:02:21.170> 120<00:02:22.170> frames<00:02:22.349> in<00:02:22.680> 720<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:23.849> camera<00:02:24.120> uses

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
and 120 frames in 720 this camera uses

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.990 
and 120 frames in 720 this camera uses
the<00:02:24.599> X<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.019> BCS<00:02:25.470> compression<00:02:26.099> which<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> great

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
the X a BCS compression which is a great

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.490 
the X a BCS compression which is a great
compression<00:02:27.360> but<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.019> also<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.470> option

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
compression but you also have the option

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.729 
compression but you also have the option
for<00:02:28.950> AVCHD<00:02:29.489> or<00:02:29.909> mpeg-4<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:31.409> get<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.590> most

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
for AVCHD or mpeg-4 to get the most

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.990 
for AVCHD or mpeg-4 to get the most
dynamic<00:02:31.920> range<00:02:32.310> out<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.579> camera<00:02:32.760> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
dynamic range out of the camera you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.789 
dynamic range out of the camera you
could<00:02:33.120> shoot<00:02:33.239> an<00:02:33.360> S<00:02:33.480> log<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.930> as<00:02:34.110> well<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.769> can

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
could shoot an S log to as well you can

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.130 
could shoot an S log to as well you can
put<00:02:35.069> in<00:02:35.159> picture<00:02:35.549> profiles<00:02:35.879> as<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.870> said<00:02:37.049> this

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
put in picture profiles as I said this

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.020 
put in picture profiles as I said this
is<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> full-frame<00:02:37.680> camera<00:02:37.739> which<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.700> great<00:02:39.000> if

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
is a full-frame camera which is great if

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.190 
is a full-frame camera which is great if
you<00:02:39.180> want<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.390> really<00:02:39.659> shallow<00:02:39.870> depth<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
you want that really shallow depth of

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.869 
you want that really shallow depth of
field<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.590> your<00:02:40.680> video<00:02:40.920> or<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:41.610> you're<00:02:41.730> still
