00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
throwing a hundred out patterns would

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.660

repetitions you did of that throw in
April<00:00:57.760> arm<00:00:58.000> what's<00:00:58.750> going<00:00:58.899> to<00:00:58.929> allow<00:00:59.019> that<00:00:59.109> to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
April arm what's going to allow that to

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.430 
April arm what's going to allow that to
be<00:00:59.500> executed<00:01:00.280> so<00:01:00.519> every<00:01:01.359> repetition<00:01:01.750> counts

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
be executed so every repetition counts

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.189 
be executed so every repetition counts
is<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.649> theme<00:01:02.949> we<00:01:03.129> use<00:01:03.370> around<00:01:03.640> there<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.210> but

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
is a theme we use around there and but

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.170 
is a theme we use around there and but
in<00:01:05.470> its<00:01:05.680> over<00:01:05.980> a<00:01:06.010> course<00:01:06.310> of<00:01:06.460> time<00:01:06.640> I<00:01:06.910> mean<00:01:07.030> my

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
in its over a course of time I mean my

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.240 
in its over a course of time I mean my
timing<00:01:07.660> with<00:01:07.840> Marvin<00:01:08.350> Harrison<00:01:08.710> Reggie<00:01:08.920> Wayne

timing with Marvin Harrison Reggie Wayne

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.399 
timing with Marvin Harrison Reggie Wayne
is<00:01:10.000> going<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.329> be<00:01:10.450> much<00:01:10.659> better<00:01:10.840> than<00:01:10.990> any<00:01:11.200> new

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
is going to be much better than any new

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.560 
is going to be much better than any new
receiver<00:01:11.799> because<00:01:12.009> of<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.729> repetitions<00:01:13.360> over

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570
