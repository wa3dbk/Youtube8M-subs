the Gerber crucial the reason why I
picked<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:09.840> up<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.290> as<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.650> can<00:00:10.769> see<00:00:10.920> it's<00:00:11.070> a

picked this up is as you can see it's a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.589 
picked this up is as you can see it's a
very<00:00:11.460> small<00:00:11.910> multi-tool<00:00:13.910> no<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.089> not<00:00:15.210> it's

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
very small multi-tool no it's not it's

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.040 
very small multi-tool no it's not it's
not<00:00:15.780> large<00:00:16.080> at<00:00:16.260> all<00:00:16.609> and<00:00:17.609> they<00:00:18.029> put<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.510> with

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
not large at all and they put it on with

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.250 
not large at all and they put it on with
a<00:00:19.340> belt<00:00:20.340> keeper<00:00:20.670> or<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.510> know<00:00:21.600> pocket<00:00:22.080> clip

a belt keeper or a you know pocket clip
on<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.980> back<00:00:24.080> it<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.410> that's<00:00:25.560> that's<00:00:25.740> why<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
on the back it but that's that's why I

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.050 
on the back it but that's that's why I
like<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.340> that's<00:00:26.550> why<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.670> picked<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.970> up

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
like this that's why I picked it up

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.410 
like this that's why I picked it up
actually<00:00:27.740> you<00:00:28.740> know<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:30.029> thing<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.359> I

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
actually you know in one thing that I

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.269 
actually you know in one thing that I
really<00:00:30.960> do<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.260> about<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.740> Gerber

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
really do like about it is that Gerber

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.940 
really do like about it is that Gerber
did<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.489> good<00:00:32.610> job<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:33.450> making<00:00:34.350> sure<00:00:34.680> that

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
did a good job with making sure that

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.420 
did a good job with making sure that
this<00:00:35.100> multi-tool<00:00:35.700> didn't<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:37.800> know<00:00:37.950> lack

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
this multi-tool didn't you know lack

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.900 
this multi-tool didn't you know lack
where<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> lot<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> other<00:00:39.719> smaller<00:00:40.170> ones<00:00:40.469> do

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
where a lot of the other smaller ones do

where a lot of the other smaller ones do
normally<00:00:41.910> unless<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.329> buy<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
don't get a whole lot of functionality

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.569 
don't get a whole lot of functionality
out<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.530> smaller<00:00:52.920> ones<00:00:53.309> normally

out of this the smaller ones normally
it's<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.210> kind<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.789> poorly<00:00:56.789> built

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
it's this kind of you know poorly built

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.389 
it's this kind of you know poorly built
there's<00:00:57.600> not<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> lot<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.410> know<00:00:58.440> tools<00:00:59.070> on

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
there's not a lot of you know tools on

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.219 
there's not a lot of you know tools on
it<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.129> pliers<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.699> real<00:01:02.879> weak<00:01:03.229> but

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
it you know the pliers are real weak but

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.080 
it you know the pliers are real weak but
they<00:01:04.379> did<00:01:04.530> an<00:01:04.680> excellent<00:01:05.070> job<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.909> making

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
they did an excellent job and making

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.810 
they did an excellent job and making
sure<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.689> was<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.229> good<00:01:07.590> product<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.460> scaled

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
sure this was a good product just scaled

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.190 
sure this was a good product just scaled
down<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:12.000> really<00:01:12.510> good<00:01:12.750> thing<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.049> like

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
down the one really good thing I like

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.410 
down the one really good thing I like
about<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.610> made<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
about this is that they made all the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810 
about this is that they made all the
tools<00:01:15.689> accessible<00:01:16.470> from<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.920> outside<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
tools accessible from the outside you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.760 
tools accessible from the outside you
know<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> being<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> don't<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
know that being that you don't have to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
know that being that you don't have to
open<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.250> guy<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.270> tool<00:01:21.479> out<00:01:21.720> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
open this guy up to get to tool out and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.620 
open this guy up to get to tool out and
then<00:01:22.200> close<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:23.030> like<00:01:24.030> some<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> others

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
then close it like some of the others

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.530 
then close it like some of the others
that<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.290> know<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.909> all<00:01:27.420> of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
that you you know see do and all of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440 
that you you know see do and all of
these<00:01:27.689> tools<00:01:27.930> are<00:01:28.140> locking<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.240> know<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
these tools are locking so you know the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
these tools are locking so you know the
bullet<00:01:30.630> here's<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> blade<00:01:33.740> as<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.189> see

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
bullet here's the blade as you can see

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.609 
bullet here's the blade as you can see
as<00:01:35.400> partial<00:01:35.820> separation<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> bottom<00:01:36.750> top

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
as partial separation on the bottom top

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.990 
as partial separation on the bottom top
is<00:01:37.829> straight<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.329> locking<00:01:39.810> blade

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
is straight and it is a locking blade

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.950 
is straight and it is a locking blade
which<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.119> nice<00:01:42.380> on<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.950> other<00:01:44.280> side<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.759> this

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
which is nice on the other side of this

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.730 
which is nice on the other side of this
you've<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:47.659> your<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.899> opener<00:01:50.509> corkscrew

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
you've got your can opener corkscrew

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.569 
you've got your can opener corkscrew
these<00:01:52.740> are<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> only<00:01:53.130> two<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.460> aren't

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
these are the only two that aren't

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.460 
these are the only two that aren't
locking<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.689> don't<00:01:54.840> necessarily<00:01:54.960> need

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
locking but you don't necessarily need

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.910 
locking but you don't necessarily need
these<00:01:55.649> locking<00:01:55.950> really<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.430> mean<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.530> then<00:01:58.680> on

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
these locking really I mean and then on

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.889 
these locking really I mean and then on
the<00:01:59.070> flip<00:01:59.280> side<00:02:01.729> there's<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.270> Phillips<00:02:04.049> head

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.280 

and<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.959> flathead<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:11.019> both<00:02:12.019> of<00:02:12.050> these<00:02:12.230> are

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
and a flathead and both of these are

grip<00:02:47.810> on<00:02:48.019> them<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.610> not<00:02:49.819> spring-loaded

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
grip on them it is not spring-loaded

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.180 
grip on them it is not spring-loaded
that's<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.140> only<00:02:51.440> thing<00:02:51.829> I<00:02:51.950> don't<00:02:52.010> really

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
that's the only thing I don't really

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.770 
that's the only thing I don't really
like<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.640> wish<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.790> would<00:02:53.030> have<00:02:53.120> made<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.420> plier

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
like I wish it would have made the plier

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.030 
like I wish it would have made the plier
spring-loaded<00:02:55.750> but<00:02:56.750> even<00:02:57.319> opened<00:02:57.560> up<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.920> can

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
spring-loaded but even opened up you can

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.949 
spring-loaded but even opened up you can
see<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.340> not<00:02:58.489> real<00:02:58.730> large<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.690> pretty

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.180 
see it's not real large it is pretty
cool-looking<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.410> like<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.739> fact<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.040> they

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
cool-looking I like the fact that they

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.130 
cool-looking I like the fact that they
did<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:04.489> in<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.640> green<00:03:04.940> just<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.569> typical

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.440 
did this in the green just a typical
black<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:06.799> see<00:03:06.980> or<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.340> stainless<00:03:07.579> I

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
black that you see or the stainless I

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.270 
black that you see or the stainless I
haven't<00:03:09.200> seen<00:03:09.319> any<00:03:09.530> other<00:03:09.560> colors<00:03:10.010> in<00:03:10.160> it

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
haven't seen any other colors in it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.009 
haven't seen any other colors in it
Green<00:03:10.970> is<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.150> only<00:03:11.359> thing<00:03:11.510> I've<00:03:11.630> seen<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:11.959> it

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019

Green is the only thing I've seen in it
so<00:03:12.170> far<00:03:12.380> but<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:13.280> picked<00:03:13.819> us<00:03:13.970> up<00:03:14.150> for<00:03:14.540> about<00:03:14.959> 30<00:03:15.470> I

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
so far but I picked us up for about 30 I

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.520 
so far but I picked us up for about 30 I
think<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.370> was<00:03:16.459> like<00:03:16.630> $33<00:03:17.630> or<00:03:17.780> something<00:03:18.079> so

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
think it was like $33 or something so

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.030 
think it was like $33 or something so
relatively<00:03:19.100> cheap<00:03:20.049> but<00:03:21.049> overall<00:03:21.500> it's<00:03:21.799> it's

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
relatively cheap but overall it's it's
