our tagline and then we're going to put
on<00:00:19.939> this<00:00:20.939> little<00:00:21.230> bobber<00:00:22.230> stop<00:00:24.710> which<00:00:25.710> it's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
on this little bobber stop which it's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.849 
on this little bobber stop which it's
just<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.119> little<00:00:27.269> small<00:00:27.689> rubber<00:00:28.050> Barbara<00:00:28.590> stop

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
just a little small rubber Barbara stop

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.870 
just a little small rubber Barbara stop
maybe<00:00:29.250> about<00:00:29.670> around<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.480> medium-sized<00:00:31.380> bead

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
maybe about around a medium-sized bead

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.400 
maybe about around a medium-sized bead
that<00:00:32.880> I'm<00:00:32.969> going<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.210> put<00:00:33.450> right<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> line

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
that I'm going to put right on the line

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.090 
that I'm going to put right on the line
and<00:00:35.180> I'm<00:00:36.180> going<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.020> double<00:00:37.440> loop<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and I'm going to do a double loop so I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.010 
and I'm going to do a double loop so I
threaded<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> through<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:39.239> time<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.840> going

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
threaded it through one time I'm going

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.540 
threaded it through one time I'm going
to<00:00:40.079> thread<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.469> through<00:00:40.640> again<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:43.489> second<00:00:44.489> time

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to thread it through again a second time

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.479 
to thread it through again a second time
and<00:00:45.440> then<00:00:46.440> once<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.829> thread<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> through<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and then once I thread it through that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.860 
and then once I thread it through that
second<00:00:47.850> time<00:00:47.969> I'm<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.480> pull<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.719> through

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
second time I'm going to pull it through

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
second time I'm going to pull it through
the<00:00:49.440> first<00:00:49.469> loop<00:00:50.090> that<00:00:51.090> way<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:52.140> will<00:00:52.890> lock

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the first loop that way it will lock

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.770 
the first loop that way it will lock
that<00:00:53.640> line<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:56.510> then<00:00:57.510> I'm<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
that line in there and then I'm going to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.599 
that line in there and then I'm going to
adjust<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.680> length<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.370> would

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
adjust it to the length that I would

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.630 
adjust it to the length that I would
like<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.199> pull<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.350> tight<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.800> that's<00:01:02.489> going

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
like and pull it tight and that's going

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.490 
like and pull it tight and that's going
to<00:01:02.699> stop<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:04.439> bead<00:01:04.920> from<00:01:05.339> moving

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
to stop that that that bead from moving

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.200 
to stop that that that bead from moving
now<00:01:07.500> I'm<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> go<00:01:08.430> ahead<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.790> put<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.030> my

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
now I'm going to go ahead and put on my

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.289 
now I'm going to go ahead and put on my
egg<00:01:09.450> sinker<00:01:09.960> which<00:01:10.310> today<00:01:11.310> we're<00:01:11.490> using<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.970> two

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
egg sinker which today we're using a two

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.380 
egg sinker which today we're using a two
pound<00:01:12.600> or<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.590> two<00:01:14.520> ounce<00:01:14.790> X<00:01:15.240> sinker<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:17.390> just

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
pound or two two ounce X sinker and just

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.690 
pound or two two ounce X sinker and just
thread<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.750> through

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.679 

now<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.630> slides<00:01:24.020> up<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.560> down<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.040> line<00:01:25.250> just

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
now it slides up and down the line just

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.730 
now it slides up and down the line just
like<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.369> that's<00:01:28.369> to<00:01:28.780> allow<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:30.049> line

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
like that and that's to allow the line

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.190 
like that and that's to allow the line
when<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.520> catfish<00:01:31.970> takes<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.390> bite<00:01:32.600> they're

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
when the catfish takes the bite they're

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.719 
when the catfish takes the bite they're
going<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.500> pull<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.860> line<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.399> it's<00:01:34.520> going<00:01:34.670> to

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
going to pull the line and it's going to

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.200 
going to pull the line and it's going to
go<00:01:34.880> straight<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.689> rod<00:01:35.899> tip<00:01:36.820> so<00:01:37.820> they<00:01:38.000> don't

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
go straight to the rod tip so they don't

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.690 
go straight to the rod tip so they don't
feel<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.630> weight<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.799> weight<00:01:40.399> they're

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
feel the weight of the weight they're

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.080 
feel the weight of the weight they're
the<00:01:41.090> egg<00:01:41.270> sinker<00:01:42.159> because<00:01:43.159> what<00:01:43.369> they<00:01:43.520> do<00:01:43.580> fill

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
the egg sinker because what they do fill

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.080 
the egg sinker because what they do fill
the<00:01:44.240> line<00:01:44.450> then<00:01:44.990> they<00:01:45.259> will<00:01:45.530> let<00:01:45.920> go<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.909> now

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
the line then they will let go so now

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.270 
the line then they will let go so now
I'm<00:01:47.210> going<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.479> tie<00:01:47.720> this<00:01:47.780> let<00:01:48.560> this<00:01:48.710> tag<00:01:49.009> line

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
I'm going to tie this let this tag line

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.940 
I'm going to tie this let this tag line
directly<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.450> my<00:01:50.600> barrel<00:01:50.960> swivel<00:01:52.149> and<00:01:53.950> then

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
directly to my barrel swivel and then

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.139 
directly to my barrel swivel and then
I'm<00:01:55.100> going<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.399> go<00:01:55.640> ahead<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:56.090> tie<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.810> simple

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
I'm going to go ahead and tie a simple

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.010 
I'm going to go ahead and tie a simple
clinch<00:01:59.149> knot<00:01:59.350> which<00:02:00.350> is<00:02:00.380> tying<00:02:02.020> circles

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
clinch knot which is tying circles

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.919 
clinch knot which is tying circles
around<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.710> main<00:02:03.950> line<00:02:03.979> about<00:02:04.729> three<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.479> six

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
around the main line about three to six

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.520 
around the main line about three to six
times<00:02:06.850> then<00:02:07.850> take<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.569> tag<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.380> go

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
times then take the tag in and go

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.610 
times then take the tag in and go
through<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.130> loop<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.989> then<00:02:11.989> go<00:02:12.260> back

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
through the loop and then go back

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.949 
through the loop and then go back
through<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.370> second<00:02:13.940> loop<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:14.930> just

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
through the second loop that you just

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.830 
through the second loop that you just
made<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.910> then<00:02:16.910> pull<00:02:17.299> it<00:02:17.620> tight<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.720> that's

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
made and then pull it tight and that's

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.750 
made and then pull it tight and that's
going<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.140> set<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.560> line<00:02:21.769> now<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.220> can<00:02:22.519> trim

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
going to set the line now you can trim

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.190 
going to set the line now you can trim
that<00:02:23.000> tag<00:02:23.299> outline<00:02:23.840> off<00:02:25.870> dentists<00:02:26.870> don't<00:02:26.959> like

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
that tag outline off dentists don't like

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.080 
that tag outline off dentists don't like
that<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:29.269> then<00:02:30.670> you're<00:02:31.670> going<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.820> go<00:02:31.970> ahead
