that I've found

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.980 
that I've found
moenay's<00:01:14.640> go<00:01:14.760> through<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> buttons<00:01:15.240> so

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
moenay's go through the buttons so

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.649 
moenay's go through the buttons so
clicking<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:17.070> analog<00:01:17.460> stick<00:01:17.659> does

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
clicking in the right analog stick does

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.760 
clicking in the right analog stick does
absolutely<00:01:18.990> nothing

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
absolutely nothing

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.219 
absolutely nothing
ok<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.790> left<00:01:21.119> analog<00:01:21.360> stick<00:01:21.570> makes<00:01:22.080> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
ok in the left analog stick makes you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.600 
ok in the left analog stick makes you
crouch<00:01:23.040> which<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> kind<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.479> expected

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
crouch which is kind of expected

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.260 
crouch which is kind of expected
clicking<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.909> does<00:01:28.159> nothing<00:01:29.159> maybe<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.790> think

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
clicking a does nothing maybe I think

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.520 
clicking a does nothing maybe I think
actually<00:01:30.390> doesn't<00:01:30.720> mean<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> menus<00:01:31.350> but

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
actually doesn't mean in the menus but

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.499 
actually doesn't mean in the menus but
for<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.740> moment<00:01:31.829> does<00:01:32.159> nothing<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.299> can

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
for the moment does nothing so I can

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.080 
for the moment does nothing so I can

change<00:03:01.349> of<00:03:01.500> U<00:03:01.680> now<00:03:02.269> let's<00:03:03.269> see<00:03:03.599> what<00:03:03.810> L<00:03:04.109> V<00:03:04.799> goes

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
change of U now let's see what L V goes

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.509 
change of U now let's see what L V goes
looks<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:05.760> OB<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.389> doing<00:03:06.689> nothing<00:03:06.930> but<00:03:07.519> a

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
looks like OB is doing nothing but a

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.640 
looks like OB is doing nothing but a
third-person<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.540> LB<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.349> does<00:03:10.530> nothing

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
third-person and LB that does nothing

third-person and LB that does nothing
okay<00:03:11.549> let's<00:03:11.760> try<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:12.680> left<00:03:13.680> trigger<00:03:14.959> that

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
okay let's try the left trigger that

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:16.909 
okay let's try the left trigger that
zooms<00:03:16.500> in

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
zooms in

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.439 
zooms in
so<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.400> triggers<00:03:17.699> to<00:03:17.849> zoom<00:03:18.030> in<00:03:18.209> and

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
so this triggers to zoom in and

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:22.280 
so this triggers to zoom in and
currently<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:20.489> right<00:03:21.150> trigger<00:03:21.510> maybe<00:03:22.019> that

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
currently the right trigger maybe that

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.899 
currently the right trigger maybe that
has<00:03:22.560> something<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:23.040> do<00:03:23.280> with<00:03:24.139> fighting<00:03:25.819> let<00:03:26.819> me
