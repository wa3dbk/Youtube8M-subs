00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:22.510
 and here is the ritz 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:26.950
 minecraft and today I continue the map review 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:30.550
 of stratosphere survival and guys the 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.290
 you may have dropped a payment and it was 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.450
 pretty funny guys to quality and to 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.370
 empty good as you always know 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.379
 I do in the review of the maps that I do 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.940
 in my mini series you have in the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.920
 description 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.019
 in the download link is valid and also 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.750
 the forum link will be good where 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.910
 are the challenges of this map because it brings 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.670
 challenges good first thing I have to tell you 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.559
 is that it is easy and difficult is difficult 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.750
 because you have to find the island 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.030
 appropriate to the first one because if we do not 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.320
 we are going to put a lot of messes and 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.019
 problems but once we find 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.839
 a good island where to get things 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.509
 to move forward to grow to climb the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.490
 level because it will be quite simple is 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.399
 more would say that exceedingly easy because 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.289
 for example on this island not but in a 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.390
 that stops here because it goes up a lot of 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.670
 level have diamonds let's get them 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.200
 come out by the ears, it has to be said that 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.960
 it's pretty good the salts are 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.630
 placed randomly that's always 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.399
 thank you there is some injury as you see and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.720
 it does not have to be zombies 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.149
 secrets or spiders and good is pretty 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.490
 well because there are many many islands like 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.250
 you see here because here is like a 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.229
 Pretty pretty jungle and there are 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 another but this is more like an esplanade 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.140
 good has 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.420
 some little things very much the most 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.359
 the decorations are very cool 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.069
 but you have to say everything and it's that I do not 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:54.159
 has liked this map too much 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.229
 because there is an amazing piece of bug in 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.969
 this good island really is not a bug 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.630
 it is an error of the map creator but 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.899
 good 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.689
 let's call it if it's a mistake on this island 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.189
 there is a portal nÃ©ider is valid and when 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.700
 we left that portal we should 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.730
 appear there not we do not eat 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.790
 a portal here in a vacuum that does not 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.470
 mola absolutely nothing is not cool 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.660
 nothing at all because we have to do 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.700
 a little way out there over there 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.280
 well a disgusting guys the truth is that no 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.769
 It gives me nothing and it's a shame but it's what 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.390
 there is otherwise pretty good what 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.849
 only that they give you so many 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.030
 many things there are enough islands 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.620
 all very cool and nothing I think not 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.349
 I have to say absolutely nothing more 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.260
 from this map well this is a buddha 1.4 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.180
 it seems that you can not detect the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.400
 text of the posters that are in those 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.829
 coordinates 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.079
 and there is nothing as often as it is 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.700
 troller for what you just saw 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.459
 generated in a moron we should have 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.280
 careful I enlighten in my series but not 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.799
 I could do nothing and I came out a lot 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.780
 mobs without subway will do very much to 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.870
 guys but I liked it a lot 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.310
 this review that I hope you play in the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:13.180
 map and nothing you liked and until 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.580
 now the eternal struggle over whether this is 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.830
 who is cool 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.830
 like the ua 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.790
 to me 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.900
 Y
