ever<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.240> worth<00:01:15.689> doing<00:01:15.930> all<00:01:16.350> right

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409

ever then it's not worth doing all right
here<00:01:16.650> we<00:01:16.740> go<00:01:16.770> looking<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.700> Gina's<00:01:18.090> eyes<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
here we go looking in Gina's eyes and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.639 
here we go looking in Gina's eyes and
she's<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.290> let's<00:01:20.040> go<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.460> it

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
she's like let's go for it

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.830 
she's like let's go for it
there's<00:01:22.219> just<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.579> really<00:01:23.000> cool<00:01:23.299> balance<00:01:23.479> of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
there's just a really cool balance of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.749 
there's just a really cool balance of
characters<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.619> I<00:01:24.770> think<00:01:25.009> that<00:01:25.159> that<00:01:25.340> shines

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
characters and I think that that shines

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.080 
characters and I think that that shines
through<00:01:25.909> in<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.600> fighters<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.280> idea<00:01:28.820> was

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
through in the fighters so the idea was

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.789 
through in the fighters so the idea was
creating<00:01:29.509> a<00:01:29.600> dynamic<00:01:29.780> where<00:01:30.229> I'm<00:01:30.350> all<00:01:30.560> about

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
creating a dynamic where I'm all about

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.480 
creating a dynamic where I'm all about
survival<00:01:31.429> she's<00:01:31.909> all<00:01:32.090> about<00:01:32.329> technique<00:01:33.490> Misha

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
survival she's all about technique Misha
