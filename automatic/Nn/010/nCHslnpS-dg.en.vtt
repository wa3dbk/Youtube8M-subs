there<00:00:11.260> we<00:00:11.410> go<00:00:11.530> GeForce<00:00:12.130> GT<00:00:12.720> -<00:00:13.720> 30<00:00:14.320> M<00:00:14.650> okay<00:00:15.460> so

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
there we go GeForce GT - 30 M okay so

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.430 
there we go GeForce GT - 30 M okay so
here's<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:15.880> setup<00:00:16.090> now<00:00:16.449> I<00:00:16.480> have<00:00:16.779> overclocked

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
here's the setup now I have overclocked

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.020 
here's the setup now I have overclocked
I'm<00:00:17.710> running<00:00:17.980> out<00:00:18.100> slight<00:00:18.460> overclock<00:00:18.850> you

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.030 
I'm running out slight overclock you

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.900 
I'm running out slight overclock you
want<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:19.240> see<00:00:19.300> that<00:00:19.420> video<00:00:19.570> click<00:00:19.780> the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
want to see that video click the

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.109 
want to see that video click the
annotation<00:00:21.910> and<00:00:22.120> we're<00:00:22.960> going<00:00:23.110> to<00:00:23.140> load<00:00:24.119> ARMA

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
annotation and we're going to load ARMA

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.100 
annotation and we're going to load ARMA
there<00:00:25.420> we<00:00:25.600> go

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
there we go

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.290 
there we go
look<00:00:26.380> at<00:00:26.500> that<00:00:26.710> 30<00:00:27.190> frames<00:00:28.020> ok<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.880> is<00:00:31.150> an

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
look at that 30 frames ok this is an

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.399 
look at that 30 frames ok this is an
online<00:00:31.539> multiplayer<00:00:32.410> map<00:00:34.019> with<00:00:35.019> people

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:35.409 
online multiplayer map with people

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:38.399 
online multiplayer map with people
online<00:00:35.679> right<00:00:36.159> now<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.870> don't<00:00:38.019> really<00:00:38.170> play

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
online right now you don't really play

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:40.590 
online right now you don't really play
ARMA<00:00:38.949> any<00:00:39.129> other<00:00:39.339> way<00:00:39.460> really<00:00:39.879> so<00:00:40.210> will<00:00:40.420> be<00:00:40.569> a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
ARMA any other way really so will be a

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.040 
ARMA any other way really so will be a
point<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.079> testing<00:00:41.409> it<00:00:41.559> in<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.710> test<00:00:41.949> range<00:00:42.219> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
point of testing it in the test range I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.459 
point of testing it in the test range I
am<00:00:44.050> playing<00:00:44.379> with<00:00:44.589> one<00:00:44.769> hand<00:00:44.800> so<00:00:45.159> you<00:00:45.249> got<00:00:45.370> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
am playing with one hand so you got the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.369 
am playing with one hand so you got the
part<00:00:47.469> in<00:00:47.649> light<00:00:48.300> crap<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.479> playing<00:00:49.780> abilities

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
part in light crap you playing abilities

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.250 
part in light crap you playing abilities
I'll<00:00:50.589> show<00:00:50.769> you<00:00:50.859> what<00:00:51.010> options<00:00:51.460> I<00:00:51.579> did<00:00:51.819> here<00:00:52.449> so

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.930 

configure<00:00:57.539> video<00:00:58.539> ok<00:00:59.170> so<00:00:59.229> I<00:00:59.679> turn<00:01:00.399> my<00:01:00.519> overall

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
configure video ok so I turn my overall

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.100 
configure video ok so I turn my overall
drawing<00:01:01.479> down<00:01:01.749> a<00:01:02.079> lot<00:01:02.469> it'll<00:01:02.979> put<00:01:03.190> up<00:01:03.339> to<00:01:03.459> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
drawing down a lot it'll put up to that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.709 
drawing down a lot it'll put up to that
vote<00:01:05.430> let's<00:01:06.430> do<00:01:06.579> that<00:01:06.789> how<00:01:07.000> many<00:01:07.060> frames<00:01:07.360> do<00:01:07.659> I

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:07.719 
vote let's do that how many frames do I

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.249 
vote let's do that how many frames do I

doesn't have a lot to do it to do with
that<00:01:22.359> I<00:01:22.450> noticed<00:01:22.780> in<00:01:22.899> ARMA<00:01:23.259> you're<00:01:23.530> getting

that I noticed in ARMA you're getting

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.990 
that I noticed in ARMA you're getting
almost<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.159> same<00:01:24.280> frames<00:01:24.579> no<00:01:24.700> matter<00:01:24.820> what

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
almost the same frames no matter what

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.940 
almost the same frames no matter what
resolution<00:01:25.299> you<00:01:25.539> put<00:01:25.719> down<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:26.380> big<00:01:26.649> thing

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
resolution you put down the big thing

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.190 
resolution you put down the big thing
you<00:01:27.159> want<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.430> do<00:01:27.609> is<00:01:27.850> that<00:01:28.659> over<00:01:28.899> here<00:01:28.930> is<00:01:29.170> a

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
you want to do is that over here is a

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.709 
you want to do is that over here is a
GPU<00:01:29.740> Rideau<00:01:30.130> you<00:01:30.850> want<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.149> make<00:01:31.359> sure<00:01:31.390> it's

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:31.719 
GPU Rideau you want to make sure it's

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.529 
GPU Rideau you want to make sure it's
utilizing<00:01:32.469> all<00:01:32.649> of<00:01:32.979> your<00:01:33.100> GPU<00:01:33.520> because<00:01:34.000> i<00:01:34.149> was

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
utilizing all of your GPU because i was

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.520 
utilizing all of your GPU because i was

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
in this game for some that's what

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.389 
in this game for some that's what
happened<00:01:52.929> to<00:01:52.990> me<00:01:53.140> so<00:01:53.350> if<00:01:53.829> you<00:01:53.979> have<00:01:54.100> problems

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
happened to me so if you have problems

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.660 
happened to me so if you have problems
and<00:01:54.939> you're<00:01:55.450> running<00:01:55.780> Jeep<00:01:56.020> our<00:01:56.259> CPU<00:01:56.829> unpark

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
and you're running Jeep our CPU unpark

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.469 
and you're running Jeep our CPU unpark
get<00:01:57.969> rid<00:01:58.149> of<00:01:58.210> it<00:01:58.359> ok<00:01:58.780> and<00:02:00.149> yeah<00:02:01.149> I'm<00:02:01.240> gonna<00:02:01.390> hit

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
get rid of it ok and yeah I'm gonna hit

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.279 
get rid of it ok and yeah I'm gonna hit
ok<00:02:01.810> now<00:02:02.789> we<00:02:03.789> increase<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.420> distance<00:02:04.869> was<00:02:05.109> I<00:02:05.229> do

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
ok now we increase the distance was I do

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.630 
ok now we increase the distance was I do
for<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.619> framerate<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:07.420> dropped<00:02:07.950> 5<00:02:08.950> or<00:02:09.130> 6<00:02:09.310> frames

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
for a framerate we dropped 5 or 6 frames

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.230 
for a framerate we dropped 5 or 6 frames
which<00:02:10.090> in<00:02:10.420> my<00:02:10.960> opinion<00:02:11.080> is<00:02:11.650> completely<00:02:12.520> doable

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
which in my opinion is completely doable

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.390 
which in my opinion is completely doable
because<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:14.020> want<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.230> be

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
because you want to be

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.020 
because you want to be
to<00:02:14.519> see<00:02:14.670> people<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.150> distance<00:02:16.849> which<00:02:17.849> we
