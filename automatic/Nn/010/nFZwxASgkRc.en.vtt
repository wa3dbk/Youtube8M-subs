00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
coupon for it so I got this purple

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.050 
coupon for it so I got this purple
carefresh<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.370> thought<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.550> would<00:02:39.730> give<00:02:39.850> some

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
carefresh I thought I would give some

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.490 
carefresh I thought I would give some
color<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:41.190> Toffees<00:02:42.190> cage<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:43.209> so<00:02:43.870> I<00:02:44.290> think

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
color to Toffees cage and so I think

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.680 
color to Toffees cage and so I think
this<00:02:44.740> was<00:02:44.920> like<00:02:45.070> for<00:02:45.250> me<00:02:45.400> seven<00:02:45.940> dollars<00:02:46.330> I

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
this was like for me seven dollars I

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.420 
this was like for me seven dollars I
think<00:02:47.050> maybe<00:02:47.320> or<00:02:47.740> maybe<00:02:47.890> was<00:02:48.100> eight<00:02:48.250> dollars

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430
