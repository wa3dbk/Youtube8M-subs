experience<00:00:58.980> dealing<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.030> perception<00:01:00.690> so

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
experience dealing with perception so

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020

next next step to evolve into for me my
personal<00:01:27.060> evolution<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:28.560> making<00:01:28.979> images<00:01:29.100> so

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
personal evolution in making images so

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.200 
personal evolution in making images so
that<00:01:31.040> kind<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.100> set<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.340> tone<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.970> like

that kind of set the tone that was like

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.010 
that kind of set the tone that was like
about<00:01:34.130> 81<00:01:35.130> 83<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> had<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> great

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
pleasure of an honor of meeting Bucky

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.109 
pleasure of an honor of meeting Bucky
and<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.900> galvanized<00:01:40.880> sort<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> my

and that really galvanized sort of my
path<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.689> terms<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:43.140> staying<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.890> this

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
path in terms of staying on with this

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.580 
path in terms of staying on with this
and<00:01:44.280> there's<00:01:44.939> been<00:01:45.119> great<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.600> hook<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.560> with

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and there's been great to hook up with

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.660 
and there's been great to hook up with
snack<00:01:47.960> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> last<00:01:49.860> few<00:01:50.070> years<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
snack in the in the last few years to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.260 
snack in the in the last few years to
kind<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.329> into<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:52.909> like<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.119> so

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
kind of get back into this like that so

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.200 
kind of get back into this like that so
anyway<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.540> got<00:01:54.750> into<00:01:54.960> computer<00:01:55.290> graphics<00:01:55.770> then

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
anyway I got into computer graphics then

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.719 
anyway I got into computer graphics then
and<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.329> let<00:01:57.570> traditional<00:01:58.200> media<00:01:58.469> go<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:59.549> was

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and I let traditional media go this was

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.630 
and I let traditional media go this was
about<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.060> middle<00:02:00.270> 80s<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> that's<00:02:02.369> kind<00:02:02.610> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
about the middle 80s so that's kind of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.120 
about the middle 80s so that's kind of
what<00:02:02.790> I've<00:02:02.909> been<00:02:03.149> pursuing<00:02:03.770> primarily<00:02:04.770> in

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
what I've been pursuing primarily in

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.520 
what I've been pursuing primarily in
steel<00:02:05.729> imagery<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> lot<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.229> years<00:02:07.380> doing

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
steel imagery for a lot of years doing

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.790 
steel imagery for a lot of years doing
digital<00:02:07.740> prints<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.539> combining<00:02:10.080> geometry

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
digital prints and combining geometry

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.590 
digital prints and combining geometry
and

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.820 
and
figuration<00:02:13.060> recognizable<00:02:14.060> people<00:02:14.360> in<00:02:14.510> things

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
figuration recognizable people in things

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.350 
figuration recognizable people in things
those<00:02:15.830> kinds<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.250> things<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.910> abstraction

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
those kinds of things the abstraction

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.720 
those kinds of things the abstraction
and<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.780> figuration<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:19.130> realism<00:02:19.460> are

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
and the figuration and the realism are

I<00:02:24.040> did<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.070> talk<00:02:25.370> at<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.480> new<00:02:26.660> Gucci<00:02:27.050> museum

last<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:28.040> fall<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:29.000> synergetics<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.690> art

so<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.170> was<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.320> was<00:02:30.650> great<00:02:30.980> honor<00:02:31.190> and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
so that was that was great honor and

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.550 
so that was that was great honor and
that<00:02:31.520> was<00:02:31.640> really<00:02:32.450> really<00:02:32.690> fun<00:02:32.990> I<00:02:33.020> think<00:02:33.290> many

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
that was really really fun I think many

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.870 
that was really really fun I think many

I think we're at that moment again you
know<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.560> sort<00:03:45.800> of<00:03:45.830> a<00:03:45.920> psychical<00:03:46.460> take<00:03:47.060> on

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
bubbling over into the foreground which

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.880 
bubbling over into the foreground which
we're<00:03:52.340> all<00:03:52.490> helping<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:54.290> bring<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.650> into

we're all helping and to bring that into
