00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.240
 Y 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.460
 giovanni dos santos had one of his 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.590
 best performances as selected 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.810
 Mexican in this arena of 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.240
 the dunes however the same forward 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.430
 highlighted more the joint work that 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.740
 had the tricolor team to take out the 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.960
 triumph in front of the mind I am happy 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.000
 for him because of the work the team did 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.530
 in the collective today I think we have all 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.410
 given a great game we have left it inside 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.660
 of the field and we have shown that we come 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.129
 working well everyone understanding very 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.540
 well what is what what the teacher 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.480
 wants us to do inside the field like this 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.030
 I see a very strong group and very 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.519
 happy for that the teacher says 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.350
 before the game did not happen what 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.659
 never happen will miss her head and 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.940
 keep trying and that's what 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.479
 what we do I do not think the team already 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.949
 He has shown maturity despite 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:01.670
 we canceled two goals that 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.799
 we saw it clearly the team tried everything 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.659
 the party we control the game very 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.860
 well and I think that's a point well 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.670
 strong what the team is showing 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.460
 that despite any adversity 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.430
 we are moving forward and I think today 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.350
 we have done a great job 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.890
 playing a world game is always 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.730
 special and more and then win your team 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.430
 I have this duty with more joy do not you 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.320
 I say I feel very grateful for 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.690
 the trust of the teacher and the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.110
 physically companions I have commented 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.030
 I come very well 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.150
 I think the group has been working very hard 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.180
 well and I feel motivated to play the 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.610
 worldwide we know that I have 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.160
 Brazilian family friends here but 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.440
 well that 's a point and I think that 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.840
 you do not need extra motivation to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.330
 for worldwide play even though it 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.979
 they canceled two goals in the wrong way I 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.200
 was named by the fifa the best
