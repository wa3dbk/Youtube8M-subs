family<00:00:38.180> in<00:00:38.480> spinach<00:00:38.840> I<00:00:39.079> toyed<00:00:39.470> around<00:00:39.589> now

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
family in spinach I toyed around now

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.439 
family in spinach I toyed around now
mid-april<00:00:40.670> okay

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
mid-april okay

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.079 
mid-april okay
and<00:00:41.540> then<00:00:42.140> I've<00:00:42.290> do<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.530> second<00:00:43.100> sowing<00:00:43.460> in<00:00:43.730> tune

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
and then I've do a second sowing in tune

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.479 
and then I've do a second sowing in tune
okay<00:00:44.900> class<00:00:45.170> oh<00:00:45.409> she<00:00:45.470> shows<00:00:45.890> how<00:00:46.070> to<00:00:46.129> sow<00:00:46.339> the

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
okay class oh she shows how to sow the

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.200 
okay class oh she shows how to sow the
seeds<00:00:47.050> so<00:00:48.050> we<00:00:48.559> fill<00:00:48.800> our<00:00:48.949> see<00:00:49.159> tray<00:00:49.399> again<00:00:49.550> nice

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
seeds so we fill our see tray again nice

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.110 
seeds so we fill our see tray again nice
and<00:00:50.479> loose<00:00:50.720> first<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.979> then<00:00:52.309> with<00:00:52.489> it<00:00:52.640> just<00:00:53.030> a

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
and loose first and then with it just a

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.560 
and loose first and then with it just a
big<00:00:53.329> to<00:00:53.870> three<00:00:54.140> taps<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:54.920> permit<00:00:55.339> in<00:00:55.460> cuts<00:00:56.089> the

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
big to three taps to permit in cuts the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.369 
big to three taps to permit in cuts the
comp<00:00:56.809> excess<00:00:57.379> compost<00:00:57.890> off<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:58.449> a<00:00:59.449> big<00:00:59.659> holes

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
comp excess compost off and a big holes

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.350 
comp excess compost off and a big holes
in<00:01:00.710> about<00:01:01.009> two<00:01:01.220> centimeters<00:01:01.909> deep<00:01:02.089> now

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
in about two centimeters deep now

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.060 
in about two centimeters deep now
because<00:01:02.720> they're<00:01:02.900> quite<00:01:03.080> big<00:01:03.350> seeds<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:03.920> they

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
because they're quite big seeds so they

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.520 
because they're quite big seeds so they
can<00:01:04.250> be<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.269> in<00:01:05.390> a<00:01:05.479> little<00:01:05.720> bit<00:01:05.840> deeper<00:01:05.990> two

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
can be so in a little bit deeper two

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.070 
can be so in a little bit deeper two
centimetres<00:01:07.189> fingernails<00:01:07.820> depth<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.869> big

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
centimetres fingernails depth the big

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.859 
centimetres fingernails depth the big
seed<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:09.560> they're<00:01:09.710> easily<00:01:10.180> put<00:01:11.180> in<00:01:11.330> one<00:01:11.570> seed

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
seed so they're easily put in one seed

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.890 
seed so they're easily put in one seed
in<00:01:12.140> each<00:01:12.439> cell<00:01:12.770> when<00:01:13.549> you<00:01:13.670> finished<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.600> put

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
in each cell when you finished you put

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.359 
in each cell when you finished you put
fine<00:01:15.799> seed<00:01:16.130> compost<00:01:16.670> over<00:01:17.119> fill<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:17.630> again<00:01:17.750> and

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
fine seed compost over fill it again and

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.730 
fine seed compost over fill it again and
then<00:01:19.369> scrape<00:01:19.790> it<00:01:19.970> off<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.420> that's<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:21.350> that's

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
then scrape it off and that's it that's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.910 
then scrape it off and that's it that's
ready<00:01:21.979> it<00:01:22.850> just<00:01:22.909> water<00:01:23.299> it<00:01:23.570> in<00:01:23.720> gently<00:01:24.049> don't

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
ready it just water it in gently don't

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.429 
ready it just water it in gently don't
overwater<00:01:25.549> over<00:01:26.329> watering<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.869> just<00:01:27.140> as<00:01:27.259> bad

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
overwater over watering is just as bad

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.169 
overwater over watering is just as bad
as<00:01:27.679> under<00:01:28.009> watering<00:01:28.429> because<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:28.909> see<00:01:29.060> it's

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
as under watering because to see it's

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.020 
as under watering because to see it's
may<00:01:29.359> rot<00:01:29.569> away<00:01:29.749> and<00:01:30.170> that's<00:01:30.679> it<00:01:30.859> so<00:01:31.490> each<00:01:31.700> seed

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
may rot away and that's it so each seed

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.419 
may rot away and that's it so each seed
you<00:01:32.210> sow<00:01:32.420> in<00:01:32.689> there<00:01:32.899> will<00:01:33.350> make<00:01:33.560> three<00:01:33.890> four

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
you sow in there will make three four

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.080 
you sow in there will make three four
five<00:01:34.789> seams<00:01:35.569> and<00:01:35.869> that's<00:01:36.289> a<00:01:36.350> problem<00:01:36.770> because

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
five seams and that's a problem because

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.529 
five seams and that's a problem because
you<00:01:38.090> need<00:01:38.329> to<00:01:38.479> thin<00:01:38.719> them<00:01:38.929> to<00:01:39.139> one<00:01:39.380> seedling<00:01:39.710> ya

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
you need to thin them to one seedling ya

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.539 
you need to thin them to one seedling ya
don't<00:01:41.539> through<00:01:41.869> TV<00:01:42.289> speak<00:01:42.950> here's<00:01:43.249> when<00:01:43.429> we

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
don't through TV speak here's when we

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.279 
don't through TV speak here's when we
made<00:01:43.729> earlier<00:01:44.090> exactly<00:01:44.630> like<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> cookery

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
made earlier exactly like a cookery

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.980 
made earlier exactly like a cookery
program<00:01:45.770> isn't<00:01:46.039> it<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.729> see<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.659> here<00:01:47.960> that

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
program isn't it so see that here that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.680 
program isn't it so see that here that
one<00:01:48.289> was<00:01:48.560> one<00:01:48.740> seeds<00:01:49.100> hinted<00:01:49.819> out<00:01:49.999> here

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.930 

so<00:01:54.690> for<00:01:55.500> our<00:01:55.530> spinach<00:01:56.160> what<00:01:56.340> what<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:56.790> some

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
so for our spinach what what what some

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.030 
so for our spinach what what what some
soil<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.330> we<00:01:57.420> looking<00:01:57.660> for<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.650> fertile

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
soil are we looking for really fertile

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.520 
soil are we looking for really fertile
soil<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.880> more<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.420> feed<00:02:00.660> them<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.260> bigger

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
soil the more you feed them the bigger

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.740 
soil the more you feed them the bigger
they<00:02:01.680> grow<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.220> it's<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.460> greedy<00:02:02.820> old<00:02:03.060> plant<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
they grow so it's a greedy old plant the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.000 
they grow so it's a greedy old plant the
other<00:02:03.930> thing<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.410> want<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.680> plant<00:02:04.860> it

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
other thing is you want to plant it

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.250 
other thing is you want to plant it
firmly<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.910> ground<00:02:06.150> okay<00:02:06.600> because<00:02:07.020> once

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
firmly in the ground okay because once

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.350 
firmly in the ground okay because once
you<00:02:07.440> start<00:02:07.680> picking<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.130> leaves<00:02:08.310> it'll<00:02:08.790> rock

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you start picking the leaves it'll rock

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.540 
you start picking the leaves it'll rock
in<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:09.630> ground<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.560> really<00:02:11.040> need<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.430> get

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
in the ground so really need to get

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.810 
in the ground so really need to get
thrown<00:02:12.000> plant<00:02:12.360> anything<00:02:12.810> yeah<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.820> what

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
thrown plant anything yeah and what

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.220 
thrown plant anything yeah and what
distance<00:02:15.210> apart<00:02:15.510> are<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.780> going<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:15.990> do<00:02:16.110> it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
distance apart are we going to do it

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.080 
distance apart are we going to do it
give<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.800> good<00:02:17.040> bit<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.430> distance<00:02:17.880> like<00:02:18.060> a

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
give it a good bit of distance like a
