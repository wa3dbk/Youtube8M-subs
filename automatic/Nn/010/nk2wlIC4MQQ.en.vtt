00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.119
 of the right screen if it is 5 5.96 point 3 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.859
 inches and but they 're talking about 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.850
 probably it comes with a processor 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.969
 15 in the five eight-core touch 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.629

 berlin in the synagogue in ifa and then 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.980
 That's it, he's coming. 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.680
 be a little bigger 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.520

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.730
 is a tablet is the phone is a rocket 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.010

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.650
 samsung as i see that samsung 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.409

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.280
 new device every day taliban 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.110
 there is a good new year and what new 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.150
 new technologies there. 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 it appears that the consumer or 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.509
 quota liking this much understood 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:27.150
 so this is the car you notice 3 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:30.479
 he will have a screen there a bad and aegean egypt 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.430

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.939
 new technology to save more 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:41.820
 energy in relation to super-amoled and he

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.960
 but it is a new technology for 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.860
 save even more energy from the super 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.460
 current amoled and will come with a 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.259
 just as their predecessors 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.960
