00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
an After Effects project so that you can

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.620 
an After Effects project so that you can
kind<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.580> do<00:00:21.029> some<00:00:21.240> animation<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.050> get<00:00:23.010> some

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
cool-looking logos and whatnot into your

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.480 
cool-looking logos and whatnot into your
After<00:00:27.420> Effects<00:00:27.660> projects<00:00:28.140> after<00:00:28.890> creating

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
After Effects projects after creating

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.089 
After Effects projects after creating
them<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.939> Illustrator<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.080> let's<00:00:31.740> get<00:00:31.890> into

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
them in Illustrator so let's get into

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.660 
them in Illustrator so let's get into
how<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:33.510> quickly<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.770> kind

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
how to do that just quickly this is kind

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.620 
how to do that just quickly this is kind
of<00:00:35.700> what<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> created<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.450> little

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
of what I created just a little

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.889 
of what I created just a little
pineapple<00:00:36.840> character<00:00:37.559> ah<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:39.000> then<00:00:39.750> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
pineapple character ah and then it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.680 
pineapple character ah and then it
explodes<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.070> did<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.790> by<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.510> into

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
explodes and so I did that by going into

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.840 
explodes and so I did that by going into
illustrator<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.920> creating<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.610> quick

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
illustrator and creating a quick

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.240 
illustrator and creating a quick
illustrator<00:00:45.329> file<00:00:45.600> these<00:00:46.590> are<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.890> separate

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
illustrator file these are just separate

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.560 
illustrator file these are just separate
layers<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.059> really<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> most

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
layers and that's really the most

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.810 
layers and that's really the most
important<00:00:49.020> part<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.829> separating<00:00:50.640> all

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
important part of this is separating all

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.959 
important part of this is separating all
of<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.090> layers<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.399> be

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
of your layers that are going to be

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.819 
of your layers that are going to be
edited<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.079> position<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> be

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
edited or the position is going to be

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.910 
edited or the position is going to be
changed<00:00:56.309> anything<00:00:56.760> inside<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:58.260> After

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
changed anything inside of your After

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.000 
changed anything inside of your After
Effects<00:00:59.190> project<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.930> saved<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.739> as

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
Effects project and so I saved this as

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.460 
Effects project and so I saved this as
an<00:01:02.579> AI<00:01:02.730> project<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> again<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.320> you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
an AI project and again right here you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.039 
an AI project and again right here you
can<00:01:04.589> see<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:04.949> layers<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.939> everything<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
can see in layers that everything is a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.520 
can see in layers that everything is a
separate<00:01:07.799> layer<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.729> saved<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.150> as<00:01:09.530> an

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
separate layer so I saved that as an

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.270 
separate layer so I saved that as an
illustrator<00:01:11.010> project<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:13.280> After

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
illustrator project when in After

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.960 
illustrator project when in After
Effects<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.259> my<00:01:16.700> pineapple<00:01:17.700> video

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
Effects and I have my pineapple video

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.320 
Effects and I have my pineapple video
set<00:01:18.240> up<00:01:18.330> right<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.659> I'll<00:01:18.900> double<00:01:19.409> click

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
set up right here I'll double click

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.410 
set up right here I'll double click
illustrator<00:01:21.330> face<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:23.150> then<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.390> here

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
illustrator face and then right here

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.100 
illustrator face and then right here
you'll<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.900> import<00:01:25.830> as<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.990> either

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
you'll see import as and you can either

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.950 
you'll see import as and you can either
import<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.710> footage<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.700> composition<00:01:30.420> or

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
import as footage a composition or

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.620 
import as footage a composition or
composition<00:01:31.380> retain<00:01:32.189> layer<00:01:32.640> sizes<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
composition retain layer sizes and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
composition retain layer sizes and
retain<00:01:34.259> layer<00:01:34.470> sizes<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.100> what<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.460> want<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
retain layer sizes is what we want to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.210 
retain layer sizes is what we want to
bring<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.320> way<00:01:37.470> it'll

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
bring it in as and that way it'll

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.550 
bring it in as and that way it'll
actually<00:01:38.430> allow<00:01:39.030> us<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.540> then<00:01:39.750> edit<00:01:40.200> those

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
actually allow us to then edit those

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.859 
actually allow us to then edit those
individual<00:01:41.369> layers<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.299> let's<00:01:42.509> click<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
individual layers so let's click on that

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.819 
individual layers so let's click on that
say<00:01:43.740> open<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.390> right<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.500> we

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
say open and right here you can see we

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.740 
say open and right here you can see we
have<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> new<00:01:47.189> composition<00:01:47.790> called<00:01:48.119> face<00:01:48.450> -<00:01:48.720> I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
have a new composition called face - I

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.620 
have a new composition called face - I
already<00:01:49.229> had<00:01:49.409> regular<00:01:50.189> face<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.759> right<00:01:51.299> here

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
already had regular face and right here

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.389 
already had regular face and right here
we<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:51.960> all<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> our<00:01:52.500> different<00:01:52.829> layers<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
we have all of our different layers and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.959 
we have all of our different layers and
so<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:54.030> turn<00:01:54.240> these<00:01:54.390> off<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.020> want<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
so I can turn these off if I want to and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.780 
so I can turn these off if I want to and
I<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.180> manipulate<00:01:57.509> them<00:01:58.579> individually<00:01:59.579> so

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
I can manipulate them individually so

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.700 
I can manipulate them individually so
what<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.170> from<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.969> grab<00:02:02.969> face<00:02:03.299> -

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
what we can do from here is grab face -

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.410 
what we can do from here is grab face -
drop<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.740> down<00:02:04.950> into<00:02:05.250> our<00:02:05.280> project<00:02:05.820> bring<00:02:06.329> it

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
drop it down into our project bring it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.109 
drop it down into our project bring it
up<00:02:06.509> over<00:02:06.810> top<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:06.990> pineapple<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.940> can

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
up over top of pineapple and then we can

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.630 
up over top of pineapple and then we can
scale<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.660> up<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.069> do<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.160> right<00:02:11.340> here

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
scale it up and do it right here

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.440 
scale it up and do it right here
scale<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.790> down<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:15.700> then<00:02:16.700> pull<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.030> down<00:02:17.090> here

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
scale it down and then pull it down here

of these I'm going to select all those
keyframes<00:02:41.530> keyframe<00:02:42.530> interpolation<00:02:43.180> and

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
keyframes keyframe interpolation and

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.890 
keyframes keyframe interpolation and
let's<00:02:44.630> go<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.810> continuous<00:02:45.470> bezzie<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.510> say<00:02:47.510> okay

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
let's go to continuous bezzie a say okay

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.750 
let's go to continuous bezzie a say okay
and<00:02:48.860> now<00:02:50.590> we<00:02:51.590> see<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:51.830> we<00:02:52.370> have<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.550> nice
