hey guys welcome to this tutorial if the
description<00:00:14.759> below<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.450> can<00:00:15.480> find<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.139> this

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
description below you can find that this

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.150 
description below you can find that this
really<00:00:16.470> matches<00:00:16.949> links<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.480> go

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.130 

first<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.580> start<00:00:24.000> with<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.269> rice<00:00:24.600> or<00:00:24.840> solo

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
first we start with the rice or solo

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.269 
first we start with the rice or solo
view<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.859> add<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.430> background<00:00:26.849> image<00:00:28.279> this

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
view and add a background image this

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.220 
view and add a background image this
will<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> outline<00:00:30.420> okay<00:00:31.820> now<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.540> add<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
will be the outline okay now we add the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.150 
will be the outline okay now we add the
sphere<00:00:34.469> object<00:00:36.200> reduce<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> segment<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.860> 12

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
sphere object reduce the segment to 12

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.770 
sphere object reduce the segment to 12
and<00:00:38.460> turn<00:00:38.820> 90<00:00:39.660> degrees<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.530> x-axis<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
and turn 90 degrees of the x-axis a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.430 
and turn 90 degrees of the x-axis a
scale<00:00:43.340> now<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.820> will<00:00:45.059> enter<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.719> edit<00:00:45.840> mode<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
scale now we will enter to edit mode and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.830 
scale now we will enter to edit mode and
activate<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> proportional<00:00:48.059> entity<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
activate a proportional entity with the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
activate a proportional entity with the

activity<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:54.030> cannot<00:00:54.390> forget<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.140> remove

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
activity and we cannot forget to remove

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.319 
activity and we cannot forget to remove
the<00:00:55.440> type<00:00:55.800> triangles<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:57.030> once<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the type triangles because once you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.770 
the type triangles because once you
divide<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.530> problems<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.730> let's<00:01:00.480> make

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
divide it it was problems now let's make

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.579 
divide it it was problems now let's make
the<00:01:01.020> areas<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:02.010> selected<00:01:02.719> duplicate<00:01:03.719> turn<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the areas we selected duplicate turn it

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.980 
the areas we selected duplicate turn it
into<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.949> new<00:01:05.129> jet<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> contour<00:01:06.270> P<00:01:06.479> stretch

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
into a new jet with a contour P stretch

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.350 
into a new jet with a contour P stretch
make<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> particle<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.880> select<00:01:09.060> these

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
make a particle here we select these

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.950 
make a particle here we select these
faces<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.900> move<00:01:10.320> back<00:01:10.640> okay

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
faces and move back okay

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.800 
faces and move back okay
make<00:01:12.960> another<00:01:13.290> partition<00:01:13.799> shrink<00:01:14.700> enlarge<00:01:15.180> DS

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
make another partition shrink enlarge DS

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.520 
make another partition shrink enlarge DS
and<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> move<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:16.950> well<00:01:17.250> okay<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.810> iris<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and the move as well okay the iris is

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.340 
and the move as well okay the iris is
already<00:01:20.009> done

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.830 

once<00:01:23.350> we<00:01:23.710> have<00:01:23.950> Don<00:01:24.250> VI<00:01:24.580> let's<00:01:25.270> create<00:01:25.630> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
once we have Don VI let's create the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.380 
once we have Don VI let's create the
line<00:01:26.050> we<00:01:26.350> add<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.560> base<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:26.890> cycler<00:01:27.550> enlarging

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
line we add a base a cycler enlarging

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.070 
line we add a base a cycler enlarging
enter<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:29.020> plane<00:01:29.820> rotated<00:01:30.820> at<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.300> booth<00:01:31.510> to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
enter the plane rotated at the booth to

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.990 
enter the plane rotated at the booth to
the<00:01:32.110> circle<00:01:32.800> okay

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
the circle okay

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.600 
the circle okay
we'll<00:01:34.360> transfer<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.050> plane<00:01:35.410> in<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.650> window<00:01:36.160> with

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
we'll transfer a plane in a window with

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.990 
we'll transfer a plane in a window with
a<00:01:36.640> wry<00:01:37.000> body<00:01:37.270> fire<00:01:37.600> this<00:01:38.200> time<00:01:38.500> put<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.370> select

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
a wry body fire this time put to select

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.710 
a wry body fire this time put to select
the<00:01:40.090> window<00:01:40.510> under<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.290> circle<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:43.270> will

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
the window under the circle we will

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.090 
the window under the circle we will
speak<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.320> full<00:01:44.740> bath<00:01:46.080> as<00:01:47.080> you<00:01:47.290> can<00:01:47.440> see<00:01:47.650> now

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
speak and full bath as you can see now

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.340 
speak and full bath as you can see now
with<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.640> timeline<00:01:49.150> can<00:01:49.450> change<00:01:49.990> the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
with the timeline can change the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.770 
with the timeline can change the
lighting<00:01:50.590> but<00:01:51.430> even<00:01:51.760> we<00:01:52.000> need<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.450> add<00:01:52.600> the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
lighting but even we need to add the

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.480 
lighting but even we need to add the
mission<00:01:53.170> material<00:01:55.740> increases<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.950> power<00:01:57.160> to

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
mission material increases the power to

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.580 
mission material increases the power to
30<00:01:58.200> okay

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
30 okay

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.420 
30 okay

the box okay happened that we have a

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.270 
the box okay happened that we have a
problem<00:04:32.719> if<00:04:32.960> we<00:04:33.110> change<00:04:33.469> the<00:04:33.800> light<00:04:33.979> position

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
problem if we change the light position

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.760 
problem if we change the light position
the<00:04:34.909> translucency<00:04:35.629> still<00:04:36.169> appears<00:04:36.500> from

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
the translucency still appears from

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.909 
the translucency still appears from
behind<00:04:36.830> which<00:04:37.669> is<00:04:37.849> a<00:04:38.000> mistake<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:38.960> we<00:04:39.469> have<00:04:39.710> to

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
behind which is a mistake so we have to

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.610 
behind which is a mistake so we have to
duplicate<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.550> eye<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:41.060> make<00:04:41.990> an<00:04:42.379> object

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
duplicate the eye and make an object
