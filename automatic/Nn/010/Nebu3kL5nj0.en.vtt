00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.060
 Brazilians coming, etc. 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.279

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.760
 brazilians cursing 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.740
 we know that the municipality has several civilians 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.900
 several pedestrians of various 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.910
 nationalities and why not put one 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.340
 carioca mouth dirty there in the middle of a 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.450

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.930
 of stimmme if you notice that you have a champion 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.809
 of basketball and beto de campinho may have 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.059
 a caress anchored in the wall that 99% 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.020
 of the times will be a Brazilian if not 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.090
 have a walk around the block 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.039
 to see if it appeared if it appears 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.320

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.600

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:14.869

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.270
 Encompassing such as the monkey or rock 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.170

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.060
 to the surface your body is crazy is crazy to 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.640
 car stab 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.100
 the next one is an easter egg and if I read one 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.750
 review of my old video and 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.070
 physics got really interesting 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.980
 you will first need a 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.080
 ice cream cart which is easily 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.390
 found here on this street that cuts the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.280
 mine 'because you keep wandering until 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.870
 find a defiantly steal a cart is 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.370
 you may notice that these carts 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.380
 the ice cream was just pressed the 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.930
 horn they'll start playing some 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.620
 songs that are polyphonic versions 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.600

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.970
 author and song name is good to know if 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:23.290
 on youtube some of these songs and 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:25.300
 variable as a much better relationship 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.410
 songs and stay change you go 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.410
 to feel somewhat familiar 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.880
 yes it's gta 4 theme if you call 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.860
 prosit to identify which song 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.810
 playing while this song is playing 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.519
 the theme gt hatchback touching it will 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.080
 obviously sending the message will say 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.700
 which is the theme of gta and when you read 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.540
 this message because it enabled one 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.550
 mother-of-saint indicate the kind that fuck well 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.680
 next tip are bank statements 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.840
 we know that invade has several boxes 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.489
 electronics scattered around the city in 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.290
 that you can not do anything but 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.500
 look at your bank account but the others 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.300
 pedestrians can hoard these 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.820
 machines so whenever you see a pedestrian 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.340
 of using this machine it will be enough 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.050
 take a step and chic in it and it goes 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.630
 steal all the money they give to the body 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.730
 remember not to do this at home or 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.400
 street next tip is to abuse the 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.019
 happiness just take a helicopter 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.570
 flying over to the island of happiness 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.150
 so there is a landing lycra to the aussie which 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.040
 it is the feet of the statue in some 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.930
 I know exactly what this shirt is going to have 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.050
 that what makes better than the joke a 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.640
 pun on 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.970
 are the island in front will be enrolled 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.980
 happiness ethical happiness is turning the 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.820
 back is inscribed playland type 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.770
 happiness 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.590
 alencar was close to what it is like 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.510
 to downgrade the only one is to be top car better 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.640
 place to do that game airport 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.740
 I'll just get there, just find 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.930
 an airplane on the runway 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.270
 slowly it gets out of the car and 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.880
 runs against a turbine behind the 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.130
 of the airplane turbine and as challenges for the 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.360
 play a thousand to bugar and make the only one 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.250
 to lower, however, remains and above the ground 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.680
 compressing my legs of him not 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.860
 have words that express competition 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.320
 stay the only one running like a dwarf 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.090
 I do not know an anomaly any next 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.130
 tip is how to multiply your hell 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.260
 we know that hell is the most 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.989
 fast and rarer in the game you just 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.260
 acquires one of these during history if 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.140
 blow you fucked and I'm - I do not 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.790
 I remember having found any 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.490
 hells walking prize at speed is 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.130
 almost impossible to find one randomly 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.020
 unless you are inside the 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.180
 hell a lot of people find hell in 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.010
 The street is driving an ironic thing 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.169
 So what do you do well in your life? 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.140
 Bronca's apartment is going to have a corner 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.510
 middle that is rounded up pble 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.150
 this corner will have a chance of sounds of 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.190
 several cars if you have a car 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.690
 and I saw it as they say from some very 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.910
 away from the game even if not watch out 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.800
 render the cars that will review the 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.410
 car you are in then understood that 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.570
 You make a grab go up to the barrier. 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.810
 more or less back up to the 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.669
 corner back well to notice that not 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.430
 happened while filming what I am 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.680
 unfortunate fucking but it happened already 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.080
 I arrive and only have a 15 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.510
 hell round the corner where everything is 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.340
 color with 100 aerofoil in 16 oil 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.380
 hells cutest 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.180
 according to your taste and only have the 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.320
 parking job he does not know the 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.890
 agency in front of the apartment 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.740
 very utopic seventh and last tip as 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.120
 pick up the bra in which is the car more weight 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.340
 It's beautiful in the game. 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.750
 - I consider this as a estrÃ©ie by 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.639
 part of the producers because of the 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.129
 location 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.229
 They stuck a car at last. 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.150
 alderney island that left on this 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.800
 zinho location here just pick up 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.749
 drive down the dirt road until you reach the 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.740
 arrive in kind of mansion in front of the 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:49.840
 mansion 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.930
 will have a garage that the garage of 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.419
 mansion but behind this threaded garage 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.659
 in the middle of the bush will have the sultan thing 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.669
 pretty long base steal it's good 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.499
 likely to be dirty poorly maintained 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.900
 just take the workshop and pack it 

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:08.169
 paint it and this will save the 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.180
 Most beautiful car game over face up 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.310
 what the hell in my opinion pirate 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:19.449
 engine noise along with the noise of the 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:21.580
 Turkish guy who was arrested and came for today 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.889
 it's only if everything indicates leaving more things 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.330
 to show the future video I can 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:27.490
 comment below keep an eye on the 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.379
 upcoming channel videos maybe the dark 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.569
 souls maybe the gameplay of the walking 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:34.270
 dead to be brave further to the 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.009
 My analysis of the game, do not forget 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.620
 to give a tune to my fan page on 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.750
 facebook created yesterday 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.099

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.439
