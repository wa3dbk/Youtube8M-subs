this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.500> the<00:00:02.040> Petit<00:00:02.370> Verdot<00:00:02.580> that<00:00:03.030> our<00:00:03.210> crews

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
this is the Petit Verdot that our crews

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.930 
this is the Petit Verdot that our crews
were<00:00:03.689> harvesting<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.620> morning<00:00:05.220> at<00:00:05.370> starting

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
were harvesting this morning at starting

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.680 
were harvesting this morning at starting
at<00:00:06.060> 3<00:00:06.299> o'clock<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:07.730> it's<00:00:08.730> here<00:00:09.000> waiting<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.570> be

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
at 3 o'clock and it's here waiting to be

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.570 
at 3 o'clock and it's here waiting to be
processed<00:00:10.410> along<00:00:10.740> with<00:00:10.980> everything<00:00:11.250> out<00:00:11.550> that

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
processed along with everything out that

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.220 
processed along with everything out that
you<00:00:11.849> can<00:00:11.969> see<00:00:12.090> from<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.420> pallets<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.019> fruit

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
you can see from the pallets of fruit

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.530 
you can see from the pallets of fruit
they<00:00:13.380> still<00:00:13.620> have<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.009> go<00:00:14.190> through<00:00:14.540> they're

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
they still have to go through they're

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.660 
they still have to go through they're
going<00:00:15.809> through<00:00:15.960> all<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.230> cabernet<00:00:16.710> first<00:00:17.369> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
going through all the cabernet first and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.189 
going through all the cabernet first and
they'll<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.869> Petit<00:00:19.410> Verdot<00:00:19.619> next<00:00:20.369> so

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
they'll get to the Petit Verdot next so

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.570 
they'll get to the Petit Verdot next so
at<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.470> point<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.949> know<00:00:23.039> they're<00:00:23.220> trying<00:00:23.430> to

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
at this point you know they're trying to

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.880 
at this point you know they're trying to
be<00:00:24.570> efficient<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.199> not<00:00:25.320> switch<00:00:25.619> back<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
be efficient and not switch back and

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.460 
be efficient and not switch back and
forth<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.460> 4<00:00:27.000> varieties<00:00:27.630> which<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> matter

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
forth for 4 varieties which is a matter

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.339 
forth for 4 varieties which is a matter
of<00:00:28.590> process<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.820> through<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.510> getting

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
of process and going through and getting

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.260 
of process and going through and getting
the<00:00:31.529> fruit<00:00:31.769> onto<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> conveyor<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.880> get<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the fruit onto the conveyor to get the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.360 
the fruit onto the conveyor to get the
initial<00:00:33.480> leaves<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.410> stuff<00:00:34.620> out<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
initial leaves and stuff out of the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.299 
initial leaves and stuff out of the
boxes<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:37.380> sending<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> up<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
boxes and then sending it up the

boxes and then sending it up the
conveyor<00:00:38.640> into<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> Basilan<00:00:39.809> which<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.200> be

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
conveyor into the Basilan which would be

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.479 
conveyor into the Basilan which would be
the<00:00:40.770> distance<00:00:42.140> Amer<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.350> goes<00:00:43.500> back<00:00:43.739> down<00:00:44.010> onto

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the distance Amer it goes back down onto

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.790 
the distance Amer it goes back down onto
the<00:00:44.670> optics<00:00:45.270> order<00:00:45.750> where<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> optic<00:00:46.469> sorter

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
the day's process they can take those

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.590 
the day's process they can take those
bins<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.400> rerun<00:01:52.880> them<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.240> change<00:01:53.480> the

bins and rerun them and change the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.990 
bins and rerun them and change the
program<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.020> little<00:01:54.230> bit<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.590> extract<00:01:55.100> maybe<00:01:55.880> a

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
program a little bit to extract maybe a

program a little bit to extract maybe a
little<00:01:56.240> bit<00:01:56.390> more<00:01:56.600> grapes<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.980> grape<00:01:58.190> juice

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
little bit more grapes and grape juice

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.370 
little bit more grapes and grape juice
because<00:01:58.850> perhaps<00:01:59.090> optic<00:01:59.600> sorter<00:01:59.960> is<00:01:59.990> not
