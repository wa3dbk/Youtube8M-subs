00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:02.580
 to 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.580
 to me 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.530
 bell ringer 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.279
 there are many adversities that can affect plants 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.199
 it is important to know how to recognize them to apply more effective remedies 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.550
 for example, you should not confuse aphid lice with similar cochineals 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.320
 to small cerusico badges 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.940
 arranged on leaves and branches 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.240
 they must be fought with an anticocciniglia removing the gpu wherever possible with a 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.720
 paper tissue soaked in alcohol 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.700
 snails and tireless snails devouring foliage are also common 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.330
 to block it, spread the appropriate granules on the ground and in the pots 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.900
 antilumaca 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.690
 or arrange the effective and close to the plants of the crazy ones with beer 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.690
 natural system to eliminate the problem 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.710
 when the leaves send, however, it is often not a disease 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.780
 think of iron deficiency in the soil 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.140
 the frequent problem on hydrangeas is fought by administering specific ones 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.619
 Iron-based preparations completely the names for the soil health of the 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.880
 useful animals and insects 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.070
 against the steps of very common on many types of ornamental plants and from vegetable garden si 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.869
 can experience the effectiveness of an algae-based pesticide or 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.250
 the preparation is very simple choose a beautiful headboard better if 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.350
 itself 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.810
 clean it to extract the spirits eliminating the skin that surrounds them 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.680
 remove the segments from each other and place them in a container in which 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.820
 pouring boiling water 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.920
 rugby cover with a lid with kitchen aluminum and let it sit 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.500
 at least 24 hours 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 now you filter the preparation 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.249
 transfer it to a vaporizer and spray the areas where you notice the 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:19.009
 parasites that are immediately blocked by the slow, straight action of the year 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:23.849
 the operation will have to be repeated after a week until the insects do not 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.529
 they disappeared completely 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.529
 other plants can be useful to combat pests 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.249
 the very fragrant leaves of the example mint serve me for the preparation 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:38.249
 of an effective macerate in removing the ants 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:44.929
 while the fragrant chinotto if you went near cabbage and cauliflower and 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:49.649
 help to limit the spread of the larvae of cabolaia kebouquet rellano le 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:51.089
 leaves 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:55.529
 moreover it is very important not to remove useful insects like the 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:03:00.679
 nice red ladybug shield with black dots is the worst enemy of the 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:04.019
 Alpine and therefore the gardener's best friend
