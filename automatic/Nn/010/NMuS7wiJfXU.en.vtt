a bang area well today I'm going to show

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.910 
a bang area well today I'm going to show
you<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.180> proper<00:00:18.690> method<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.199> which<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.680> choose

you the proper method in which to choose

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.240 
you the proper method in which to choose
a<00:00:19.949> bang<00:00:20.359> when<00:00:21.359> talking<00:00:21.600> about<00:00:21.810> bangs<00:00:22.320> bangs

a bang when talking about bangs bangs

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.240 
a bang when talking about bangs bangs
are<00:00:23.490> either<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.630> create<00:00:24.810> symmetry<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:25.949> there's

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
are either to create symmetry if there's

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.640 
are either to create symmetry if there's
an<00:00:26.369> along<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.910> elongated<00:00:27.689> facial<00:00:28.230> structure

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
an along it elongated facial structure

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.060 
an along it elongated facial structure
or<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.810> simply<00:00:31.140> create<00:00:31.289> an<00:00:31.590> accent

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
or it's to just simply create an accent

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.220 
or it's to just simply create an accent
so<00:00:32.309> today<00:00:32.940> I'm<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.270> show<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:34.170> to

choose the proper Bank section here we

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.310 
choose the proper Bank section here we
go<00:00:37.290> follow<00:00:37.860> along<00:00:38.570> when<00:00:39.570> choosing<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.110> bang

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
go follow along when choosing a bang

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.530 
go follow along when choosing a bang
section<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.550> how<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.030> done

section this is how it's done
number<00:00:43.110> one<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.770> have<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.129> realize<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
number one we have to realize that the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.660 
number one we have to realize that the
head<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.570> flat<00:00:45.989> nobody<00:00:46.770> has<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> block<00:00:47.370> head

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
head is not flat nobody has a block head

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.670 
head is not flat nobody has a block head
if<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.270> were<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> put<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> comb<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.260> top<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
if you were to put a comb on top of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
if you were to put a comb on top of
someone's<00:00:50.039> head<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.180> quite<00:00:51.449> simply

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
someone's head you can see quite simply

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.400 
someone's head you can see quite simply
but<00:00:52.680> right<00:00:52.949> about<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.870> pivot<00:00:55.379> point

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
but right about here is a pivot point

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010 
but right about here is a pivot point
that's<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> area<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.629> skull

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that's the area in which the skull

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.369 
that's the area in which the skull
begins<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.739> travel<00:00:59.190> forward<00:00:59.510> that's<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.960> far

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
begins to travel forward that's as far

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
begins to travel forward that's as far
back<00:01:01.649> as<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.859> want<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.640> never<00:01:03.000> want<00:01:03.329> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
back as you want to go you never want to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.890 
back as you want to go you never want to
exceed<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.019> point<00:01:04.580> similarly<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.600> skull

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
exceed that point similarly on the skull

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.649 
exceed that point similarly on the skull
because<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.650> rounded<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.330> pivot

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
because it's rounded there are pivot

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.020 
because it's rounded there are pivot
points<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.500> pivot<00:01:11.189> points<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.880> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
points here and pivot points here so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.820 
points here and pivot points here so
when<00:01:12.659> parting<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> hair<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.409> don't<00:01:13.590> want<00:01:13.740> to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.340 
force the parts we simply want to allow
them<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.340> avail<00:01:17.640> themselves<00:01:17.930> let's<00:01:18.930> try<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:21.350> so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
them to avail themselves let's try it so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.870 
them to avail themselves let's try it so
now<00:01:22.500> notice<00:01:22.740> carefully<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.549> not<00:01:23.729> going

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to separate allow it to avail itself you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050 
to separate allow it to avail itself you
can<00:01:49.530> almost<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.100> little<00:01:50.490> widow's<00:01:50.759> peak

and<00:02:10.979> what<00:02:11.160> you'll<00:02:11.340> notice<00:02:11.370> right<00:02:12.030> away<00:02:12.090> is

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
and what you'll notice right away is

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.910 
and what you'll notice right away is
that<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.400> parts<00:02:14.819> although<00:02:15.660> not<00:02:16.080> quite<00:02:16.319> but

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
that the parts although not quite but

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.000 
that the parts although not quite but
almost<00:02:17.190> perfectly<00:02:18.150> intersect<00:02:18.900> into<00:02:19.440> that

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
almost perfectly intersect into that

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.420 
almost perfectly intersect into that
famous<00:02:20.540> triangular<00:02:21.540> shape<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.830> idea<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.400> that

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
famous triangular shape the idea is that

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.900 
famous triangular shape the idea is that
no<00:02:23.849> one<00:02:24.090> skull<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.720> evenly<00:02:25.470> shaped<00:02:25.830> no<00:02:26.430> one<00:02:26.670> has

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
no one skull is evenly shaped no one has

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.479 
no one skull is evenly shaped no one has
perfect<00:02:27.720> symmetry<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:28.650> what<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.250> found

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
perfect symmetry but what we have found

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.880 
perfect symmetry but what we have found
here<00:02:29.880> are<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.450> pivot<00:02:30.780> points<00:02:31.200> where<00:02:31.680> she

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
here are the pivot points where she

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.070 
here are the pivot points where she

pivots this way pivots that way and

of the shape of the skull now we can

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.960 
of the shape of the skull now we can

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
like a second grader it doesn't really

proper form now today we're going to

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.930 
proper form now today we're going to
choose<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.660> bang<00:03:06.959> that's<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.410> slightly<00:03:07.940> right

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
choose a bang that's just slightly right

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.180 
choose a bang that's just slightly right
about<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.359> eyebrow<00:03:09.750> length<00:03:10.109> something<00:03:10.829> soft

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
about the eyebrow length something soft

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:56.369 
about the eyebrow length something soft
but<00:03:11.760> just<00:03:12.329> generally<00:03:13.290> because<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.680> my<00:03:13.829> choice

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.470 

and<00:03:57.379> there<00:03:58.099> you<00:03:58.250> have<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.519> a<00:03:58.790> simple<00:03:59.060> bang

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
and there you have it a simple bang

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.809 
and there you have it a simple bang
remember<00:04:00.260> yours<00:04:00.769> can<00:04:00.980> be<00:04:01.099> different<00:04:01.579> whether

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
remember yours can be different whether

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.420 
remember yours can be different whether
you<00:04:01.939> want<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.209> wear<00:04:02.329> it<00:04:02.419> longer<00:04:02.720> shorter<00:04:03.439> draw

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
you want to wear it longer shorter draw

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.009 
you want to wear it longer shorter draw
