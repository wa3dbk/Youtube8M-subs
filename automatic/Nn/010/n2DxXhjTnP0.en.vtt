another important thing to note with

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.220 
another important thing to note with
these<00:00:59.129> programs<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> that<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.300> sound<00:01:00.600> process

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
these programs is that the sound process

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.340 
these programs is that the sound process
is<00:01:01.440> preset<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> not<00:01:02.550> adjustable<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:04.170> what

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
is preset and not adjustable so what

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.230 
is preset and not adjustable so what
this<00:01:04.530> means<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> left<00:01:05.430> hand<00:01:05.700> buttons<00:01:06.030> use

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
this means is the left hand buttons use
