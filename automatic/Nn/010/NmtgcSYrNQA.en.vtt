I'm here with Jochen Hamlin who will be
climbing<00:00:35.040> with<00:00:35.280> me<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.640> next<00:00:35.969> section

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
climbing with me in this next section

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.100 
climbing with me in this next section
I'm<00:00:36.690> actually<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:38.059> use<00:00:39.059> sort<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:39.989> an

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
I'm actually going to use sort of an

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.279 
I'm actually going to use sort of an
old-fashioned<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:41.010> basic<00:00:42.079> harness<00:00:43.079> just

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
old-fashioned very basic harness just

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.840 
old-fashioned very basic harness just
wrap<00:00:43.770> around<00:00:44.129> my<00:00:44.280> waist<00:00:46.520> this<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.610> called<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
wrap around my waist this is called a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.930 
wrap around my waist this is called a
carabiner<00:00:48.300> here<00:00:50.690> leg<00:00:51.690> loops<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.640> I'm

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
carabiner here leg loops so that if I'm

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.840 
carabiner here leg loops so that if I'm
suspended<00:00:54.660> from<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.440> rope<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.040> crevasse<00:00:56.280> or

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
suspended from the rope in a crevasse or

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.180 
suspended from the rope in a crevasse or
hanging<00:00:57.720> a<00:00:57.810> bit<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.200> Valais<00:00:58.440> or<00:00:58.710> falling

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
hanging a bit on the Valais or falling

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.720 
hanging a bit on the Valais or falling
then<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> weight<00:01:00.030> will<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.730> legs

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
then the weight will go on to the legs

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.109 
then the weight will go on to the legs
instead<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.360> from<00:01:03.540> my<00:01:03.690> waist<00:01:03.870> climbing<00:01:04.589> rope

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
instead of from my waist climbing rope

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.959 
instead of from my waist climbing rope
which<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.149> actually<00:01:07.159> dynamic<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.549> important

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
which is actually dynamic it's important

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.300 
which is actually dynamic it's important
these<00:01:09.329> ropes<00:01:09.600> stretch<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.469> put<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.009> lot<00:01:11.189> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
these ropes stretch if you put a lot of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.880 
these ropes stretch if you put a lot of
weight<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:11.969> them<00:01:12.329> different<00:01:13.229> nuts<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.799> are

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
weight on them different nuts that are

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.499 
weight on them different nuts that are
used<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.219> tying<00:01:14.399> in<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> standard<00:01:15.329> these

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
used for tying in but the standard these

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.649 
used for tying in but the standard these
days<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.189> called<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> figure<00:01:17.490> eight<00:01:17.790> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
days is called the figure eight you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.499 
days is called the figure eight you
first<00:01:18.899> make<00:01:19.200> figure<00:01:20.009> eight<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.399> that<00:01:20.700> then

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
first make figure eight like that then

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.429 
first make figure eight like that then
you<00:01:21.600> pass<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.020> through<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:23.149> harness<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:27.439> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
you pass it through your harness and you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.029 
you pass it through your harness and you
follow<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.810> rope<00:01:30.810> around<00:01:31.020> like<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.679> and<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
follow the rope around like this and it

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.379 
follow the rope around like this and it
becomes<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:33.079> figure<00:01:34.079> eight<00:01:34.229> knot<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.069> a

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:38.389 

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:42.590 

helmet<00:01:39.859> protects<00:01:40.859> you<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.249> two<00:01:41.700> ways<00:01:41.939> three

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
helmet protects you in two ways three

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.080 
helmet protects you in two ways three
ways<00:01:42.749> actually<00:01:43.289> one<00:01:43.889> is<00:01:44.069> against<00:01:44.399> rocks<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
ways actually one is against rocks that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.719 
ways actually one is against rocks that
would<00:01:45.299> fall<00:01:45.569> from<00:01:45.810> above<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:47.459> don't<00:01:47.609> want

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
would fall from above and you don't want

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.849 
would fall from above and you don't want
them<00:01:47.849> to<00:01:47.969> hit<00:01:48.090> your<00:01:48.270> head<00:01:48.569> so<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.139> bounce<00:01:49.560> off

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
them to hit your head so they bounce off

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.679 
them to hit your head so they bounce off
the<00:01:50.039> helmet<00:01:50.189> hopefully<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.770> another<00:01:52.770> way<00:01:52.979> is

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
the helmet hopefully and another way is

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.669 
the helmet hopefully and another way is
if<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.810> fall<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.499> then<00:01:56.279> hit<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> side<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
if you fall and then hit the side of the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.609 
if you fall and then hit the side of the
rock<00:01:58.679> you're<00:01:59.399> bowing<00:01:59.609> into<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.409> like<00:02:01.409> that

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
rock you're bowing into it like that

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.249 
rock you're bowing into it like that
it's<00:02:01.799> much<00:02:01.950> better<00:02:02.099> than<00:02:02.310> hitting<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.669> skull

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
it's much better than hitting your skull

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.300 
it's much better than hitting your skull
and<00:02:04.259> what<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:04.499> the<00:02:04.619> third<00:02:04.770> one<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.009> thought<00:02:05.249> I

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and what was the third one I thought I

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.180 
and what was the third one I thought I
was<00:02:05.759> sudden<00:02:06.090> rocks<00:02:06.869> hitting<00:02:07.139> your<00:02:08.009> head

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
was sudden rocks hitting your head

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.460 
was sudden rocks hitting your head
bouncing<00:02:08.970> during<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.330> fall<00:02:10.160> he<00:02:11.160> was<00:02:11.250> just<00:02:11.489> -

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
bouncing during a fall he was just -

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.850 
bouncing during a fall he was just -
okay<00:02:13.470> then<00:02:13.830> Yocum<00:02:14.160> will<00:02:14.340> put<00:02:14.880> me<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.150> belay<00:02:15.860> so

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
okay then Yocum will put me on belay so

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.400 
okay then Yocum will put me on belay so
that<00:02:16.980> he'll<00:02:17.190> feed<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.330> Rope<00:02:18.540> out<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:19.080> me<00:02:19.260> as

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
that he'll feed the Rope out to me as

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.650 
that he'll feed the Rope out to me as
I'm<00:02:19.590> climbing<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.250> then<00:02:20.910> if<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.150> were<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.420> fall

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
I'm climbing and then if I were to fall

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.610 
I'm climbing and then if I were to fall
then<00:02:22.020> he<00:02:22.319> would<00:02:23.180> hold<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.720> catch<00:02:25.410> it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
then he would hold on and catch it

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.190 
then he would hold on and catch it
there's<00:02:26.799> various<00:02:27.069> ways<00:02:27.659> of<00:02:28.659> doing<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:29.019> he's

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
there's various ways of doing it he's

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.479 
there's various ways of doing it he's
doing<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.500> was<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> knot<00:02:29.890> called<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.220> Munter

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
doing it was a knot called the Munter

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.699 
doing it was a knot called the Munter
hitch<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:31.690> Europe<00:02:32.019> you'll<00:02:32.170> find<00:02:32.379> lots<00:02:32.530> of

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
hitch in Europe you'll find lots of

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.759 
hitch in Europe you'll find lots of
bolts<00:02:33.390> which<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.540> won't<00:02:34.720> be<00:02:34.900> finding<00:02:35.110> much<00:02:35.620> in

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
bolts which I won't be finding much in

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.020 
bolts which I won't be finding much in
the<00:02:35.860> mountains<00:02:36.250> because<00:02:36.489> these<00:02:36.610> are<00:02:36.760> more<00:02:36.909> in

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the mountains because these are more in

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.630 
the mountains because these are more in
the<00:02:37.180> rock<00:02:37.540> climbing<00:02:37.810> areas<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.280> that's<00:02:39.459> a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
the rock climbing areas and so that's a

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.210 
the rock climbing areas and so that's a
very<00:02:39.819> secure<00:02:40.150> anchor<00:02:40.569> that<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:41.080> could<00:02:41.260> clip

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
very secure anchor that you could clip

Rope slides up with me and if I were to
fall<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.120> goes<00:03:01.660> down<00:03:01.870> like<00:03:02.049> that<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:02.590> most

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
fall and it goes down like that but most

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.400 
fall and it goes down like that but most

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
places where I go there won't be bolt

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.770 
places where I go there won't be bolt
like<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.549> I'll<00:03:07.450> show<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.690> with<00:03:08.049> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
other type of gear here with the camming

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.099 
other type of gear here with the camming
nut<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:17.109> an<00:03:17.879> active<00:03:18.879> not<00:03:19.450> here<00:03:19.780> because

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
nut that is an active not here because

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.440 
nut that is an active not here because
it<00:03:20.230> expands<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:21.099> this<00:03:21.340> passive<00:03:22.120> piece<00:03:22.269> of

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
it expands and this passive piece of

it expands and this passive piece of
protection<00:03:22.799> eccentric<00:03:23.799> knot<00:03:24.150> here<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.480> you

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
protection eccentric knot here that you

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.140 
protection eccentric knot here that you
can<00:03:25.840> put<00:03:26.109> into<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.470> crack<00:03:26.829> there<00:03:27.370> very<00:03:27.579> easy<00:03:27.849> if

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
can put into a crack there very easy if

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.699 
can put into a crack there very easy if
the<00:03:28.299> crack<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.750> just<00:03:28.989> right<00:03:29.170> for<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.530> if<00:03:29.620> it

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
the crack is just right for it if it

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.009 
the crack is just right for it if it
pinches<00:03:29.920> or<00:03:30.579> if<00:03:30.819> it's<00:03:31.000> fit<00:03:31.269> just<00:03:31.450> right<00:03:31.630> but

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
pinches or if it's fit just right but

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.020 
pinches or if it's fit just right but
otherwise<00:03:32.260> like<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.609> can<00:03:33.730> see<00:03:33.910> it's

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
otherwise like that you can see it's

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.580 
otherwise like that you can see it's
there<00:03:34.239> but<00:03:34.450> it's<00:03:34.599> not<00:03:34.720> going<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.959> hold<00:03:35.079> very

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
there but it's not going to hold very

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.849 
there but it's not going to hold very
well<00:03:35.799> so<00:03:36.760> now<00:03:37.419> before<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.079> start<00:03:38.349> climbing<00:03:38.560> I'd

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
well so now before I start climbing I'd

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.800 
well so now before I start climbing I'd
confirm<00:03:39.430> with<00:03:39.880> yoga<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.209> on<00:03:40.359> belay

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
confirm with yoga and on belay

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.099 
confirm with yoga and on belay
lay<00:03:41.470> on<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.919> now<00:03:42.040> I'd<00:03:42.190> say<00:03:42.419> climbing<00:03:43.419> so<00:03:43.870> he

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
lay on and now I'd say climbing so he

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:55.580 
lay on and now I'd say climbing so he
knows<00:03:44.639> and<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:49.060> looking<00:03:49.599> for<00:03:49.780> little<00:03:50.790> edges

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.979 

when<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.620> get<00:03:56.889> up<00:03:57.209> high<00:03:58.209> enough<00:03:58.239> that<00:03:58.750> I'd<00:03:58.870> be

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
when I get up high enough that I'd be

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.439 
when I get up high enough that I'd be
worried<00:03:59.290> about<00:03:59.530> another<00:04:00.069> fall<00:04:00.430> then<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:01.299> would

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
worried about another fall then I would

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.289 
worried about another fall then I would
put<00:04:01.599> in<00:04:01.750> another<00:04:02.519> piece<00:04:03.519> of<00:04:03.549> gear<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.269> make

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
put in another piece of gear to make

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.180 
put in another piece of gear to make
sure<00:04:04.599> that<00:04:04.870> that<00:04:05.680> would<00:04:05.829> keep<00:04:06.010> me<00:04:06.160> from

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
sure that that would keep me from

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.300 
sure that that would keep me from
hitting<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.180> ground<00:04:07.299> if<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.870> were<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.139> fall<00:04:08.319> and

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
hitting the ground if I were to fall and

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.009 
hitting the ground if I were to fall and
when<00:04:09.430> Jochen<00:04:09.790> comes<00:04:10.000> up<00:04:10.180> he'll<00:04:10.419> take<00:04:10.629> out<00:04:10.840> the

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
when Jochen comes up he'll take out the

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.839 
when Jochen comes up he'll take out the
equipment

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.129
