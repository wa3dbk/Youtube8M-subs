this<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.860> another<00:00:02.280> test<00:00:02.399> of<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.270> premier<00:00:03.810> g35

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
this is another test of the premier g35

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.280 
this is another test of the premier g35
air<00:00:05.100> dual<00:00:05.490> action<00:00:05.670> airbrush<00:00:06.029> this<00:00:06.960> time<00:00:07.140> I'm

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
air dual action airbrush this time I'm

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.730 
air dual action airbrush this time I'm
going<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.649> see<00:00:07.919> how<00:00:08.130> well<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.370> can<00:00:09.230> apply<00:00:10.230> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
going to see how well I can apply the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.220 
going to see how well I can apply the
paint<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.099> small<00:00:11.610> areas<00:00:11.969> try<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.809> focus<00:00:12.990> on

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
paint to small areas try to focus on

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.870 
paint to small areas try to focus on
these<00:00:13.320> small<00:00:13.769> lines<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.700> brick<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.299> then<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
these small lines of brick and then the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.349 
these small lines of brick and then the
crease<00:00:17.880> lines<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.840> show<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.359> fine

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
crease lines to show just the fine

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.900 
crease lines to show just the fine
detail<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.289> brush<00:00:22.500> can<00:00:22.650> achieve<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
detail that this brush can achieve so a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.460 
detail that this brush can achieve so a
couple<00:00:24.769> tests<00:00:25.769> I'm<00:00:26.189> using<00:00:26.510> acrylic<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:28.320> me<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
couple tests I'm using acrylic to me a

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.749 
couple tests I'm using acrylic to me a
paint<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.660> thin<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.689> some<00:00:31.460> detergent<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
paint and thin with some detergent and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.459 
paint and thin with some detergent and
water<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> break<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:33.989> surface<00:00:34.320> tension

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
water just to break the surface tension

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.540 
water just to break the surface tension
and<00:00:34.980> provided<00:00:35.430> thinness<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:38.989> one<00:00:39.989> pass<00:00:40.550> too

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and provided thinness to it one pass too

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.770 
and provided thinness to it one pass too
puffy<00:00:44.329> three<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.850> three<00:00:47.850> passes<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.690> I'm

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
puffy three and three passes and I'm

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.350 
puffy three and three passes and I'm
pretty<00:00:49.230> well<00:00:49.530> filled<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.940> row<00:00:51.149> of

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
pretty well filled that in that row of

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.920 
pretty well filled that in that row of
stone<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:53.430> no<00:00:53.460> overspray<00:00:54.270> which<00:00:54.719> is

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
stone and I see no overspray which is

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.740 
stone and I see no overspray which is
really<00:00:55.530> good<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.670> was<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.030> good<00:00:57.480> distance

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
really good and I was a good distance

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.290 
really good and I was a good distance
from<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.129> model<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.079> not<00:01:01.079> too<00:01:01.260> bad<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.300> one

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
from the model so not too bad I one

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.729 
from the model so not too bad I one
thing<00:01:03.449> about<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> model<00:01:04.080> too<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
thing about the model too is it's a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.080 
thing about the model too is it's a
172nd<00:01:05.700> scale<00:01:06.030> custom<00:01:06.780> dynamics<00:01:07.520> resin<00:01:08.520> bridge

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
172nd scale custom dynamics resin bridge

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.710 
172nd scale custom dynamics resin bridge
so<00:01:10.070> right<00:01:11.070> away<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.640> small<00:01:11.970> scale<00:01:12.299> so

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
so right away it's a small scale so

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.990 
so right away it's a small scale so
things<00:01:12.960> are<00:01:13.110> tight<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:14.280> need<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.700> look<00:01:14.880> at

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
things are tight and to need to look at

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.249 
things are tight and to need to look at
good<00:01:15.299> control<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.780> girl<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.110> other

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
good control and the girl on the other

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.469 
good control and the girl on the other
side<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:22.520> how<00:01:23.520> well<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:24.000> get<00:01:24.330> this

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
side and see how well I can get this

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.219 
side and see how well I can get this
side

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.889 

nicely<00:01:31.229> done<00:01:31.640> very<00:01:32.640> nice<00:01:32.909> little<00:01:33.540> overspray

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
nicely done very nice little overspray

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.719 
nicely done very nice little overspray
but<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.560> me<00:01:34.770> than<00:01:34.979> anything<00:01:35.460> else

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
but that was more me than anything else

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.270 
but that was more me than anything else
and<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:37.080> am<00:01:37.200> purposefully<00:01:37.830> leaving<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
and I am purposefully leaving it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.240 
and I am purposefully leaving it
unmasked<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.360> show<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.740> isn't<00:01:41.039> a<00:01:41.100> lot

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
unmasked to show that there isn't a lot

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.450 
unmasked to show that there isn't a lot
of<00:01:41.399> overspray<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.259> nice<00:01:43.500> control<00:01:44.039> so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
of overspray and you get nice control so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.520 
of overspray and you get nice control so
normally<00:01:44.970> I'm<00:01:45.090> mask<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.840> off<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.320> paint

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
normally I'm mask that off and paint

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.830 
normally I'm mask that off and paint
inside<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.610> done<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.270> since

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
inside and be done with it but since

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.090 
inside and be done with it but since
we're<00:01:48.990> trying<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:49.409> push<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.649> airbrush

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
we're trying to really push the airbrush

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.969 
we're trying to really push the airbrush
and<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:51.149> how<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.539> do<00:01:51.780> I'm<00:01:51.990> purposely

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and see how well it can do I'm purposely

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:04.010 
and see how well it can do I'm purposely
not<00:01:53.369> masking<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.869> will<00:01:55.289> contest<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:55.979> guys

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:21.000 

you

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.940 

so<00:02:22.010> this<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.280> actually<00:02:22.790> quite<00:02:23.120> nice<00:02:23.770> not<00:02:24.770> sure

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
so this is actually quite nice not sure

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.850 
so this is actually quite nice not sure
if<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.100> can<00:02:25.250> see<00:02:25.360> really<00:02:26.360> well<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.470> let's<00:02:27.650> run

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
if you can see really well so let's run

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
if you can see really well so let's run
brings<00:02:28.100> up<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.390> shadowing<00:02:30.340> it's<00:02:31.340> pretty

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
brings up but the shadowing it's pretty

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.010 
brings up but the shadowing it's pretty
easy<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.270> do<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.750> pretty<00:02:33.320> tight<00:02:33.590> for<00:02:34.120> just<00:02:35.120> a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
easy to do and pretty tight for just a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.010 
easy to do and pretty tight for just a
general<00:02:36.560> airbrush<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.520> is<00:02:38.300> built<00:02:38.600> for<00:02:38.750> small

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
general airbrush that is built for small

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.970 
general airbrush that is built for small
tight<00:02:39.320> spaces<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:40.540> it's<00:02:41.540> very<00:02:41.660> good<00:02:41.980> do

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
tight spaces so it's very good do

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:51.500 
tight spaces so it's very good do
another<00:02:43.190> couple<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.180> get<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.690> hang<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.140> it

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:12.010 

that's<00:02:52.510> nice<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:55.090> get<00:02:55.240> right<00:02:55.450> up<00:02:55.600> tight

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.270 

so<00:03:13.020> that's<00:03:13.320> some<00:03:13.530> pretty<00:03:14.210> small<00:03:15.890> tight<00:03:16.890> work

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
so that's some pretty small tight work

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.790 
so that's some pretty small tight work
in<00:03:17.580> there<00:03:17.820> with<00:03:18.690> really<00:03:19.560> no<00:03:21.680> masking<00:03:22.680> or

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
in there with really no masking or

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.200 
in there with really no masking or
anything<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.220> nature<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.730> keep<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.060> that

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
anything of that nature to keep it that

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.830 
anything of that nature to keep it that
tight<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.110> pretty<00:03:25.560> nice
