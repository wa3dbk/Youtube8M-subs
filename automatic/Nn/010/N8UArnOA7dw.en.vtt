00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.530
 I'm very proud of you for going to 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.389
 this trip are going to have a lot of fun and 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.389
 remember if something is after them 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.720
 we have learned more in the last decade 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.600
 of genetics that in a century of 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.180
 digging bones a whole new frontier 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.370
 it has been opened to us we have our 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.370
 first genetically modified hybrid 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.930
 they came up with a new dinosaur 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.930
 it seems like a silly idea 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.710
 the wall measures 12 meters you think the 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:45.869
 climbing depends on what 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.260
 what kind of dinosaur did they invent in 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.260
 The laboratory 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.530
 the bass on the island 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.680
 It is a very intelligent animal 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.910
 will kill 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.910
 to everything that moves
