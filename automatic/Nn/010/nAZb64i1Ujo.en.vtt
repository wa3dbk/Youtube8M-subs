good day i'll see it was pretty bad but

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.749 
good day i'll see it was pretty bad but
because<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.409> them<00:01:43.740> Call<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.189> Duty's<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.729> a

because of them Call of Duty's like a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.940 
because of them Call of Duty's like a
nostalgic<00:01:45.329> glory<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.899> always<00:01:46.530> loved<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.829> play

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
nostalgic glory I always loved to play

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
nostalgic glory I always loved to play
on<00:01:47.100> those<00:01:47.220> maps<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.149> call<00:01:48.360> of

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
on those maps just because it's call of

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.050 
on those maps just because it's call of
duty<00:01:48.720> 4<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.740> my<00:01:49.860> opinion<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.399> may<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
duty 4 so in my opinion this may be the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.480 
duty 4 so in my opinion this may be the
best<00:01:51.210> dlc<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.810> any<00:01:51.960> call<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.320> duty<00:01:52.619> yet<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.430> I
