00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.080
 used for our purposes 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.600
 enterprises that is 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.050

 Firsova, she would know how, after almost 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.619
 that a half century in Gelendzhik will 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.130
 keep carefully the tradition of production and 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.590
 even as local wines have been appreciated for more than a century 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.990

 Gelendzhik natural wine production 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.539
 question fundamentally despite the fact that 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.580
 the process is very laborious about this 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.060
 technologies do not refuse in spite 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.849

 have you heard a powder dye about 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.220
 aromas 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.510
 none of this applies and i think then 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.760
 what we prepare ourselves 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.619

 really natural products and 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.920
 qualitative but again evaluate by 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.070
 when dry law was in territory 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.680

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.840

 as experts say wine breathes 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.740
