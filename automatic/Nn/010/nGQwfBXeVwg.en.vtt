so<00:00:11.969> if<00:00:12.089> we<00:00:12.209> can<00:00:12.360> learn<00:00:12.539> how<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.719> build<00:00:12.959> better

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:13.199 
so if we can learn how to build better

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.460 
so if we can learn how to build better
and<00:00:14.030> locate<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.179> places<00:00:15.690> where<00:00:16.170> we're<00:00:16.320> less

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
and locate in places where we're less

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.560 
and locate in places where we're less
dependent<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:16.949> automobiles<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:18.240> have<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.420> good

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
dependent on automobiles we have a good

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.570 
dependent on automobiles we have a good
shot<00:00:18.779> at<00:00:18.900> addressing<00:00:19.019> two-thirds<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.339> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
shot at addressing two-thirds of the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.060 
shot at addressing two-thirds of the
carbon<00:00:20.910> equation<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.439> house<00:00:22.679> is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
carbon equation so this house is

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
carbon equation so this house is
supposed<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.550> be<00:00:23.759> the<00:00:23.910> beginning<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.419> what<00:00:24.570> we

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
supposed to be the beginning of what we

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.230 
supposed to be the beginning of what we
hope<00:00:24.810> will<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.339> replicated<00:00:26.339> over<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.910> over

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
hope will be replicated over and over

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.700 
hope will be replicated over and over
and<00:00:27.480> over<00:00:27.570> again<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.529> Fairfax

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
and over again not just here in Fairfax

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.479 
and over again not just here in Fairfax
County<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.279> across<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.699> country

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.880 

we<00:00:34.489> were<00:00:34.609> able<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:34.910> recycle<00:00:35.359> close<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:35.960> 98%<00:00:36.350> of

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
we were able to recycle close to 98% of

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.979 
we were able to recycle close to 98% of
the<00:00:36.980> materials<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:37.699> then<00:00:38.449> we<00:00:38.629> were<00:00:38.719> able<00:00:38.839> to

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
the materials and then we were able to

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.259 
the materials and then we were able to
site<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.530> house<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.309> that<00:00:40.460> it<00:00:40.579> really<00:00:40.789> kind<00:00:41.149> of

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
site the house so that it really kind of

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:42.459 
site the house so that it really kind of
could<00:00:41.449> take<00:00:41.600> advantage<00:00:41.719> of<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:42.199> great

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
could take advantage of the great

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.290 
could take advantage of the great
southern<00:00:42.920> exposure<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:43.850> then<00:00:43.969> it<00:00:44.120> also

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
southern exposure and then it also

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.170 
southern exposure and then it also
created<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:45.050> narrow<00:00:45.409> kind<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:45.949> massing<00:00:46.909> in<00:00:47.089> the

created a narrow kind of massing in the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.029 
created a narrow kind of massing in the
plan<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:47.809> we<00:00:47.960> can<00:00:48.170> get<00:00:48.289> a<00:00:48.320> lot<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.559> great

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.069 

our<00:01:06.729> challenge<00:01:07.210> was<00:01:07.329> to<00:01:07.600> bring<00:01:07.719> in<00:01:07.869> a<00:01:07.930> lot<00:01:08.049> of

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
our challenge was to bring in a lot of

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:09.870 
our challenge was to bring in a lot of
new<00:01:08.289> systems<00:01:08.530> but<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.009> get<00:01:09.100> them<00:01:09.219> all<00:01:09.369> lined<00:01:09.670> up

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
new systems but to get them all lined up

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.230 
new systems but to get them all lined up
in<00:01:10.060> one<00:01:10.659> common<00:01:11.500> goal<00:01:11.740> we<00:01:12.520> take<00:01:12.700> it<00:01:12.820> from<00:01:13.030> a

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
in one common goal we take it from a

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.270 
in one common goal we take it from a
very<00:01:13.570> scientific<00:01:14.049> kind<00:01:14.619> of<00:01:14.770> model<00:01:15.159> on<00:01:15.220> a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
very scientific kind of model on a

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.010 
very scientific kind of model on a
computer<00:01:15.759> and<00:01:16.360> then<00:01:16.450> we<00:01:16.570> bring<00:01:16.689> it<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.840> the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
computer and then we bring it to the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.550 
computer and then we bring it to the
architecture<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:18.520> HVAC<00:01:19.390> engineer<00:01:19.990> the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
architecture the HVAC engineer the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.310 
architecture the HVAC engineer the
structural<00:01:21.130> guy<00:01:21.659> modular<00:01:22.659> components<00:01:23.140> so<00:01:23.229> all

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
structural guy modular components so all

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.870 
structural guy modular components so all
these<00:01:23.439> things<00:01:23.679> got<00:01:23.829> to<00:01:23.860> be<00:01:23.950> pointing<00:01:24.729> in<00:01:24.820> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
these things got to be pointing in the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.700 
these things got to be pointing in the
same<00:01:24.939> direction<00:01:25.119> I'm<00:01:25.569> lining<00:01:25.750> up<00:01:25.929> if<00:01:26.439> water

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
same direction I'm lining up if water

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.469 
same direction I'm lining up if water
runs<00:01:26.950> off<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.280> roof<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.729> goes<00:01:28.030> down<00:01:28.210> into<00:01:28.360> the

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
runs off the roof and goes down into the

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.520 
runs off the roof and goes down into the
streets<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:28.990> then<00:01:29.079> the<00:01:29.170> storm<00:01:29.409> water

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
streets and then the storm water

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.990 
streets and then the storm water
eventually<00:01:30.039> ends<00:01:30.189> up<00:01:30.310> in<00:01:30.429> our<00:01:30.490> rivers<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.909> our

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
eventually ends up in our rivers in our

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.710 
eventually ends up in our rivers in our
oceans

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.390 

what's<00:01:35.290> wonderful<00:01:35.530> about<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.860> place<00:01:36.040> like<00:01:36.250> this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
what's wonderful about a place like this

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.610 
what's wonderful about a place like this
is<00:01:36.640> that<00:01:36.820> it's<00:01:37.000> not<00:01:37.060> only<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:38.290> know<00:01:38.350> about

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
is that it's not only you know about

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.410 
is that it's not only you know about
healthy<00:01:38.860> living<00:01:39.040> but<00:01:39.490> it's<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:40.150> being<00:01:40.300> better

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
healthy living but it's and being better

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.670 
healthy living but it's and being better
for<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.660> environment<00:01:40.780> but<00:01:41.260> it's<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.470> showcase

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
for the environment but it's a showcase

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.010 
for the environment but it's a showcase
and<00:01:42.040> an<00:01:42.100> opportunity<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:43.210> really<00:01:43.660> prove<00:01:43.840> to

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
and an opportunity to really prove to

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.780 
and an opportunity to really prove to
people<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.380> we<00:01:44.470> can<00:01:44.650> live<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.280> way<00:01:45.460> that<00:01:45.490> is
