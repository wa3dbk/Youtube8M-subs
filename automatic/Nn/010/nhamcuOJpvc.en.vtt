00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.240
 big hello dear friends as well 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:21.060
 subscribers to my channel on youtube 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.980
 dropped of course max marmat and today at 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.349
 Randomize case plan tell you about 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.929
 m41 walker bulldog machine 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.300
 This is a light tank of the seventh level in general. 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.060
 Itachi guys with the fact that the output of the lungs 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.640
 tanks in random randomly changed 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.260
 gameplay has more colors less 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.310
 artillery more than medium and heavy 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.040
 tanks 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.230
 these excuses are very like and 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 so I myself began to ride my own 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.000
 basic account and deflate m41 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.640
 walker bulldog but unfortunately today 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.800
 We look dumb ripley and because I 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.960
 as they say hand past rough wood 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.960
 so here I will show you a site replay 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.090
 from replay taken well based on it 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.940
 based on your real beliefs 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.750
 and subjective me hop this car 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.900
 I will try to you about this tank 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.960
 tell 1 of course and the most huge 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.750
 plus this car is its alternative 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.600
 gun having 175 millimeters penetration 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.970
 armor-piercing projectile and 10 shells in 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.280
 only two son loading drum 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.590
 seconds between a couple of new ones etc. 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.720
 it makes of our m41 walker bulldog 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.060
 a one of the most powerful and powerful 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.100
 damager yes of course at the seventh level 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.650
 there are cars that are about 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 the same sneakers does not have a drum but has 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.510
 about the same damage and also breaking through 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.370
 m41 walker bulldog agree grain in 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.370
 this plan is very unique car 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.590
 because with tanks with ten shells 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.479
 in the loading drum still in the game we have not 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.370
 there was something new 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.630
 when I know you are not in principle 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.970
 bother where do you go 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.460
 a dozen nine eight tanchik always 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.740
 find his hole his point as 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.320
 it is said and that even in this fight get 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.570
 in 10 uriel in the presence of at least some 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.580
 more or less even circle our hero 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.159
 will cause quite a lot of damage and 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.819
 by the standards of even a heavy tank is alpha 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.789
 then it will be very elegant still good 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.909
 the first position that I took in the picture 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.680
 Siegfried this square c2 notice that he 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.439
 didn't go to the city though most 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.209
 Who is light now or medium tanks 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.120
 go exactly to the city he took this up 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.620
 priests 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.439
 sniper position and 10-ki is not bad 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.750
 scattered 1,100 damage in his pockets 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.609
 and from calm to yourself 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.370
 unfolding ass wagging leaves with this 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.290
 positions towards the city in general guys 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.900
 Here I also ride on this machine 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.719
 I ride order and there may be 20 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.459
 battles managed to download there a couple of guns here before 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.889
 This gun has not reached yet, but I want to say 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.319
 you one each of these light tanks 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:50.689
 is unique not only in its gameplay but in 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.579
 its speed because it is in m41 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.370
 walker bulldog 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.769
 72 there with kopecks kilometers per hour it 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.750
 very good speed then it is but almost 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.310
 maximum speed in our game with us 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.129
 there is of course and 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.560
 ru 251 German which is also in it 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.560
 pressure everyone surprised with his 80 there with 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.669
 penny speeds well, in general they are 41 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.829
 the bulldog has a good amount 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:15.530
 horsepower per ton what makes of 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.540
 he is sufficient single eternal tanchik 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.989
 meanwhile our hero shoot 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.489
 enemy 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.709
 m t 54 e1 which is actually in the very 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.659
 the height of the battle to get to our base that 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.699
 in general, and most likely led them 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.280
 team to plum because two thawing 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.810
 absolutely free exchanged our 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.829
 allies who were already 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.620
 autistic 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.930
 well, our opponents continue and 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.620
 continues to bend union team at 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.169
 them, a score of 79 is a sad bill 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.260
 even despite the fact that they have this vpz 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:50.690
 e100 and t57 heavy which by the way 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.489
 there most likely were adequate 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.199
 Liri was the first time and was reviewing salt 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.120
 not to the world you can tell you so 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.579
 hanging on the enemy team got caught 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.250
 far from stupid 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.220
 of course with te hee which we tried 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.829
 break through our greens with honor 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.769
 saying our lt's okay with brains he 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:13.069
 occupies a vantage point now dead 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.660
 t95 on the greens in this our hero usa 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:21.840
 move that time enemy 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:24.110
 In the act of CPS, shorter than 4 4 travels on the passage 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.160
 manages to grab and therefore our hero 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.500
 shifted to some more profitable 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.900
 positions in general yes worth watching in x2 and 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.390
 x4 because there are so many 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.180
 publications that I don't like at all 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.540
 It seemed to the subscribers even know 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.580
 here 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.650
 playing heavy on the middle tank all 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.310
 time you complain why there is no btr and why 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.440
 no some 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.900
 action here on this tank I would say 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.670
 just an abundance of action and she's even fine 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.710
 annoying lacks any such 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.900
 sand moments when you can just 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.580
 stand to get pleasure from there 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.340
 any standing on you constantly 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.620
 will have to move it makes 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.870
 of course our brain to think well, and our hands 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.660
 to be at a loss what to do 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.180
 farther in the meantime our hero arrows your 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.750
 the last drum and goes to the next 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.090
 kd 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.570
 Code is one of the small advantages and 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.430
 cons of this tanchik 28 seconds drum 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.470
 avocado is not a long time 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.240
 for a light tank of the seventh level is 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.260
 enough ki sad because 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.240
 get and 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.520
 and to the dozens and if we are unlucky in 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.070
 enemy team any a 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.960
 adequate there is a heavy tank of type e100 and 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.450
 Looks like this map 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.250
 did you come across something like there ensk then 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.480
 there is a linear map where 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.970
 flashing some particular 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.640
 direction then most likely you will have 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.800
 very low hit rating 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.230
 on this tank since he will eat play 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.570
 so the gameplay is very uncomfortable 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.750
 in the meantime, the bill was generally close to 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:52.169
 12 12 is a very good team 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.060
 dragged there is bratuhi well done joseph 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:58.890
 Stalin lead you all to great 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.960
 she wins these times of ours is easy 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.390
 zac continues to stand by them to mix and 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.340
 By the way, not surprised guys that he 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.290
 this fight so effectively play it out 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.720
 enemy openteck team I said 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.970
 I got an invoice position 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.980
 she is not the best that is there is a big 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.900
 number of medium tank tolerable series 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.580
 a small number of medium tanks there 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.660
 broke through that is if they played 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.970
 a little over ass 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.320
 backs to that is and because they had 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.300
 many medium tanks of course you can 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.640
 to say that it was necessary to expand but I would 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.530
 still took out the best virgins because 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.900
 It was to go to the race but because they were 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.280
 other such heavy patterns and 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.490
 in short, the chance of dust 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.340
 but our hero entered the port borrowed 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.420
 and of course honey we are already 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.360
 enjoy the way he breaks fast 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.420
 your paraglider heavy padtai 10 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.940
 level is left alone or tablet 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.980
 Well, you understand of course that blinked 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.290
 darling mean artillery we are with you 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.780
 I do not like this so here would drag 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:58.390
 ugly ca n't talk like that 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:02.170
 take in x4 and keep looking at 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:04.750
 edition well it is super fast and easy 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.790
 Tank basically guys on this all 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.640
 now he will find the author from art and 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:14.890
 he knows something my will be finished here 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.540
 art found art yurt therefore we do not 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:20.490
 respect guys so do not be offended 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:23.320
 someone mars plays god forbid you health 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.190
 so he found artillery of course with 

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.530
 drummer 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.330
 oh, how I love when the enemy ends 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.580
 art on this fight is over let's 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.470
 send results most to 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:36.160
 I liked the results 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:39.700
 Damage 6200 47 units and 4 frags and 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.860
 of course 2138 experience units of which 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.890
 enough to take a sign 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:47.890
 the classiness of the master as well as the caliber itself and 

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.930
 support in detail are looking for plus 50 thousand 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.640
 silver is a very good result 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:54.070
 honestly two years of these lungs 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.260
 tanks in general, in general, all but that 

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.000
 including booker bulldog such results 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.850
 on light tanks, we practically do not 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.680
 seen from and seen but very rarely if 

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.940
 you like guys subscribe
