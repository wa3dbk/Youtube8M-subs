I have a phobia fan controller up in the

wants a red and the top is it's what the

wants a red and the top is it's what the
reason<00:03:46.970> for<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.209> white<00:03:47.390> being<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:49.010> allow<00:03:49.220> the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
reason for the white being to allow the

red nuances the black and red nuances to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.520 
red nuances the black and red nuances to
come<00:03:52.250> out<00:03:52.520> a<00:03:52.550> little<00:03:52.760> bit<00:03:52.910> more<00:03:53.230> naturally<00:03:54.230> so

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
come out a little bit more naturally so

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.860 
come out a little bit more naturally so
so<00:03:54.860> more<00:03:55.430> like<00:03:55.610> highlighting<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.390> accents

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
so more like highlighting the accents

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.350 
so more like highlighting the accents
instead<00:03:57.740> of<00:03:57.860> flowering<00:03:58.220> flooding<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:59.120> with

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
instead of flowering flooding it with

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.860 
instead of flowering flooding it with
red<00:04:00.050> light<00:04:00.260> or<00:04:00.470> so<00:04:00.650> but<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:02.330> red<00:04:02.480> light<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:02.780> the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
red light or so but the red light in the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.770 
red light or so but the red light in the
bottom<00:04:03.400> creates<00:04:04.400> this<00:04:04.580> contrast<00:04:05.270> which<00:04:05.660> I

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
bottom creates this contrast which I

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.740 
bottom creates this contrast which I
really<00:04:05.990> like<00:04:06.140> so<00:04:06.550> so<00:04:07.550> this<00:04:07.670> is<00:04:07.730> my<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.570> is<00:04:08.630> my

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750
