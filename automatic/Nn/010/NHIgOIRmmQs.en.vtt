00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 speech and organisms a video then today 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.639
 at the request of many people 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.130
 I'm here making the video I want 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.500
 explain to you a little something and that 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.770
 It's actually quite simple but it ends up being 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.650
 A little difficult to explain Understand is 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.460
 This is not very simple but it is simple. 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.099
 Yes, you will see that this is 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.609
 super dinner and then I still do not know the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.540
 name that is made here on these borders 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.010
 of the ship map on the gr side and on the bl 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.450
 but first I would like to talk to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.460
 You on this side bl here is much more 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.120
 easy to do this gianpi 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.520
 because in the beginning at least for those already 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.280
 You know, it's not going to change anything, because 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.840
 on this side gr it is a little bigger 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.000
 this wall here is what I think and the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.600
 yield the audience has to be a bit 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.640
 slower than the flat plan 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.400
 It's very simple to do 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.260
 explaining here how you do is 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.689
 Of course you will not see the video go 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.510
 going out and doing you guys going to get a base 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.610
 here of the video and will try to train and 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 can do or who has 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.310
 ease of understanding the video 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.130
 if you see people will do it right? 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.759
 ambon then first I would like to 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.390
 explain that you have that two years ago 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.930
 here you'll have to do is run 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.180
 direction they will always ran in 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.850
 direction them to start this gianpi 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:45.210
 You guys, I just came here to run. 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:49.770
 There you have already sold the leap objective. 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.590
 it's like an anp download and it's like 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.960
 if here were a sandbox making 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.360
 the anp download here only that would be 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.540
 reaching a height more and then rising in 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.960
 I do not know how to explain it very well, but 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.640
 It's as if this second because I gave 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.459
 here o 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.440
 he was in the barrel and then I could 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.410
 climb up on that top he understood 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.470
 So what are you going to have to do? 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.330
 It will be run into the barrel 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.590
 lapola hold up against all this 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.590
 holding w 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:32.360
 Of course nothing to hello, popular will be 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:42.710
 against and is very easy so very simple to 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:47.360
 account runs in the group connection and is 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:50.300
 so it's done and I here for you 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.940
 this speed on this side here dr 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:58.310
 she is not the same can see with the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.130
 control is not the same because in a 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:09.710
 moment when you jump on these two pipes 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:15.410
 Here gr gr of a while more on 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:17.150
 to be able to come back again in a way 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.840
 slower than what happens with the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.450
 character found I'm going to jump 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.810
 you can see that it is a minimum time 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.270
 or thousandths or if a second at the most 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.700
 that it stays in the air 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:39.140
 he stays in the air until he falls back into the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:41.420
 pipe in the air in the air until he does it again 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.290
 on the barrel and this time on this side is 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.150
 bigger 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.959
 It is a little bigger then the fast 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.510
 velocity 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:55.040
 reminiscing on adobe is speed is 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.900
 lapola holds against everything holding w 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.190
 speed will decrease 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.140
 bit by lapola hold against 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:08.570
 lapola hold up against the pope polish 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:15.769
 ensures stand there in popular there 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:18.530
 pencil and there playing x 1 or 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.330
 normal starting and training here you 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.580
 You will see that one hour you will do without 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.090
 going wrong will be very simple for you 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.650
 always hit 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.630
 and this is basically what you can do and 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.380
 on your back as well 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.840
 so that side as the other but 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.350
 When are you going to coast? 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.940
 You have to know the time you have to jump. 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.190
 or here on the b side it does not have much 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.590
 time is most popular for insuring against 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.740
 the same is very easy but on this side here 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:54.510
 global risk gr is a little bit 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.490
 harder to do but if you see a 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.580
 bit slow but nothing that goes 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.560
 change a lot 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.830
 so it's very simple as it does 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.090
 remembering, run there, put her on 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:13.500
 that's how you two give a second 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.000
 2nd download leap here in this pipe and 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.479
 it will make you go up a 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.610
 A little higher here and it just should 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:25.050
 to do if you hold the control 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:29.490
 in the end it always against Beads 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.990
 holding w mpula opa lapola safe with 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.669
 ow 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:37.710
 and against and of course here for example if 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.120
 are coming from behind you will hold 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.750
 the 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.419
 still in diagonal you will hold the 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.340
 lapola ensure control of the steering 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:51.030
 that you want to climb and it's basically 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.560
 cypress 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.360
 I hope you have succeeded. 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:06:00.120
 learn ii and this is what you have liked 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.760
 and until the next video thank you very much 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.760
 all who have been here and gone
