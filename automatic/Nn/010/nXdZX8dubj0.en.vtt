00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:12.469
 well the first notice and the most obvious is if you're a fan of this saga do not lose 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.710
 time here the other if you are interested in the graphics of video games like me 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.560
 this is your video 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.380
 let us begin 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.460
 but what the hell this is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life that they want 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.230
 demonstrate with that insignificant saga besides that they are armable figurines are 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.250
 the worst in games and if you have not seen one is impossible these assholes have 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.940
 of everything I read indiana and lions lego star wars and then I deleted bread 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.360
 after selling it claimed god of war or then removing hero assholes what amount 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.230
 of games have these assholes who give you for ass I do not know why they continue 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.069
 pulling more and more games out of this crap is that it will never end 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.950
 here you have a video of this shit of sada 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.020

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.580
 the shows started 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.580
 taking into account these four young people's day of visit 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.250
 there is an intention of characters 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.250
 next to the united states 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.940
 - in a kind of having collapsed until the next day 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.730
 the duel between them costa del sol 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 all this and much more weight sergio to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.450
 in all regions of them in that sense 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.770
 in general terms 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.330
 has helped me to process the news came to negotiate in 2 272 knows very well 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.480
 when in the genre 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.960
 lives the dream of everything so far no progress is made 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.670
 It has given me a lot of air play with two cabbages 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.980
 the bags 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.220
 All this 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.460
 sada 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.460
 condemned to death 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.110
 what the hell 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.489
 nor for xbox 360 this shit looks better 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.260
 let's tell you that you do not waste money buying this shit 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:17.200
 a point in favor if you are one of those who mocks the ignorance of 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.029
 graphics and you have nothing else to do and what is not to laugh a laugh 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:25.760
 buy thread but do not buy this shit for a bar if it's interesting you 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.040
 I say because I fell into this shit and I do not want you to go through this 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.869
 for those who want to know why I bought it is because I kept 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:39.680
 listen to them so much shit from this lego batman lego jarry potter then 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:44.029
 I decided to buy it and I told myself in my mind to see if it is so 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:48.159
 popular this saga that gets so much bullshit but when I put it in my 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.229
 console I told myself but what the fuck I lost my bitch moni buying me is trinket 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:56.229
 this mediocrity and I gave it to a geek 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:01.259
 Well, I hope that I make you understand this criticism and that you follow my steps 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:06.289
