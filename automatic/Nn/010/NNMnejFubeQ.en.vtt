Armour curry one and the ANA foam upper
which<00:01:52.540> is<00:01:52.630> like<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.780> combination<00:01:53.050> of<00:01:53.380> like<00:01:53.590> foam

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
which is like a combination of like foam

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.060 
which is like a combination of like foam
and<00:01:54.729> mesh<00:01:55.509> on<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.840> upper<00:01:56.170> which<00:01:56.650> makes<00:01:56.950> it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
and mesh on the upper which makes it

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.850 
and mesh on the upper which makes it
really<00:01:57.369> soft<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.270> flexible<00:01:58.540> I<00:01:58.960> would<00:01:59.680> say

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
really soft and flexible I would say

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.730 
really soft and flexible I would say
like<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.490> few<00:02:01.270> war<00:02:01.690> like<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.020> anatomic<00:02:02.500> spawn

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
like a few war like the anatomic spawn

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.320 
like a few war like the anatomic spawn
and<00:02:03.009> I<00:02:03.040> thought<00:02:03.490> those<00:02:03.670> were<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.880> little<00:02:04.179> bit

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
and I thought those were a little bit

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.600 
and I thought those were a little bit
tight<00:02:05.259> if<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:05.979> have<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.100> little<00:02:06.220> bit<00:02:06.399> wider

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
tight if you have a little bit wider

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.400 
tight if you have a little bit wider
feet<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:07.390> will<00:02:07.509> actually<00:02:07.630> be<00:02:07.899> like<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> big

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
feet this will actually be like a big

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.570 
feet this will actually be like a big
change<00:02:08.649> in<00:02:08.770> terms<00:02:08.800> like<00:02:09.130> it's<00:02:09.280> just<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.490> little

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
change in terms like it's just a little

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.309 
change in terms like it's just a little
bit<00:02:09.759> more<00:02:09.880> flexible<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.600> little<00:02:11.110> bit<00:02:11.200> more

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
bit more flexible a little bit more

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.650 
bit more flexible a little bit more
breathable<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:13.630> everything<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.450> see<00:02:16.450> you

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
breathable and everything so so see you

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.870 
breathable and everything so so see you
can't<00:02:16.810> really<00:02:16.960> see<00:02:17.200> like<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:18.160> design<00:02:18.550> of

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
can't really see like the the design of

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.910 
can't really see like the the design of
the<00:02:18.970> shoe<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.420> see<00:02:19.780> there's<00:02:19.960> like<00:02:20.050> different

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
like cuts right here different geometric

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.880 
like cuts right here different geometric
like<00:02:23.050> shapes<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.730> everything<00:02:24.760> on<00:02:25.330> this<00:02:25.540> one

that's<00:02:26.890> hard<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.280> tell<00:02:27.460> because<00:02:27.640> he<00:02:27.880> made

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
that's hard to tell because he made

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.100 
that's hard to tell because he made
something<00:02:28.240> like<00:02:28.390> that<00:02:28.569> yellow<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.930> black

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
something like that yellow and black

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.410

it's<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:32.050> little<00:02:32.260> bit<00:02:32.410> more<00:02:32.650> obvious<00:02:32.770> on<00:02:33.069> the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
it's a little bit more obvious on the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.150 
it's a little bit more obvious on the
other<00:02:33.340> colorways<00:02:33.850> so<00:02:34.770> then<00:02:35.770> you<00:02:35.890> can<00:02:36.010> see
