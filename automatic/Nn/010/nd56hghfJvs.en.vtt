 it immediately struck 50 pence I start holding my mouth 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.810
 to have 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.220
 What do you say to be in his defense? 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.220
 she will be on 9 and 7 si 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 we have 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.540
 apn 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.110
 one by a Jehovah's Witness 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.500
 test test test test 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.560
 abused our arms take against St 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.100
 Brussels as part 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.910
 b 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.840
 on 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 dpa 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.170
 that was from a folded that just saw 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.760
 The Trucker is bitter for the Opera Halle 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.410
 or break 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.790
 Gladbach has 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.380
 and they were different 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.639
 they will 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.639
 heptathlete 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:17.849
 there 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.969
 discovered 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.509
 We know the collected things Aachen 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.509
 Things that as 31 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.179
 it is the seventh time 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.199
 maybe you will find out here 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.639
 that they are outward 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.209
 not far enough right 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.829
 quickly she clarified we have a lot to do 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.629
 lose the biggest 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.639
 This is 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.039
 she is future 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.039
 they should not be able to grasp single notes 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.219
 Fichtes knew and the Liverpool 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.389
 Yes 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.389
 snappy but unclouded have presented us well 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.819
 nothing hero 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.089
 I do that now 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.840
 but now the number of the people was my mistake 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.769
 the mistake was that I had killed and gotten the tightened out 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.609
 then up 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:19.849
 no idea 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.849
 because traces lead on the spot 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.979
 playfully but quickly 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.269
 but nothing new 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.269
 that's the only reason why it's clear 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:42.949
 conflicts 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.859
 Olala with the 4th motorcycle 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.969
 Brumfield you do not see them 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:51.199
 Queen of England 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.199
 but it may now be more 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.669
 and her boat 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.549
 and yes the road will end soon 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.549
 and Lara jumps on castle 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.399
 and her famous dive jump that I do not laugh 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.240
 nice thing 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.340
 Egypt is finished in the eternal hunting grounds sent O'Brien 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.099
 Â«I am a happy person 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:45.889
 the report says the game is now almost 11 15 already 48 Kilz 24 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.050
 that was not too much for Egypt, actually, Fienne's view 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.610
 To know people hikers 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.840
 that were so hard to put supplies 8 abstract only from 2 0 of Aintree 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.270
 I do not give a shit on that 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.319
 May play 50 seats again is thank you may not give it first 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.870
 maybe someday if not there 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.339
 no idea about PIK 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:10.029
 Gabon once again learns to play Lara Croft 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.870
 I music comments he as a thank you want to save their doors 

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:16.889
 No 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.919
 Yes that's true 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.919
 Already a crawling game 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.809
 Score single anyway 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:28.809
 while Matt Kinch called the usual bit of money 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.919
 that's bankruptcy going 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.330
 okay the 50 bands covered because I think the tip is a real one 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.039
 then we do net on the net are sar 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.669
 yes I think it is not difficult for me 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.080
 okay people 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.180
 we are now in the new world finally I was not sure what it's called 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.379

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.120
