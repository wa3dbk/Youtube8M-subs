00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
because I haven't showed it in a long

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.990 
because I haven't showed it in a long
time<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:13.070> this<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.130> still<00:00:14.490> what<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.969> and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
time so this is still what it is and

still very happy with it and it looks

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.849 
still very happy with it and it looks
very<00:00:20.340> nice<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:24.109> now<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> haven't<00:00:25.410> done<00:00:25.529> anything

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
very nice so now I haven't done anything

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.419 
very nice so now I haven't done anything
actually<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.000> show<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.599> something<00:00:28.429> but

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
actually just to show you something but

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.799 
actually just to show you something but
I<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:30.500> used<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.740> silver<00:00:32.219> marker<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.940> give<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
I I used the silver marker to give it a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.290 
I I used the silver marker to give it a
lot<00:00:34.110> older<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> look<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:37.730> that<00:00:38.730> works<00:00:39.000> out<00:00:39.239> very

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
lot older a look and that works out very

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.209 
lot older a look and that works out very
well<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.350> go<00:00:41.160> over<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> edges<00:00:41.969> that

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
well you have to go over the edges that

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.350 
well you have to go over the edges that
though<00:00:44.219> they<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.210> used<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.750> most<00:00:46.489> like<00:00:47.489> at

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
though they get used the most like at

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.170 
though they get used the most like at
the<00:00:48.570> slide<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.280> grips<00:00:50.550> key<00:00:51.000> is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the slide and here and the grips key is

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.049 
the slide and here and the grips key is
the<00:00:51.390> most<00:00:52.280> what<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.610> could<00:00:54.390> call<00:00:54.570> scratch<00:00:54.989> so

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
the most what I could call scratch so

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.840 
the most what I could call scratch so
that's<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.360> and<00:01:00.140> for<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.410> troy<00:01:02.250> flip<00:01:02.699> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
that's that and for the troy flip of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.530 
that's that and for the troy flip of
