on this particular one the wood varies
from<00:01:18.490> one<00:01:18.729> guitar<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.390> next<00:01:19.690> because<00:01:19.840> it

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
from one guitar to the next because it

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.779 
from one guitar to the next because it
all<00:01:20.380> comes<00:01:20.619> from<00:01:20.890> different<00:01:21.009> trees<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.670> no

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
two are ever going to be quite the same

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.290 
two are ever going to be quite the same
and<00:01:23.950> that's<00:01:24.190> part<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.640> romance<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.210> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.480 

but<00:01:40.750> let's<00:01:40.930> talk<00:01:41.080> about<00:01:41.230> the<00:01:41.500> top<00:01:41.770> it's<00:01:42.340> a

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
but let's talk about the top it's a

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.430 
but let's talk about the top it's a
spruce<00:01:42.760> top<00:01:43.060> you've<00:01:43.630> heard<00:01:43.840> that<00:01:44.020> before<00:01:44.080> a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
spruce top you've heard that before a

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.650 
spruce top you've heard that before a
lot<00:01:44.710> of<00:01:44.830> guitars<00:01:45.100> have<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.310> spruce<00:01:45.640> top<00:01:45.850> but

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
lot of guitars have a spruce top but

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.860 
lot of guitars have a spruce top but
Yamaha<00:01:47.230> has<00:01:47.590> developed<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.220> process<00:01:49.060> called<00:01:49.600> a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
Yamaha has developed a process called a

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.540 
Yamaha has developed a process called a
r-e<00:01:51.060> acoustic<00:01:52.060> resonance<00:01:52.630> enhancement<00:01:53.560> this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
r-e acoustic resonance enhancement this

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.990 
r-e acoustic resonance enhancement this
is<00:01:54.730> a<00:01:54.760> Yamaha<00:01:55.390> regional<00:01:56.110> process<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:57.310> using<00:01:57.730> a

system of precisely controlling
temperature<00:02:00.600> humidity<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.640> atmospheric

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
temperature humidity and atmospheric

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.940 
temperature humidity and atmospheric
pressure<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.300> this<00:02:04.750> process<00:02:05.050> causes<00:02:05.800> the

molecular properties of the top wood to
change<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.640> be<00:02:09.850> similar<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.330> wood<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.050> you

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
change to be similar to wood that you

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.750 
change to be similar to wood that you
would<00:02:11.350> find<00:02:11.620> on<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.860> guitar<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.220> someone

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
would find on the guitar that someone

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.390 
would find on the guitar that someone
has<00:02:12.910> played<00:02:13.209> for<00:02:13.480> 30<00:02:13.720> years<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:14.770> pre<00:02:15.130> aged

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
has played for 30 years so it's pre aged

you<00:02:50.860> might<00:02:51.099> look<00:02:51.280> at<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.640> say<00:02:51.760> well<00:02:51.910> why

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
you might look at that and say well why

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.570 
you might look at that and say well why
didn't<00:02:52.269> they<00:02:52.360> just<00:02:52.569> make<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.959> all<00:02:53.140> one<00:02:53.590> well

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
didn't they just make that all one well

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.420 
didn't they just make that all one well
that<00:02:54.940> uses<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> lot<00:02:55.870> more<00:02:56.170> wood<00:02:56.470> all<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:57.130> wood

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
that uses a lot more wood all that wood

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.059 
that uses a lot more wood all that wood
in<00:02:57.700> here<00:02:58.120> if<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.630> was<00:02:58.810> one<00:02:59.110> piece<00:02:59.380> would<00:03:00.010> be

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
in here if this was one piece would be

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.309 
in here if this was one piece would be
wasted<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.269> much<00:03:01.540> more<00:03:01.750> efficient

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319

let's look at the nut and saddle both

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.810 
let's look at the nut and saddle both
being<00:05:04.900> of<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.110> synthetic<00:05:05.620> material<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:06.430> saddle

being of a synthetic material the saddle
is<00:05:06.940> compensated<00:05:07.720> which<00:05:08.230> means<00:05:08.530> each<00:05:08.740> string

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
is compensated which means each string

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.070 

so<00:05:37.010> let's<00:05:37.250> talk<00:05:37.430> about<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:37.850> electronics<00:05:38.510> this

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
so let's talk about the electronics this

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.320 
so let's talk about the electronics this
guitar<00:05:39.500> does<00:05:39.800> have<00:05:40.070> them<00:05:40.340> these<00:05:40.640> electronics

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
guitar does have them these electronics

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.230 
guitar does have them these electronics
are<00:05:41.420> called<00:05:41.660> zero<00:05:42.470> impact<00:05:43.100> electronics<00:05:43.910> that

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
are called zero impact electronics that

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.210 
are called zero impact electronics that
has<00:05:44.420> a<00:05:44.450> couple<00:05:44.810> of<00:05:44.870> different<00:05:45.230> meanings<00:05:45.590> one

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
has a couple of different meanings one

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.670 
has a couple of different meanings one
there's<00:05:46.550> zero<00:05:47.030> impact<00:05:47.660> to<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:48.020> cosmetics

because<00:05:48.920> you<00:05:49.010> don't<00:05:49.190> see<00:05:49.430> anything<00:05:49.790> there's

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
because you don't see anything there's

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.720 
because you don't see anything there's

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
beauty of the guitar so perhaps more

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.570 
beauty of the guitar so perhaps more
important<00:05:56.810> to<00:05:56.990> zero<00:05:57.320> impact<00:05:57.830> there's<00:05:58.310> no

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
purpose of the zero impact pickup system

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.330 
purpose of the zero impact pickup system
from<00:06:14.390> Yamaha<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:15.050> system<00:06:15.590> utilizes

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
from Yamaha the system utilizes

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.970 
from Yamaha the system utilizes
individual<00:06:17.120> piezo<00:06:17.690> electric<00:06:17.960> elements<00:06:18.770> under

individual piezo electric elements under
each<00:06:19.250> string<00:06:19.760> so<00:06:20.480> it's<00:06:20.720> actually<00:06:21.380> six<00:06:21.740> pickups

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
each string so it's actually six pickups

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.760 
each string so it's actually six pickups
in<00:06:22.460> one<00:06:23.210> this<00:06:23.750> allows<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.350> system<00:06:24.530> to

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
in one this allows the system to

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.400 
in one this allows the system to
faithfully<00:06:25.430> reproduce<00:06:25.940> each<00:06:26.180> string<00:06:26.660> of<00:06:26.900> the
