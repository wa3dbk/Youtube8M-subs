00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.660
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 a small texture pack showing 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.400
 and to the radcliffe realist 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.109
 this is a default pack just one 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.240
 a bit overworked but I use that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.369
 currently and find it really damn cool 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.230
 if you are interested that later 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.380
 private mopac presentation 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.489
 bz what do I say texture pack imagine 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.920
 then he just writes one 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.730
 finish with the texture pack and then 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.590
 I will probably test it then 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.000
 I come now first to the stone 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.329
 grass blog here 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.890
 you can not see that at all but the earth 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.600
 looks almost exactly the same here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.760
 already built paving stone oak 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.410
 Birch what I think is pretty cool 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.260
 The wood is strong after the success 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.110
 as I said it is also a success but stop 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.979
 I can do a little overworked sand too 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.860

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.049
 So stone was called here the whole 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.950
 stages, so to speak 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.799

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.250

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.540
