00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.940
 but with maybe you have been afraid 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.680
 of undertaking how many times has not 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.769
 decided it's time to change without 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.869
 However good fear in the community 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.640
 many times they come between this 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.740
 decision and between living a full life 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.090
 good today we have that accompanies me 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.160
 here in the study excess television 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.650
 mario borghino he is the author of this 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.380
 book the great leap of life where it 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.150
 expose and gives us some tips for 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.070
 encourage us suddenly to take that great leap 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.660
 that they take us that would take us to 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.070
 entrepreneurship and to make then 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.629
 our life full our plans that 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.760
 we have had is from several years ago and 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.140
 that good often frightens us 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.250
 risk to start Mr. Mario 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.320
 because I do not like this very good idea 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.909
 new in day because with this key account 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.530
 key to undertake because you have 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.699
 all the reason in this book I was 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.790
 reading the weekend 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.640
 and many times it is fear the fear of 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.019
 risk and for many times it says very well 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.290
 it is the saying not the one that does not risk not 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.510
 win 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.970
 This is how we come from 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.689
 a culture that it would seem that this 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.760
 it is forbidden to fail like that is and well in 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.740
 the silicon valley that are all these 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.500
 young people who are born with their new 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.280
 companies the objective of them is that if 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.100
 you do not 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.799
 then you are not creating a new 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.380
 organization is to say the fact is that the 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.830
 failure is an element of experience 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.270
 meetings of events where you accumulate 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.210
 elements in which you do not have to 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.830
 to venture is the only element that 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.380
 allows you to open new ones 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.720
 experiences is that you try one and 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.729
 again I always tell people 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.940
 fail until you succeed you have to be 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.590
 continue failing because it happens there's still 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.570
 a huge problem in this sense that 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.910
 It's not just for a company, it 's for you 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.830
 personal life most people 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.750
 they die in this life without having fulfilled 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.580
 the great goals of his life 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.020
 elizabeth kÃ¼bler ross that that always 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.520
 was a tanatologist who studied this and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.979
 analyzed a lot of people who 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.170
 they were already on the deathbed and two 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.149
 things she came to the conclusion of 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.130
 so many hundreds of people that the 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.289
 people were sorry they do not see 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.050
 have not tried something that always 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.489
 had longed for clear and the other is not 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.350
 have told loved ones 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.540
 how much I loved him but an element 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.410
 important related to this book is 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.350
 the number of attempts that 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.260
 we have in the trunk of memories 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.120
 many many ideas that were there and 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.040
 in many cases we observe that there 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.120
 very very smart people who do not 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.550
 they are successful 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.700
 so it is that if the intention the way in 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.860
 that you risk in your life is the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.260
 only way you have to be able to 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.420
 approaching success is when you 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.640
 fail means you have to open 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.530
 new doors the problem is that you 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.050
 attribute to yourself vehicle I have a 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.180
 chapter I have are four chapters one 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.860
 talks about happiness the importance 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.510
 that we have our 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.360
 power inside of us 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.760
 same for two concepts about 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.830
 Success as success is achieved in 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.630
 our life as fear is one of the 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.390
 factors the fear has always won 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.300
 the party to the human being always always 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.730
 has been the cause of many failures 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.730
 of people and always wins him like 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.830
 I say always goes 2 to 1 and you win the 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.540
 party to the human being that being that 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.780
 wins the battles by being a now 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.030
 we filled 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.459
 let's put the real things in 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.830
 reality in countries like Mexico and the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.260
 rest of latin america where you alright 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.900
 he says it is the theme of fear 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.819
 fear of risk laws but what 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.980
 do for example when a young person has 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.050
 a young man also a great adult agent 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.880
 intends to start 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.200
 undertake to suddenly you already have 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.760
 experience in a certain field and says good 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.890
 I'm going to start doing my own company 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.920
 I'm going to start doing my own business 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.500
 to stop depending on the arrival 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.300
 to do what I always wanted to do well 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.160
 and many times there are two issues that I 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.560
 found mainly in this fear 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.900
 at risk one is the family because they know 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.150
 that these people already have two children 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.709
 the wife and if they fail, well, the 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.540
 family is left unprotected in certain 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.620
 mode and a second topic that I 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.030
 found in this subject of 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.340
 Entrepreneurship in these years that I have 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.980
 in this topic of finance is the subject 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.230
 that many people do not capitalize 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.819
 ideas both young and 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.790
 adults for another fear of risk 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.410
 also to drop the investments and those 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.229
 financial institutions or even of 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.910
 some other companies or accelerators 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.930
 of business that suddenly also 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.080
 they sell in some 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.259
 projects like they are not very viable and 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.580
 what I have proven over the years 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:34.800
 advising medical entrepreneur rescue 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.660
 companies and try to take out companies from 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.970
 your own crisis not only companies 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.169
 young if a company from 30 to 40 years old 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.570
 that at this time given the conditions 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.610
 economic and globalization are 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.410
 having problems but one of the things 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.630
 that observed in young people when 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.550
 they start their business is that they initiate a 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.039
 business without knowing anything 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.560
 about a company they know about 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.259
 software know about maybe of 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.630
 clothes they know about shoes because they have been 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.330
 in that business and they believe that by knowing 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.830
 about that of that product they 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.949
 they have the right to open a business 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.949
 not because you take a huge risk is 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.380
 say making a business survive is a 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.570
 huge pain because you have to have a 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.669
 integral solution to be able to 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.250
 can do it there are young people who are good 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.320
 technicians but they do not know how to sell there are others 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.440
 cases good managers but not 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.180
 They know they have no concept of type 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.370
 financial to be able to manage your business 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.630
 there is no other that sells a lot and they do not know 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.850
 manage that 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.240
 it's a balancing element you have to 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:38.400
 understand the companies are a multiple 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.830
 activities that you have to have in 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.170
 interdependently controlled and not 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.180
 just know why software is opened 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.070
 a business no sir you are prohibited 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.920
 open the business until you have not 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.020
 studied how a business is managed and 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.270
 how a business was launched in such a way 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.760
 that then they say good I opened my 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.490
 business and I ended up with all the savings 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.470
 that I had of my life because yes it is to say is 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.960
 the least that can happen to you because 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.910
 you study about business about 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.680
 how do you create a business what are the 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.330
 business characteristics and you 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.190
 I wonder I interviewed many 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.110
 general managers always asked them 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.090
 tell me how you became a millionaire and 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.680
 generally the answers that I 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.260
 I get from them is that they have a 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.450
 integral business concept do not have 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.340
 a concept that has a product gara 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.250
 not that I'm in LeÃ³n guanajuato isseg 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.200
 of shoes do not necessarily know of 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.870
 shoes allows you here to have a business 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.730
 of shoes and that is another element that 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.660
 you have to learn then when I 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.930
 speak 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.440
 says this book this my seventh book 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.300
 surprised a lot 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.850
 we have much more than 200,000 books in 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.250
 the market of the people that that 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.630
 truly this one likes in the way 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.710
 in which I write but I am a 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.560
 very practical person 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.570
 I'm close to the companies I do not 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.520
 I do not give opinions I talk about what I know 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.100
 of what I have checked and what 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.600
 observed in entrepreneurs I'm 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.250
 very close to all the entrepreneurs of 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.900
 mexico I think that one I thank you 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.940
 much that has accompanied us and that has 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.250
 shared with these two in these few 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.040
 minutes this experience about how not 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.090
 doubt and risk making those 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.470
 dreams that we often have 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.090
 kept in the drawer as you well 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.010
 it says well so fear does not win the 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.380
 game seriously because it's no good 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.450
 author of this book the great leap of his 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.370
 life the truth a book that the truth 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.770
 it's worth it if you read it 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.090
 they are planning to undertake to organize 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.980
 some kind of business because what 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.410
 questions and answers to free us 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.720
