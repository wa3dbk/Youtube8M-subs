00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello today is a thursday yes 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.940
 yesterday was my first day of school 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.890
 the christmas holidays and usually 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.840
 it is the summer comes to ever do 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.460
 not out of bed and everything if you're in 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.840
 had the holidays and then at some point 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.639
 but it was not like that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.619
 I'm already at ten to six 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.300
 got up for some of you again 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.580
 to be normal, but I have to 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.949
 do not get up until seven because I'm first 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 20 48 must drive off to school 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.130
 to be unhappy and so many 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 now actually times was cool on I 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.179
 over and then the way to school 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.070
 also extremely close I've sometimes 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.960
 An older video tells that to me 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.210
 stay for a really great cruz 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.160
 got work and got it for free 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.480
 thanks to my father who suddenly the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.520
 ninth victory has heard one 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.649
 discovered music direction for me or he 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840
 a band that's a very special one 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.730
 music style practiced and no it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.140
 is out and should no medium or 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.899
 hard rock resp 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.430
 but it's such a mixture of jazz 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.989
 and by the way I'm doing now 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.570
 simply advertising the band is called fat 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.670
 freddy's drop and without flax on like that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.739
 to put a gruber driver and this 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.559
 listening to music you just feel 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.700
 no that's so indescribable 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.869
 Normally I used metal 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.400
 music belongs and it just has me 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.020
 driven to drive fast and the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.119
 new music that I hear now drives 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.580
 tell me to start now and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.960
 believe me that is so cool 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.240
 you could use the music of fat freddy's 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.799
 drop also called ried music denote that 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.270
 hitting it pretty good actually had 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.830
 in any case, have a look and then went 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.270
 you go to school on an already direct 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.220

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.040
 Holidays together with my family 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.750
 and grabs somehow extremely from 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.729
 you just do not talk to the family 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.320
 just as you talk to your buddies and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.390

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.159
