00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
I'm practicing tongue twisters uh it's

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.230 
I'm practicing tongue twisters uh it's
gonna<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.460> world's<00:00:20.609> hardest<00:00:20.910> tongue

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
gonna be the world's hardest tongue

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.820 
gonna be the world's hardest tongue
twisters<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.840> come<00:00:21.990> out<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.260> I'm<00:00:22.439> gonna<00:00:22.619> get

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
twisters just come out and I'm gonna get

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.620 
twisters just come out and I'm gonna get
it<00:00:22.949> I'm<00:00:23.039> gonna<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.400> okay<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.330> know<00:00:24.420> it's

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
it I'm gonna get okay it's you know it's

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.050 
it I'm gonna get okay it's you know it's
weird<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.170> tongue<00:00:25.650> twisters<00:00:26.099> even<00:00:26.490> exist<00:00:26.880> if

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
weird that tongue twisters even exist if

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.460 
weird that tongue twisters even exist if
you<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.330> about<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.599> right<00:00:27.720> cuz<00:00:27.869> yeah<00:00:28.019> these

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you think about it right cuz yeah these

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.630 
you think about it right cuz yeah these
are<00:00:28.680> sounds<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.099> make<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> time

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
are sounds that we make all the time

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.710 
are sounds that we make all the time
these<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:29.849> words<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.300> say<00:00:30.480> all<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.630> time

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
these are words that we say all the time

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.269 
these are words that we say all the time
we're<00:00:31.019> planning<00:00:31.500> what<00:00:31.650> we're<00:00:31.830> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.070> say

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
we're planning what we're going to say

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.160 
we're planning what we're going to say
in<00:00:32.430> advance<00:00:32.550> em<00:00:33.000> hmm<00:00:33.120> why<00:00:33.570> do<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.780> get<00:00:33.930> tripped

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
in advance em hmm why do we get tripped

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.200 
in advance em hmm why do we get tripped
up<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> MIT<00:00:35.250> researchers<00:00:35.940> were

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
up that's what the MIT researchers were

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.330 
up that's what the MIT researchers were
looking<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.930> find<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.559> before<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.160> find

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
looking to find and before you can find

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
looking to find and before you can find
the<00:00:38.399> cause<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.579> something<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the cause of something you have to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.869 
the cause of something you have to
figure<00:00:39.629> out<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.050> specific<00:00:40.500> effects<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> what

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
figure out the specific effects and what

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.090 
figure out the specific effects and what
actual<00:00:42.300> things<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.899> happening<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:43.980> our

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
actual things are happening that get our

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.310 
actual things are happening that get our
tongues<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.640> twisted<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.300> they<00:00:45.660> got<00:00:46.170> this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
tongues so twisted so they got this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.600 
tongues so twisted so they got this
group<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.710> volunteers<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.250> they<00:00:47.340> give<00:00:47.460> them<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
group of volunteers and they give them a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.830 
group of volunteers and they give them a
whole<00:00:47.730> list<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.059> these<00:00:48.180> classic<00:00:48.660> tongue

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
whole list of these classic tongue

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
whole list of these classic tongue
twisters<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.320> recorded<00:00:49.980> them<00:00:50.129> trying<00:00:50.520> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
twisters and recorded them trying to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.369 
twisters and recorded them trying to
read<00:00:50.969> them<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.300> they<00:00:51.449> isolated<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.170> most

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
read them and they isolated the most

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
read them and they isolated the most
common<00:00:52.739> pronunciation<00:00:52.890> errors<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.789> an<00:00:53.940> effort

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
common pronunciation errors in an effort

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.869 
common pronunciation errors in an effort
to<00:00:54.420> start<00:00:54.690> tracing<00:00:55.079> back<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.070> cause<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.699> our

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
to start tracing back the cause of our

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.729 
to start tracing back the cause of our
brain<00:00:57.210> mouth<00:00:57.449> confusion<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.289> toyboat

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
brain mouth confusion so do toyboat

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.200 
brain mouth confusion so do toyboat
again<00:00:58.980> okay<00:00:59.340> toyboat<00:00:59.699> toyboat<00:00:59.730> toyboat

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
cop so the sounds are blending together

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.080 
cop so the sounds are blending together
and<00:01:10.500> you're<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.130> sounding<00:01:11.460> crazy<00:01:11.640> yes

and there's always some blending but
there's<00:01:14.010> also<00:01:14.189> always<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.790> space<00:01:15.030> well

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
there's also always some space well

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.539 
there's also always some space well
sometimes<00:01:15.869> right<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.590> varies<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.400> either

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
sometimes right and it varies you either

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.010 
sometimes right and it varies you either
crush<00:01:17.850> them<00:01:18.090> or<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.240> space<00:01:18.509> them<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.810> right

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
crush them or you space them out right

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
crush them or you space them out right
and<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.320> happens<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.770> both<00:01:19.920> short<00:01:20.280> word

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and that happens in both short word

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.999 
and that happens in both short word
twisters<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.210> longer<00:01:21.900> phrase<00:01:22.140> more<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
twisters and longer phrase more like the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.219 
twisters and longer phrase more like the
six<00:01:23.340> six<00:01:24.210> six<00:01:25.020> six<00:01:25.890> ships<00:01:26.310> eek<00:01:26.610> six<00:01:27.229> exactly

six six six six ships eek six exactly
what<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.470> gonna<00:01:28.590> say<00:01:28.710> that's<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.189> Suzy<00:01:29.610> sits

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
what I was gonna say that's or Suzy sits

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.700 
what I was gonna say that's or Suzy sits
in<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.090> shoeshine<00:01:30.570> shop<00:01:30.630> where<00:01:31.140> she<00:01:31.170> shit's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
in a shoeshine shop where she shit's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.330 
in a shoeshine shop where she shit's
where<00:01:32.040> she<00:01:32.220> sits<00:01:32.790> shines<00:01:33.450> where<00:01:34.320> she<00:01:34.560> shot<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
where she sits shines where she shot and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.960 
where she sits shines where she shot and
so<00:01:35.610> she<00:01:36.119> says<00:01:37.280> okay<00:01:38.280> we're<00:01:38.460> really<00:01:38.610> bad<00:01:38.820> at
