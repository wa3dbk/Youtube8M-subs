00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 and help youtube friends that's why 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.029
 teach to touch I ask you please 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 jaguars good originally 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.230
 song is by juan gabriel but it's a 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.340
 adaptation jaguars and I liked it 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.440
 How much was left 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.570
 This song is simple and is suitable for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.520
 beginners already know that it is better than 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.500
 go to christian bale dotcom here 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.710
 down in the description so they can 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.050
 watch the video demo the lyrics and so 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.840
 learn to perfection so well 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.510
 let's start perfect tuning 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.320
 standard of the guitar starts with a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.320
 small intro 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.090
 it is very simple 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.280
 nothing we put you in your fingers and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:49.640
 we started down we remove we put 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.420
 finger and martÃ­ masters with the little boy 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.420
 and remove again 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.910
 that there is slower 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.660
 i 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.670
 and then let's start with the rhythm 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.220
 which is for the whole song does not have 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.070
 greater science since you are born upstairs 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.970
 down up down down up down 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.970
 down up 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.390
 so nothing more 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.380
 to the song 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.380
 up 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.950
 ok we started 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.189
 different is repeated three times 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.310
 once again 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.100
 and the harmonica part comes 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.100
 we start in sun 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.509
 king 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.750
 and the verse begins with the one with 67 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.300
 for the song we're going to use for the 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.300
 stanza my minor 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:37.270
 if less then again and less 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.810
 F sharp minor is the same rhythm that 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.810
 I taught them 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.650
 I'll do this part slowly because 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.440
 takes about rapid changes so 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.440
 they are starting we started again 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.370
 ok and there starts another stanza again 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.370
 and here in this part again with yes 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.030
 seven and he gives emphasis they can do 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.030
 down 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.930
 OK so 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.580
 in this sense 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.260
 i 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:33.800
 and there begins the chorus is simple 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.800
 also nothing else is the same me do not leave me 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:53.870
 and again now it starts as an inter 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:58.240
 check is not in the letter of the page and 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.240
 well and nothing is a part nadal occupies 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:07.699
 197 check not well with the demo video and 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.099

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.259

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.479
