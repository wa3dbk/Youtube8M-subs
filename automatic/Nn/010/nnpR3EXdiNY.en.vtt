and it's gonna add the blue it was I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.520 
and it's gonna add the blue it was I
think<00:04:35.400> like<00:04:35.490> 25<00:04:36.030> weird<00:04:36.330> or<00:04:36.660> odd<00:04:37.050> vending

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
think like 25 weird or odd vending

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.740 
think like 25 weird or odd vending
machines<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.300> they're<00:04:39.300> pretty<00:04:39.450> cool<00:04:39.600> so

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
machines and they're pretty cool so

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.790 
machines and they're pretty cool so
there's<00:04:39.840> one<00:04:40.139> that<00:04:40.260> I<00:04:40.320> think<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.650> since

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
there's one that I think it since

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.290 
there's one that I think it since
there's<00:04:41.130> two<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.490> them<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.820> can<00:04:41.880> think<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.150> off

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
there's two of them I can think of off

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.080 
there's two of them I can think of off
the<00:04:42.330> top<00:04:42.450> my<00:04:42.660> head<00:04:42.810> out<00:04:42.990> in<00:04:43.139> Japan<00:04:43.650> one<00:04:44.430> Elvis<00:04:44.850> I

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
the top my head out in Japan one Elvis I

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.060 
the top my head out in Japan one Elvis I
can't<00:04:45.270> believe<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:45.510> outcome<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:46.080> guys<00:04:46.229> such

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
can't believe I outcome that guys such

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.779 
can't believe I outcome that guys such
luck<00:04:47.389> one<00:04:48.389> of<00:04:48.479> them<00:04:48.570> is<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:49.020> sells<00:04:49.410> hairy<00:04:50.370> crabs

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
luck one of them is it sells hairy crabs

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:51.980 
luck one of them is it sells hairy crabs
I<00:04:50.970> think<00:04:51.150> that's<00:04:51.270> what<00:04:51.389> they're<00:04:51.479> called<00:04:51.750> or

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
I think that's what they're called or

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.719 
I think that's what they're called or
something<00:04:52.350> that<00:04:52.650> basically<00:04:53.039> a<00:04:53.370> vending

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
something that basically a vending

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.040 
something that basically a vending
machine<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:54.090> sells<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.419> live<00:04:54.690> crabs

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
machine that sells you live crabs

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.810 
machine that sells you live crabs
they're<00:04:55.320> cooled<00:04:55.560> about<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:55.860> think<00:04:56.100> 40<00:04:56.460> or<00:04:56.669> 30

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
they're cooled about I think 40 or 30

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.480 
they're cooled about I think 40 or 30
ish<00:04:57.060> degrees<00:04:57.450> to<00:04:58.020> keep<00:04:58.200> them<00:04:58.350> alive<00:04:58.440> but<00:04:59.100> kind

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
ish degrees to keep them alive but kind

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.159 
ish degrees to keep them alive but kind
of<00:04:59.580> like<00:04:59.789> an<00:04:59.910> in<00:05:00.120> conscious<00:05:00.780> you<00:05:01.139> know

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
of like an in conscious you know

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.409 
of like an in conscious you know
unconscious<00:05:01.919> kind<00:05:02.130> of<00:05:02.250> set<00:05:02.639> of<00:05:02.729> state<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.180> mind

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
unconscious kind of set of state of mind

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:04.520 
unconscious kind of set of state of mind
I<00:05:03.600> guess<00:05:03.750> or<00:05:03.900> whatever<00:05:04.139> you<00:05:04.200> want<00:05:04.320> to<00:05:04.380> call<00:05:04.470> it

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
their weight in their gender and they

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.490 
their weight in their gender and they
even<00:05:11.520> have<00:05:11.610> a<00:05:11.639> guarantee<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.240> if<00:05:12.389> you<00:05:12.570> buy<00:05:13.470> a
