and<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.060> crutches<00:01:32.450> I've<00:01:33.410> already<00:01:33.650> succeeded

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
and the crutches I've already succeeded

in standing with the crutches people

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.730 
in standing with the crutches people
have<00:01:38.120> asked<00:01:38.570> me<00:01:38.600> what<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.810> think<00:01:38.900> of<00:01:39.230> stem<00:01:39.530> cell

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
have asked me what I think of stem cell

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.250 
have asked me what I think of stem cell
research<00:01:40.420> before<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.540> accident<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:42.050> never

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
research before the accident I never

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260 
research before the accident I never
really<00:01:42.470> gave<00:01:42.620> it<00:01:42.680> much<00:01:42.800> thought<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:43.520> am<00:01:44.090> NOT<00:01:44.240> a

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
really gave it much thought I am NOT a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.480 
really gave it much thought I am NOT a
scientist<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.050> I'm<00:01:45.200> not<00:01:45.530> fully<00:01:45.800> educated<00:01:45.980> on

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
scientist and I'm not fully educated on

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.090 
scientist and I'm not fully educated on
this<00:01:46.640> issue<00:01:46.820> issue<00:01:47.380> but<00:01:48.380> since<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.950> accident

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
this issue issue but since the accident

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.240 
this issue issue but since the accident
I<00:01:49.520> have<00:01:49.880> reflected<00:01:50.360> on<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.810> topic<00:01:51.200> often<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.770> do

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
I have reflected on the topic often I do

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.920 
I have reflected on the topic often I do
not<00:01:52.490> support<00:01:52.850> embryonic<00:01:53.480> stem<00:01:53.690> cell<00:01:53.900> research

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
not support embryonic stem cell research

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.950 
not support embryonic stem cell research
as<00:01:54.530> I<00:01:55.040> do<00:01:55.100> understand<00:01:55.760> it<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.150> embryo<00:01:56.480> must<00:01:56.810> be

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
as I do understand it the embryo must be

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.660 
as I do understand it the embryo must be
killed<00:01:57.230> to<00:01:57.380> obtain<00:01:57.710> these<00:01:57.890> stem<00:01:58.160> cells<00:01:58.190> I

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
killed to obtain these stem cells I

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.820 
killed to obtain these stem cells I
think<00:01:59.330> it<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.480> morally<00:01:59.960> wrong<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.440> killing<00:02:00.740> of

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
think it is morally wrong the killing of
