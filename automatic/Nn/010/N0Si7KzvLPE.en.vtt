this<00:00:52.920> computer<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.460> i<00:00:53.489> built<00:00:53.730> myself<00:00:54.030> it's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this computer that i built myself it's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.630

kind<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.110> loud<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.530> doesn't<00:00:55.949> run<00:00:56.039> too<00:00:56.100> great<00:00:56.460> if

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
