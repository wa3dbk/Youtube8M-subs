00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
this enough importance of it and it's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 
this enough importance of it and it's
one<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> reasons<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.820> need<00:01:39.119> /

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
emphasizes because people just don't

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.249 
emphasizes because people just don't
think<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.490> matters<00:01:41.670> but<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> really<00:01:42.720> does<00:01:43.049> it

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
think it matters but it really does it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.889 
think it matters but it really does it
really<00:01:43.470> doesn't<00:01:43.799> matter<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.780> really<00:01:45.780> want
