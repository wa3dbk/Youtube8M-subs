00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
months ago I developed the tag leer

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.180 
months ago I developed the tag leer
guitar<00:00:45.580> it<00:00:45.879> was<00:00:46.000> my<00:00:46.150> first<00:00:46.540> true<00:00:46.960> single<00:00:47.920> coil

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
guitar it was my first true single coil

spent a lot of time developing these

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.020 
spent a lot of time developing these
pickups<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:54.250> this<00:00:54.400> guitar<00:00:54.729> would<00:00:54.879> sound

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
pickups so this guitar would sound

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.579 
pickups so this guitar would sound
killer<00:00:55.330> and<00:00:55.690> then<00:00:55.809> of<00:00:55.900> course<00:00:56.110> people<00:00:56.140> started

killer and then of course people started
ordering<00:00:56.739> them<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.159> they<00:00:57.220> want<00:00:57.549> humbuckers

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
ordering them and they want humbuckers

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.509 
ordering them and they want humbuckers
in<00:00:58.360> the<00:00:58.449> back<00:00:58.629> which<00:00:59.409> we<00:00:59.589> did<00:00:59.799> the<00:01:00.280> problem

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
in the back which we did the problem

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.430 
in the back which we did the problem
that<00:01:00.760> always<00:01:00.940> bothered<00:01:01.390> me<00:01:01.449> is<00:01:01.720> when<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.229> put

that always bothered me is when you put
a<00:01:02.470> humbucker<00:01:02.860> in<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:02.979> back<00:01:03.159> it<00:01:03.309> would<00:01:03.430> lose

your<00:01:03.760> single<00:01:04.089> coil<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:05.140> then<00:01:05.409> we<00:01:06.100> would<00:01:06.220> tap

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
your single coil and then we would tap

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.950 
your single coil and then we would tap
it<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:06.880> know<00:01:07.060> they<00:01:07.150> would<00:01:07.240> say<00:01:07.360> oh<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:07.630> want<00:01:07.810> to

to come up with a pickup where you
retain<00:01:15.189> your<00:01:15.220> single<00:01:16.060> coil<00:01:16.299> when<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.510> put<00:01:16.689> in

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
retain your single coil when you put in

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.210 
retain your single coil when you put in
a<00:01:16.869> humbucker<00:01:17.200> and<00:01:17.409> that's<00:01:17.530> what<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.799> sidekick

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
a humbucker and that's what the sidekick

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.149 
a humbucker and that's what the sidekick
does<00:01:18.460> so<00:01:19.360> basically<00:01:19.810> this<00:01:20.080> pickup<00:01:20.650> here<00:01:20.920> this

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
does so basically this pickup here this

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.910 
does so basically this pickup here this
coil<00:01:21.490> is<00:01:22.179> your<00:01:22.570> basic<00:01:23.079> part<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.409> your<00:01:23.590> three

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
coil is your basic part of your three

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
coil set with 7.2 K this coil here is

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.639 
coil set with 7.2 K this coil here is
what<00:01:27.759> we<00:01:27.850> call<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.119> sidekick<00:01:28.600> its<00:01:29.289> sole

purpose is to turn our 7.2 K single coil

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.830 
purpose is to turn our 7.2 K single coil
into<00:01:32.799> a<00:01:33.249> humbucker<00:01:33.789> and<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.450> beauty<00:01:34.749> behind

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
into a humbucker and the beauty behind

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.499 
into a humbucker and the beauty behind
it<00:01:35.200> is<00:01:35.409> it<00:01:35.679> matches<00:01:36.039> volume<00:01:36.759> when<00:01:37.179> you<00:01:37.270> switch

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
it is it matches volume when you switch

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.300 
it is it matches volume when you switch
between<00:01:37.719> single<00:01:38.350> coil<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.679> humbucker<00:01:39.100> you

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
between single coil and humbucker you

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.789 
between single coil and humbucker you
get<00:01:39.520> no<00:01:39.759> volume<00:01:40.270> drop-off<00:01:40.990> that's<00:01:41.560> really

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
get no volume drop-off that's really

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.830 
get no volume drop-off that's really
what<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.039> sidekicks<00:01:42.490> all<00:01:42.670> about<00:01:42.969> when<00:01:43.719> you

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
what the sidekicks all about when you

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.899 
what the sidekicks all about when you
switch<00:01:44.079> between<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.619> that's<00:01:45.219> a<00:01:45.310> match<00:01:45.520> volume

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
switch between it that's a match volume

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.870 
switch between it that's a match volume
set<00:01:46.179> it<00:01:46.810> makes<00:01:47.109> a<00:01:47.200> lot<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.380> sense<00:01:47.710> I've<00:01:48.219> had

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
set it makes a lot of sense I've had

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.730 
set it makes a lot of sense I've had
that<00:01:49.149> same<00:01:49.390> problem<00:01:49.450> I<00:01:49.929> used<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:50.170> own<00:01:50.319> a<00:01:50.350> guitar

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
that same problem I used to own a guitar

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.590 
that same problem I used to own a guitar
like<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:50.950> I'd<00:01:51.429> ended<00:01:51.729> up<00:01:51.819> never<00:01:52.119> using<00:01:52.240> the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
like that I'd ended up never using the

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.539 
like that I'd ended up never using the
coil<00:01:52.840> tap<00:01:53.140> because<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:53.649> volume<00:01:54.100> would<00:01:54.310> drop

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
coil tap because the volume would drop

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.520 
coil tap because the volume would drop
by<00:01:54.819> half<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.450> other<00:01:55.569> beauty<00:01:55.899> behind<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.289> is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
by half the other beauty behind it is

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.380 
by half the other beauty behind it is
it's<00:01:56.740> just<00:01:57.219> pickup<00:01:57.520> technology<00:01:58.090> there's<00:01:58.270> no
