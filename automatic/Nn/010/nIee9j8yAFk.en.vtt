drying too quickly on the face like I'm

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.210 
drying too quickly on the face like I'm
getting<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.200> back<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.770> blend<00:01:20.040> out

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
getting to go back in and blend out

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.820 
getting to go back in and blend out
pretty<00:01:20.549> easy<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.170> places<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.650> with

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
pretty easy on the places like with

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:37.260 
pretty easy on the places like with
these<00:01:22.950> other<00:01:23.189> dogs

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.940 

so<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.329> would<00:01:38.509> say<00:01:38.689> after<00:01:39.170> one<00:01:39.499> round<00:01:39.530> of

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
so I would say after one round of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.300 
so I would say after one round of
coverage<00:01:40.460> that<00:01:40.759> it's<00:01:41.619> medium<00:01:42.619> coverage<00:01:42.979> it's

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310

not covering up all my spots I'm going

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.889 
not covering up all my spots I'm going
through<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.219> breakout<00:01:46.819> right<00:01:47.119> now<00:01:47.359> so<00:01:47.689> you<00:01:47.750> can

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
through a breakout right now so you can

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.510 
through a breakout right now so you can
definitely<00:01:48.079> still<00:01:48.439> see<00:01:48.649> those<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.280> I'm<00:01:49.369> going

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
to apply a second layer and see if that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:21.480 
to apply a second layer and see if that

a stretch to me but I would say it's at
least<00:03:05.620> like<00:03:05.920> 12<00:03:06.220> hours<00:03:06.370> like<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.880> could<00:03:07.000> at

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
good when I saw my CVS I was kind of

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.270 
good when I saw my CVS I was kind of
skeptical<00:03:19.420> because<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:20.530> find<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.800> good<00:03:21.010> matte

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
skeptical because to find a good matte

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.740 
skeptical because to find a good matte
foundation<00:03:21.880> let<00:03:22.060> alone<00:03:22.210> from<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.510> drugstore

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
foundation let alone from the drugstore

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.480 
foundation let alone from the drugstore
it<00:03:23.020> seems<00:03:23.260> like<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.410> really<00:03:23.770> hard<00:03:24.010> feat<00:03:24.250> these

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
it seems like a really hard feat these

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.880 
it seems like a really hard feat these
days<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.540> one<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.470> best<00:03:26.590> one<00:03:26.800> I've

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
days and this one is the best one I've

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.970 
days and this one is the best one I've
tried<00:03:27.480> high-end<00:03:28.480> low-end<00:03:28.960> whatever<00:03:29.710> you<00:03:29.860> want

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
tried high-end low-end whatever you want

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.280 
tried high-end low-end whatever you want
to<00:03:30.040> call<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.370> this<00:03:31.090> one<00:03:31.330> wins<00:03:31.540> hand<00:03:31.840> down

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
to call it this one wins hand down

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.540 
to call it this one wins hand down
I've<00:03:32.410> never<00:03:32.770> liked<00:03:33.040> any<00:03:33.220> other<00:03:33.370> back

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
I've never liked any other back

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.610 
I've never liked any other back
foundation<00:03:34.150> from<00:03:34.270> the<00:03:34.330> drugstore<00:03:34.630> until<00:03:35.380> this

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
foundation from the drugstore until this

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.230 
foundation from the drugstore until this
one<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:36.100> think<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.520> because<00:03:36.700> it's<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:36.970> dimi

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
one I think it's because it's the dimi

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.780 
one I think it's because it's the dimi
matte<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.410> wasn't<00:03:38.740> too<00:03:38.950> matte<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.460> don't

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
matte so it wasn't too matte I don't
