one I think this is either 14 or
three-eighths<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.579> an<00:00:35.700> inch<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.320> really<00:00:38.960> this

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
three-eighths of an inch I really this

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.180 
three-eighths of an inch I really this
one<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> biggest<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.890> get<00:00:41.070> which

or faster i guess you could say and this

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
or faster i guess you could say and this
definitely<00:01:28.770> eliminates<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.640> fridge<00:01:29.820> as<00:01:30.060> well

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
because since um this is kind of like

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.310 
because since um this is kind of like
keeping<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.299> together<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.840> don't<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.200> a
