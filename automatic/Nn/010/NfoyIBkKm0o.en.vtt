isn't<00:02:32.430> an<00:02:32.670> end<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.150> before<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.170> s<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.620> it's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
isn't an end in before the s so it's

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.300 
isn't an end in before the s so it's
just<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.100> what<00:02:35.550> as<00:02:35.970> embarrassing<00:02:36.890> but<00:02:37.890> I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
just like what as embarrassing but I

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.820 
just like what as embarrassing but I
guess<00:02:38.880> there's<00:02:39.720> something<00:02:40.110> happens<00:02:40.560> people

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
guess there's something happens people

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.760 
guess there's something happens people
soon<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.640> i<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:42.080> i'll<00:02:43.080> get<00:02:43.260> over<00:02:43.290> eventually
