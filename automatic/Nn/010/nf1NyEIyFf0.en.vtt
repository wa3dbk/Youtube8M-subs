00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
today it is a log that is filled with

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.440 
today it is a log that is filled with
seeds<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.599> sides<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.670> as<00:00:11.670> alfalfa<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.360> the

center once they get through the seeds

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.390 
center once they get through the seeds
once<00:00:14.280> they<00:00:14.460> eat<00:00:14.700> through<00:00:15.260> the<00:00:16.260> sides<00:00:16.529> they<00:00:17.250> can

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
once they eat through the sides they can

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.670 
once they eat through the sides they can
actually<00:00:17.520> use<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.850> as<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> little<00:00:18.570> kind<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.050> you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
actually use it as a little kind of you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.890 
actually use it as a little kind of you
know<00:00:19.710> nesting<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.820> little<00:00:21.240> tube<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.689> hiding

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
know nesting or a little tube for hiding

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.400 
know nesting or a little tube for hiding
but<00:00:22.890> they<00:00:23.010> can't<00:00:23.910> seem<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.570> make<00:00:24.750> heads<00:00:25.260> or

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
but they can't seem to make heads or

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.839 
but they can't seem to make heads or
tails<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.890> what<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.310> yet<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.699> have

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
tails of what it is yet they have

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.490 
tails of what it is yet they have
nibbled<00:00:27.090> at<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> sides<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.109> little<00:00:28.260> bit

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
nibbled at the sides of it a little bit

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.370 
nibbled at the sides of it a little bit
but<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.369> don't<00:00:29.550> think<00:00:29.640> they<00:00:29.730> figured<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:30.380> that

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
but I don't think they figured out that

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.590 
but I don't think they figured out that
if<00:00:31.500> they<00:00:31.619> eat<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.009> size<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
if they eat the size and you know the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.930 
if they eat the size and you know the
food<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> sides<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.460> they<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.820> get

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
food on the sides that they can get

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.720 
food on the sides that they can get
inside<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:37.350> they've<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.309> been<00:00:38.460> kind<00:00:38.640> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
inside so they've just been kind of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.220 
inside so they've just been kind of
walking<00:00:38.969> around<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:39.840> actually<00:00:39.989> hoping

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
walking around it I was actually hoping

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.780 
walking around it I was actually hoping
that<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.649> would<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> video<00:00:41.280> here<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.579> them

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that we would have a video here of them

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.220 
that we would have a video here of them
kind<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.149> enjoying<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.750> well<00:00:43.620> unfortunately

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230

months<00:02:54.950> maybe<00:02:55.130> now<00:02:55.730> they're<00:02:55.880> starting<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.180> get

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
months maybe now they're starting to get

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:57.699 
months maybe now they're starting to get
set<00:02:56.540> in<00:02:56.660> their<00:02:56.780> ways<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:57.380> know<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.620> they're

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
set in their ways you know and they're

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.810 
set in their ways you know and they're
only<00:02:57.830> going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.100> like<00:02:58.250> what<00:02:58.430> they<00:02:58.549> like<00:02:58.580> and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
only going to like what they like and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.970 
only going to like what they like and
when<00:02:59.150> we<00:02:59.239> give<00:02:59.360> them<00:02:59.480> new<00:02:59.600> stuff<00:02:59.900> now<00:03:00.140> it<00:03:00.860> may

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
when we give them new stuff now it may

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.729 
when we give them new stuff now it may
be<00:03:01.040> hard<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.430> convince<00:03:01.549> them<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:01.970> even<00:03:02.180> try<00:03:02.540> it

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
be hard to convince them to even try it

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.870 
be hard to convince them to even try it
because<00:03:03.739> they're<00:03:04.070> just<00:03:04.250> like<00:03:04.370> well<00:03:04.580> where

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
because they're just like well where

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.580 
because they're just like well where
this<00:03:04.970> isn't<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.360> yogi<00:03:05.720> where<00:03:05.930> is<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.290> you<00:03:06.470> know

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
this isn't the yogi where is it you know

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.050 
this isn't the yogi where is it you know
this<00:03:06.799> isn't<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.070> veggies<00:03:07.489> that<00:03:07.519> were<00:03:07.760> used<00:03:07.940> to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
this isn't the veggies that were used to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.690 
this isn't the veggies that were used to
wear<00:03:08.330> those<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:10.130> we're<00:03:10.250> going<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.430> leave<00:03:10.580> this

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
wear those so we're going to leave this

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.740 
wear those so we're going to leave this
in<00:03:10.880> there<00:03:11.000> it's<00:03:11.090> what<00:03:11.209> did<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.420> want<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.600> leave

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
in there it's what did you want to leave

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.690 
in there it's what did you want to leave
it<00:03:11.840> in<00:03:11.900> there<00:03:11.989> for<00:03:12.049> long<00:03:12.260> term<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.890> see<00:03:13.580> if

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
it in there for long term and see if

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.039 
it in there for long term and see if
they<00:03:13.820> nibble<00:03:14.120> at<00:03:14.269> it<00:03:14.450> if<00:03:14.570> they<00:03:14.660> ever<00:03:14.750> figure

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
they nibble at it if they ever figure

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.870 
they nibble at it if they ever figure
out<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.590> can<00:03:15.769> eat<00:03:15.799> through<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.430> that's

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
out that you can eat through it that's

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.640 
out that you can eat through it that's
