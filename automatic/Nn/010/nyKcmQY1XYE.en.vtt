00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.490
 gadget company philips me 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.320
 provided 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 A blender called Filip sleeps . 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.509
 I was recently at the presentation of this 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.089
 gadget 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.090

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.060
 pluses and me today philips chased him 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.250
 live here that looked me already whole 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.650
 two boxes by the way I don't know what's in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.570
 why they are exactly 2 now open 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.119
 secrets 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.219
 we will reveal the secret and we will start them 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.780
 uncover with the opening of the barn in 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.079
 one box is shorter itself 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.320
 blender with two nozzles as I understand it 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.210
 with two nozzles not stirrup in the second 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.390
 still let's open let's see 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.379
 also drove for the company philips 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.710
 presentations when I was very me 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.100
 I liked it there is a bowl such usually with 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.140
 one knife in a blender bowl down there 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.440
 the bowl was with two knives one just above 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.489
 other cutting efficiency yet 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.040
 increased from this but on presentation 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.189
 there was a small snag that big 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.799
 pieces of meat we stuffed there this 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.270
 this container with two knives and mine 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.380
 such a soup has developed that he is not quite 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:24.479
 coped though as it turned out there that 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:28.400
 in fact, the whole thing was as follows 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.750
 that we just took this blender itself 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.200
 positive to by the way took it myself 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.380
 blender 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.380
 from the bowl such here is another blender 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.930
 the cap and therefore just didn't dock 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:47.720
 here's the part to listen to and well, great 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.720
 the blender is well made i am satisfied 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.150
 so I didn't have this 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.520
 I have a double mixer with a mixer never 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.909
 there was no life now there will not be this 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.659
 mixer so that philips can survive 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:09.159
 they will even appear more and more often 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.159
 here with two such nozzles 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.730
 two such nozzles 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.070
 still included in the standard this 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.030
 blender studies 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:32.100
 submersible by immersion part 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.100
 metal is very high quality made 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.700
 I donâ€™t know honestly the price of this 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.520
 blender if it is adequate price 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.850
 you can buy me nothing yet 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.810
 advise but in principle if the price be 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.990
 adequate in even on the advice to take on that 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:59.050
 everything looks like 100 kashka again 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.150
 I'm useful for me 100 kashka 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:09.010
 gone somewhere therefore not useful 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:13.240
 such a kit includes such a nozzle 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.310
 for mixer for mixer, listen all 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.990
 carpenter made so high quality plastic 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.819
 not some cheap really 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:32.060
 quite good we will test we will test and voila 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:35.719
 voila cup with the name of their friends friends 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.959
 Japan film Spock gave me a cup 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:41.639
 with one knife, what do you do? 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.459
 probably with two knives will be similar but 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:48.359
 they told me that two knives we 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.760
 we will give you later this cup 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.730
 with one knife you see here one knife 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.010
 and the second leg 2 is often a little higher 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.019
 one more match are well really 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.699
 it's really more convenient for them to chop 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.219
 that such a cup is big enough 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.969
 me blends with a smaller cup and very 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.760
 great that she 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:13.400
 and breathing rubberized so will 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.400
 much more comfortable working with her 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.639
 Kachek I can immediately say at first 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.370
 sight 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.610
 here it is a pen but I have already tried and 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.539
 it works really comfortably here 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.039
 adjustable speed I will show you closer 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.320
 you do not have something with one hand 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.600
 switch there it is you push and here 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.410
 you can adjust the speed with one hand 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:48.660
 rotations of everyones everyones everyones 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.639
 all sorts of things than yes and by the way in the second 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.120
 box, I already caught what are out 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:57.030

 well, by the way in the professional kitchen too 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.010

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.220

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.960
 I want to try to do this 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.720
