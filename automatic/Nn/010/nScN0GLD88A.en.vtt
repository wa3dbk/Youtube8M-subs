00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.479
 i 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:33.129
 and helps you find yourself to 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.790
 find your pasta or tranquility 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.790
 feel joy 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.350
 is what I practically feel every 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.579
 Once I go to the mountains 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.579
 a load 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.610
 the north face of the previous year were 21 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.980
 kilometers and I did not have any 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.660
 experience in what is of that world of 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.430
 the mountain 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.309
 then it cost me a lot I liked it a lot 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.010
 I arrived with the last ones and the route 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.780
 the kilometers but the level 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.379
 Equal competition was very hard and I think 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.610
 that marked me because 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.369
 Oh, I'll like it more than it brings then 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.729
 from there I started to dedicate myself a little more to 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.729
 this 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:29.829
 and I think you suffer a lot of twists 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:33.319
 and if he is not very prepared then 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:37.939
 that technical level really was very 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:41.179
 complicated but here in the country my 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.899
 career that I would like to win is 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.670
 the 80 km of analysis this year still 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.709
 I do not encourage myself, I have to be a little more 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.340
 prepared but the other year but already 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.850
 debut in that distance 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.850
 i 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.150
 and speaking internationally I think that 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.150
 like any good trailero would like 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:19.430
 and that are seven but the fight for 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.810
 train in what is the trailer is very 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.500
 hard 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.569
 and you have felt that fatigue 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.840
 then the memories in all 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.500
 places that you passed all the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.150
 kilometers that runs this before that 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.940
 all the hours all the suffering that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.970
 I already suffered it that you did not feel before 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.819
 I think it makes you have the strength to 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.459
 that you go one step further, but it is no longer 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.459
 have then that I think that 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.680
 of your mind and your heart
