00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 we say unfortunately we still have 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.959
 technical problems because we have arrived 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.940
 in progress and we are still settling the 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.460
 signal is all is well I take advantage of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.050
 the new we said and we found it 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.660
 tried the new on playstation 4 I have it 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.400
 found a bit jerky but maybe not 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.199
 the laborers are here the tune phase 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.300
 who can who can stand it has 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.010
 it really turns off however it is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.720
 remarkable that for the first time 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.710
 that I want to underline this anyway 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 what for the first time e 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.849
 assassin's creed merchandise challenge themselves 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.869
 it is playable at e3 them usually 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.149
 they always follow a table of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.980
 march very precise to the e3 reveal o 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.649
 however the ad more composed by 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.600
 villa a colonia and playable ubisoft ha 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.129
 completely changed style to looking 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.079
 to bring as much as possible to play 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.270
 playable at e3 I've seen the same 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.350
 for honor the brand new game just 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.730
 announced however only 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.110
 appreciable fact that they gave me the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.520
 imane pad by the way they told me do 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.350
 what the fuck to do that is not that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.420
 the guy told me I recommend you do 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.969
 to the lens careful the demo explodes but 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.640
 how is this difference possible between the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.039
 cleaning of this six months after launch 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.799
 five months after launch and not cleaning 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.720
 of the others I believe that yes 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.570
 was related to the fact that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.730
 two things 1 that this sin ticket 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.260
 and of course it starts from an engine on which 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.540
 they worked for four years 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.610
 unity engine that is unity three anyway 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.990
 months later the launch was already another 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.190
 game in terms of cleanliness therefore 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.710
 obviously they took the same 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.750
 engine could work without having to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.270
 spending time creating the rendering 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.710
 but only to optimize the system at 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.630
 at the same time then they repeated me 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.540
 for the umpteenth time also the pr 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.520
 Italian that the thing that created more 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 problematic unity was the component 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.630
 lauper structural sky cooperative 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.130
 work so that he could keep a 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.200
 manage the vehicle power he has 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.360
 created more problems and it is not a case that 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.729
 sinti that does not have the component that applies 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.190
 the problem being that there is a billion 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.600
 non-player characters that go 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.920
 synced simultaneously because 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.869
 obviously all the interactions of the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.100
 advantages must be identical 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.990
 within the game world there are 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.890
 a lot of data to manage and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.420
 probably the lim was not working 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.860
 infrastructure or the entrance comes to me 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.570
 think that they probably also have 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.009
 tried to keep doing something 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.709
 because I will repeat however until 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.489
 fine that the producer I interviewed 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.630
 on the occasion of the video kiss of quebec 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.370
 of aned belaunde I don't remember how 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.930
 it is called francois pelanda it seems to me 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.850
 when I asked him tell me about the 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.070
 multiplayer if he is there he doesn't 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.400
 He said there will be no in fact he did to me 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.050
 say 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.269
 actually at this stage we talk 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.800
 just the single player campaign 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.570
 actually after only a month they have 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.400
 said the multiplayer there will be no that 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.810
 makes me think they probably were 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.450
 still trying to figure out whether to issue 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.739
 a figure some kind of component of 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.760
 sure their year continues to have problems 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.380
 they said 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.540
 we cut and solve the problem 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.950
 let's say at the root 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.530
 then surely we will have to see longevity e 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.269
 all the rest certainly pop 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.799
 added something to unity must 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.930
 say it even if the missions were neither 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.390
 maximum nothing I take advantage of for 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.220
 to greet you I am sorry that it was so 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.380
 lasts but I remind you that the killers of 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.299
 in a few minutes you will find a 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.160
 report my tried on the site 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.739
 probably in the day it will also arrive 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.600
 the video preview dedicated in short 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.370
 very thorough and everything then 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.900
 waiting to be who you feel 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.580
 I said community of onidi obviously 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.260
 I was talking about the yes live of unity 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.870
 if you want there is the milk videorecensione 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.540
 and in just a few minutes antonio iodice 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.980
 we will talk about halo 5 guardians then 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.980
 thanks see you soon
