is I believe called shut down or
something<00:03:49.349> along<00:03:49.590> those<00:03:49.650> lines<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:50.790> kind<00:03:51.150> of

something along those lines you kind of

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.500 
something along those lines you kind of
get<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.510> understand<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:53.450> kind<00:03:54.450> of

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
get to understand that that is kind of

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.690 
get to understand that that is kind of
what<00:03:54.690> these<00:03:54.840> little<00:03:55.470> many<00:03:55.680> ideas<00:03:56.069> going<00:03:56.489> for

little<00:05:47.819> experiment<00:05:48.599> in<00:05:48.779> two<00:05:49.500> different

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
little experiment in two different

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.100 
little experiment in two different
tracks<00:05:50.039> one<00:05:50.520> that<00:05:50.699> is<00:05:50.819> very<00:05:51.029> short<00:05:51.360> less<00:05:51.899> than

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
tracks one that is very short less than

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.920 
tracks one that is very short less than
two<00:05:52.259> minutes<00:05:52.409> and<00:05:52.860> one<00:05:53.849> that<00:05:54.029> is<00:05:54.210> increasingly

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
two minutes and one that is increasingly

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.670 
two minutes and one that is increasingly
and<00:05:55.349> largely<00:05:56.069> a<00:05:56.669> part<00:05:57.389> of<00:05:57.539> the<00:05:57.689> final<00:05:58.080> you<00:05:58.649> know

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
and largely a part of the final you know

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.679 
and largely a part of the final you know
to<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:58.919> final<00:05:59.219> side<00:05:59.399> of<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.610> album<00:05:59.789> and<00:06:00.180> this

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:00.689 
to the final side of the album and this

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.790 
to the final side of the album and this
really<00:06:01.199> brings<00:06:01.529> it<00:06:01.800> down<00:06:02.039> you<00:06:02.939> know<00:06:03.089> this<00:06:03.360> just

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
really brings it down you know this just

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.429 
really brings it down you know this just
destroys<00:06:04.800> the<00:06:05.250> flow<00:06:05.520> now<00:06:06.149> I<00:06:06.180> understand<00:06:07.050> that

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:07.439 
destroys the flow now I understand that

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.219 
destroys the flow now I understand that
I<00:06:07.589> am<00:06:07.949> also<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:09.149> same<00:06:09.360> person<00:06:09.750> that<00:06:09.779> says<00:06:10.080> that

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
I am also the same person that says that

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.659 
I am also the same person that says that
the<00:06:10.319> last<00:06:10.500> track<00:06:10.800> is<00:06:10.949> usually<00:06:11.279> where<00:06:11.430> bands

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
the last track is usually where bands

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.209 
the last track is usually where bands
tend<00:06:11.939> to<00:06:12.120> try<00:06:12.389> something<00:06:12.960> unique<00:06:13.860> something

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
tend to try something unique something

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:16.459 
tend to try something unique something
that's<00:06:14.520> outside<00:06:14.909> of<00:06:14.969> the<00:06:15.180> box<00:06:15.419> something<00:06:16.020> that

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
that's outside of the box something that

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.869 
that's outside of the box something that
is<00:06:16.830> you<00:06:17.789> know<00:06:17.939> not<00:06:18.719> completely<00:06:19.680> what<00:06:20.129> they

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:20.879 
is you know not completely what they

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:24.469 
is you know not completely what they
typically<00:06:21.629> do<00:06:22.039> however<00:06:23.039> there's<00:06:23.550> also<00:06:23.819> the

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
typically do however there's also the

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.709 
typically do however there's also the
idea<00:06:24.839> of<00:06:25.129> finishing<00:06:26.129> with<00:06:27.029> your<00:06:27.270> best<00:06:27.479> foot

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:27.719 
idea of finishing with your best foot

forward<00:06:28.020> now<00:06:28.949> I<00:06:29.310> just<00:06:29.909> reviewed<00:06:30.180> that<00:06:30.360> Rush

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
forward now I just reviewed that Rush

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.540 
forward now I just reviewed that Rush
album<00:06:30.839> Clockwork<00:06:31.409> Angels<00:06:31.830> where<00:06:32.099> the<00:06:32.250> final

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
album Clockwork Angels where the final

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.050 
album Clockwork Angels where the final
track<00:06:32.759> the<00:06:32.940> garden<00:06:33.300> really<00:06:33.479> was<00:06:33.779> just

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
track the garden really was just

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.440 
track the garden really was just
nice<00:06:35.160> encapsulation<00:06:36.160> of<00:06:36.400> the<00:06:36.520> entire<00:06:36.850> affair

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
nice encapsulation of the entire affair

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.560 
nice encapsulation of the entire affair
and<00:06:37.690> just<00:06:38.139> work<00:06:38.620> beautifully<00:06:39.210> this<00:06:40.210> album

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
and just work beautifully this album

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.040 
and just work beautifully this album
here<00:06:40.840> not<00:06:41.830> so<00:06:42.040> much<00:06:42.250> human<00:06:42.910> augmentation

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
here not so much human augmentation

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.659 
here not so much human augmentation
actually<00:06:44.050> destroys<00:06:44.470> the<00:06:44.710> album<00:06:45.040> it<00:06:45.220> is<00:06:45.250> an

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669 
actually destroys the album it is an

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.840 
actually destroys the album it is an
album<00:06:46.060> that<00:06:46.270> is<00:06:47.220> really<00:06:48.220> going<00:06:48.370> to<00:06:48.460> be<00:06:48.580> tainted

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
album that is really going to be tainted

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.940 
album that is really going to be tainted
a<00:06:49.120> little<00:06:49.360> bit<00:06:49.480> by<00:06:49.630> this<00:06:49.690> experiment<00:06:50.440> unless

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
a little bit by this experiment unless

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.500 
a little bit by this experiment unless
of<00:06:51.130> course<00:06:51.160> there<00:06:51.580> is<00:06:51.700> a<00:06:51.910> movie<00:06:52.330> that's

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
of course there is a movie that's

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.090 
of course there is a movie that's
developed<00:06:52.870> forward<00:06:53.200> or<00:06:53.320> there's<00:06:53.800> a<00:06:53.889> little

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
developed forward or there's a little

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.480 
developed forward or there's a little
more<00:06:54.490> of<00:06:54.610> an<00:06:54.700> explanation<00:06:55.660> behind<00:06:56.110> it<00:06:56.490> and

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
more of an explanation behind it and

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.860 
more of an explanation behind it and
it's<00:06:57.760> really<00:06:58.000> just<00:06:58.120> something<00:06:58.389> where<00:06:58.630> this<00:06:58.720> is

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870 
it's really just something where this is

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.860 
it's really just something where this is
an<00:06:58.990> experiment<00:06:59.530> that<00:06:59.700> doesn't<00:07:00.700> work<00:07:00.970> on<00:07:01.240> the

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
an experiment that doesn't work on the

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.129 
an experiment that doesn't work on the
on<00:07:02.800> the<00:07:02.950> audio<00:07:03.280> landscape<00:07:04.270> on<00:07:04.450> on<00:07:04.660> the<00:07:04.840> audio

on the audio landscape on on the audio
landscape<00:07:05.620> as<00:07:05.830> opposed<00:07:06.160> to<00:07:06.340> without<00:07:06.760> the

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
necessity of visual aid so with that

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.510 
necessity of visual aid so with that
said<00:07:10.510> that<00:07:10.780> really<00:07:11.020> just<00:07:11.590> bears<00:07:12.010> down<00:07:12.310> the

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
said that really just bears down the

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.040 
said that really just bears down the
latter<00:07:12.729> part<00:07:12.970> of<00:07:13.060> the<00:07:13.150> album<00:07:13.479> and<00:07:13.570> kind<00:07:13.960> of

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
latter part of the album and kind of

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.690 
latter part of the album and kind of
leaves<00:07:14.470> you<00:07:14.650> a<00:07:14.710> little<00:07:14.919> bit<00:07:15.040> disappointed

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
leaves you a little bit disappointed

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.460 
leaves you a little bit disappointed
because<00:07:15.820> you<00:07:16.150> see<00:07:16.330> a<00:07:16.360> nine<00:07:16.630> minute<00:07:16.870> long<00:07:17.169> Fear

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470

because you see a nine minute long Fear
Factory<00:07:17.919> track<00:07:18.190> and<00:07:18.430> the<00:07:18.490> first<00:07:18.790> thing<00:07:19.060> that

Factory track and the first thing that

this<00:07:30.160> album<00:07:30.400> I<00:07:30.820> would<00:07:31.060> have<00:07:31.210> to<00:07:31.389> give<00:07:31.570> it<00:07:31.750> a

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
this album I would have to give it a

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.120 
this album I would have to give it a
solid<00:07:32.970> 7.75<00:07:33.970> maybe<00:07:34.750> ramp<00:07:35.080> that<00:07:35.260> up<00:07:35.320> to<00:07:35.620> an<00:07:35.740> 8<00:07:35.860> I

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.130 
solid 7.75 maybe ramp that up to an 8 I

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.270 
solid 7.75 maybe ramp that up to an 8 I
like<00:07:36.580> it<00:07:36.820> it<00:07:37.090> is<00:07:37.630> a<00:07:37.660> good<00:07:37.990> release<00:07:38.289> it<00:07:38.680> is

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 
like it it is a good release it is

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.640 
like it it is a good release it is
certainly<00:07:39.850> par<00:07:40.240> for<00:07:40.450> the<00:07:40.479> course<00:07:40.750> and<00:07:41.169> then

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:41.650 
certainly par for the course and then

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.150 
certainly par for the course and then
some<00:07:42.010> for<00:07:42.400> Fear<00:07:42.820> Factory<00:07:43.330> however<00:07:43.810> I<00:07:44.160> can't

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.160 
some for Fear Factory however I can't

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.440 
some for Fear Factory however I can't
ignore<00:07:45.340> the<00:07:45.580> fact<00:07:45.820> that<00:07:45.910> I<00:07:46.000> almost<00:07:46.210> feel

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.450 
ignore the fact that I almost feel

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.409 
ignore the fact that I almost feel
cheated<00:07:46.870> out<00:07:47.020> of<00:07:47.050> 11<00:07:47.470> minutes<00:07:48.150> maybe<00:07:49.150> that's
