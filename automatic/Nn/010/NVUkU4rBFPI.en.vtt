00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.890
 here so we will once again consider 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.740
 option car setting for 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.980
 Parking by the way, be careful 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.300
 if you park then consider cars 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.920
 but we left them a place to move and 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.800
 never mind 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.910
 in this case, even calls to more precisely 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.130
 signals means creating this distance already 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.170
 and for parking and we are talking about 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.050
 parallel parking we begin movement 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.680
 and now consider what is needed 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:43.890
 take into account during the correct setting 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:48.829
 in the triangle of the window left rear chips 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.539
 either corner of the car we are moving with you 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.530
 did suppose not eat up 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.750
 did not perform the statement means friends 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.350
 my not enough space 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.360
 then for parking usually cars 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.280
 stand a short distance and there 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:13.260
 saw ahead now we'll take a look 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.260
 go to the second extreme period leg 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:23.090
 you and I did not take into account the statement and drove 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.090
 for the triangle went on all 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.540
 check so here we are 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:33.860
 violating your correct action 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.870
 consider what happens release 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.700
 brake pedal 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.810
 we start to park with you and in 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.880
 time of arrival 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.030
 see that there were no cars and here 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.330
 we have almost done everything during the race 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.160
 my friends, we risk 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:04.190
 touch the corner of the car while driving 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.020
 and now you're lying to a class so as not to hurt 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.930
 all the same 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:15.410
 come out of this position and with you 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.910
 stop here, remove the transfer 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.270
 stay on the desk and now we are on them 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.160
 open the technique again and try 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:31.310
 proper 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:34.060
 consider a parking pocket does not 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.060
 doest 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:43.450
 won't give us the opportunity to park 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:48.930
 places a little moving back in time 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:53.459
 maneuver the right corner of your car 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.459
 that's actually the left corner 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.090
 here we emphasize just two 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.720
 extremes and occupy a middle ground not 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.230
 exclude the car stop exactly 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:13.060
 specifically 2 chips she needs 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.989
 be sure to consider means if we 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.910
 stopped and parked your car 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.350
 mean wheels 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.099
 you can unscrew right there by the way 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:28.540
 many do so no one forbids 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:30.940
 but you still have to touch because we 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.420
 if not twisted and did not change direction 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.239
 sink as well and come out is it worth the extra 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:42.180
 just twist the steering wheel and strain in any 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:48.459
 mechanism can be for aesthetics it and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:53.739
 I need it but I think it makes no sense therefore 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.640
 turn on the transfer leave the wheel in volume 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.560
 same position 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.480
 make sure no cars are starting 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.590
 movement if we did not change with you 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.829
 direction during the action already on 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.090
 parking we will never touch this corner 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:12.150
 let's make a conclusion with friends 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.470
 put the car 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.410
 right on the parking and still include 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.870
 right turn in advance 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.470
 put information for drivers who 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.930
 move behind if you park 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.240
 your car according to the scheme as in school 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.360
 first we pass the stop lines forward 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.220
 now we will make a left turn 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.520
 stop line and then we move 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:47.780
 reversing setting the left corner 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:50.789
 then at this time our place may be 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.680
 busy in vivo therefore 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:58.380
 we are our students company auto forward 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.520
 learning next skip counter 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.800
 car we learn as follows 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.900
 turn on the turn signal in advance and not 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.770
 driving far but teachers 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.770
 straight motion 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.629
 friends we are a company she that roll 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.629
 .
