 the importance of a healthy breakfast 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.299
 particularly for children since 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.460
 provides the energy they need to 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.290
 start the day for this reason is 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.630
 important that breakfast is complete 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.610
 and contain proteins and vegetables today 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.200

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.790

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.870
 No breakfast is complete 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.000
 without shell roig so we will use a 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.649
 spoonful to sauté the vegetables 8 of 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.749
 every 10 children think that the vegetables 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.370
 made with triples are delicious and 

00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:40.429
 I assure you that your children will not be the 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.829
 exception we will also need a 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:46.219
 medium green zucchini a red bell pepper 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.899
 red a quarter cup of onion 2 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.339
 tablespoons of cilantro 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.280
 an eighth of a teaspoon of pepper 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.499
 black 2 tablespoons water and 4 eggs 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.659
 the vegetables must be chopped 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:58.699
 thin strips how are you 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.070
 this style of cutting vegetables like this 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.780
 Julian calls 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.489
 how vegetables are not squares 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.350
 They can be difficult to cut in 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.600
 these thin bands but I'm going to 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.220
 teach a trick and I like to cut him 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.470
 the sides to the vegetables until 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.000
 are rectangular and then it is more 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.820
 easy to cut them into rectangles more 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.670
 small melts in a pan of 12 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.420
 inches half a spoonful of tips 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.850
 They contain 70% less saturated fat and 30% 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.400
 less calories than butter the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.050
 we leave over medium-high heat and now we're going 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.900
 to fry the vegetables until they are 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.640
 soft about 10 minutes and then we add 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.979
 the cilantro and the garlic to give them a 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.570
 touch of more flavor now we beat the 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.090
 eggs together with water and pepper 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.649
 so that the eggs are fluffed is 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.700
 important to beat the eggs until 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.720
 foam or use the electric mixer 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.659
 we melted another half tablespoon of 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.609
 country crock in the same pan 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.649
 we add the egg mixture and cook 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.509
 at medium-high heat for six minutes 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.549
 lifting the edges with a spatula 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.230
 and the day of the pan so that the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.510
 Whole mixture is cooked 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.370
 to finish add the vegetables to 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.250
 center of the eggs folding the sides 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.380
 inwards to cover them we cover the 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.850
 pan and cook over low heat about 4 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.370
 minutes until the games are 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.230
 firm we serve our men full 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.940
