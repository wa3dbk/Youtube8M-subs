going<00:00:14.920> to<00:00:15.070> a<00:00:15.250> quick<00:00:15.869> recap<00:00:16.869> on<00:00:17.140> what<00:00:17.170> do<00:00:17.950> the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
going to a quick recap on what do the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.519 
going to a quick recap on what do the
beta<00:00:18.310> so<00:00:18.820> let's<00:00:18.970> get<00:00:19.270> into<00:00:19.330> it<00:00:22.380> some<00:00:23.380> of<00:00:23.470> the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:23.529 
beta so let's get into it some of the

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:24.900 
beta so let's get into it some of the
things<00:00:23.710> that<00:00:23.770> are<00:00:24.010> due<00:00:24.160> is<00:00:24.340> that<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.640> trees

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
things that are due is that the trees

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.590 
things that are due is that the trees
are<00:00:24.939> decay<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:27.610> side<00:00:27.910> server<00:00:28.150> inventory

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
are decay and the side server inventory

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.779 
are decay and the side server inventory
so<00:00:29.500> that<00:00:29.590> means<00:00:29.800> you<00:00:29.949> can<00:00:30.100> know<00:00:30.220> if<00:00:30.490> you<00:00:30.610> have<00:00:30.730> a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
so that means you can know if you have a

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.790 
so that means you can know if you have a
ride<00:00:31.150> them<00:00:31.330> it<00:00:31.660> means<00:00:31.840> you<00:00:31.960> can<00:00:32.110> see<00:00:32.320> what<00:00:32.500> item

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
ride them it means you can see what item

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.229 
ride them it means you can see what item
is<00:00:32.890> so<00:00:33.190> if<00:00:33.250> it's<00:00:33.370> like<00:00:33.460> coal<00:00:33.730> you<00:00:34.000> hover<00:00:34.150> over
