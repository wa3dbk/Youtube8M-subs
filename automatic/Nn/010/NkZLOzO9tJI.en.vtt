00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.750
 if you want to give the best treatment 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.309
 for your motorcycle needs to stay 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.710
 aware of these details 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.610
 after all, the bike is a heritage that deserves 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.230
 all the necessary attention now so 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.570
 important when carrying out 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.779
 preventive maintenance and use the 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.730
 genuine parts round because only they 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.550
 guarantees the durability and 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.519
 security that you will make round deserve 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.470
 it's true the original pieces are waves are 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.809
 developed to meet the most 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.120
 rigid quality standards by offering 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.040
 an excellent value for money 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.830
 use parts of doubtful origin 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.110
 can pose a great risk even if 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.930
 seemingly simple items can 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.740
 the motorcyclist and the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.140
 your family 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.210
 see this example the brake lever 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.830
 front is the item that has large 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.020
 importance for safety 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.180
 know why parts offered in the market 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.670
 parallel may even appear to 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.329
 similar to the original steals but not 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.190
 are 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.199
 even small variations in size 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.119
 this component may cause the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.799
 braking of the front brake 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.619
 cause an accident 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.240
 and worse if they fall to pieces 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.319
 poor quality may break 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.340
 easily offering great risk 

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:21.039
 definitely an example that the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.579
 cheap goes out very expensive 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.340
 but the round is different 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:29.530
 the cheap comes out cheap even you knew it 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.060
 the average price difference of the parts 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.369
 genuine round with regard to 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.479
 marketed in the parallel market is 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.240
 very small 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.399
 already the quality and durability are courses 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.709
 since the quality of a 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.139
 original piece the wave is guaranteed 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.259
 and this factor is directly linked to 

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:50.380
 items such as your security for example 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.539
 it's worth risking there's one more thing 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.630
 in addition to the original parts, ong offers 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.609
 also the line of genuine parts 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.009
 ramp calls are parts produced by 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:01.959
 approved suppliers for the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.599
 replacement market with the rigid 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.790
 round quality control offered to the 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:09.090
 excellent customer 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.430
 of cost benefit knew that the prices 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.920
 of the female round pieces are not much 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.480
 different from those of dubious quality and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.480
 some even cost a lot less
