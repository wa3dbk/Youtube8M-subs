00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.650
 hello recruit welcome a week 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.650
 to me 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.650
 As I am a pro gamer I said doubts 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.380
 existential that the league of 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.180
 legends a little detail if you're not 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.770
 fan the league of legends 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.810
 you will not know much about the 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.610
 things but good more or less if you do not 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.680
 you catch it then give it to the aek and lose them and 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.510
 nothing 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 if in Libya it is flying because it 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.670
 affect the damage of killing area or the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.220
 effect of morgana area or roots 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.780
 what will the experts say is 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.489
 because the puddle of morgana has 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.290
 ammonia what 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.750
 why big bleep has affected me 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.980
 by the thymus poison what happens that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.110
 eat the paint 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.910
 schillings in the blind because he had 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.710
 affected by the thymus stick or the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.809
 Petrifying look of Cassiopeia and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.760
 talking about petrifying looks do not say 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.070
 nothing about gallium mancipe because it is that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.659
 they are already stone the same happens with the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.659
 mute with zone 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.510
 abraham because it affects him to turn on if 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.640
 this fact of fire these good collides 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.970
 because it grows the same if you eat a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.770
 child that you do that is so it happens that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.360
 inside is like the backpack of ace 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.760
 we take out the bottle of water and it has 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.920
 spaces to put a bicycle another 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.900
 about crashing when he swells from eating and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.630
 giant giant giants are set and they 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.010
 gets in the grass is not seen but if the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.690
 grass reaches his ankles 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.280
 another thing that is the same as pokÃ©mon 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.310
 when you are in the grass that is a 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.970
 cuadradito well the pizzas put an entity to 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 be hidden the boots that happens that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.710
 accelerate the engine of the helicopter 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.360
 cut is actually because corquin not 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.860
 goes flying is like the car of the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.580
 Flintstones that underneath 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.400
 legs of the objects could have three 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.350
 swords two centers of I do not know what but I 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.420
 I keep attacking with my sister afraid but 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.770
 as with this that which is thus loaded in 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.870
 White 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.300
 another object the spiked armor that 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.940
 happens that if you attack with a total of one 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.820
 magic ball an arrow or a gear or 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.979
 of the clock hurts you here in reality 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.200
 it's not like it's spiked, it's that it gives you 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.150
