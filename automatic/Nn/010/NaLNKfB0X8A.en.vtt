bitch<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.579> if<00:01:50.820> somebody<00:01:50.850> wanted<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
bitch at you but if somebody wanted to

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.090 
bitch at you but if somebody wanted to
talk<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.170> they'd<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.560> write<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.860> for

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
talk to you they'd have to write it for

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.010 
talk to you they'd have to write it for
you<00:01:53.130> or<00:01:53.460> again<00:01:53.850> if<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:54.540> knew<00:01:54.720> sign<00:01:54.990> language

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
you or again if they knew sign language

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.959 
you or again if they knew sign language
they<00:01:55.470> would<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.520> so

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
they would have to do that to you so

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.550 
they would have to do that to you so
these<00:01:57.090> two<00:01:57.329> things<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.380> crazy

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
these two things are really really crazy

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.350 
these two things are really really crazy
to<00:01:58.799> think<00:01:58.829> about<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.460> one<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.240> you

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to think about if one of them you

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.030 
to think about if one of them you
couldn't<00:02:00.570> really<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:01.020> without<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.530> every<00:02:01.829> day

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
couldn't really do without on every day

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
couldn't really do without on every day
but<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.909> honestly<00:02:03.329> had<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.659> choose<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.229> I

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
but if I honestly had to choose one I

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.109 
but if I honestly had to choose one I
would<00:02:04.469> probably<00:02:04.799> rather<00:02:05.189> not<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.790> able<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
would probably rather not be able to

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.479 
would probably rather not be able to
hear<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.229> feel<00:02:07.530> speaking<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> little

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
hear because I feel speaking is a little

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.520 
hear because I feel speaking is a little
bit<00:02:08.580> more<00:02:08.700> powerful<00:02:09.300> than<00:02:09.479> hearing<00:02:09.929> because

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
bit more powerful than hearing because

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.140 
bit more powerful than hearing because
if<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.860> speak<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.520> voice<00:02:11.879> for

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
if you speak you have a voice for

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.350 
if you speak you have a voice for
yourself

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
yourself

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.090 
yourself
like<00:02:13.450> for<00:02:13.660> example<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.110> could<00:02:14.290> do<00:02:14.440> youtube<00:02:14.890> if

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
like for example you could do youtube if

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.770 
like for example you could do youtube if
you<00:02:15.220> have<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> voice<00:02:15.880> people<00:02:16.150> who<00:02:16.360> could<00:02:16.540> listen

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
you have a voice people who could listen

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.530 
you have a voice people who could listen
to<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.320> although<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:17.980> can<00:02:18.280> hear<00:02:18.760> what<00:02:19.360> you're

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
people could listen to that and plus if

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.740 
people could listen to that and plus if
you<00:02:24.610> have<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.820> girlfriend<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.450> don't<00:02:25.480> gotta
