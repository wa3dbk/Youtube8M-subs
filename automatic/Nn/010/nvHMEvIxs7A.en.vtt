 hello my loves welcome back to 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.879

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.949
 a request from someone and thank you very much 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.720
 by request the video will be treated 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:20.240
 how I apply what the blogs 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.340
 area where the blog should go and for 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.350
 course the brush everything I should use 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.600
 to apply the blush process ok 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.390
 I'm also going to show you what kind 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.280
 of rumors go according to the tone of 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.260
 skin that they have do not miss the video 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.559
 so they can see step by step how I 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.149
 I do now I'm going to show you four 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.429
 brushes that are the four favorites that 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.569
 I have and these four can use them 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:43.969
 to apply your blog 

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:46.550
 ok we are going to start with the number 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.899
 one that this is my favorite of all the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.309
 most favorite of all because they are all 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.510
 my favorites but is the favorite of 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.659
 all ok 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.569
 this is if you can see it is finite and 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.539
 It's like the little tip like that and this is from 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:01.940
 mac 116 for the reason that I like is 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.920
 very much is because if I eat the tip 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.830
 I can only pick up a little bit of 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.260
 product and it helps me to make it more 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.400
 defined in the area where he applied me only 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.220
 That 's why my favorite is good 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.070
 and now we will continue with the other is 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:23.380
 it's an angular brush if you can see 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.920
 it's like this and this is sigma's the f40 ok 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.320
 and I like it too but this one tends 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.100
 to grab a little more product by 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.770
 that's my favorite number 2 because and 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.810
 it looks like this 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.780
 and also this easy to explain because 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.299
 is made angular and already has the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.170
 figure from where one can apply the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.770
 Blog 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.929
 let's continue now for this then 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.240
 This is can be used for powder is 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.490
 good in itself is for dust but as no 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.530
 it's so big you can use it for the blog 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.969
 I also use it for the glory sometimes 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.479
 when some of my brushes are 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.729
 dirty use this is 30 sigma and 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.170
 this one also has to grab a 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.880
 little more of product but not what 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.310
 it only takes with the part of 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.259
 up a little bit in the center and so on 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.269
 after this I like it because it smokes 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.870
 well the product or does not apply it and what 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:20.220
 it disappears and they are super super cute ok and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.640
 I told you these efe 30 sigma ok 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.980
 let's continue for the last one is to 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.079
 my face like it's not my face to be a little 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.540
 fine I do not need a brush so 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.840
 great but this time is to make sure 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.810
 that distributes it well the blush use this 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.110
 and distributed it super super well to this 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.060
 make sure it looks good 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.240
 like the way I want it to 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.500

 ok it looks like this and it looks super cute 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.260
 people who have skin color like this 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.220
 like mine although I 'm also going to 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.560

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.210
 since also this other 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.580
 This is being more for night 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.800
 because it has a little bit of good brightness 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.780

 cheek this bad I use it more at night 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.510
 okay 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.250
 something that they take into account if their color of 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.980
 skin is a little color of dark skin or 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.960
 Triguena try to use this blog is that 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.230
 be rumors that are a light color 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.600
 to highlight their energy though 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.250
 never go for dark colors 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.320
 because what they want is to focus more on their 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.240
 measure and that you see that that 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.920
 little color so nice do not try to use 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.840
 this little clear color now I 'm going to 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.630
 explain step by step how they should 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.830
 apply was replaced his blush and the 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.930
 take advantage of what they can use to 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.490
 apply it now I'm going to show you how 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.410
 must apply the blog on the blush 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.300
 always remember that they have to 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.940
 Apply it under the bone if 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.160
 they only touch something success that here the 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.430
 Bone of the cheek and the blog should go 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.139
 under the little bone ok I'm just going to apply 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.830
 in the following way 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:43.000
 and there's a suntan lotion of mine here 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.850
 down I'm just going to apply the blog 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.350
 I put my face like this to know where I should 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.350
 put it so that it becomes definite 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.950
 I apply it that way and now that it's applied 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.900
 so it does not look like this 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.900
 I'm going to blur it 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:12.759
 ok and when I'm sure it's the 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:15.710
 amount that I want if I want it to look 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.630
 stronger I will apply more but 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.990
 for this look 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.700
 I just want it to look like that ok 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.330
