 subscribe to your channel the materials that 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.900
 we will need for this craft 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:34.110
 they will be black paper a sheet of paper 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.230
 Recycled dark green cellophane paper or 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.940
 clear scissors a standard punch 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.530

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.020
 compass silicone and sol in silicone a league 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.360
 a piece of green card and the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.340
 sweet that you want now let's see 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 the procedure the first thing we will do 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.750
 will be take our sheet of paper and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.000
 we will do the fold shown in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.180
 camera is something very simple after 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.510
 We will cut the remainder unfold 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.320
 our paper and we will have a square 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.210
 now we will extend our cellophane paper 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.210
 we will place the square of paper on top 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.580
 and we will cut a square of paper 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.330
 cellophane a little bigger than that of the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.790
 sheet of paper 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.100
 this to give us an idea and not have to 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.900
 mark on the same cellophane paper and 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.900
 after some work costs 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.600
 we will put our square and 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.549
 we will place the candy in this case I 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.350
 I ran out of candy so I'll use 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.689
 stuffed pillows to simulate 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.159
 but you are going to put the amount 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.890
 of sweets that they want 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.679
 we will join all the tips and roll up 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.590
 'We have so that we have a kind 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.640
 as a small trout in the part of 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.619
 up that we will now proceed to 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.700
 hold it with a small garter or if not 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.700
 with adhesive tape 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.310
 once this subject basically already 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.220
 we have what is the head of our 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.069
 witch now we will take our rule and the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.410
 compass and we will open the compass to four 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.870
 centimeters now we want our 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.269
 black cardboard and we will draw a circle 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.840
 the circle will be 8 centimeters 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.670
 in diameter and we will also mark a 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.670
 square of 11 x 11 centimeters 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.400
 once it's all marked we're going to 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.400
 trim 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.780
 well I have trimmed we will take 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.830
 our square of 11 x 11 and we will do 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.590
 a kind of cone this will be the part 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.110
 Over the shoulder of our witch 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.660
 once we have the width of which 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.000
 we want the cone we are going to stick it with 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.280
 silicon and now we will cut to the surplus 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.280
 you will decide how high you want it 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.870
 ah 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.959
 now we will take our circle and more or 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.660
 least we will fold it in half and 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.849
 more or less in the center we will make a 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.120
 drilling selection of good fit 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.120
 A) Yes 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.920
 this way we will have more or less our 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.860
 hat is not yet time to paste it 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.349
 well now we will take our sachet 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.450
 sweet and we will face this as 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.870
 trunk that is on top 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.959
 through the hole of our circle one 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.180
 Once it is well inserted, we can 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.680
 give a little bit of shape now or not your 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.050
 silicone we're going to stick our with a 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.900
 cardboard to finish making the 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.970
 hat basically the general form already 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.160
 is ready but now with our 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.220
 perforadora and black cardboard we will do 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.519
 two holes and we will stick them on 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.959
 one side of our candy bag 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.150
 this to simulate the eyes of our 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.950
 witch once it's stuck 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.410
 we will cut one in the form of analysis in 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.260
 our green card and we will draw 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.140
 as a kind of wart and it's the 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.300
 we will stick in the middle of both eyes this 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.450
 to give it a little more 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.569
 characterization 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.940
 and well so we will be able to add 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.160
 a little eyelash in this case 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.840
 hat I add a little bit of 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.900
 decoration and thus we will remain 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.480
