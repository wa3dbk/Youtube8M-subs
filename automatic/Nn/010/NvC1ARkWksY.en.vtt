00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
interested in what if that something is

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.040 
interested in what if that something is
perhaps<00:01:44.310> being<00:01:44.640> lost<00:01:44.940> that<00:01:45.330> in<00:01:45.539> 200<00:01:46.020> years

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
they'll they'll look back and think that

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.300 
they'll they'll look back and think that
should<00:01:47.789> have<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> protective<00:01:49.020> thing<00:01:49.310> is

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
should have be a protective thing is

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
should have be a protective thing is
that<00:01:50.580> that's<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.850> lot<00:01:50.970> lighting<00:01:51.240> control<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:52.080> a

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that that's a lot lighting control was a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.820 
that that's a lot lighting control was a
mixer<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:52.619> something<00:01:52.979> like<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.479> wow<00:01:54.830> this

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
mixer or something like that wow this

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.640 
mixer or something like that wow this
could<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.520> been<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.570> commander<00:01:58.409> here

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.260 

so<00:02:01.650> would<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:02.130> been<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.430> DJ<00:02:02.850> booth<00:02:03.030> or

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
something up there it seems unlike that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.440 
something up there it seems unlike that
it<00:02:05.700> seemed<00:02:05.820> more<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.180> people<00:02:06.360> would

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it seemed more like that people would

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
is the people that come to it rather

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.420

than the building that contains it very

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.830 
than the building that contains it very
hard<00:02:50.579> to<00:02:50.670> get<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> feel<00:02:51.120> for<00:02:51.360> what<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.540> was<00:02:51.630> like

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
hard to get a feel for what it was like

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.509 
hard to get a feel for what it was like
in<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.290> weird<00:02:52.470> way<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.709> remove<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.190> people

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
in a weird way you remove the people

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.740 
in a weird way you remove the people
from<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.790> that's<00:02:53.880> i<00:02:54.030> suppose<00:02:54.239> what<00:02:54.269> clubbing

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
from it that's i suppose what clubbing

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.810 
from it that's i suppose what clubbing
is<00:02:54.810> ultimately<00:02:55.230> about<00:02:55.350> if<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.250> compared<00:02:56.669> to

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
is ultimately about if you compared to

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.650 
is ultimately about if you compared to
if<00:02:56.880> we<00:02:57.000> were<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.150> an<00:02:57.269> empty

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
if we were in an empty

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.050 
if we were in an empty
museum<00:02:58.080> yeah<00:02:58.560> absolutely<00:02:59.100> shouldn't<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.940> will

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
museum yeah absolutely shouldn't it will

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.380 
museum yeah absolutely shouldn't it will
still<00:03:00.330> feel<00:03:00.780> like<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.350> same<00:03:01.620> thing<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
still feel like the same thing the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.610 
still feel like the same thing the
architecture<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.230> head<00:03:04.440> nism<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:05.460> actually

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
architecture of head nism is actually

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.530 
architecture of head nism is actually
shabby<00:03:07.620> for<00:03:07.920> walls<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.490> then<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.940> yeah<00:03:09.210> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
shabby for walls and then it is yeah the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.820 
shabby for walls and then it is yeah the
rest<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.840> architecture<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.320> head<00:03:10.470> nism<00:03:10.740> is

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
rest of the architecture of head nism is

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.280 
rest of the architecture of head nism is
largely<00:03:11.160> inside<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.150> headless<00:03:12.480> brain<00:03:12.900> isn't

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
largely inside the headless brain isn't

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.660 
largely inside the headless brain isn't
it<00:03:14.720> it's<00:03:15.720> hard<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.020> place<00:03:16.380> it's<00:03:17.220> really<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.520> said

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
it it's hard to place it's really I said

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.570 
it it's hard to place it's really I said
there's<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.120> pair<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.600> Underpants<00:03:19.410> her<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:20.520> you

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
there's a pair of Underpants her so you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.310 
there's a pair of Underpants her so you
did<00:03:20.730> closing<00:03:21.120> pi<00:03:21.300> ii<00:03:23.840> just<00:03:24.840> filled<00:03:25.200> with

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
did closing pi ii just filled with

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.280 
did closing pi ii just filled with
another<00:03:25.680> side<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.130> north<00:03:26.280> off<00:03:26.630> in<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.750> wig<00:03:27.960> and

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
another side the north off in a wig and

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.500 
another side the north off in a wig and
as<00:03:28.800> VIP<00:03:29.100> wristbands<00:03:29.730> hey<00:03:29.790> look<00:03:29.970> at<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.090> I

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
as VIP wristbands hey look at that I

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.330 
as VIP wristbands hey look at that I
think<00:03:31.140> aspects<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.590> bodies<00:03:31.860> are<00:03:31.980> totally

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
think aspects of bodies are totally

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.800 
think aspects of bodies are totally
