um<00:00:06.740> I<00:00:08.750> is<00:00:09.750> about<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.170> blending<00:00:10.650> in<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.460> front

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
um I is about the blending in the front

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.299 
um I is about the blending in the front
of<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.849> hair<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.389> used<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.500> different<00:00:13.740> method<00:00:13.980> of

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
of the hair I used a different method of

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.310 
of the hair I used a different method of
blending<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.030> think<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.509> one<00:00:15.750> works<00:00:15.929> a

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
blending and I think this one works a

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.189 
blending and I think this one works a
little<00:00:16.740> bit<00:00:16.980> much<00:00:17.130> better<00:00:17.430> than<00:00:17.730> me<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:19.050> know
