when<00:04:50.500> they<00:04:50.560> split<00:04:50.860> up<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.190> classes<00:04:51.730> let's<00:04:52.390> see

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
when they split up the classes let's see

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.750 
when they split up the classes let's see
I<00:04:52.990> heard<00:04:53.470> they<00:04:53.620> try<00:04:53.830> to<00:04:53.890> sort<00:04:54.160> classes<00:04:54.610> based

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
I heard they try to sort classes based

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.730 
I heard they try to sort classes based
on<00:04:55.000> average<00:04:55.360> test<00:04:55.660> scores<00:04:55.930> they<00:04:56.470> also

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
on average test scores they also

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.380 
on average test scores they also
separate<00:04:57.370> students<00:04:57.730> depending<00:04:58.060> on<00:04:58.210> who's

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
separate students depending on who's

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.690 
separate students depending on who's
related<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:58.840> who<00:04:58.960> oh<00:04:59.320> and<00:04:59.890> they<00:05:00.220> also<00:05:00.250> try<00:05:00.670> to

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
related to who oh and they also try to

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.040 
related to who oh and they also try to
put<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.000> troublemakers<00:05:01.600> in<00:05:01.630> different

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
put the troublemakers in different

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.440 
put the troublemakers in different
classes<00:05:02.280> ultimately<00:05:03.280> I<00:05:03.580> think<00:05:03.640> it<00:05:04.030> depends<00:05:04.330> on

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
classes ultimately I think it depends on

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.810 
classes ultimately I think it depends on
the<00:05:04.510> school<00:05:04.900> you're<00:05:05.080> attending<00:05:05.410> well<00:05:06.280> on<00:05:06.430> TV

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
the school you're attending well on TV

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.520 
the school you're attending well on TV
and<00:05:07.030> in<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.150> movies<00:05:07.240> they<00:05:07.900> always<00:05:07.930> put<00:05:08.410> all

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
and in the movies they always put all

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.920 
and in the movies they always put all
the<00:05:08.650> bag<00:05:08.890> kit<00:05:09.160> in<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.400> same<00:05:09.640> class<00:05:09.850> it's<00:05:10.660> more

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
the bag kit in the same class it's more

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.050 
the bag kit in the same class it's more
compelling<00:05:11.590> but<00:05:12.100> high<00:05:12.280> schools<00:05:12.610> are<00:05:12.730> supposed

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
compelling but high schools are supposed

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.280 
compelling but high schools are supposed
to<00:05:13.150> make<00:05:13.330> sure<00:05:13.510> that<00:05:13.690> everyone<00:05:13.900> who<00:05:14.110> goes

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
to make sure that everyone who goes

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.140 
to make sure that everyone who goes
there<00:05:14.560> is<00:05:14.740> at<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:15.010> same<00:05:15.190> level<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:16.000> there

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
there is at the same level so there

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.640 
there is at the same level so there
shouldn't<00:05:16.180> be<00:05:16.510> any<00:05:16.720> trouble<00:05:17.050> makers<00:05:17.530> around

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
shouldn't be any trouble makers around

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.430 
shouldn't be any trouble makers around
you<00:05:18.130> do<00:05:18.370> have<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.610> point<00:05:18.700> Yuki<00:05:19.480> is<00:05:19.810> where<00:05:20.320> you
