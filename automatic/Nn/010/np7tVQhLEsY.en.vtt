again<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.120> little<00:01:03.359> bit<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.660> wave<00:01:03.870> over

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
again just a little bit of a wave over

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.410 
again just a little bit of a wave over
the<00:01:04.799> cards<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.900> instantly<00:01:07.729> there's<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:09.000> two

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
last but not least a more wave around

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.870 
last but not least a more wave around
and<00:01:24.890> look<00:01:25.890> all<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.939> cards<00:01:27.570> are<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:28.170> sixes<00:01:28.880> now

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and look all the cards are now sixes now

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.090 
and look all the cards are now sixes now
these<00:01:30.150> are<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.360> sixes<00:01:30.900> over<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.920> mean

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
these are the sixes over here that mean

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.719 
these are the sixes over here that mean
this<00:01:32.460> must<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.000> twos<00:01:33.470> they<00:01:34.470> are<00:01:34.729> their

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
this must be the twos they are their

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.219 
this must be the twos they are their
altitudes<00:01:36.320> every<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:38.150> every<00:01:39.150> single<00:01:39.630> card<00:01:40.020> is

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
altitudes every one every single card is

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.999 
altitudes every one every single card is
twos<00:01:40.850> now<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> neat<00:01:42.869> trick<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.470> I'm

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
twos now that is a neat trick but I'm

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.580 
twos now that is a neat trick but I'm
going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.250> take<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.909> step<00:01:45.090> further<00:01:45.590> I'm

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
going to take this one step further I'm

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.139 
going to take this one step further I'm
going<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.799> try<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> make<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.310> super<00:01:47.970> neat

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
going to try to make this a super neat

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.210 
going to try to make this a super neat
trick<00:01:48.450> I'm<00:01:48.869> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> take<00:01:49.290> these<00:01:49.470> sixes<00:01:50.070> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
trick I'm going to take these sixes and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.370 
trick I'm going to take these sixes and
watch<00:01:50.790> real<00:01:51.360> closely<00:01:51.720> I'm<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> make

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
watch real closely I'm going to make

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.840 
watch real closely I'm going to make
them<00:01:52.560> disappear<00:01:56.299> well<00:01:57.299> they're<00:01:58.049> still<00:01:58.320> here

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
them disappear well they're still here

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.370 
them disappear well they're still here
but<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.119> gone<00:02:00.590> look

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
but they are gone look

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.630 
but they are gone look
every<00:02:03.010> card<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:04.420> now<00:02:04.630> gone<00:02:05.170> every<00:02:05.590> six<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.340> now

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
every card is now gone every six is now

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.660 
every card is now gone every six is now
gone<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:08.350> they've<00:02:08.619> gone<00:02:08.770> somewhere<00:02:09.039> they've

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
gone if they've gone somewhere they've

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.880 
gone if they've gone somewhere they've
gone<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.210> packet<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.869> with<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.320> twos<00:02:11.590> and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
gone to this packet in with the twos and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.890 
gone to this packet in with the twos and
if<00:02:12.370> you've<00:02:12.490> got<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.820> sixes<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.660> twos

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
if you've got the sixes and the twos

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.350 
if you've got the sixes and the twos
together<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:15.040> means<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.970> have<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.150> whole

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
together that means you have a whole

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.130 
together that means you have a whole
bunch<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.900> eight<00:02:17.140> right<00:02:17.680> here<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:19.690> trick<00:02:19.990> is
