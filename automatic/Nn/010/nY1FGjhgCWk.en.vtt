 I know so let's go here perfect not what 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.340
 we have taken but it is not the labyrinth 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.579
 I know myself being the exit so we're going to 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.230
 try a fast fast match and 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.800
 Quick 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.900
 I think I could not fucking shit 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.030

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.570

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 we are coming out I think yes I think so 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.810
 Of course, we did go perfect or 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.759
 spain to the first has not been anything 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.619
 in perfect because we are here in the 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.030
 olimpo server grace right of 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.729
 get the ip the description as 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.770
 We are always on the emerald map 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.409
 run one of my favorites but I do not know 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.640
 the bad thing about this map is that I do not know what 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.740
 that is being the labyrinth but 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.910
 Taiwan is just as bad he wants it 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.100
 saying what I said before that 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.660
 we are in a beta version that does not follow 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.670
 he has stayed exactly I think I saw him 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.430
 for the other video and I do not know I do not know if 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.880
 you know who it is but it is also and such that 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 uploaded the video we're in optics in 1.8 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.479
 You and what enjoyed friends what enjoyed enjoyed 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.280
 It's perfect that parkour as he dominated 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.580
 as he mastered it now it would be funny that 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.190
 I fell to say that is not the case 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.000
 perfect perfect perfect for 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.130
 to cover and well then what if you 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 like more if you want more to escape this me 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.340
 I think it's like the game you like 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.260
 quite on the channel I also like to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.810
 I record it a lot if you want more leave 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.500
 you like it and I've dropped it take or read 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.500
 my molars 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.690
 hello my balls perfect to see over here 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.970
 around here is enough 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.520
 perfect nonsense let's go over there 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.560
 perfect perfect perfect if we continue 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.060
 after doing we keep going first 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.470
 if I like it 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.000
 and although we give four runners or the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.330
 beasts very bad with us we are very 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.410
 Pros I always say it for Paraguay 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.020
 Very dark 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.470
 and we go seconds well for you spain well 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.750
 for you 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.220
 it's perfect here or here 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.430
 dark is this has not uploaded me the 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.370
 shine and that will make me give 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.860
 problems about not getting the brightness 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.410
 perfect it and perfect it we 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.110
 here and we equip ourselves quickly we take 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.700
 this we take the armor we put it on 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.170
 although you have told me many times that 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.360
 I put it directly from the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.180
 inventory but it does not matter and the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.350
 I need not bow to anything 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.370
 let's put this this 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.620
 this 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.810
 let's take this let's offer a 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.000
 and this arc but always leave me 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.430
 arrows I do not know why we were going to go back to 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.400
 perfect end to see where now 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.709
 around here I always fall when I go by 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.720
 here but I'll wait, I do not expect not to fall 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.940
 because it would not be to my liking to fall 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.230
 although as it seems there are four 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.730
 runners sure it's by the end 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.860
 the beast because it is very manco 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.659
 then but the equal does not matter 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.579
 but here we have one more broker that has 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.440
 reached your goal but a little late 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.379
 friend a little late 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.239
 barry with fagot is perfect right now 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.099
 I'm nervous because I want to give 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.480
 candela I want to give candela I want the 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.980
 video that they should although I believe that with 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.079
 my super parkour has already been well 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.230
 video 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.700
 you're a little cool is not very cool 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.129
 or that is the beast or is our friend the 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.970
 broker is our friend the broker does not 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:06.510
 There is problem no problem no problem look 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:12.140
 there we have the beast 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.140
 let's go for her not dad dad 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.520
 goodbye beast very good and that I like 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.569
 the firecrackers like mola bueno let's go for 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.879
 the next guys 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.409
 and well guys we are here at the worst 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:35.089
 map that could have touched me but 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.129
 I want you to see how maimed I am in 

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:39.169
 this map that is the worst map is the 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.119
 canels this map is fatal to me not what 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.849
 next but good that you do not want what 

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:46.309
 I'm a little man and I'm seeing if with the pressure 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.110
 to record it comes out to me it 's okay ok let's go 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:50.270
 this is going to start now and if you have arrived 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.159
 until this part of the video dale like 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.869
 because it does not cost anything there is that I am very 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:57.080
 heavy on this but it's that they help so much 

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:59.839
 so without further expansion we are going to 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.369
 the perfect map the first jump already 

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:03.169
 we have done this part always the 

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:05.360
 I never jump I do not like this part 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.490
 I always go here and here I do not 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.080
 like all this pair because if it fails 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.289
 in one of these parks the charge the 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:16.369
 I finish so I go around here and I go to 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:19.249
 it worth it to try it and I dropped 

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:22.039
 you have seen I am an amazing pro in 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:24.339
 this map I loved I loved this 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.339
 Map 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.940
 I love this map I love it 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:38.630
 it does not matter after those 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:42.490
 tremendous welsch let's try 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:45.669
 perfect we do not get away with ours 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.860
 perfect here around here 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.990
 I'm nervous because this map is given to me 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.490
 fatal seriously is the worst map that I 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.800
 can play in a green escape but 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.569
 I think that you see how bad it makes me look 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.710
 is even giving me wrong I think I'm going 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:02.349
 first bone is not worth this part I do not 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.630
 like nothing perfect perfect and we arrived 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.490
 in the end we have reached the end of my 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.190
 worst map 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:12.220
 that the arm of the ball 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.500
 ok cojemos this is the same chest 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.050
 spain 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.570
 we take this and this push and the 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.310
 armor over all the armor and not the 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:25.620
 I will put as you said as the 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:28.610
 put many times that is worth I think that 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:31.820
 It's the first time this map has passed me 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:36.160
 I think it's the first time 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.160
 and he's not kidding jokingly he's not kidding 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.650
 out there perfect wow wow is the first 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.930
 time and we have to wait for the beast 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.930
 by balls and we have it there 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:52.539
 I think we have thrown away the lava 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:55.509
 no no no no no infinite bow 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:58.430
 so it takes already so I'm going to do the 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:07:00.530
 technique that nobody would ever use 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.980
 let's kill the beast like the one that does not 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.980
 wants the thing 

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:10.520
 his coat of optics in this lawyer I do not know 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.650
 if you see it 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.790
 I am in tension because before it has 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.190
 come out and now it can not be different 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.890
 let's go for it that I do not 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.870
 you put more hosts I'm going to kill you and 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.800
 goodbye 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:30.620
 harder in the world than from kids 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.270
 what beast what beast what beast 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.889

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.750
 the video remember if you want more is 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:37.490
 able to beast to leave put like that 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.160
 you already know that winning is a matter of destiny 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:42.380
 on this map in this in this game mode 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.030
 I always win no no no I'm not that good 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.010
