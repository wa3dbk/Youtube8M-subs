 to start gaining muscle mass is 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.170
 necessary that you first have 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.270
 awareness of the current weight of 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.969
 measurements of each muscle and how much 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.590
 wants to increase the ideal would be to count 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.080
 with the advice of an expert

 after toning the fat but that's 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.469
 a big mistake because it is at risk 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.600
 health and later it becomes very 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.329
 difficult to mold a body with excess 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.800
 fat the ideal is that at the same time 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.859
 that a diet rich in 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.780
 carbohydrates proteins and nutrients are 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.479
 work on the muscles in which you

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.679
 more than they eat they do not get fat yet 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:00.749

 loading exercises in which they work 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.070
 your muscles and these begin to grow 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.720
 food is something that will contribute 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.910
 in weight gain 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.580
 when the routine is being carried out 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.890

 certain breaks to avoid the loss of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.570
 calories since since there is a 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.540
 correct feeding will suffice with the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.760
 muscular work to stay healthy the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.190
 carbohydrate consumption during the day 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.350

 physical resistance during 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.980
 yoghurt is recommended

 oatmeal honey vegetables rich in 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.479

 cream of wheat and whole grain 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.890
 among others 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.110
 proteins for their part are the most 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.600
 related to tissue formation 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.990
 muscle eat for example eggs 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.810

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.840
