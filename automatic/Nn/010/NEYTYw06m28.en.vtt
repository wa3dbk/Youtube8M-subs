at<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:15.830> it<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.009> very<00:01:17.159> fun<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
at all it is a very fun this is the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.550 
at all it is a very fun this is the
reason<00:01:18.360> why<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.509> think<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:18.930> need<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.229> take<00:01:19.409> out

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
reason why I think they need to take out

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.950 
reason why I think they need to take out
budget<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> give<00:01:20.340> us<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.640> many<00:01:21.180> items<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:21.720> we

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
budget and give us as many items as we

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.620 
budget and give us as many items as we
want<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.400> way<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.030> actually<00:01:24.210> build

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
want so that way we can actually build

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.570 
want so that way we can actually build
something<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.380> where<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.040> doesn't<00:01:26.280> lag

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
something like this where it doesn't lag

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.450 
something like this where it doesn't lag
and<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:26.970> things<00:01:27.270> start<00:01:27.689> lagging<00:01:28.100> then<00:01:29.100> no

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and then things start lagging then no

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
and then things start lagging then no
one<00:01:29.610> would<00:01:29.759> want<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.090> play<00:01:30.210> your<00:01:30.360> map<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.780> so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
one would want to play your map and so

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.950 
one would want to play your map and so
you<00:01:31.350> got<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.770> change<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:33.210> that's<00:01:33.659> why<00:01:33.840> I'm

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
you got to change it so that's why I'm

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
you got to change it so that's why I'm
hoping<00:01:34.229> they<00:01:34.470> will<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:34.860> Halo<00:01:35.040> 5<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.640> no

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
hoping they will do with Halo 5 just no

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.920 
hoping they will do with Halo 5 just no
budget<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.329> everything

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
