00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
anyway here's what we got to do there's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800 
anyway here's what we got to do there's
four<00:00:25.830> steps<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.580> do<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.180> die<00:00:27.300> four<00:00:27.539> times

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
four steps you do have to die four times

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.570 
four steps you do have to die four times
and<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.800> do<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.099> order<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and you have to do it in this order to
