00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
thing for the first time in the series

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.260 
thing for the first time in the series
it's<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.099> picture<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.580> picture<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:12.150> I've

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
it's like a picture in picture but I've

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.610 
it's like a picture in picture but I've
never<00:02:12.720> done<00:02:12.989> something<00:02:13.349> like

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620

just<00:02:13.739> before<00:02:13.860> I've<00:02:14.700> made<00:02:14.909> it<00:02:15.060> simulated<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.750> it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
just before I've made it simulated so it

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.809 
just before I've made it simulated so it
looks<00:02:16.049> like<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.260> TV<00:02:16.680> screen<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.549> if

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
looks like a TV screen so it's like if

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.039 
looks like a TV screen so it's like if
you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.060> remember<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.420> call<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.629> duty<00:02:18.900> black

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.039 
you can remember on call of duty black
ops<00:02:19.349> if<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.340> ever<00:02:20.370> played<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.879> xbox<00:02:21.000> 360<00:02:21.840> or

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
ops if you ever played the xbox 360 or

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.890 
ops if you ever played the xbox 360 or
the<00:02:22.110> ps3<00:02:22.620> version<00:02:23.120> they<00:02:24.120> used<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.659> a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the ps3 version they used to have a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.559 
the ps3 version they used to have a
camera<00:02:25.230> spike<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.730> looked<00:02:26.909> like<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.480> know

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
camera spike so it looked like you know

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.149 
camera spike so it looked like you know
you<00:02:27.629> can<00:02:27.810> see<00:02:27.989> like<00:02:28.230> what<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.680> camera<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.129> see

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
you can see like what the camera can see

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.800 
you can see like what the camera can see
in<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.489> top<00:02:29.640> right<00:02:29.909> corner<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.299> I<00:02:30.510> think<00:02:30.569> it

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
in the top right corner are I think it

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.640 
in the top right corner are I think it
actually<00:02:30.900> became<00:02:31.849> in<00:02:32.849> place<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.810> mini-map

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
actually became in place of the mini-map

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
minutes or so I think somebody points it

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:25.579 
minutes or so I think somebody points it
on<00:06:23.759> the<00:06:23.849> comment<00:06:24.150> section<00:06:24.479> you<00:06:25.319> know<00:06:25.409> it'll

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
stop commentators from straying off

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.930 
stop commentators from straying off
topic<00:06:27.300> to<00:06:27.810> try<00:06:28.020> it<00:06:28.080> ends<00:06:28.729> commentator<00:06:29.729> for<00:06:29.819> the

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
topic to try it ends commentator for the

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.159 
topic to try it ends commentator for the
whole<00:06:30.120> 10<00:06:30.419> minutes<00:06:30.750> or<00:06:30.810> something<00:06:30.930> like<00:06:31.110> that

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
whole 10 minutes or something like that

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.990 
whole 10 minutes or something like that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.180 
so I would agree with that and I think
