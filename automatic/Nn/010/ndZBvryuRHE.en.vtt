00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.289
 remove the plastic that I already broke 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.289

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.190

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:07.160
 extra content and upload the campaign and everything 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.220

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.090
 of control codes and there are not any 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.230
 code shown good is the first thing that 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.630
 we have here is the one on this the disc 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:26.100
 that looks pretty good in this is a 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.100
 propaganda of the season pass 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.780
 all legitimate 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.370
 here there is no code but they are 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.090
 little things like that or another QR code 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.719
 normal codes 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.630

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.220
 good control control is the 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.170
 control control the east has thus these 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.879
 little things that would be like packages like 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.250

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.940

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.030
 parent control if we compare it where 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.360
 pay for the one who is already more filthy and 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.250
 everything today here is very very 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.510
 true this is the new control I'm going 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.520

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.980
