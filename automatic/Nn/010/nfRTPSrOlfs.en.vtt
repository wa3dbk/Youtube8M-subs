as a headphone amplifier is a very
exciting<00:00:51.140> product<00:00:51.890> i<00:00:52.129> have<00:00:52.250> tried<00:00:52.610> a

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
exciting product i have tried a

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.899 
exciting product i have tried a
prototype<00:00:53.390> back<00:00:54.229> at<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.610> bristol<00:00:55.610> Santa

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
prototype back at the bristol Santa

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.149 
prototype back at the bristol Santa
vision<00:00:56.210> show<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:58.750> it<00:00:59.750> sounded<00:01:00.710> really<00:01:00.920> good

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
vision show and it sounded really good

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.829 
vision show and it sounded really good
then<00:01:01.400> but<00:01:01.699> I<00:01:01.729> was<00:01:01.970> limited<00:01:02.299> to<00:01:02.330> what<00:01:02.570> I<00:01:02.600> could

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
then but I was limited to what I could

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.039 
then but I was limited to what I could
use<00:01:02.989> it<00:01:03.019> with<00:01:03.260> I<00:01:03.500> think<00:01:04.220> this<00:01:04.369> may<00:01:04.549> be<00:01:04.580> the<00:01:05.049> 31

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
use it with I think this may be the 31

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.500 
use it with I think this may be the 31
from<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:06.619> there's<00:01:07.370> not<00:01:07.580> be<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.730> fav<00:01:07.970> unit

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
all very exciting I think so first of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:37.000 
all very exciting I think so first of
all<00:01:21.470> we<00:01:21.530> get<00:01:23.710> this<00:01:28.810> thing<00:01:30.760> is<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:32.120> band<00:01:36.010> boys

quit<00:02:48.000> dimensions<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.600> probably<00:02:48.989> used<00:02:49.170> to

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
quit dimensions to be probably used to

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.330 
quit dimensions to be probably used to
charge<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.920> device<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.700> well<00:02:51.390> as<00:02:51.810> I'm<00:02:52.130> use<00:02:53.130> it

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
charge the device as well as I'm use it

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.550

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
see the point of that um this is a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.380 
see the point of that um this is a
lineout<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.320> headphone<00:03:49.650> out<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:51.359> there's<00:03:51.600> some
