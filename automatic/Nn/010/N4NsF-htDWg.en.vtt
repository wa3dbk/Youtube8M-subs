00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.660
 well there start something with the word 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.079
 convertible from devaluation 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.390
 because now they are in great fun 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.340
 really a nice car but it is not 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.160
 real convertible so it becomes convertible 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.710
 I no longer use this video in my mouth 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.710
 ok this is not a convertible 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.050
 but it is very beautiful 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.580
 super great writer day or mistake day 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.080
 I have to say because it goes in slats 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.940
 as it were, photos are just behind the 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.410
 really covers the entire width and length 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.360
 and open it again if you go on the 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.510
 button presses also goes backwards 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.510
 away 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.880
 yes it is for that reason that wesley by and 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.980
 the plurel that went into production in 2010 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.030
 have not been forgotten or if we have 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.750
 go further and go back in the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.910
 history 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.670
 the legendary deux chevaux of course 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.960
 which also opened in this way 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.820
 unlike the curiel they have that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.410
 day here bowed not removable this time 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.330
 made and that is a good thing because that 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.210
 was yes that makes the car very tight 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.360
 and I really do not pluriel and went and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.620
 costs for stiffness and also yes if 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.570
 those things loose helmet was already a huge 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.830
 job and then you were bothered with what you are coming 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.479
 don't leave them in the car so you left them 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.580
 at home and if you were 100 km away with 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.229
 nice sun in the rain 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.229
 then became a wimp 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.400
 yes then how open do you actually drive yes 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.050
 it's what I said it's not it 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.700
 real cabriolet work you've got to the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.470
 side still the jaa those windows and that 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.520
 sit upstairs and you will also notice if you like 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.260
 which drives faster at certain speeds 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.729
 drive that typical 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.020
 thumps inside of you 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.960
 also gets to slide at a vending machine 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.890
 daily with real cabinet 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.119
 but nevertheless that ordinary one 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.730
 consequence a little help from delicious 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.440
 sunshine and japan enjoy this looks 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.570
 little for us for the time being 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.430
 version put down as the 155 hp 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.840
 strong thp 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.570
 and that is basically the same engine as 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.400
 a the mini cooper s slightly pinched then 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.500
 but nevertheless really a delicious one 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.269
 machine really incredibly smooth 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.300
 from 2000 rpm really a full box 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.370
 Powerful in and yes but they like this car 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.800
 just a delicious carts nice and fast 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.630
 nice alert nice to sit on the grass too 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.760
 into the six-speed bin of the mini and that is also 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.130
 a party really short strokes really really 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.540
 exactly with a lot of feeling you really switch 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.760
 really pleases you for what is hardly 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.080
 is needed to make things smooth and son 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.269
 then i'll take it mini again 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.190
 in the union because even where driving is yes 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.050
 we know the ds3 ordinary course 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.580
 little or nothing has changed here 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.190
 I do that because those arches have remained 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.750
 standing the car is almost as stiff as 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.090
 the become as dense and that is 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.300
 just a fantastic thing really super 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.830
 tight send a lot of feelings is it 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.240
 near the mini and that's it 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.990
 biggest compliment again a car this one 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.990
 can give class though 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.370
 yes have done a cabrio piece on it 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.200
 heavier and yes it is not a convertible sorry 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.629
 the sliding roof is that the cat is heavier 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.690
 then one then the dense feather to 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.760
 with this car only 25 kilos , only 25 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.400
 pounds heavier to the ds3 dense 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.870
 which you know very few actually know that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.220
 Your pity is that you look forward to it 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.720
 sees little difference with close 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.400
 implementation and almost nothing you need it 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.540
 really pay attention to see the difference 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.220
 and as a shame because you want a little bit 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.379
 be distinctive you have 3000 euros 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.819
 more paid already at ds3 close 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.530
 well i have the chrome strip behind 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.420
 you on fabric roof what you almost do not 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.010
 see if you don't look and 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.670
 years back your kind smaller but that 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.670
 it was just about 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.829
 interior I can be short because you 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.019
 knowing that of course is nothing to it 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.880
 changed same as the won ds3 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:03.079
 apart you have to love it but it 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.900
 is certainly not like others except 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.940
 this 155 hp turbo engine is also there 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.489
 a three student 82 hp 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.950
 this block is also without turbo so the 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.970
 120 hp engine and is a 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.169
 diesel in March already comes the ds3 cabrio 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.880
 to our country and that is more than sufficient 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.019
 to go wonderfully from spring 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.019
 I am already looking forward to it 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.139
 yes and if you have to sit in the back bs 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.370
 very happy that it is not real 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.960
 convertible is because you just got it 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.520
 very big or look like a small open 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.720
 Old was really catching you up a bit 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.139
 a lot of profit but yes that will be with the 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.139
 experience
