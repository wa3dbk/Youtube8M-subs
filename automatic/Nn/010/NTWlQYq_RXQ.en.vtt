00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:04.519
 Werder Bremen 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.320
 this is the demolished and annihilated the Czechs of Russian state 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.870
 the rescue workers had to do hard labor for the 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.060
 trapped driver with full force he is in the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.830
 oncoming bus raced many of the passengers sleep at the time 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.550
 fatal because so none of them can hold on somewhere or from others 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.539
 Protect the way from impact 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.380
 loud bang easy 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 and the whole bus has wobbled like that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.630
 for all evening games 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.890
 to be in Austria 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.380
 I got her down 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.210
 that was also so that the writing without having a faint memory word 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.320
 wanted out 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.020
 Shortly before, the van collides with this oncoming car 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.940
 The 26-year-old driver is seriously injured by the impact 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.080
 the truck came to the other side of the road the bus can not 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.730
 Dodge more and drive into the semi-trailer 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.560
 Only one of the over 40 bus inmates will be seriously injured or come to blemishes 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.510
 from that 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.920
 How many passengers sat exactly in the coach can the police 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.330
 do not say it right now 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.160
 the most complicated was for us very soon after arrival the right one 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.190
 Deciding to go in there to quickly build a basic 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.920
 to know who is most hurt here where do we first have the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.520
 We had rescue measures in the past years 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.490
 several serious traffic accidents but that is actually an area 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.480
 strongest emirates to 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.480
 So far, there were none 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.600
 unhappily injured and as losers all go home in good spirits 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.050
 or 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.340
 so far it is unclear how the first accident between truck and passenger car is 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.580
 has come 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.180
 only one hour ago was the full closure of the main road 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.810
 To get picked up
