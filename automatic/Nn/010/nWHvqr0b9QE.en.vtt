 family histories are preserved 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.350
 is the case of this doll brought by 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.840
 the first owner of the toy was 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.409
 the wife of the broker who 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.900

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.950
 By the doll that did I was seeing here. 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.009

 are actions that do well for the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.229
 parents but also bring many benefits 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.780
 for the little ones and a reflection on the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.119
 excess for the whole family since the year
