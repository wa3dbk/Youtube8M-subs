 update is 1800 euro gaming computers 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.759
 september 2014 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.740
 as a processor came the intel core i7 5820 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.400
 with 6 x 33 gigahertz 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.140
 he has a toro day of 3.6 gigahertz 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.119
 140 watt tdp has a free one 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.250
 multiplier that would be you can do it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.350
 Free overclocking and hyperthreading the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.630
 is here called deanery council as a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.580
 theoretical 12 nuclear course enough

 to six thick enough if he is too 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.090
 becomes weak you can overclock him as 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.040
 cool big block 3 it is a very 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 big and strong cooler and with him 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.829
 operate slices and overclock possible 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.899
 as mainboard the s hawx 99 extreme 4 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.469
 with the intellekt 99 chipset 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.010

 usb 3 a lan socket and 6 3 5 mm 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.860
 ping for the sound chip than as 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.900
 RAM 16 GB critical ballistix 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.729
 port ddr4 2416 right afloat it's a 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.159
 Quad kit water is one can in the quad 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.560
 channel and 16 gb are also 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.580
 for the next time enough as ssd the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.400
 512 gb between 550 it became one 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.890
 sleek fast ssd and 512 gb are enough 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.259
 for some as hard disk the one 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.610
 terabyte desktop art idea it's one 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.350
 cut the fast hard disk 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.270
 and a terabyte pay for most 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.939
 thick enough under you then as

 graphics card the 4gb detective goes off 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.850
 x900 and 80 the gtx 980 is currently the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.920
 fastest single gpu graphics card the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.720
 also very much for their tremendous performance 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.520
