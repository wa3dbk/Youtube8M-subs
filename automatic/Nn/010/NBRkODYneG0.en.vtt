hollow<00:04:43.009> that<00:04:43.520> is<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.120> sick<00:04:45.039> it<00:04:46.039> looks<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:46.669> nice

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
hollow that is so sick it looks so nice

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.310 
hollow that is so sick it looks so nice
the<00:04:48.500> hollow<00:04:48.830> is<00:04:49.310> kind<00:04:49.759> of<00:04:49.849> hard<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.120> see<00:04:50.419> but

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
the hollow is kind of hard to see but

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.570 
the hollow is kind of hard to see but
it's<00:04:51.530> in<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.919> background<00:04:52.789> right<00:04:53.120> here<00:04:54.580> it's

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
it's in the background right here it's

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.870 
it's in the background right here it's
not<00:04:55.789> on<00:04:56.000> this<00:04:56.180> side<00:04:57.220> try<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.280> get<00:04:58.550> it<00:04:58.639> in<00:04:58.729> there

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
not on this side try to get it in there

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.640 
not on this side try to get it in there
a<00:04:58.910> little<00:04:59.060> bit<00:04:59.270> you<00:04:59.960> can<00:05:00.139> see<00:05:00.289> a<00:05:00.320> little<00:05:00.500> bit

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
a little bit you can see a little bit

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.080 
a little bit you can see a little bit

two hollows these two right here got a

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.689 
two hollows these two right here got a
prism<00:05:13.240> energy<00:05:14.240> reverse<00:05:14.630> holo<00:05:15.400> which<00:05:16.400> is<00:05:16.520> nice

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
prism energy reverse holo which is nice

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.810

you<00:05:16.849> can<00:05:16.970> see<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.270> energy<00:05:17.479> up<00:05:18.050> here<00:05:18.440> is

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
you can see the energy up here is

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.290 
you can see the energy up here is
shining<00:05:19.820> and<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:21.590> autumn<00:05:22.310> has<00:05:22.520> like<00:05:22.880> the
