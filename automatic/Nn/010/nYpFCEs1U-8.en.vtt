00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 the complete look of the Cinderella 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.810
 after watching the premiere of this pretty 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.510
 movie today I bring you the complete look 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.580
 of the Cinderella 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.830
 The first thing we will do is moisturize well 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.890
 the skin we will apply a diaz cream 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.529
 to bring light to the face of the center 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.750
 outward and then we will apply a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.240
 light makeup base directly 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.750
 with your hands with a brush or with a 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.750
 sponge 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.450
 we will apply the corrector just below 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.430
 of dark circles 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.840
 and also in dark areas where 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.840
 we want to bring you light 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.780
 we blur it with the fingertips 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.280
 little by little and we're going to apply a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.050
 illuminator in bar above the cheekbone and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.050
 also under the eyebrow 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.980
 we take a shadow of a brown tone 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.010
 clarito we apply to all the eyelid 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.010
 mobile 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.010
 and we blur it well by brushing 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.650
 through the fold we take a golden shadow 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.740
 with a little bit of brightness and we apply it 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.360
 in the center of the mobile eyelid in the in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.490
 the movie had eyes very 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.490
 natural but with a little bit of brightness 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.010
 and now with a darker shadow we're going 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.740
 to give intensity at the end of 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.329
 outside 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.329
 and on the inside 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.880
 we are blurring it very carefully 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.880
 to create the effect 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.940
 we take again the shadow that we have 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.100
 applied throughout the eyelid and the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.070
 we work in the fold to finish 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.320
 integrate well the two tones and in this 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.930
 look it is important to give importance to 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.420
 eyebrows so we combed them and filled them 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.799
 the holes 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.799
 we use lashes 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.440
 a little chewing on the outside end 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.590
 and in the bottom 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.510
 we take a red lipstick and 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.510
 touches we stain the lip 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.580
 and we're also going to apply it in the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.349
 cheeks to give it a juicy effect and 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.870
 for now we would have the makeup 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.290
 Cinderella ready something very natural 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.569
 but very flattering 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.670
 now we collect the hair from the part 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.859
 from above with a clamp or with a rubber 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.079
 so that it does not bother us we divide the 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:37.319
 hair in two partitions we take the 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.900
 respective and we start I think it's better 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.329
 use the tongs in this case 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.329
 because we want to mark one more wave 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.489
 marked and not so undone and this 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.500
 shape will take us a little bit more 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.510
 it is important not to touch the wave until 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.220
 it's totally cold because if we do not 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.220
 will be more loose and undone 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.550
 we just marked all the locks 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.799
 we take a lock from the bottom 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.180
 on one side and we make a braid of 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.180
 cord we roll 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.430
 we use it for the top part with 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.849
 Care at each crossing 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.349
 and now we pass it over and the 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.349
 we hold with a fork 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.320
 now we take the lock of the part of 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.069
 in front of us and we fold it and place a 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.469
 fork inside without seeing 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.290
 and some open hairpin if it's 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:46.590
 necessary and we do the same in the other 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.590
 side 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.090
 we hold it by the back 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.129
 and to complete the Cinderella look 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.129
 let's apply some glitter 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.950
 let's put on the super dress that 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.210
 It has brought us a lot of work and 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.700
 final I think it has been very good 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.640
 and will be ready to go to the party 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.300
 but remember Cinderella everything changes 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.300
 12 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.180
 and as Cinderella's mother says in the 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.130
 film the secret that will help you 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.400
 overcome all the tests that you pose 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.380
 life is to be generous and have value 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.790
 I hope you liked the video I 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.130
 I encourage you all to watch the 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.260
 movie because it is very beautiful us 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.240
 we have not had a great time recording this 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.650
 video I send you a big kiss and we 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.650
 we see in the next video
