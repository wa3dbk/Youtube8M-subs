for us that frees up about 5 million in
cap<00:02:57.370> space<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.970> will<00:02:58.090> allow<00:02:58.359> us<00:02:58.389> to<00:02:58.569> sinus<00:02:59.530> on

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
I think this is a really good good idea

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.490 
I think this is a really good good idea
here<00:03:12.579> and<00:03:12.700> I'm<00:03:13.569> just<00:03:13.780> bringing<00:03:13.959> random

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
here and I'm just bringing random

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.699 
here and I'm just bringing random
minutes<00:03:14.799> down<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.230> first<00:03:17.470> time

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
minutes down so this is the first time

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.110 
minutes down so this is the first time
we<00:03:17.859> really<00:03:18.099> haven't<00:03:18.370> had<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.519> lot<00:03:18.669> of<00:03:18.730> point

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
we really haven't had a lot of point

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.809 
we really haven't had a lot of point
guards<00:03:19.449> on<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.690> team<00:03:23.099> and<00:03:24.099> we'll<00:03:24.370> just<00:03:24.519> spread

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
guards on the team and we'll just spread

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.939 
guards on the team and we'll just spread
the<00:03:25.000> wealth<00:03:25.209> out<00:03:25.449> there<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:26.049> think<00:03:26.590> we<00:03:26.799> give

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
the wealth out there I think we give

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.309 
the wealth out there I think we give
Bowen<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.519> better<00:03:27.699> chance<00:03:28.030> over<00:03:28.329> Singler<00:03:28.750> for

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
Bowen the better chance over Singler for
