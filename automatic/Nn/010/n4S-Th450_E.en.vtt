on<00:01:34.460> do<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:34.939> understand<00:01:35.390> me<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.689> has<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.929> be

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
on do you understand me it has to be

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.980 
on do you understand me it has to be
turned<00:01:36.259> on<00:01:36.470> now<00:01:37.270> if<00:01:38.270> i'm<00:01:38.450> reading<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:38.810> right

turned on now if i'm reading this right
I'm<00:01:39.799> afraid<00:01:40.069> there<00:01:40.369> are<00:01:40.490> lethal<00:01:40.700> levels<00:01:41.179> of

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
I'm afraid there are lethal levels of

I'm afraid there are lethal levels of
radiation<00:01:41.509> inside<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.380> chamber<00:01:42.670> I'm<00:01:43.670> sorry<00:01:44.060> I

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
radiation inside the chamber I'm sorry I
