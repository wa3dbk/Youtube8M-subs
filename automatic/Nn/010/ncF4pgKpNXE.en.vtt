characteristics to this disorder
typically<00:01:00.260> we<00:01:00.470> find<00:01:00.770> it<00:01:00.980> on<00:01:01.160> trees<00:01:01.700> that<00:01:02.120> have

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
typically we find it on trees that have

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.410 
typically we find it on trees that have
a<00:01:02.360> lighter<00:01:03.200> crop<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:04.040> weaker<00:01:04.999> growing

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
heavier crop and are more vigorously

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.239 
heavier crop and are more vigorously
growing<00:01:11.659> seem<00:01:12.319> to<00:01:12.469> have<00:01:12.590> less<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.100> this

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:13.249

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:15.879 
growing seem to have less of this
chlorosis<00:01:13.579> or<00:01:14.119> yellows<00:01:14.479> now<00:01:14.719> a<00:01:15.590> few

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:15.889 
chlorosis or yellows now a few

chlorosis or yellows now a few
researchers<00:01:16.579> have<00:01:16.850> looked<00:01:17.389> at<00:01:17.569> this<00:01:17.719> issue<00:01:18.219> it

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
researchers have looked at this issue it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.279 
researchers have looked at this issue it
does<00:01:19.490> remind<00:01:19.909> you<00:01:20.119> of<00:01:20.240> potato<00:01:20.630> leaf<00:01:20.899> hopper

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
does remind you of potato leaf hopper

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.830 
does remind you of potato leaf hopper
injury<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:22.039> Honeycrisp<00:01:22.789> can<00:01:23.119> get<00:01:23.299> potato<00:01:23.600> leaf

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
injury a Honeycrisp can get potato leaf

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.629 
injury a Honeycrisp can get potato leaf
hopper<00:01:24.259> but<00:01:24.499> just<00:01:24.710> because<00:01:24.859> you<00:01:25.219> get<00:01:25.490> it

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
hopper but just because you get it

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.940 
hopper but just because you get it
doesn't<00:01:26.569> mean<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:26.749> have<00:01:26.780> potato<00:01:27.289> leaf<00:01:27.499> hopper

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
doesn't mean you have potato leaf hopper

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.370 
doesn't mean you have potato leaf hopper
so<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.189> need<00:01:28.399> to<00:01:28.520> scout<00:01:28.850> for<00:01:28.880> that<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:30.139> it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
so you need to scout for that but it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.550 
so you need to scout for that but it
seems<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.740> be<00:01:30.829> a<00:01:30.859> physiological<00:01:31.270> disorder

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
seems to be a physiological disorder

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.429 
seems to be a physiological disorder
that's<00:01:33.560> related<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.420> starch<00:01:35.420> or<00:01:35.689> carbohydrate

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
that's related to starch or carbohydrate

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.190 
that's related to starch or carbohydrate
movement<00:01:37.340> in<00:01:37.459> the<00:01:37.609> plant<00:01:37.840> now<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.899> good<00:01:39.139> thing

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
movement in the plant now the good thing

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.379 
movement in the plant now the good thing
is<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:40.009> chlorosis<00:01:40.310> or<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.939> yellowing

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:41.389 
is that the chlorosis or the yellowing

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:44.019 
is that the chlorosis or the yellowing
itself<00:01:41.810> doesn't<00:01:42.259> seem<00:01:42.499> to<00:01:42.679> affect<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.729> trees

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.029 
itself doesn't seem to affect the trees

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:46.660 
itself doesn't seem to affect the trees
that<00:01:44.299> much<00:01:44.569> but<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.499> fact<00:01:45.799> that<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.130> tree<00:01:46.639> is

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
that much but the fact that the tree is

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.379 
that much but the fact that the tree is
perhaps<00:01:47.149> under<00:01:47.659> cropped<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:49.130> or<00:01:49.700> weak<00:01:49.999> is<00:01:50.209> not

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389 
perhaps under cropped and or weak is not

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:53.649 
perhaps under cropped and or weak is not
a<00:01:50.420> good<00:01:50.689> thing<00:01:50.929> so<00:01:51.670> it's<00:01:52.670> important<00:01:53.359> to<00:01:53.420> have

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
a good thing so it's important to have

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.379 
a good thing so it's important to have
an<00:01:53.869> annual<00:01:54.520> moderate<00:01:55.520> crop<00:01:55.909> load<00:01:56.179> with

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
an annual moderate crop load with

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:58.419 
an annual moderate crop load with
Honeycrisp<00:01:56.929> be<00:01:57.709> very<00:01:57.889> particular<00:01:58.399> about

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
Honeycrisp be very particular about

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.999 
Honeycrisp be very particular about
thinning<00:01:58.909> Honeycrisp<00:01:59.539> it's<00:02:00.289> also<00:02:00.469> important

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
thinning Honeycrisp it's also important

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.580 
thinning Honeycrisp it's also important
to<00:02:01.069> keep<00:02:01.219> the<00:02:01.429> trees<00:02:02.020> vigorous<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.229> growing

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
to keep the trees vigorous and growing

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.889 
to keep the trees vigorous and growing
well<00:02:03.950> again<00:02:04.639> you'll<00:02:04.849> more<00:02:05.270> likely<00:02:05.599> to<00:02:05.719> see

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
well again you'll more likely to see

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.800 
well again you'll more likely to see
this<00:02:06.049> yellowing<00:02:06.649> on<00:02:07.060> honey<00:02:08.060> crisps<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.420> are

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
this yellowing on honey crisps that are

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.410 
this yellowing on honey crisps that are
weak<00:02:09.290> and<00:02:09.530> not<00:02:09.740> growing<00:02:10.009> as<00:02:10.280> well<00:02:10.550> just

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
weak and not growing as well just

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.150 
weak and not growing as well just
quickly<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.810> reminder<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.710> need<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:12.980> keep

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
pretty well picked these two trees we

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.330 
pretty well picked these two trees we
have<00:02:49.400> clean<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:50.540> did<00:02:51.410> pick<00:02:51.620> some<00:02:51.830> PF<00:02:52.070> ones

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
have clean so I did pick some PF ones

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.240 
have clean so I did pick some PF ones
yesterday<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.030> tested<00:02:53.390> them<00:02:54.040> some<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.100> them

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
yesterday and tested them some of them

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.950 
yesterday and tested them some of them
are<00:02:55.370> certainly<00:02:55.640> ready<00:02:55.910> others<00:02:56.630> could<00:02:56.810> wait<00:02:56.930> a

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
are certainly ready others could wait a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.260 
are certainly ready others could wait a
little<00:02:57.140> longer<00:02:57.440> but<00:02:58.340> it's<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.580> first<00:02:58.880> of<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
little longer but it's the first of the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.290 
little longer but it's the first of the
real<00:02:59.810> red<00:03:00.080> coloring<00:03:00.580> early<00:03:01.580> peaches<00:03:01.940> we<00:03:02.090> have
