install these SR performance full-length
subframe<00:00:58.739> connectors<00:00:59.310> now<00:00:59.970> these<00:01:00.149> are<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> very

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
subframe connectors now these are a very

on<00:01:05.190> our<00:01:05.400> launches<00:01:05.940> we<00:01:06.570> did<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.229> weld

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
on our launches we did up for the weld

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.110 
on our launches we did up for the weld
in<00:01:07.590> version<00:01:07.979> which<00:01:08.100> did<00:01:08.310> require<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> little

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
in version which did require a little

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.090 
in version which did require a little
bit<00:01:09.240> more<00:01:09.390> work<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.110> they're<00:01:10.680> gonna<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.860> much

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
bit more work but they're gonna be much

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
bit more work but they're gonna be much
stronger<00:01:11.400> than<00:01:11.580> other<00:01:11.820> Bolton<00:01:12.300> options<00:01:12.750> it'll

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
stronger than other Bolton options it'll

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.160

take<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.360> closer<00:01:18.600> look<00:01:18.720> at<00:01:18.930> our<00:01:18.960> suspension<00:01:19.650> now

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
take a closer look at our suspension now

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.649 
take a closer look at our suspension now
we<00:01:20.280> were<00:01:20.460> attempting<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.970> keep<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> cost<00:01:21.450> down

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
we were attempting to keep the cost down

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.360 
we were attempting to keep the cost down
with<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.990> build<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> our<00:01:22.680> factory<00:01:23.100> shocks

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
with this build and our factory shocks

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.490 
with this build and our factory shocks
and<00:01:23.580> struts<00:01:23.820> are<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.210> great<00:01:24.450> shape<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.380> we

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
and struts are in great shape so we

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200 
and struts are in great shape so we
decided<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> install<00:01:26.010> these<00:01:26.280> SR<00:01:26.700> performance

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
