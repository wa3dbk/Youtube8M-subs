00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
detail into this case let's speculate on

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.880 
detail into this case let's speculate on
the<00:01:57.790> back<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.240> just<00:01:58.360> this<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:59.049> this<00:01:59.409> is<00:01:59.590> quite

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
the back and just this is this is quite

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.760 
the back and just this is this is quite
deep<00:02:00.220> cut<00:02:00.580> this<00:02:01.479> texture<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.290> it's<00:02:02.439> got<00:02:02.560> some

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
deep cut this texture so it's got some

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.490 
deep cut this texture so it's got some
real<00:02:03.159> sort<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.580> grip<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.170> nice<00:02:05.170> little

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
real sort of grip to it nice little

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.920 
real sort of grip to it nice little
protection<00:02:05.830> feels<00:02:06.549> really<00:02:06.939> great<00:02:07.210> does

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
protection feels really great does

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.600 
protection feels really great does
protrude<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.560> up<00:02:08.679> from<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.070> front<00:02:09.399> of<00:02:09.489> the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
protrude it up from the front of the

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.970
