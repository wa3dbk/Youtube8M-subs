00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.830
 hello everyone I'm full of sweet and 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.690
 salty and today we are going to prepare another 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.090
 healthy recipe to start the year 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.920
 new and that's how to make a salad 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.559
 roasted chicken with a vinaigrette 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.050
 cilantro and lemon green this salad is 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.000
 delicious because the vinaigrette combines 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.849
 very good with the chicken and the marina 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.769
 chicken is spectacular and as always the 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.470
 link of the recipes for available to 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.570
 end of the video 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.529
 to start let's make the marinade 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:37.260
 and we need a little oil 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.260
 we also need green lemon juice 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.800
 dry coriander can also use 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.180
 fresh cilantro 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.240
 cumin powder 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.150
 cayenne pepper or chili powder 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.610
 this is optional 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.610
 and season with salt and pepper 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.670
 we are going to stir well all these 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.780
 ingredients and then we put the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.270
 marinated part 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.909
 for the chicken we are going to use breasts 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.280
 of chicken and how are these a bit 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.680
 thick what we're going to do is flatten 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.980
 with a mallet to flatten meats or a 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.710
 kitchen hammer 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.010
 we are going to place them between two pieces of 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.010
 plastic here we have the mallet that has 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.350
 two sides and on the side that is smooth is 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.170
 with which we are going to hit the breasts 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.020
 of chicken 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.939
 and we are going to hit them a bit so that 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.330
 postpone and so that they are equal 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.330
 thick 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.120
 i 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.370
 as you can see the breasts are a 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.880
 little thinner and the only thing we have 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.380
 what to do is place them in a container 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.530
 You can also place them in a bag 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.530
 plastic 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.060
 and the breasts are going to add the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.060
 marinated that we prepared previously 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.560
 and we make sure that all the chicken is 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.560
 well covered with the marinade 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.860
 we cover the container well and we will 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.209
 refrigerate for approximately 30 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.209
 minutes to one hour 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.700
 and now let's cook the chicken on fire 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.980
 medium-high by approximately 5 to 7 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.139
 minutes on each side or until the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.139
 chicken juices come out transparent 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.720
 Y 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.220
 meanwhile we are going to prepare the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.230
 vinaigrette and in a processor 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.490
 food we are going to place cilantro 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:37.980
 Garlic 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:37.980
 green lemon juice balsamic vinegar 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.120
 honey 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.090
 Y 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.090
 and then season with salt and pepper 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.920
 i 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.920
 we plugged the processor 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.610
 and we are going to liquefy all the ingredients 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.610
 until they are well crushed 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.790
 and then we are going to add olive oil 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.590
 while the processor follows the and when 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.590
 we do it slowly 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.800
 and the vinaigrette is ready 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.000
 and then we're going to mix all the 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.490
 vegetables in this case I'm using this 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.199
 mixed greens can you 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.710
 use any type of lettuce that 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.710
 prefer 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.330
 i 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:51.180
 we're also going to add cherry tomatoes or 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.180
 cherry and we're going to split them in the middle 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.340
 and we also add cucumber cut into 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.340
 pieces 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.880
 and a little grated carrot for 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.880
 add color 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.690
 and we just have to mix well all 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.690
 these ingredients 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.330
 you 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.490
 now that the chicken has been cooked and 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.880
 has cooled down a bit what we are going to do 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.950
 is to break it into small pieces this is not 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.230
 only makes the presentation is 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.940
 prettier but also allows it to 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.190
 I can eat easier 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.140
 and to serve the salad we only have 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.230
 to put a little bit of lettuce in a 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:44.750
 plate making sure you have tomato 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:47.870
 the cucumber and the carrot 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.320
 and then we put the chicken on top of the 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.320
 salad 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.990
 finally we serve the vinaigrette apart 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.909
 and that is the recipe to make a 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.990
 roasted chicken salad with a 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:08.330
 cilantro vinaigrette and green lemon 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.030
