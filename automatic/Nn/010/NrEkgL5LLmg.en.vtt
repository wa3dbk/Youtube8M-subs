favorite teams the Cowboys which oddly

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.559 
favorite teams the Cowboys which oddly
enough<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.219> had<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.639> ask<00:02:23.730> him<00:02:23.999> right<00:02:24.239> after<00:02:24.389> he

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
enough I had to ask him right after he

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.509 
enough I had to ask him right after he
said<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.900> if<00:02:25.319> he<00:02:25.379> thought<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.159> the<00:02:26.310> dez

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
said that if he thought that the dez

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.030 
said that if he thought that the dez
bryant<00:02:26.969> catch<00:02:27.150> was<00:02:27.389> an<00:02:27.540> actual<00:02:27.780> catch<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.590> it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
bryant catch was an actual catch and it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.979 
bryant catch was an actual catch and it
was<00:02:29.430> actually<00:02:29.579> kind<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.269> interesting<00:02:30.450> hearing

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
was actually kind of interesting hearing

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.229 
was actually kind of interesting hearing
his<00:02:31.230> comment<00:02:31.680> from<00:02:32.010> him<00:02:32.219> being<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.489> defender<00:02:32.969> he

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
his comment from him being a defender he

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.990 
his comment from him being a defender he
said<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.719> he<00:02:33.870> made<00:02:34.430> three<00:02:35.430> steps<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.909> then

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
said that he made three steps and then

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.509 
said that he made three steps and then
he<00:02:36.180> made<00:02:36.359> a<00:02:36.389> football<00:02:36.959> move<00:02:37.230> towards<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:38.099> end

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
he made a football move towards the end

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.819 
he made a football move towards the end
zone<00:02:38.969> and<00:02:39.239> he<00:02:39.870> thought<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.230> should<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.680> been

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
zone and he thought it should have been

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.940 
zone and he thought it should have been
a<00:02:41.040> touchdown<00:02:41.639> which<00:02:41.849> i<00:02:42.000> thought<00:02:42.209> was<00:02:42.389> you<00:02:42.659> know

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
a touchdown which i thought was you know

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.259 
a touchdown which i thought was you know
well<00:02:43.950> his<00:02:44.189> favorite<00:02:44.519> team<00:02:44.669> was<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.849> Cowboys

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
well his favorite team was the Cowboys

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.429 
well his favorite team was the Cowboys
but<00:02:45.419> I<00:02:45.480> thought<00:02:45.659> was<00:02:45.810> odd<00:02:45.930> because<00:02:46.079> he's<00:02:46.349> a

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
but I thought was odd because he's a

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.539 
but I thought was odd because he's a
defender<00:02:46.889> and<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.069> would<00:02:47.189> think<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.370> he

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
defender and you would think that he

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.339 
defender and you would think that he
would<00:02:47.579> agree<00:02:48.000> with<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.450> call<00:02:48.689> that<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.019> wasn't

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
would agree with the call that it wasn't

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.080 
would agree with the call that it wasn't
a<00:02:49.379> touchdown<00:02:49.829> but<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.099> mean<00:02:50.340> his<00:02:50.489> favorite<00:02:50.909> team

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
a touchdown but I mean his favorite team

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.539 
a touchdown but I mean his favorite team
is<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.269> cowboys<00:02:51.510> so<00:02:52.079> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.189> see<00:02:53.340> why<00:02:53.519> he

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
is the cowboys so you can see why he

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.390 
is the cowboys so you can see why he
thought<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.209> was<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.359> touchdown<00:02:54.870> but<00:02:54.900> um<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.620> kind

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
thought it was a touchdown but um I kind

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.589 
thought it was a touchdown but um I kind
agreed<00:02:56.609> to<00:02:56.699> I<00:02:56.730> thought<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.090> was<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.209> touchdown

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
agreed to I thought it was a touchdown

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.420 
agreed to I thought it was a touchdown
to<00:02:57.629> but<00:02:57.930> I'm<00:02:58.109> not<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.409> rep<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:58.859> what<00:02:59.219> the<00:02:59.310> hell

the biggest bears fan like I hope the
packers<00:05:24.819> lose<00:05:25.229> every<00:05:26.229> single<00:05:26.469> game<00:05:26.889> that<00:05:27.279> they

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
packers lose every single game that they

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.089 
packers lose every single game that they
ever<00:05:28.090> play<00:05:28.509> but<00:05:29.199> he<00:05:29.289> was<00:05:29.440> like<00:05:29.590> support<00:05:30.009> in

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
ever play but he was like support in

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.820 
ever play but he was like support in
Seattle<00:05:30.669> which<00:05:30.789> was<00:05:30.969> odd<00:05:31.210> but<00:05:31.509> hey<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:32.620> guess

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
Seattle which was odd but hey I guess

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.369 
Seattle which was odd but hey I guess
maybe<00:05:33.219> because<00:05:33.789> it's<00:05:33.969> his<00:05:34.150> it's<00:05:34.870> his<00:05:35.020> day<00:05:35.259> he

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:35.379 
maybe because it's his it's his day he

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:37.260 
maybe because it's his it's his day he
wants<00:05:35.500> his<00:05:35.710> division<00:05:36.219> to<00:05:36.340> win<00:05:36.550> maybe<00:05:36.969> that's

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
wants his division to win maybe that's

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.809 
wants his division to win maybe that's
why<00:05:37.509> but<00:05:38.379> anyway<00:05:38.770> things<00:05:39.550> of<00:05:39.669> that<00:05:39.789> nature

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
why but anyway things of that nature

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.269 
why but anyway things of that nature
