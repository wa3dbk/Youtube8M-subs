has four gigabyte gigabit ethernet ports
so<00:00:28.230> here's<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> box<00:00:29.369> here's<00:00:29.789> what<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.000> looks

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
so here's the box here's what it looks

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:30.999 
so here's the box here's what it looks
like

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
like

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.810 
like

power adapters so let's open this up and
if<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.180> wondering<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.869> back<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
if you're wondering for the back it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.530 
if you're wondering for the back it
shows<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:08.159> three<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> routers<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:11.540> e1000

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
shows all three of the routers the e1000

the e 2001 I have and of course the e
3000<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.479> difference<00:01:18.869> between<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.470> e<00:01:19.909> 2000

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
3000 the difference between the e 2000

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.429 
3000 the difference between the e 2000
and<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> e<00:01:21.240> 3000<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:24.060> says<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.420> has<00:01:24.570> optimized

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
and the e 3000 it says it has optimized

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.320 
and the e 3000 it says it has optimized
for<00:01:25.680> wireless<00:01:25.979> gaming<00:01:26.250> optimized<00:01:26.939> for

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
for wireless gaming optimized for

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.940 
for wireless gaming optimized for

streaming HD it connect and share USB
storage<00:01:31.950> throughout<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:33.090> then<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.329> also<00:01:33.450> has

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
storage throughout but then it also has

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.550 
storage throughout but then it also has
this<00:01:34.350> one<00:01:34.530> has<00:01:34.729> three<00:01:35.729> antennas<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:37.140> one<00:01:37.380> has

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
this one has three antennas this one has

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.280 
this one has three antennas this one has
six<00:01:38.130> antennas<00:01:38.700> built-in<00:01:39.650> this<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:41.210> 2.4<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.329> 5.0

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
six antennas built-in this is 2.4 to 5.0

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.670 
six antennas built-in this is 2.4 to 5.0
selectable<00:01:44.149> gigahertz<00:01:45.149> while<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.409> dual

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
selectable gigahertz while this is dual

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.870 
selectable gigahertz while this is dual
band<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.520> both<00:01:47.689> 2.4<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.720> 5.0<00:01:50.270> ok

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
band so it's both 2.4 and 5.0 ok

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:05.210 
band so it's both 2.4 and 5.0 ok
let's<00:01:52.000> finish<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.540> rest<00:01:52.719> of<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.930> sandbox<00:01:53.170> and

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.290 

here<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.759> router<00:02:07.000> itself<00:02:08.940> really<00:02:09.940> nice

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
here is the router itself really nice

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:20.540 
here is the router itself really nice
but<00:02:10.929> nice<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:12.239> let's<00:02:13.239> pull<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:13.720> off<00:02:14.019> oh<00:02:15.630> yes

14.95<00:05:07.890> because<00:05:08.890> my<00:05:09.720> network<00:05:10.720> speeds<00:05:10.960> at<00:05:11.110> 20<00:05:11.410> so

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
14.95 because my network speeds at 20 so

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.270 
14.95 because my network speeds at 20 so
and<00:05:12.070> it's<00:05:12.220> more<00:05:12.400> than<00:05:12.490> realistic<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:15.040> that's

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
and it's more than realistic and that's

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.640 
and it's more than realistic and that's
fourteen<00:05:15.820> point<00:05:16.030> nine<00:05:16.090> that<00:05:16.780> is<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:17.260> download
