00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
speculation about characters that people

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.069 
speculation about characters that people
would<00:02:24.099> like<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.280> see<00:02:24.610> i<00:02:25.030> will<00:02:25.510> say<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.930> lot

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
would like to see i will say that a lot

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.030 
would like to see i will say that a lot
of<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.230> characters<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.680> people<00:02:26.950> are

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
of the characters that people are

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.190 
of the characters that people are
talking<00:02:27.069> about<00:02:27.489> might<00:02:28.360> show<00:02:28.599> up<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:28.870> our<00:02:28.959> game

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
talking about might show up in our game

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.360 
talking about might show up in our game
and<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:29.470> i<00:02:29.500> think<00:02:29.620> that's<00:02:29.829> going<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.069> be<00:02:30.129> really

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
and so i think that's going to be really

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.339 
and so i think that's going to be really
exciting<00:02:30.730> for<00:02:30.760> players<00:02:31.150> once<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:31.959> happens

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
exciting for players once that happens

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.600 
exciting for players once that happens
it's<00:02:32.440> really<00:02:32.799> listening<00:02:33.129> to<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.340> fans

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
it's really listening to the fans

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.150 
it's really listening to the fans
finding<00:02:34.390> out<00:02:34.510> what<00:02:34.750> makes<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.470> best<00:02:35.709> fit<00:02:36.129> for
