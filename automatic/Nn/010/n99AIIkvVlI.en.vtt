00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.080
 Hello 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.010
 as always we are going to open the new 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.500
 package that I just got to the 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.099
 post Office 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.099
 what we have inside 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.250
 and let's see the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.250
 let's take a well-known century 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.539
 so you do not doubt it's a box without 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.539
 true 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.510
 to 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.460
 we open 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.030
 we find 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.690
 with the latest news 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.369
 in sandals 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.369
 of the brand and the dirty 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.020
 in the night model 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.750
 It is a specifically designed model 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.970
 for the mountain and 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.060
 so technical grounds 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.210
 and with some main characteristics 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.170
 some are unique in this in this 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.660
 model and others are inherited from models 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.100
 that we have reviewed previously but 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.869
 well let's talk little by little about this 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.640
 the presentation as always box 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.640
 simple cardboard 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.000
 small complete as tie materials 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.960
 etc 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.960
 Y 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.960
 4 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.260
 we are going to 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.480
 to look at the characteristics a 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:15.260
 little according to the manufacturer the weight is 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.480
 125 grams is still a good weight 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.980
 compared some traditional shoe or 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.830
 maybe even with some others 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.400
 sandals with sandals in weight weight 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.400
 minimum 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.480
 the upper part comes with straps from 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.980
 Fastening system is exactly 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.430
 equal to the signa 2.0 model that wants 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.430
 to say that 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.290
 They are straps from 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.040
 high strength with anchors 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.160
 reinforced 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:57.220
 the front has 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.220
 a much softer cord for 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.410
 prevent friction between the fingers that 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.410
 plus 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.790
 and good the anchoring system is 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.710
 simple 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:16.040
 a small click and we already have it inside 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:19.970
 the sole the part where the foot rests 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.160
 rough with small incisions for 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.290
 favor the grip that does not slip on 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.180
 foot 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.519
 and the main novelty comes in the sole 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.709
 on the outside where we 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.719
 so we found a good surface 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.030
 very different from everything seen 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:42.079
 previously at least for me in what 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.079
 what sandals are you referring 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.810
 a pretty aggressive drawing 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.710
 of vibra sole of course I do not know if it 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.710
 if it is appreciated there 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:02.030
 pretty aggressive and aggressive drawing like 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:04.940
 I say ideal to face the mountain 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.510
 ground with stones 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.540
 powder 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.349
 the good bulk more or less can be 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.380
 appreciate the data are 95 millimeters of 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:20.260
 rubber 9 centimeters and a half true 9 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.320
 millimeters and a half and 2 millimeters and 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.120
 half d 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.490
 of tacos 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.180
 that is to say in total the summing would come 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.830
 about 12 millimeters a centimeter with 2 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.570
 of thickness that good 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.850
 compared with slippers 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.720
 Traditional mountain trailers is 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.260
 something ridiculous 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:49.730
 as I said 125 grams of weight in size 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:53.020
 42 this is 143 maybe that some more 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.020
 but good 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.150
 another novelty that comes has been manufactured 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.389
 with different colors in this case has 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.970
 Well sent that is a very nice color 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.689
 the olive green east with a surface 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.520
 Brown 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:12.509
 and flexibility as well 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.509
 here you can see 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.160
 a little more you have to add at least 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.920
 have seen the previous unboxing that 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.990
 I've done it because it's very similar to 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.590
 last of the assigned 2.0 that here 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.590
 I leave the link 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.550
 but you have to look at the 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.750
 specific novelties of this model that 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.350
 certainly promise 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:42.490
 It promises a lot I like to go out 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.980
 the mountain by the mountain running on land 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.720
 with the guarachas that is really 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.020
 with the previous ones at least with the 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.890
 signa 2.0 because I've got almost where 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.100
 I wanted but maybe with this 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:06:00.390
 model give me 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:02.760
 a security that maybe could with 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.680
 the previous models I did not dare to 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.090
 obama quieter with this 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.560
 probably face certain 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.520
 stretches of land 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.590
 with more security in any case 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.280
 good when they do a few kilometers 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.610
 I will share some first tests with 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.480
 your 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:27.350
 photos and the first sensations 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.350
 and until here 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.969
 the review 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:32.969
 see you later
