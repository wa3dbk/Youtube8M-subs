00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
also has 43 it's like 30 frames it looks

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.300 
also has 43 it's like 30 frames it looks
like<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.230> it's<00:00:28.230> plus<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.590> billion<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.099> block

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
like this it's plus a billion on block

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.650 
like this it's plus a billion on block
it's<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.609> plus<00:00:29.820> 12<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.269> something<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.599> that

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
it's like plus 12 or something like that

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.200 
it's like plus 12 or something like that
really<00:00:30.960> good<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.579> startup<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.059> its

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
really good but it's the startup on its

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.610 
really good but it's the startup on its
really<00:00:33.570> really<00:00:33.690> long<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.230> don't<00:00:34.410> know<00:00:34.469> how

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
really really long so I don't know how

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.950 
really really long so I don't know how
useful<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.670> Zod<00:00:35.940> also<00:00:36.239> has<00:00:36.390> standing

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
useful that is but Zod also has standing

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.959 
useful that is but Zod also has standing
lows<00:00:37.230> he<00:00:37.890> has<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:38.850> they

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
lows he has that one in that one they

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.780 
lows he has that one in that one they
both<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.300> strings<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:41.100> sort

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
both have strings that you can use sort

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
both have strings that you can use sort
of<00:00:41.879> interesting<00:00:42.270> standing<00:00:42.750> lows<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.170> sort<00:00:43.770> of

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
of interesting standing lows are sort of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.470 
of interesting standing lows are sort of
unique<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.760> they're<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.059> really<00:00:45.300> good

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
unique and they're really really good

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.180 
unique and they're really really good
because<00:00:45.899> most<00:00:46.289> people<00:00:46.500> tend<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> stand<00:00:47.010> when

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
because most people tend to stand when

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.020 
because most people tend to stand when
you<00:00:47.280> stand<00:00:47.520> next<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.789> them<00:00:47.940> at<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.989> habit<00:00:49.440> of

you stand next to them at a habit of

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.369 
you stand next to them at a habit of
being<00:00:51.030> scared<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.510> overhead<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:51.989> down<00:00:52.170> one

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
being scared of the overhead is down one

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.380 
being scared of the overhead is down one

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
choose the speed of EDS you saw right

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.630 
choose the speed of EDS you saw right
there<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.450> super<00:01:25.049> slow<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.070> right<00:01:26.220> there<00:01:26.430> is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
a lot faster and then there's a speed in

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.600 
a lot faster and then there's a speed in
between<00:01:28.470> those<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.070> also<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.400> them<00:01:29.520> in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
between those two we can also do them in

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.640 
between those two we can also do them in
the<00:01:29.700> air<00:01:29.850> like<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:31.829> slow

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
the air like that really really slow

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.950 
the air like that really really slow
faster<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.250> he<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.490> use<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:36.000> mask<00:01:36.780> his

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
faster and so he can use it to mask his

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.620 
faster and so he can use it to mask his
entrance<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.579> use<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.820> slow<00:01:39.390> one

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
entrance so like if you use the slow one

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.410 
entrance so like if you use the slow one
and<00:01:40.070> then<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.369> dash<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.180> actually

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and then you like dash you can actually

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.780 
and then you like dash you can actually
pass<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.350> here<00:01:43.680> I'll<00:01:44.369> get<00:01:44.579> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
pass it up as you see here I'll get that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.120 
pass it up as you see here I'll get that
sick<00:01:45.180> set<00:01:45.479> up<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> meter<00:01:46.079> burn<00:01:46.320> wall<00:01:46.590> oh<00:01:46.829> my

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
sick set up to the meter burn wall oh my

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.249 
sick set up to the meter burn wall oh my
god<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.509> got<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.840> guys<00:01:48.960> get<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
god but you get to got you guys get the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.719 
god but you get to got you guys get the
idea<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.680> really<00:01:49.950> really<00:01:50.189> slow<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.610> when

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
idea so it's really really slow and when

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.450 
idea so it's really really slow and when
you<00:01:50.820> meet<00:01:51.000> or<00:01:51.119> burn<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.860> shoots<00:01:53.040> out<00:01:53.189> three

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you meet or burn it it shoots out three

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.770 
you meet or burn it it shoots out three
just<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.329> you're<00:01:54.450> doing<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
just like that if you're doing on the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.289 
just like that if you're doing on the
ground<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.770> guys<00:01:55.950> saw<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.189> earlier<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:57.090> two

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
ground you guys saw it earlier one two

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.179 
ground you guys saw it earlier one two
three<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.930> then<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.259> get<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.070> get<00:01:59.159> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
three and then you get the you can get a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.660 
three and then you get the you can get a
combo<00:01:59.520> after<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.570> kind<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.750> cool<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
combo after it it's kind of cool that

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.350 
combo after it it's kind of cool that
projectiles<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:02.939> interesting<00:02:03.329> because

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
projectiles really interesting because

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.660 
projectiles really interesting because
it<00:02:03.960> allows<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.740> control<00:02:04.920> space<00:02:05.310> really

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
it allows you to control space really

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.240 
it allows you to control space really
really<00:02:05.850> well<00:02:06.320> no<00:02:07.320> other<00:02:07.439> project<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> game

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
really well no other project on the game

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.040 
really well no other project on the game
really<00:02:08.459> lets<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.819> control<00:02:09.209> space<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.869> that

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
really lets you control space like that

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.360 
really lets you control space like that
so<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> think<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:10.530> really<00:02:10.830> cool<00:02:11.039> whether

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so I think that's really cool whether

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.410 
so I think that's really cool whether
it's<00:02:11.580> incredibly<00:02:12.360> useful<00:02:12.540> or<00:02:12.810> not<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:12.989> guess

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
it's incredibly useful or not I guess

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.720 
it's incredibly useful or not I guess
see<00:02:13.630> what<00:02:13.810> time<00:02:14.020> but<00:02:14.430> that's<00:02:15.430> really

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
see what time but that's really

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.300 
see what time but that's really
interesting<00:02:15.880> because<00:02:16.739> if<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.800> character<00:02:18.010> tries

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
interesting because if a character tries

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.500 
interesting because if a character tries
to<00:02:18.430> go<00:02:18.550> up<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.910> can<00:02:19.630> test<00:02:19.900> Zod's<00:02:20.709> air<00:02:21.010> control

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
to go up and can test Zod's air control

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.910 
to go up and can test Zod's air control
then<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.870> uh<00:02:22.900> that's<00:02:23.349> really<00:02:23.560> good<00:02:23.680> he<00:02:23.800> also

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
then that uh that's really good he also

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.070 
then that uh that's really good he also
has<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.220> move<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.640> air<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.750> is<00:02:25.840> sort<00:02:26.050> of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
has this move in the air this is sort of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.630 
has this move in the air this is sort of
like<00:02:26.170> his<00:02:26.349> calm<00:02:26.590> blender<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:27.280> if<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.489> end

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
like his calm blender so like if you end

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.920 
like his calm blender so like if you end
a<00:02:27.700> string<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.180> combo<00:02:28.510> like<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.840> do

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
a string in a combo like you do

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.449 
a string in a combo like you do
something<00:02:29.170> like<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.410> then<00:02:30.040> that's<00:02:30.280> his

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
something like this then that's his

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.520 
something like this then that's his
common<00:02:30.730> wonder<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.209> ends<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.870> it's

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
common wonder it ends like that it's

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.900 
common wonder it ends like that it's
really<00:02:32.680> interesting<00:02:32.980> move<00:02:33.250> especially<00:02:33.520> since

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
really interesting move especially since

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.449 
really interesting move especially since
you<00:02:34.030> can<00:02:34.180> do<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.360> airborne<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:36.160> sort<00:02:36.310> of

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
you can do it airborne and it's sort of

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.949 
you can do it airborne and it's sort of
like<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.580> quick<00:02:36.790> way<00:02:36.910> around<00:02:37.209> Oh<00:02:37.330> real<00:02:37.750> quick

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
like a quick way around Oh real quick

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.650 
like a quick way around Oh real quick
mention<00:02:38.140> his<00:02:38.350> down<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.770> looked<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.340> good

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
mention his down to looked really good

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.180 
mention his down to looked really good
so<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:41.019> might<00:02:41.200> be<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.350> really<00:02:41.590> good<00:02:41.800> anti<00:02:42.130> er<00:02:42.160> I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
so that might be a really good anti er I

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.830 
so that might be a really good anti er I
haven't<00:02:42.580> tested<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.940> properties<00:02:43.390> on<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.630> but

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
haven't tested the properties on it but

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.540 
haven't tested the properties on it but
just<00:02:43.959> by<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.200> way<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.560> looks<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.069> I<00:02:45.400> can

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
just by the way it looks and I can

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.400 
just by the way it looks and I can
imagine<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.030> hitbox<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.660> could<00:02:47.260> see<00:02:47.380> it

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
imagine the hitbox I could see it

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.870 
imagine the hitbox I could see it
actually<00:02:47.590> being<00:02:47.920> really<00:02:48.100> good<00:02:48.280> his<00:02:48.489> down<00:02:48.670> to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
actually being really good his down to

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.479 
actually being really good his down to
is<00:02:49.060> is<00:02:49.480> really<00:02:49.690> fast<00:02:50.050> really<00:02:50.319> good<00:02:50.590> looking<00:02:51.130> so

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
is is really fast really good looking so

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.880 
is is really fast really good looking so
I'm<00:02:52.209> attested<00:02:52.690> in<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.870> match<00:02:53.049> but<00:02:53.380> looks<00:02:53.680> pretty

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
I'm attested in a match but looks pretty

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.070 
I'm attested in a match but looks pretty
sick<00:02:54.100> his<00:02:55.060> other<00:02:55.180> special<00:02:55.600> moves<00:02:55.780> he<00:02:55.959> has<00:02:56.049> a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
sick his other special moves he has a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.949 
sick his other special moves he has a
three<00:02:56.350> very<00:02:56.830> looks<00:02:57.069> like<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.660> he<00:02:58.660> also<00:02:58.780> has

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
three very looks like that he also has

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.580 
the Phantom Zone punch and the
interesting<00:03:01.630> thing<00:03:01.780> about<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.500> that

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
interesting thing about this is that

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.500 
interesting thing about this is that
it's<00:03:03.190> minus<00:03:03.519> one<00:03:03.700> on<00:03:03.819> block<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.299> if<00:03:04.390> you're

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
it's minus one on block so if you're

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.820 
it's minus one on block so if you're
doing<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.750> block<00:03:04.989> string<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.380> notice<00:03:05.680> your

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
doing a block string you notice your

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.470 
doing a block string you notice your
opponent<00:03:06.220> blocks<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.819> can<00:03:06.940> cancel<00:03:07.180> into

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
opponent blocks it you can cancel into

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.050 
opponent blocks it you can cancel into
that<00:03:07.600> minus<00:03:07.900> one<00:03:08.049> block<00:03:08.350> pretty<00:03:08.950> safe<00:03:09.220> not<00:03:10.030> a

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
that minus one block pretty safe not a

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.670 
that minus one block pretty safe not a
bad<00:03:10.269> situation<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.840> be<00:03:10.959> in<00:03:10.989> meter<00:03:11.319> burn<00:03:11.530> it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
bad situation to be in meter burn it

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.470 
bad situation to be in meter burn it
looks<00:03:11.799> like<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.160> puts<00:03:12.940> him<00:03:13.060> into<00:03:13.150> that<00:03:13.299> nice

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
looks like this puts him into that nice

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.970 
looks like this puts him into that nice
little<00:03:13.630> diamond<00:03:14.140> sensitive<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.680> Phantom

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980

Zone<00:03:15.010> he<00:03:15.370> also<00:03:15.489> has<00:03:15.760> his<00:03:15.790> laser<00:03:16.299> beam<00:03:16.600> looks

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
Zone he also has his laser beam looks

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.720 
Zone he also has his laser beam looks
like<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.739> can<00:03:17.859> do<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.040> close<00:03:18.310> the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.819 
talk about his trait now his trade is
really<00:03:59.049> really<00:03:59.230> interesting<00:03:59.440> in<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.799> sense

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
really really interesting in the sense

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.710 
really really interesting in the sense
that<00:04:00.130> it's<00:04:00.850> one<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.180> first<00:04:01.329> I<00:04:01.540> think

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
that it's one of the first I think

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.880 
that it's one of the first I think
summons<00:04:02.049> we<00:04:02.170> have<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.500> game<00:04:02.680> there's

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
summons we have in the game there's

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.050 
summons we have in the game there's
nothing<00:04:03.160> else<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.489> can<00:04:03.670> think<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.910> like

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
nothing else that I can think of like

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.460 
nothing else that I can think of like
this<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:04.540> summons<00:04:05.019> a<00:04:05.079> little<00:04:05.260> creature

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
this so it summons a little creature

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.380 
this so it summons a little creature
over<00:04:05.650> here<00:04:05.859> you<00:04:05.950> see<00:04:06.130> from<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.030> Phantom<00:04:07.329> Zone

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
over here you see from the Phantom Zone

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.059 
over here you see from the Phantom Zone
if<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:07.900> hit<00:04:08.049> be<00:04:08.230> if<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.440> just<00:04:08.620> mash<00:04:08.799> it<00:04:08.980> he

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
if you hit be if you just mash it he

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.879 
if you hit be if you just mash it he
swings<00:04:09.340> at<00:04:09.489> him<00:04:10.079> so<00:04:11.079> again<00:04:11.350> this<00:04:11.500> this<00:04:11.799> is

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
swings at him so again this this is

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:12.930 
swings at him so again this this is
probably<00:04:12.100> one<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.400> interesting<00:04:12.579> thing

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
probably one of the interesting thing

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.140 
probably one of the interesting thing
about<00:04:12.970> Zod<00:04:13.450> in<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.959> sense<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.790> his<00:04:15.790> air

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
about Zod in the sense that his air

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.690 
about Zod in the sense that his air
control<00:04:16.570> is<00:04:16.750> really<00:04:17.169> good<00:04:17.380> because<00:04:18.160> he<00:04:18.549> can

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
control is really good because he can

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.009 
control is really good because he can
sort<00:04:18.940> of<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.180> do<00:04:19.299> that<00:04:19.479> kind<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.750> thing<00:04:19.810> with

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
sort of just do that kind of thing with

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.020 
sort of just do that kind of thing with
the<00:04:20.139> trait<00:04:20.410> going<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:21.160> it's<00:04:21.340> like<00:04:21.549> you

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
the trait going on and it's like you

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.490 
the trait going on and it's like you
have<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.419> deal<00:04:22.570> with<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:22.930> have<00:04:23.229> to<00:04:23.349> really

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
have to deal with it you have to really

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.440 
have to deal with it you have to really
respect<00:04:23.950> it<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.280> as<00:04:24.729> you<00:04:24.849> can<00:04:24.970> see<00:04:25.000> why<00:04:25.390> the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
respect it and as you can see why the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.580 
respect it and as you can see why the
little<00:04:25.659> thing<00:04:25.840> rebuilding<00:04:26.320> its

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
little thing rebuilding its

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.750 
little thing rebuilding its
on<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.800> bottom<00:04:26.949> it<00:04:27.250> doesn't<00:04:27.520> take<00:04:27.639> an

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
on the bottom it doesn't take an

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.430 
on the bottom it doesn't take an
incredibly<00:04:28.210> long<00:04:28.419> time<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.870> come<00:04:29.020> back<00:04:29.169> it's

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
incredibly long time to come back it's

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
interesting trait i like how is straight

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.300 
interesting trait i like how is straight
looks<00:04:57.970> again<00:04:58.840> another<00:04:59.139> really<00:04:59.470> way<00:04:59.590> too<00:04:59.620> good

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
looks again another really way too good

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.270 
looks again another really way too good
way<00:05:00.460> to<00:05:00.520> control<00:05:00.910> space<00:05:01.180> so<00:05:01.660> yeah<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:02.530> think

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
way to control space so yeah I think

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.550 
way to control space so yeah I think
that<00:05:03.400> about<00:05:03.430> covers<00:05:03.639> most<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.510> Zod's<00:05:04.810> moves<00:05:05.229> i

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
that about covers most of Zod's moves i

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.590 
that about covers most of Zod's moves i
think<00:05:05.770> there's<00:05:06.130> if<00:05:06.550> there's<00:05:06.610> special<00:05:07.180> mention

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
think there's if there's special mention

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.719 
think there's if there's special mention
that<00:05:07.750> i<00:05:07.840> need<00:05:07.990> to<00:05:08.110> show<00:05:08.380> off<00:05:08.530> oh<00:05:08.710> one<00:05:09.700> thing

that i need to show off oh one thing

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.610 
that i need to show off oh one thing

you can see he actually hits kind of

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.810 
you can see he actually hits kind of
hard<00:05:35.169> thirty-nine<00:05:35.560> percent<00:05:35.680> for<00:05:36.430> a<00:05:36.520> bar<00:05:36.700> is

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
hard thirty-nine percent for a bar is

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.909 
hard thirty-nine percent for a bar is
actually<00:05:37.120> pretty<00:05:37.240> good<00:05:37.450> you<00:05:38.380> know<00:05:38.470> if<00:05:38.590> you<00:05:38.710> if

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
actually pretty good you know if you if

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.200 
actually pretty good you know if you if
you<00:05:39.010> start<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.310> convo<00:05:39.610> grounded<00:05:40.060> its

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
you start the convo grounded its

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.020 
you start the convo grounded its
thirty-eight<00:05:40.570> percent<00:05:40.720> but<00:05:41.139> yeah<00:05:41.669> so<00:05:42.669> he

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
thirty-eight percent but yeah so he

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.400 
thirty-eight percent but yeah so he
looked<00:05:43.180> really<00:05:43.330> cool<00:05:43.570> I<00:05:43.900> think<00:05:44.200> he's<00:05:44.320> probably

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
looked really cool I think he's probably

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.839 
looked really cool I think he's probably
going<00:05:44.650> to<00:05:44.740> end<00:05:44.770> up<00:05:44.889> hitting<00:05:45.070> kind<00:05:45.430> of<00:05:45.550> hard<00:05:45.760> to

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
going to end up hitting kind of hard to

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.690 
going to end up hitting kind of hard to
and<00:05:46.720> he<00:05:46.840> has<00:05:46.990> cool<00:05:47.200> looking<00:05:47.440> zone<00:05:47.650> zoning<00:05:48.340> /

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
and he has cool looking zone zoning /

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.360 
and he has cool looking zone zoning /
space<00:05:48.970> control<00:05:49.479> so<00:05:49.870> yeah<00:05:50.620> Zod<00:05:50.950> looks<00:05:51.160> really

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
space control so yeah Zod looks really

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.500 
space control so yeah Zod looks really
cool<00:05:51.520> so<00:05:51.760> far<00:05:51.940> he<00:05:52.120> looks<00:05:52.270> really<00:05:52.389> interesting

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
and hopefully he's actually difficult to

and hopefully he's actually difficult to
play<00:05:55.090> that'd<00:05:55.330> be<00:05:55.479> a<00:05:55.510> first<00:05:55.720> for<00:05:55.900> this<00:05:56.110> game<00:05:56.289> but
