00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello dear friends today 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:10.170
 we will need pancakes 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:15.420
 4 eggs 3 tablespoons sugar 1 teaspoon 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.789
 spoon of salt and baking powder three 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.830
 tablespoons vegetable oil liter 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:28.130
 milk and flour will take to taste 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.130
 pour sugar pour salt and 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:51.170
 baking powder dough and alpha oil 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:04.120
 and pour out half the milk well 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.490
 mix better 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:20.630
 I will score a spoon 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:24.380
 You can also stir the city with a spoon with milk 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:32.590
 sugar stocks when we all went we 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:32.590
 now add flour sift 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.170
 so we should have to learn first 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.700
 there are few little places like pancakes 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.009
 I 'll add more flour 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.619
 and look what dough should be 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.479
 see the leg is worth it as little 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.950
 Okay, we let him stand 10-15 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.280
 let it stand and then dilute it 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.789
 milk and see what dough 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.560
 it turned out it has become homogeneous if 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.679
 whisk of course no need to wait 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.510
 and the spoon is necessary to hand all dismissed 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:18.069
 now add the rest of the hammer and you 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.069
 already starting to knead 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.830
 while I will stir and here is a catch 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.100
 dough turned out see no lumps 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:37.910
 great maybe somewhere else and stayed there 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.740
 learn well you can bake pancakes too 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.570
 I had to add a little more liquid 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.290
 because it was a gustav 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.290
 such a
