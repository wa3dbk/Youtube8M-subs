00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
they can be very profitable under the

they can be very profitable under the
right<00:01:04.089> circumstances<00:01:04.950> the<00:01:05.950> problem<00:01:06.370> is<00:01:06.520> those

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
right circumstances the problem is those

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.720 
right circumstances the problem is those
circumstances<00:01:07.900> are<00:01:07.960> nowhere<00:01:08.440> near<00:01:08.680> as<00:01:09.220> common

as<00:01:10.420> most<00:01:10.750> players<00:01:11.050> think<00:01:11.410> for<00:01:12.310> example<00:01:12.370> let's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
as most players think for example let's

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.510 
as most players think for example let's
say<00:01:13.330> you're<00:01:13.480> holding<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.870> 8<00:01:14.080> 9<00:01:14.410> offsuit<00:01:14.710> 8<00:01:15.310> of

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
say you're holding the 8 9 offsuit 8 of

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.480 
say you're holding the 8 9 offsuit 8 of
clubs<00:01:15.840> 9<00:01:16.840> of<00:01:16.990> spades<00:01:17.230> in<00:01:17.470> middle<00:01:18.040> position<00:01:18.370> at

clubs 9 of spades in middle position at

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.490 
clubs 9 of spades in middle position at
a<00:01:18.550> fairly<00:01:18.910> loose<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.420> agressive<00:01:19.840> table<00:01:20.170> is

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
a fairly loose and agressive table is

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.140 
a fairly loose and agressive table is
this<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.770> hand<00:01:21.070> you<00:01:21.160> want<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.430> play<00:01:21.610> in<00:01:21.730> the<00:01:21.850> spot

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
this a hand you want to play in the spot

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.700 
this a hand you want to play in the spot
of<00:01:22.390> course<00:01:23.200> not

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
of course not

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.010 
of course not
so<00:01:24.130> why<00:01:24.280> does<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.460> hand<00:01:24.700> suddenly<00:01:25.030> become<00:01:25.510> so

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
so why does a hand suddenly become so

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.530 
so why does a hand suddenly become so
much<00:01:26.230> more<00:01:26.290> attractive<00:01:27.070> if<00:01:27.280> it's<00:01:27.760> 9<00:01:28.150> 8<00:01:28.420> of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
much more attractive if it's 9 8 of

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.290 
much more attractive if it's 9 8 of
hearts<00:01:28.870> you're<00:01:29.560> still<00:01:29.950> only<00:01:30.160> holding<00:01:30.700> 9<00:01:30.910> hi

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
hearts you're still only holding 9 hi

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.160 
hearts you're still only holding 9 hi
and<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:32.830> fact<00:01:33.070> that<00:01:33.160> it's<00:01:33.340> suited<00:01:33.730> yeah<00:01:34.720> great

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
and the fact that it's suited yeah great

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.300 
and the fact that it's suited yeah great
that's<00:01:35.590> gonna<00:01:35.740> help<00:01:35.950> you<00:01:36.070> maybe<00:01:36.220> 2%<00:01:37.030> maybe<00:01:37.780> 3%

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that's gonna help you maybe 2% maybe 3%

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.500 
that's gonna help you maybe 2% maybe 3%
the<00:01:39.310> reason<00:01:39.580> players<00:01:39.820> love<00:01:40.180> suited

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
the reason players love suited

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.210 
the reason players love suited
connectors<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:41.110> because<00:01:41.620> they<00:01:41.770> think<00:01:42.040> they'll

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
connectors is because they think they'll

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.480 
connectors is because they think they'll
get<00:01:42.340> paid<00:01:42.610> off<00:01:42.790> for<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.060> big<00:01:43.450> pot<00:01:43.800> if<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:45.250> when
