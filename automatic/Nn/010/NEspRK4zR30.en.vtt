00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.559
 hello and welcome to our home 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.969
 express if you have just come from 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.499
 launch in the destiny beta by 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.910
 example thanks to the three codes that each 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.890
 pre-order abnormally allowed 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.570
 to get you wondering probably 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.520
 some choose it between type in 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.500
 arcane hunter east so here is 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.780
 some info to make the right choice 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.560
 Titan is the most resistant thanks to 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.880
 his heavy armor 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.960
 it's a good choice if they find a 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.100
 cover is not what you 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.690
 prefer in the fps 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.280
 it's not as mobile as the 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.510
 hunter of course but he is not 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.519
 bad melee thanks to a 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.289
 electric impact that super attack is 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.890
 a ground blow that generates damage on 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.480
 an area of ​​effect 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.920
 he can also create a shield 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.699
 protector very useful for his 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.289
 companions in arms 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.749
 let's go to the hunters which is a class 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.550
 light fast and versatile it is a little 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:49.929
 sniper but not only since he's 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.089
 also formidable in close combat 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:53.469
 on the other hand the hunter is fragile his 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.059
 double jump is the best of all 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.100
 while on the other hand his super hit under 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.239
 the shape of three powerful shot misses a 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.100
 little effects whaou 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.389
 the arc to nice finally and the intellectual of the 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.889
 group but it's also the one who 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:05.110
 holds the power in the palm of his hand 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:07.240
 his double jump once improved himself 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.340
 turns squarely into teleportation and 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.079
 this is the class that super attack is 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.299
 delicate enough to master in terms of 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.579
 targeting while his pomegranate is rather 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.710
 easy to place however the super 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.479
 improve $ can it makes it squarely 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.520
 turn enemies into bombs which 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.200
 always does its little effect in summary 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.759
 the titan has the choice of the survivor the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.869
 hunter one of the most 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.189
 what he is and what they like 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.899
 adapt to the situation 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.420
 while the organist is one of 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.490
 dealers original and stylish even though 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.079
 destiny looks like a mmo there is 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.000
 however no obligation to respect 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.829
 the trinity as a healer and ps 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.840
 so do not be too many fears 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.950
 when to choose the next doom 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.229
 will be called doom 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.909
 I know it's amazing we would like 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.229
 well have some pictures especially those 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.509
 which were shown a few hours ago 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.189
 to the comne duvet but this content was 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.170
 in theory reserved for people on 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.399
 square 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.329
 it's heidi software that is 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.789
 joysticks what to call 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.619
 a reboot of the famous poster series of 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.359
 the story no revolution to good old 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.159
 laboratory on mars with lots of big 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.620
 weird monsters inside the demo 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.210
 presented sought to show the year 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.890
 auzits and and the dynamism of the fighting 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.390
 the essential will of course be the gunfight 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.670
 but hand-to-hand attacks have 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.410
 of course not been forgotten yorker option 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.430
 in contact and the chainsaw will be 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.020
 obviously part 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.850
 we also know that the hero will be 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.710
 able to double summit that he will not be able 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.240
 not regenerate his health even though the 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.470
 victory over some opponents him 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.460
 will allow to recover the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.620
 descriptions of his first images 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.850
 confirm that the game remains very gore this 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.590
 which should reassure the fans 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.840
 the great novelty of this new album 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.280
 will be the introduction of multiplayer doom 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.770
 is developed on the heidi engine 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.410
 taxis it is advertised in 1080p and 60 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.570
 fps only on pc ps 4 and peekbox 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.760
 one on a date so far unknown 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.350
 the project of an uncharted movie could 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.150
 may have broken the curse of 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.840
 adaptations of games to the cinema all 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.070
 world has the right to dream 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.840
 we now know that filming 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.610
 should start early 2015 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.900
 evoked for almost four years the 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.490
 project is first passed between the 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.750
 hands of david o russell to whom we owe 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.850
 lately the very successful 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.890
 american the only one before being taken over by 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.550
 neil burger who realized limitless and 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.140
 divergent 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.430
 all that was before the project was 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.620
 finally entrusted to seth gordon 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.250
 especially known for the movie how 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.840
 kill his boss 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.430
 the latter is aware of the importance 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.530
 the choice of the actor who will embody 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.940
 nathan drake on the big screen the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.500
 director seems confident in the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.820
 script that should resume 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.890
 highlights of the first episode 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.780
 while adding own inventions 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.280
 reliable for the title role seth gordon 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.050
 wants above all to find a talented actor 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.910
 rather than focusing on a wave 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.860
 physical resemblance to the face 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.030
 invented by naughty dog ​​it's obvious 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.350
 that this series has great potential 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.030
 cinematographic 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.680
 hope that the talent and the budget 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.540
 will be at the rendezvous to make 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.340
 justice to this superb saga 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.660
 the question of the day comes from julien 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.370
 who are worried about the effects of announcement 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.750
 microsoft drastic so that's right 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.910
 dismissals and closures 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.440
 announced by microsoft will hurt 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.690
 and especially to our cases as explained 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.730
 nicolas in the fresh news of this morning 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.530
 on the xbox side the effects should 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.790
 in theory remain limited and despite the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.660
 closing the studio they box 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.280
 entertainment 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.260
 we know that the series has and water 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.760
 nightfall headed by spielberg is 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.530
 maintained as well as the series that will be 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.970
 dedicated to the villains of planting break 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.710
 another exclusivity 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.020
 xbox we finally know that teams 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.610
 dedicated to xbox one for europe the 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.070
 Middle East and Africa will be 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.080
 severely impacted it even evokes 75% 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.820
 dismissal for this installed team 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.440
 in England gamer express it's over 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.120
 for this week we meet again on Monday 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.120
