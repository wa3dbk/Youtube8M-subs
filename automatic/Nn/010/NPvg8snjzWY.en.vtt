00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.230
 a little sore we want we could 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.460
 see on screen I think and 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.460
 in the end we are left with nothing 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.730
 it does not take long 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.950
 this takes what he has done is a 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.630
 goal we could not 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.490
 They have done something better than us but 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.340
 we believe that the first time we have 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.440
 done well enough saved is 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.670
 missing the ball in the goal 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.730
 if you do not score everything much more difficult 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.590
 we know that national has made a good 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.350
 stop ball goal 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.610
 and that with that he reached but nothing 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.550
 we are hurt because we believe that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.270
 we could have tied 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.900
 and we could not 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.900
 roman 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.570
 I do not know what game is the one that had 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.570
 because that's not all last semester 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.030
 and we know we have a new employee 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.660
 and nothing much tranquility is a 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.660
 coach that 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.680
 always shows a lot of security 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.120
 and nothing not us and we believe that we have 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.850
 fact 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.990
 a good match certainly not that the 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.840
 people I think we have our 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.400
 treatment still confident with our 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.080
 coach in the team that we have and 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.080
 good so we can qualify 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.820
 we do not do our best to win 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.820
 the flow is won, the tie is lost 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.010
 our hope is to reach the end 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.770
 to a 14 cup match 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.259
 esteban 3 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.759
 because we are nine points 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.520
 we will try to classify and then if 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.259
 we are lucky we will try to do the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.170
 government in our illusion is to play the 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.880
 14 matches sometimes you can sometimes not 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.479
 we know that people are very excited 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.640
 with the cup we also but it is very 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.530
 difficult is not not as easy as 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.700
 as we 've got used to everything 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.650
 what we have the luck to be here in 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.240
 this club but we believe that in fact 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.420
 we have made a good match that 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.740
 we deserved something bad and that national with 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.229
 a stopped ball took the match 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.009
 so more to congratulate in terms of 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.009
 roman analysis 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.000
 yes but that's good because 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.040
 does that for something you opposite with the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.930
 Asked if you told me we are in 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.250
 debt means that with little to 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.200
 the opposite is taking a lot 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.450
 football has those things that's why it's 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.610
 so cute us at some time the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.020
 ball will enter that surely 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.580
 tomorrow we are going to count all the 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.950
 situations that we have and are going to have 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.020
 very much but good football wins 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.180
 getting good and they marked luminous 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.709
 throne in terms of roman analysis 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.750
 which is what rescues as the most 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.400
 transcendent mouth today and where 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.290
 you feel that something was missing 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.410
 we believe that we have handled the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.390
 ball much better than Sunday that 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.170
 we have been a protagonist during the 90s 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.440
 minutes 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.700
 for the last 10 minutes is where 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.819
 we started throwing the ball to the area 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.829
 where out there 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.829
 we let try to play a little more but 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.620
 but nothing we do not think we've done 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.909
 merits to score a goal we could not 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.249
 and that now we have to rest for 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.749
 the match on roman Sunday to Carlos 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.790
 bianchi asked him after much 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:23.740
 time followed by two games 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.319
 I 'm asking that as a terminal 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.709
 all right 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.730
 worried because we know that in the cup 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.150
 we have two games we both lost 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.099
 of local and that for 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.510
 to have a lot of chance to classify 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.239
 one has to make that effort at home 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.270
 so well we still know that 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.070
 we have nine points to play 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.900
 that if we do it well we will have 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.480
 possibility of moving to the next phase 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.220
 and well we're going to try what is normal 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.400
 lose from seeing him lose to mouth 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.230
 local 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.840
 and as I said to the boys 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.480
 we have many years have club win 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.890
 used to always in the cup 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.069
 let's get to the end we 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.810
 also the technician also 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.939
 but we also have to be aware 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.019
 that time passes from others 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.599
 they also have the same action as 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.310
 us but we will try not 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.490
 We believe that we still have the same 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.530
 chance that others and what 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.209
 we hope to be in the next phase very 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.330
 what is the strongest team that gives us 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.160
 this of all these group matches 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.990
 the cup 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.060
 they come to party match us 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.950
 we know that we still have nine 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.400
 points in play we want to classify and 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.620
 later we will see what happens nine points 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.710
 romÃ¡n and carlos was very optimistic trust 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.240
 in being able to win these games and imagine 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.610
 the group is also not the message for 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.379
 the fans 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.070
 we are calm we believe that 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.570
 we made a good match 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.570
 sometimes these things happen 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.680
 we know that always in a way that 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.090
 plays very well you have to improve when 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.240
 you play well also when you play badly 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.920
 It has to improve but we also have 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.040
 to be aware that you win by marking 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.740
 no goals and nothing we have created we believe 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.080
 many situations we could not find 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.580
 me with a good center with a header from 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.700
 reached to take three points like this 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.110
 that we hope in Uruguay we play 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.110
 in the same way and mark all
