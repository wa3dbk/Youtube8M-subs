intruder kind of communicator inside

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.680 
intruder kind of communicator inside
here<00:01:50.610> how<00:01:50.909> does<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.120> work<00:01:51.270> well<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
here how does that work well that's the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.480 
here how does that work well that's the
personal<00:01:52.080> communicator<00:01:52.560> which<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.950> also<00:01:53.250> an

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
personal communicator which is also an

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.410 
personal communicator which is also an
option<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.940> on<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.950> xc70<00:01:55.950> v70<00:01:56.550> and<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:56.970> s80

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
option on on the xc70 v70 and the s80

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.899 
option on on the xc70 v70 and the s80
it's<00:01:58.050> it's<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.620> built<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.190> heartbeat<00:01:59.520> sensor

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
it's it's a built in a heartbeat sensor

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.410 
it's it's a built in a heartbeat sensor
so<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.690> someone<00:02:00.960> breaks<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.470> your<00:02:01.590> car<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
so if someone breaks into your car and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.760 
so if someone breaks into your car and
is<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> car<00:02:03.840> at<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> time<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.470> gives<00:02:04.590> you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
is in the car at the time it gives you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.460 
is in the car at the time it gives you
warning<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.280> your<00:02:05.760> remote<00:02:06.030> control<00:02:06.510> okay

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the car has broken in because it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.020
