effects<00:02:48.689> a<00:02:48.870> change<00:02:49.110> color<00:02:49.379> so<00:02:49.890> let's<00:02:50.099> select

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
effects a change color so let's select

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.330

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
one I don't recommend any of the color

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.460 
one I don't recommend any of the color
curves<00:02:53.640> effects<00:02:54.299> since<00:02:54.840> they<00:02:55.019> don't<00:02:55.140> allow

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
curves effects since they don't allow

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.910

you<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.829> change<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.220> colors<00:02:56.549> accurately

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
you to change the colors accurately

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.380 
you to change the colors accurately
instead<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.099> suggest<00:02:59.610> using<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.150> color

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
instead I suggest using the color

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.319 
instead I suggest using the color
correction<00:03:01.049> effect<00:03:01.579> these<00:03:02.579> are<00:03:02.790> much<00:03:03.060> better

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
correction effect these are much better

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.720 
correction effect these are much better
just<00:03:04.260> mess<00:03:04.530> around<00:03:04.560> with<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.129> settings<00:03:05.159> and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
just mess around with the settings and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:15.970 
just mess around with the settings and
if<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.120> like<00:03:06.299> something<00:03:06.540> keep<00:03:07.110> it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.730 

okay<00:03:16.980> let's<00:03:17.640> look<00:03:17.820> at<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.120> transitions<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
okay let's look at the transitions the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.010 
okay let's look at the transitions the
transition<00:03:20.370> you'll<00:03:20.520> be<00:03:20.700> using<00:03:21.330> most<00:03:21.810> is

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:46.820 
look at the properties of the new piece

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.910 
look at the properties of the new piece
you<00:07:47.570> see<00:07:47.810> that<00:07:48.020> they<00:07:48.170> are<00:07:48.200> exactly<00:07:48.710> the<00:07:48.890> same
