size difference between the federal and
the<00:02:36.470> nitro<00:02:36.770> HD<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:37.250> definitely<00:02:38.150> noticeable

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the nitro HD is definitely noticeable

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.330 
the nitro HD is definitely noticeable
however<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.290> nitro<00:02:39.560> HD<00:02:39.590> toward<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.130> razor

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
however the nitro HD toward the razor

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.940 
however the nitro HD toward the razor
it's<00:02:40.940> actually<00:02:41.060> about<00:02:41.270> the<00:02:41.510> same<00:02:41.540> height<00:02:42.410> same

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
it's actually about the same height same

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.190 
it's actually about the same height same
width<00:02:43.250> however<00:02:44.000> this<00:02:44.180> has<00:02:44.330> rounded<00:02:44.780> corners

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
width however this has rounded corners

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.050 
width however this has rounded corners
so<00:02:45.770> it's<00:02:45.890> not<00:02:46.010> going<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.220> feel<00:02:46.370> as<00:02:46.520> rough<00:02:46.820> on

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
so it's not going to feel as rough on

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.230 
so it's not going to feel as rough on
