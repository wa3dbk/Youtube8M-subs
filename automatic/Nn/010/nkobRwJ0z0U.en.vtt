00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.520
 before heating horse must pass 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.470
 in all view while step so that it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.890
 recognize an environment and miss 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.270
 curiosity having this precaution he does not 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.810
 will be scared of nothing 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.349
 the animal must work to the relaxed mansion 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.180
 very quiet with the loose reins 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.579
 after the track is recognized 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.960
 horse must always be heated to the palace 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.440
 to trot and gallop during trot is already 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.580
 begins the flexing part of luca 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.540
 increasing the degree of heating of the 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.180
 horse 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.190
 the animal should lower the back of the neck 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.760
 majority of the evidence the correct 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.990
 Horse's head is at the withers line 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.130
 especially in the corners where he wins 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.920
 more speed 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.560
 for this the rider must stretch the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.870
 arms forward holding the reins of the 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.960
 same size and then pull the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.259
 two arms down and back the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.270
 animal lower your head immediately 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.869
 just reach out two arms forward 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.539
 that the horse raises its head 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.979
 if the animal is somewhat resistant 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.049
 move the reins to both sides 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.259
 causing the bridle to move 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.189
 inside your mouth for all 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.710
 Exercises 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.439
 the initial position of the hands is this 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.450
 keeping the reins the same size 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.810
 the positioning of the hands is very 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.329
 important when pulling out the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.999
 two rulers press both legs to the 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.789
 at the same time one should not use the spore 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:47.369
 because the horse will want to run while 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.299
 The legs should first be pressed 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.909
 thighs 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.359
 if the horse does not respond, press 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.490
 calf or belly of the leg only in 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:00.630
 last case if the horse still does not 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.340
 to respond is that we use the spore to 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.840
 make the horse perform the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.060
 rib flexion 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.050
 it is also necessary to maintain the reins of the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.270
 same size to flex the horse 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.790
 to the left the right hand goes to 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.300
 front and left hand goes to the knee 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.910
 the right leg of the rider . 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.280
 The knight becomes loose while the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.480
 Left leg should press the belly 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.150
 of horse in sock 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.629
 a sequence we saw now little thigh 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.819
 calf and finally spurs when the 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.470
 animal is well at the palace press the 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.400
 leg so he starts to jog 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.860
 making the same circle to flex the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.810
 horse to the right, just reverse the 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.000
 positions of the hands and legs 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.239
 this is an exercise that should be 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.540
 repeated several times in fractionation 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.489
 The position of the hands and legs is 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.910
 similar to the exercise we have just 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.129
 see if the horse is flexing towards the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.379
 right the left hand goes forward 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.129
 and right behind the knee of the 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:04.739
 Knight 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.680
 the movement of my legs myself 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.450
 previous exercise to flex the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.540
 horse to the left is just 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.609
 reverse position of hands and legs 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.470
 In this exercise the horse walks to 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.160
 the same time it crosses the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.319
 hands 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.890
 This is very important to others. 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.879
 exercises that will come to the horse to postpone 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.980
 to the left 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.130
 the knight must press the leg 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.319
 right and release the left 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.319
 the two hands move to the side that 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.480
 the horse is going in detail 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.700
 we can see that it will make the horse go 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.950
 to his right hand the left hand of the 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.560
 knight stands up while the hand 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.200
 if the low is the reins of the 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.010
 same size and reversing when the 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.109
 direction changes the leg that 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.069
 who is in favor of the direction the horse 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.730
 is taking 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.980
 the other is loose in this image can we 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.410
 see that when the legs of the rider 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.389
 change the position the horse changes 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.160
 direction 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.630
 this exercise should not be repeated 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.280
 often followed 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.280
 today the horses do not like to boast
