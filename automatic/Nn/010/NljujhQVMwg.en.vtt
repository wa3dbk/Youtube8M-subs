00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.939 
the simple look you can see my eyes look
a<00:03:32.479> lot<00:03:32.599> bigger<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.049> more<00:03:33.139> open<00:03:33.500> because<00:03:33.680> I'm

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
a lot bigger and more open because I'm

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.259 
a lot bigger and more open because I'm
wearing<00:03:34.189> white<00:03:34.340> eye<00:03:34.519> shadow<00:03:34.549> which<00:03:34.939> opens<00:03:35.209> up

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
wearing white eye shadow which opens up

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.059 
wearing white eye shadow which opens up
the<00:03:35.419> eye<00:03:35.449> and<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.169> silver<00:03:36.470> underneath<00:03:36.680> also

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
the eye and the silver underneath also

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.399 
the eye and the silver underneath also
makes<00:03:37.220> your<00:03:37.340> eye<00:03:37.370> look<00:03:37.459> bigger<00:03:41.199> it's<00:03:42.199> not<00:03:42.319> the

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
makes your eye look bigger it's not the

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:43.899 
makes your eye look bigger it's not the
upper<00:03:42.650> eye<00:03:42.680> line<00:03:43.009> now<00:03:43.159> I'm<00:03:43.519> holding<00:03:43.759> the

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
upper eye line now I'm holding the

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.099 
upper eye line now I'm holding the
corner<00:03:44.209> that<00:03:44.329> I<00:03:44.389> just<00:03:44.569> made<00:03:44.689> here<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.019> I'm

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
corner that I just made here and I'm

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.689 
corner that I just made here and I'm
going<00:03:45.229> to<00:03:45.319> really<00:03:45.650> gently<00:03:46.040> tug<00:03:46.250> it<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.549> that

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
going to really gently tug it to that

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.159 
going to really gently tug it to that
one<00:03:46.879> I'm<00:03:46.970> pulling<00:03:47.269> this<00:03:47.359> across<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:47.959> doesn't

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
one I'm pulling this across it doesn't

00:03:48.169 --> 00:04:02.219 
one I'm pulling this across it doesn't
get<00:03:48.259> caught<00:03:48.439> on<00:03:48.500> like<00:03:48.799> bumpy<00:03:49.489> eyelid<00:03:49.909> wrinkles

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:02.229 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.149 

adding<00:04:03.229> the<00:04:03.319> upper<00:04:03.439> island<00:04:03.769> actually<00:04:03.889> does

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
adding the upper island actually does

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.409 
adding the upper island actually does
make<00:04:04.340> your<00:04:04.459> eyes<00:04:04.609> look<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:04.909> little<00:04:04.939> bit<00:04:05.209> smaller

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
make your eyes look a little bit smaller

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.729 
make your eyes look a little bit smaller
but<00:04:05.930> I'm<00:04:06.019> trying<00:04:06.169> to<00:04:06.229> compensate<00:04:06.469> that<00:04:06.620> by

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
but I'm trying to compensate that by

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.319 
but I'm trying to compensate that by
using<00:04:06.949> white<00:04:07.189> eyeshadow<00:04:07.370> and<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:08.030> silver

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
using white eyeshadow and the silver

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.399 
using white eyeshadow and the silver
underneath<00:04:08.689> it<00:04:08.780> makes<00:04:08.930> your<00:04:09.019> eyes<00:04:09.139> look

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
underneath it makes your eyes look

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.839 
underneath it makes your eyes look
bigger<00:04:09.439> so<00:04:09.979> final<00:04:10.219> step<00:04:10.340> up<00:04:10.459> for<00:04:10.579> this<00:04:10.639> would

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
bigger so final step up for this would

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.610 
bigger so final step up for this would
just<00:04:10.909> be<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.120> add<00:04:11.209> some<00:04:11.449> mascara<00:04:11.900> for<00:04:12.319> those<00:04:12.469> of

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
just be to add some mascara for those of
