 hello guys I'm again snail 00 in 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.770
 this time I will show you how to change 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.750
 the start button for those people 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.179
 who already tired of always having the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.130
 for this you must download the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.509
 program and the styles that you'll leave 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.509
 in the description of the video 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.599
 Once downloaded, the files should 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.599
 unzip all styles 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.630
 Once decompressed they create a new 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.280
 folder with the name that you 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.180
 want and they also keep it where 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.180
 you wish it 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.129
 now they keep the program and the styles 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.129
 in the created folder 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.119
 then they open the folder and now they give 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.619
 right click on the program and what 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.619
 run as administrator 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.920
 Once the program is open click on 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.929
 the first button and they go to the folder where 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.929
 they saved the styles and choose one 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.030
 I will choose a white icon 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.430
 then we have to wait for this 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.909
 icon is changed will only take about 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.909
 seconds 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.990
 As you can see our icon 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.620
 start menu has changed now choose the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.620
 another icon 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.740
 and again we have to wait 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.360
 now one more to finish the video 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.760
 and for those fans of video games and the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.760
 esports we have a special icon 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.020
 and again we have to wait 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.540
 how can you see the menu icon 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.540
 home has changed again 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.430

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.170
