economic<00:02:06.990> policy<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:08.340> hear<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> lot<00:02:08.850> about

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
economic policy we hear a lot about

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.050 
economic policy we hear a lot about
economic<00:02:10.020> valence<00:02:10.560> you've<00:02:11.490> never<00:02:11.670> had<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:11.940> so

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
economic valence you've never had it so

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.940 
economic valence you've never had it so
good<00:02:12.210> are<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.960> better<00:02:13.080> off<00:02:13.380> than<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.920> were

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
good are you better off than you were

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.340 
good are you better off than you were
four<00:02:14.070> years<00:02:14.340> ago<00:02:14.640> but<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.510> rarely<00:02:15.720> hear

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
four years ago but we rarely hear

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.780 
four years ago but we rarely hear
specific<00:02:16.980> policy<00:02:18.350> ideas<00:02:19.350> discussed<00:02:19.790> during

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
specific policy ideas discussed during

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.520 
specific policy ideas discussed during
presidential<00:02:21.420> campaigns<00:02:21.840> about<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.260> economy

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
presidential campaigns about the economy

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.710 
presidential campaigns about the economy
so<00:02:23.340> my<00:02:23.640> sense<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.060> right<00:02:24.540> now<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
so my sense is that right now the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.420 
so my sense is that right now the
candidates<00:02:25.260> are<00:02:25.440> doing<00:02:25.980> exactly<00:02:26.250> what

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
candidates are doing exactly what

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.160 
candidates are doing exactly what
they'll<00:02:27.209> continue<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.690> do<00:02:27.900> throughout<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
they'll continue to do throughout the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.930 
they'll continue to do throughout the
general<00:02:28.590> election<00:02:29.010> which<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.520> talk<00:02:29.700> very

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
general election which is talk very

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.000 
general election which is talk very
generally<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.870> very<00:02:31.080> vague<00:02:31.290> terms<00:02:31.620> about

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
generally and in very vague terms about

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.949 
generally and in very vague terms about
how<00:02:32.430> their<00:02:32.790> party<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.300> deliver<00:02:33.630> prosperity

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.839 

so<00:02:39.959> far<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.800> co-operative<00:02:41.069> campaign

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
so far the co-operative campaign

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.670 
so far the co-operative campaign
analysis<00:02:42.390> project<00:02:42.660> has<00:02:43.140> been<00:02:43.349> in<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> field

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
analysis project has been in the field

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.369 
analysis project has been in the field
twice<00:02:44.010> we<00:02:44.730> did<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> December<00:02:45.629> wave<00:02:45.780> where<00:02:46.200> we

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
twice we did a December wave where we

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.110 
twice we did a December wave where we
assess<00:02:46.709> people's<00:02:46.950> baseline<00:02:47.519> opinions<00:02:47.970> and

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
assess people's baseline opinions and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
attitudes towards the candidates and we

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.190 
attitudes towards the candidates and we
are<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.300> field<00:02:51.420> right<00:02:51.629> now<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
are in the field right now with the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.160 
are in the field right now with the
January<00:02:52.680> wave<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.690> one<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.900> interesting

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
January wave and one of the interesting

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.339 
January wave and one of the interesting
things<00:02:55.560> about<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.920> December<00:02:56.340> wave<00:02:56.489> was<00:02:56.970> that

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
things about the December wave was that

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.110 
things about the December wave was that
people<00:02:58.349> thought<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:58.980> Hillary<00:02:59.489> Clinton<00:02:59.880> was

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
people thought that Hillary Clinton was

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.910 
people thought that Hillary Clinton was
a<00:03:00.450> strong<00:03:00.959> leader<00:03:01.670> but<00:03:02.670> they<00:03:03.620> they<00:03:04.620> didn't

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
a strong leader but they they didn't

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.150 
a strong leader but they they didn't
trust<00:03:05.130> her<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.660> it<00:03:06.660> was<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:07.230> most<00:03:07.440> extreme

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
trust her so it was the most extreme

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.460 
trust her so it was the most extreme
difference<00:03:08.849> between<00:03:09.420> trait<00:03:09.750> ratings<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.349> any

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
difference between trait ratings of any

Obama Hillary Clinton John McCain and
then<00:03:19.739> respondents<00:03:20.519> can<00:03:20.700> say<00:03:20.880> extremely<00:03:21.390> well

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
then respondents can say extremely well

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.589 
then respondents can say extremely well
somewhat<00:03:22.440> well<00:03:22.620> not<00:03:23.549> well<00:03:23.730> at<00:03:23.880> all<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.510> know

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
somewhat well not well at all you know

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.140 
somewhat well not well at all you know
they<00:03:24.750> can<00:03:24.900> sort<00:03:25.079> of<00:03:25.140> apply<00:03:25.349> that<00:03:25.590> label<00:03:26.150> with

they can sort of apply that label with

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.289 
they can sort of apply that label with
intensity<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.079> most<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.310> time<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:30.180> know

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
intensity and most of the time you know

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.330 
intensity and most of the time you know
you'll<00:03:30.660> see<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.170> little<00:03:31.349> bit<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.590> variation<00:03:31.890> but

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
you'll see a little bit of variation but

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.920 
you'll see a little bit of variation but
if<00:03:32.459> they<00:03:32.610> think<00:03:32.670> John<00:03:33.150> McCain<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.599> a<00:03:33.630> strong

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
if they think John McCain is a strong

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.110 
if they think John McCain is a strong
leader<00:03:34.200> they<00:03:34.560> also<00:03:34.709> think<00:03:35.040> he's<00:03:35.160> honest<00:03:35.940> and

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
leader they also think he's honest and

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.970 
leader they also think he's honest and
trustworthy<00:03:36.510> these<00:03:37.319> things<00:03:37.470> tend<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.829> go

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
trustworthy these things tend to go

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.430 
trustworthy these things tend to go
together<00:03:38.299> but<00:03:39.299> on<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.660> one<00:03:39.870> dimension

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
together but on this one dimension

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.710 
together but on this one dimension
Hillary<00:03:41.220> Clinton<00:03:41.459> was<00:03:41.579> really<00:03:42.030> very

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
Hillary Clinton was really very

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.240 
Hillary Clinton was really very
different<00:03:43.139> from<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.350> other<00:03:43.470> candidates<00:03:43.980> in
