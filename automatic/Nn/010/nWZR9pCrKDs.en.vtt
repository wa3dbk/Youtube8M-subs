00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.320
 borloo and his friends who comes and i'm going to show you how to print 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.610
 with the colombia trellis and wifi 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.360
 with prosecutors in the Turkish bath another era your printer the group 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.449
 and the wi-fi 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:15.159
 and it is connected in wifi on your iphone for hypothesis 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.509
 the cost of this application is supposed to come out hours at the same time as the 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:19.929
 smoking rooms 4 points 2 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.929
 who is supposed to adapt the ball out early October 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.720
 but they have come up with an alternative that applies to those who are in 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.509
 too much for kids three holes that do not want to put it 4 points 2 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.490
 because I would like that will not leave bustos 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.360
 for the application of his sentence 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.360
 magic catch 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.360
 brouillette exchange on installous scouts and then just price 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.510
 of research 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.330
 you exchange do not take a geek 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.810
 so here is the leave 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.810
 you started the program 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.450
 this is the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 and we no longer mark any quinten storm that was looking for the printer 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.590
 - hitched m which explained that 610 mw so I'm doing confirmation of 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.670
 sending your pale complexion find in the world 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.540
 so in the hands it's unheard of 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.430
 he recalled the presence of such a file all alone on the stake 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.520
 so that's why also it goes through a powerful lobby of youpins 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.820
 will not walk 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.079
 to complete them apply reduced rates 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.860
 if you do not actually arrive after in malaysia 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.150
 ok after the president m 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.810
 for a critical photo cut 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.590
 love between m 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.320
 and then if your pictures m 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 we need to click on price 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.910
 I'm losing a little earlier 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.450
 I'm going to show you how to share for a billiard corner but it's where 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.450
 is not a copy-and-paste so by the launched mob 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.910
 marco motta 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.849
 so in my notes for example I'm going to take 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.419
 by hand on cydia for example 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.759
 all selected 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.239
 but we must start all the shareholders 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.569
 once copying them you say that you have copied him directly 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.919
 its application 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.549
 he directly posted that you copied total pranced well 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.179
 you see pass 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.179
 the Montreal duo then the printer 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.659
 so the climate plan 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.659
 jacques nantel 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.319
 nok and then 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:01.869
 There you go 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:06.209
 recovery to its prints that http source alas there is no age for 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.209
 I am surprised 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.509
 I am neither writing 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.839
 we were waiting 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:18.729
 we can notice computing 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.729
 but 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.369
 first why are we talking about 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:33.429
 Amenabar 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.539
 ap 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.849
 and that's it on the quarter 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.009
 same source 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.800
 she was created at which stone to show that to begin 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.730
 we know the best
