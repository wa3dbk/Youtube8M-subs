00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.539
 Pal or am I in front again and that to burns Schicho right next to it 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.200
 for the nearly 30 in Dorum high 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.900
 At the Percentage Station video, Sandu shot the picture abruptly 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.289
 on the first day in the first six hours, I think 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:22.530
 what is it about 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.449
 come in high jump 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.029
 I think that's really great 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.179
 and for that I thank you 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.179
 and Berenberg has written in this commentary 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.560
 that he 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.610
 I think Binger can use systems 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.540
 in order to have three Bartens 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.960
 Mr. Goals to drive that is traffic 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.750
 no one buys and then no special write between 1 same oxygen zoos 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.880
 and even three words Smith Danish rules 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.340
 if I have activated nothing percent now and then that goes to the destination 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.120
 to lead 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.890
 if I activate one here 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.660
 what the goal 1 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.660
 so won with 2 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.040
 If I have three now, then I just have to 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.370
 so add 12 cents easier 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.630
 I'll give them both &amp; Cie 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.800
 yes I drive to 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.880
 so number three 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 there is always going on and that is now 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.910
 and it goes on and on, and five six and seven for me anyway 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.400
 selected 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.460
 and maybe holes Â»may show us 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.460
 that's just happy if it's the one out 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.270
 work now 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.900
 pro without consequences 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.360
 the 4 1 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 Fungus infested 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.080
 now take this one 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.790
 5 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.820
 offside how to skip 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.710
 four points 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.579
 1 2 3 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.580
 4 lost here 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.580
 here is the number five 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.929
 then he left 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.929
 who the game must be me was this 7 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.879
 when it comes out when everything 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.909
 4 + CWS 1 07 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.909
 Volz Simon Nicholls 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:29.599
 Pillow 7 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.619
 foundations 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.619
 no big bears at all, that means 0 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.569
 then we skip all points 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.629
 that could of course also partners chunks I have the first 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.359
 forgot to write 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.359
 I'm too daring 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.569
 that's what Deuce said nothing out there 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.959
 only seven play the 1 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.979
 the drive to the rear pull 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.219
 the Lukom also use around 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.099
 when he returns 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.189
 if you want Professor Massimo 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.209
 Robby Vermeer need GC 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.209
 as an additional goal 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.049
 System does not look it 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.669
 here in the scoreboard Ulreich but already going on 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:20.769
 I think 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.709
 a total of 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.999
 it's a bit bigger 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.839
 I want to explain you very briefly now 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.599
 like the industrial park 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.449
 if here I can also do a tutorial or picture about it 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.749
 shaking the comments were 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:41.109
 It will now be necessary to try so I am deep here 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.889
 thereby became 1 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.749
 They succeeded in one 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:49.399
 deep air flew 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:53.729
 that's the same one has also done in Handelsblatt that if you 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.449
 that these there are such 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:00.989
 want this course 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.929
 what motivates you again 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:06.929
 that's just percent smaller versions 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:09.589
 same way 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:12.929
 if you have the picture I just paid attention 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.929
 that the victim stands what I always do 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.499
 we had to search for our job one gives 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.119
 that has been completely taken off the market then i wish them a lot 

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:28.460
 Travel to book 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.590
 to give 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.590
 look how that is exactly 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.810
 do not even know why must function to provide location function 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.770
 the Albertina is often wanting 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.050
 and this one up 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.300
 that's just important 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.300
 so that the signal comes through on paper 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.110
 Mr. and dog this 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.729
 Dreieich the flip-flops 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:55.809
 Give Guedes 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:57.330
 Guardian 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.870
 neighbors 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.520
 and 4 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.819
 Here we have then once by Games fail this 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.930
 once a percent off 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.059
 We take this when we do this 

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:13.610
 Berlin - so buy 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.610
 and this post is there for us with these lines i need 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:18.789
 Everyone knows that 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.210
 Monet such to the goal 1 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.210
 That is 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:27.110
 that's nice 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.279
 lead this goal 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.279
 Water is how Troitsch becomes Energy 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.490
 and 4 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.490
 this field is the input for the 1 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.449
 that means we need 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:40.939
 here a cloud around 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.689
 that's the one for the 2 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.919
 and thus the two levels were not born in goal 1 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:48.779
 we do not have to 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.779
 These then accept this 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.789
 this is the number 4 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.639
 the researchers want them to be all right 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.300
 Princesses and not this Dost but just this again 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.889
 that should go to the goal 5 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.139
 then Prof and how 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.259
 12 4 and 1 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:14.869
 4 StGB 

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:17.529
 that means we take this nut 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.529
 Although this is not here so we take this go 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.349
 and we need this one again as mime 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.569
 that really quite simple so into the marrow if you do not understand 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.270
 Guilt is quiet and neatly rude among us within five minutes 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.949
 foul 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:36.460
 So 4 1 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.559
 Water is 

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:42.599
 in the 5 it's on 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:44.270
 opaque give 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.270
 like the soft and well placed and we can become 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:52.210
 So it's the year 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.449
 because Vigiers need 1 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.279
 that they can not book it to Erwin Denk two princes 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:59.999
 that now 

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.999
 because we are the four weeks 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.520
 the war actually too already 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:13.259
 As I said starting runner commentary Rundschau we'll see you at 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:14.169
 next time until then
