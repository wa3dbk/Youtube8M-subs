00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
yesterday I got quite a bit of glue on

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.289 
yesterday I got quite a bit of glue on
my<00:01:59.909> hands<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.899> just<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.770> little<00:02:02.040> warning<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:05.299> have

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
my hands so just a little warning I have

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.600 
my hands so just a little warning I have
the<00:02:06.450> most<00:02:06.689> unstable<00:02:07.290> glue<00:02:07.680> gun<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:08.129> that

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
the most unstable glue gun I think that

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.430 
the most unstable glue gun I think that
you<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.849> buy<00:02:09.030> then<00:02:09.690> again<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.319> was

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you can buy then again I think it was

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.130 
you can buy then again I think it was
only<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> dollar<00:02:10.950> ninety-nine<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.989> can

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
only a dollar ninety-nine so what can

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.699 
only a dollar ninety-nine so what can
you<00:02:13.200> expect

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
you expect

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.520 
you expect
