00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
to set a bevel angle that we grind on

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.840 
to set a bevel angle that we grind on
the<00:01:19.619> chisel<00:01:20.210> by<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.869> height<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.350> universe

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
halfway between them I'll put a little

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.180 
halfway between them I'll put a little
bit<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.959> pressure<00:02:51.110> up<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.770> back<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:51.980> the

and see where we are we can slide that

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.050 
and see where we are we can slide that
off<00:03:08.360> take<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.720> look<00:03:08.960> at<00:03:09.830> just<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.400> couple<00:03:10.970> of

off take a look at just a couple of

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.940 
off take a look at just a couple of
spots<00:03:11.390> where<00:03:11.630> and<00:03:11.780> don't<00:03:11.930> quite<00:03:12.200> have<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.440> mix

out yet slide that back on give it just
a<00:03:16.130> couple<00:03:16.520> more<00:03:16.880> seconds<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.930> we'll<00:03:18.530> have

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
a couple more seconds and we'll have

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.870 
a couple more seconds and we'll have
that<00:03:18.830> tool<00:03:19.070> perfectly<00:03:19.700> reshaped<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:21.880> it's

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
nice and square it is going to be

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.920 
nice and square it is going to be
perfectly<00:03:25.460> squared<00:03:25.850> because<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.300> indexed<00:03:26.810> it

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
perfectly squared because we indexed it

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.400 
perfectly squared because we indexed it
in<00:03:27.260> our<00:03:27.410> gym

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.160 

there<00:03:34.040> we<00:03:34.160> go<00:03:34.540> just<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.630> couple<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.900> minutes

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
there we go just a couple of minutes

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.810 
there we go just a couple of minutes
when<00:03:36.320> we<00:03:36.350> completely<00:03:36.830> recondition<00:03:37.520> that<00:03:37.640> to

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
when we completely recondition that to

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.910 
when we completely recondition that to
now<00:03:38.720> we've<00:03:38.840> got<00:03:38.960> a<00:03:38.990> little<00:03:39.140> wire<00:03:39.380> edge<00:03:39.650> on

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
now we've got a little wire edge on

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.020 
now we've got a little wire edge on
there<00:03:40.100> we're<00:03:40.250> going<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.430> take<00:03:40.610> care<00:03:40.820> of<00:03:40.850> that

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
there we're going to take care of that

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.030 
there we're going to take care of that
in<00:03:41.240> a<00:03:41.300> minute<00:03:41.420> but<00:03:42.410> the<00:03:42.530> next<00:03:42.770> thing<00:03:42.920> we<00:03:43.010> need

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
in a minute but the next thing we need

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.220 
in a minute but the next thing we need
to<00:03:43.190> do<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.580> take<00:03:43.730> every<00:03:44.150> scratch<00:03:44.510> that's<00:03:45.080> in

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
to do is take every scratch that's in

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.440 
to do is take every scratch that's in
that<00:03:45.350> bevel<00:03:45.710> we<00:03:46.400> need<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.640> make<00:03:46.790> every<00:03:47.180> scratch

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
that bevel we need to make every scratch

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.330 
that bevel we need to make every scratch
smaller<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.170> put<00:03:48.200> all<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.710> scratches<00:03:49.100> closer

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
smaller and put all the scratches closer

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.810 
smaller and put all the scratches closer
together

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
together

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.970 
together
and<00:03:50.660> what<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.990> usually<00:03:51.170> means<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.770> you've

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
and what that usually means is you've

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.250 
and what that usually means is you've
got<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:52.190> go<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.430> different<00:03:52.580> wine<00:03:52.880> smoker<00:03:53.260> or

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
got to go to a different wine smoker or

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.050 
got to go to a different wine smoker or
it<00:03:54.470> means<00:03:54.590> give<00:03:54.920> up<00:03:55.160> on<00:03:55.460> the<00:03:55.700> grinder<00:03:56.000> all

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
it means give up on the grinder all

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.940 
it means give up on the grinder all
together<00:03:56.210> and<00:03:56.600> start<00:03:56.990> using<00:03:57.110> vegetables<00:03:57.770> sure

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
together and start using vegetables sure

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.800 
together and start using vegetables sure
with<00:03:58.550> the<00:03:58.670> tormek<00:03:59.090> we're<00:03:59.270> going<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.450> take<00:03:59.630> the

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
with the tormek we're going to take the

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.240 
with the tormek we're going to take the
same<00:04:00.020> stone<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:00.560> change<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:00.890> way<00:04:01.010> that<00:04:01.160> it

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
same stone and change the way that it

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.760 
same stone and change the way that it
cuts<00:04:01.490> great<00:04:02.480> feel<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.020> surplus<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.500> weak

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.060 

that's<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:06.920> 200<00:04:07.340> 220<00:04:08.270> grit<00:04:08.450> cut<00:04:09.080> this<00:04:09.710> piece

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
that's the 200 220 grit cut this piece

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.220 
that's the 200 220 grit cut this piece
is<00:04:10.280> called<00:04:10.460> the<00:04:10.580> stone<00:04:10.850> grater<00:04:11.180> I'm<00:04:11.930> going<00:04:12.170> to

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
is called the stone grater I'm going to

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.650 
is called the stone grater I'm going to
use<00:04:12.350> this<00:04:12.530> smooth<00:04:12.950> side<00:04:13.310> of<00:04:13.340> this<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:14.420> we're

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
use this smooth side of this and we're

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.270 
use this smooth side of this and we're
actually<00:04:14.810> going<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.170> polish<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.800> surface<00:04:16.190> of

actually going to polish the surface of

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.010 
actually going to polish the surface of
the<00:04:16.340> grindstone

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
the grindstone

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.260 
the grindstone
this<00:04:18.020> is<00:04:18.230> fracturing<00:04:18.830> each<00:04:19.070> crystal<00:04:19.730> in<00:04:20.000> the

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
this is fracturing each crystal in the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.270 
this is fracturing each crystal in the
surface<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.840> stone<00:04:21.100> we're<00:04:22.100> going<00:04:22.220> to

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
surface of the stone we're going to

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.550 
surface of the stone we're going to
change<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.760> effective<00:04:23.270> cutting<00:04:23.450> action<00:04:23.780> from

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
change the effective cutting action from

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.560 
change the effective cutting action from
the<00:04:24.770> 220<00:04:25.550> grit<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:25.970> we<00:04:26.090> use<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.420> get<00:04:26.510> the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
the 220 grit that we use to get the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.470 
the 220 grit that we use to get the
nicks<00:04:26.870> out<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.740> very<00:04:28.040> fine<00:04:28.310> cutting<00:04:28.670> 1000

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
nicks out to a very fine cutting 1000

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.390 
nicks out to a very fine cutting 1000
grit<00:04:29.690> then<00:04:30.410> we're<00:04:30.530> going<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.740> use<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:31.070> refine

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
grit then we're going to use to refine

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.049 
grit then we're going to use to refine
the<00:04:31.610> scratch<00:04:31.880> pattern<00:04:32.120> on<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.450> stone

00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:37.059 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:41.739 

takes<00:04:38.059> about<00:04:38.210> 30<00:04:38.569> seconds<00:04:39.430> and<00:04:40.449> if<00:04:41.449> you<00:04:41.569> feel

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:41.749 
takes about 30 seconds and if you feel

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:43.570 
takes about 30 seconds and if you feel
that<00:04:41.930> after<00:04:42.229> we<00:04:42.469> use<00:04:42.589> the<00:04:42.740> grader<00:04:42.979> you'll<00:04:43.370> see

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
that after we use the grader you'll see

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.480 
that after we use the grader you'll see
that<00:04:43.789> it's<00:04:43.969> a<00:04:44.059> very<00:04:44.089> very<00:04:44.509> smooth<00:04:45.229> yeah<00:04:45.919> big

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
that it's a very very smooth yeah big

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.570 
that it's a very very smooth yeah big
difference<00:04:46.610> in<00:04:46.969> it<00:04:47.089> you<00:04:47.719> now<00:04:48.499> the<00:04:49.249> beauty<00:04:49.550> of

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
difference in it you now the beauty of

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.890 
difference in it you now the beauty of
this<00:04:49.759> is<00:04:49.969> when<00:04:50.180> we<00:04:50.270> go<00:04:50.389> back<00:04:50.569> to<00:04:50.599> work

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
this is when we go back to work

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.980 
this is when we go back to work
everything<00:04:51.499> is<00:04:51.830> exactly<00:04:52.039> the<00:04:52.550> same<00:04:52.990> same

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
everything is exactly the same same

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.950 
everything is exactly the same same
gregor's<00:04:54.409> same<00:04:54.620> stone<00:04:55.069> same<00:04:55.490> jig<00:04:55.849> it's<00:04:56.599> got<00:04:56.839> to

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
gregor's same stone same jig it's got to

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.779 
gregor's same stone same jig it's got to
be<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.169> same<00:04:57.349> angle<00:04:57.559> you<00:04:58.339> don't<00:04:58.460> have<00:04:58.639> to

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
be the same angle you don't have to

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.059 
be the same angle you don't have to
reset<00:04:59.240> recalibrate<00:05:00.050> or<00:05:00.199> realign<00:05:00.620> anything

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:01.069 
reset recalibrate or realign anything

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.980 
reset recalibrate or realign anything
just<00:05:01.309> slide<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:01.639> back<00:05:01.759> on<00:05:01.939> and<00:05:02.479> go<00:05:02.659> back<00:05:02.689> to

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
just slide it back on and go back to

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.810 
just slide it back on and go back to
work

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.130 

since<00:05:07.820> everything<00:05:08.270> is<00:05:08.390> perfectly<00:05:08.840> calibrated

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
since everything is perfectly calibrated

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.520 
since everything is perfectly calibrated
this<00:05:09.980> step<00:05:10.340> is<00:05:10.580> very<00:05:10.610> quick<00:05:13.630> 25<00:05:14.630> or<00:05:14.840> 30<00:05:15.050> seconds

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
this step is very quick 25 or 30 seconds

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.990 
this step is very quick 25 or 30 seconds
of<00:05:15.650> this<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:15.950> all<00:05:16.160> you're<00:05:16.370> going<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.550> need<00:05:16.730> to

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
of this is all you're going to need to

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.230 
of this is all you're going to need to
smooth<00:05:17.270> out<00:05:17.420> the<00:05:17.480> scratches<00:05:17.840> in<00:05:18.200> the<00:05:18.230> bevel

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.290 

and<00:05:25.569> after<00:05:26.080> that<00:05:26.199> step<00:05:26.759> you<00:05:27.759> can<00:05:27.880> see<00:05:28.060> we<00:05:28.210> have

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
and after that step you can see we have

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.920 
and after that step you can see we have
a<00:05:28.330> much<00:05:28.600> more<00:05:28.630> polished<00:05:29.229> edge<00:05:30.509> now<00:05:31.509> at<00:05:31.810> this

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
a much more polished edge now at this

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.650 
a much more polished edge now at this
point<00:05:32.199> it's<00:05:32.410> a<00:05:32.500> well<00:05:32.710> ground<00:05:33.069> Chisholm<00:05:33.660> but

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
point it's a well ground Chisholm but

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.990 
point it's a well ground Chisholm but
it's<00:05:34.810> not<00:05:34.990> quite<00:05:35.259> ready<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:35.650> use<00:05:35.860> feel<00:05:36.729> on<00:05:36.880> the

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
it's not quite ready to use feel on the

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.980 
it's not quite ready to use feel on the
back<00:05:37.180> right<00:05:37.419> out<00:05:37.479> at<00:05:37.750> the<00:05:37.900> edge<00:05:39.750> that<00:05:40.750> wire

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
back right out at the edge that wire

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.779 
back right out at the edge that wire
edge<00:05:41.289> is<00:05:41.530> exactly<00:05:41.650> what<00:05:42.280> we<00:05:42.400> wanted<00:05:42.669> the

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
edge is exactly what we wanted the

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.879 
edge is exactly what we wanted the
grinder<00:05:43.120> to<00:05:43.210> do<00:05:43.360> but<00:05:44.050> if<00:05:44.139> you<00:05:44.259> leave<00:05:44.410> that<00:05:44.620> on

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
grinder to do but if you leave that on

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.430 
grinder to do but if you leave that on
there<00:05:45.130> and<00:05:45.520> you<00:05:45.639> start<00:05:45.910> using<00:05:46.090> the<00:05:46.360> tool<00:05:46.539> the

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
there and you start using the tool the

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.839 
there and you start using the tool the
edge<00:05:47.590> is<00:05:47.770> going<00:05:47.889> to<00:05:47.949> break<00:05:48.160> down<00:05:48.190> very<00:05:48.520> quickly

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
edge is going to break down very quickly

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.540 
edge is going to break down very quickly
and<00:05:49.060> you're<00:05:49.300> right<00:05:49.509> back<00:05:49.690> to<00:05:49.720> going<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:51.340> finish

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
and you're right back to going to finish

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.850 
and you're right back to going to finish
the<00:05:51.789> job<00:05:52.030> you<00:05:52.690> want<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:52.960> cut<00:05:53.199> that<00:05:53.410> wire<00:05:53.590> edge
