00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
beautiful nose and also during that time

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.700 
beautiful nose and also during that time
I'm<00:00:52.890> able<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.510> assess<00:00:54.510> their<00:00:54.870> expectations

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
I'm able to assess their expectations

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.549 
I'm able to assess their expectations
and<00:00:56.010> also<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.120> surgically<00:00:57.660> possible<00:00:58.410> to

and also if it's surgically possible to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.689 
and also if it's surgically possible to
achieve<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.039> nose<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.520> have

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
achieve the nose that they have

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.610 
achieve the nose that they have
envisioned<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.300> themselves<00:01:00.809> another<00:01:01.410> way

envisioned for themselves another way

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.880 
envisioned for themselves another way
that<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> avoid<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.850> cookie<00:01:03.780> cutter<00:01:04.019> approach<00:01:04.110> or

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that I avoid a cookie cutter approach or

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.539 
that I avoid a cookie cutter approach or
avoid<00:01:05.670> creating<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.689> cookie<00:01:07.590> cutter<00:01:07.770> nose<00:01:08.130> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
avoid creating a cookie cutter nose is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.359 
avoid creating a cookie cutter nose is
by<00:01:09.150> using<00:01:09.479> tissue<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.860> patient's<00:01:11.280> own

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
by using tissue from the patient's own

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.890 
by using tissue from the patient's own
body<00:01:12.080> this<00:01:13.080> way<00:01:13.350> each<00:01:14.210> surgery<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.540> tailored

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
body this way each surgery is tailored

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.649 
body this way each surgery is tailored
to<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.200> patient<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.850> grafts<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
to that patient and all the grafts and

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.170 
to that patient and all the grafts and
techniques<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.409> use<00:01:19.439> are<00:01:19.920> unique<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
techniques that I use are unique to that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.020 
techniques that I use are unique to that
patient<00:01:21.810> synthetic<00:01:22.590> grafts<00:01:22.799> are<00:01:23.100> very

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
patient synthetic grafts are very

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.670 
patient synthetic grafts are very
popular<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.720> widespread<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.380> Asian

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
popular and widespread in Asian

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.200 
popular and widespread in Asian
rhinoplasty<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> number<00:01:27.060> of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
rhinoplasty and there are a number of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.510 
rhinoplasty and there are a number of
reasons<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.900> one<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> main<00:01:29.070> reasons

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
reasons for this one of the main reasons

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.450 
reasons for this one of the main reasons
is<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.079> synthetic<00:01:31.079> grafts<00:01:31.439> are<00:01:31.680> readily

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
is that synthetic grafts are readily

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.580 
is that synthetic grafts are readily
available<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.210> they're<00:01:33.630> ready<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> use<00:01:34.140> right

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
available and they're ready to use right

off the shelf the problem with this is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.960 
off the shelf the problem with this is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that those grafts are not individual

disadvantage of using synthetic implants

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.010 
disadvantage of using synthetic implants

is that there's a risk of infection

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.490

patients seeking Asian rhinoplasty is

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.010 
patients seeking Asian rhinoplasty is
the<00:04:23.379> flair<00:04:23.770> or<00:04:24.099> the<00:04:25.060> width<00:04:25.270> of<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.509> nostrils

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
the flair or the width of the nostrils

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.679 
the flair or the width of the nostrils
and<00:04:26.259> again<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:27.280> Flair<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.699> nostrils<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:28.449> the

during surgery

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.740 
during surgery
so<00:04:32.620> again<00:04:32.919> Asian<00:04:33.310> rhinoplasty<00:04:33.430> is<00:04:34.180> a<00:04:34.210> surgery
