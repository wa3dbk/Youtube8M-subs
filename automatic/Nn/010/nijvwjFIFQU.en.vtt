00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.720
 I was sent here two years ago, 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.670
 my father just died then 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.580
 and my mother turned into a wreck. 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.940
 No one will come to the rescue if something bad happens. 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.430
 It is with great pleasure that I greet our freshmen. 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.720
 This will be the best year of our lives. 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720
 I missed you so much. 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.140
 Rebecca, I want to present you a new one, Ernessa Block. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.760
 She will live on down the hall. 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.300
 I wonder what is her secret? 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.160
 Everyone has a secret. 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.000
 In all the classic gothic horror stories one feels awe of feminine power. 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.270
 Female sexuality. 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.880
 The mysterious stranger occupies all the thoughts of the narrator. 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.630
 Vampires are lonely creatures. 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.090
 She wants to completely take over someone ... 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.720
 …forever and ever. 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.990
 She's nice if you try to recognize her. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.870
 Are you worried about your father? 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.580
 Some people find satisfaction in anticipation of death. 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.130
 Ernessa is kind of weird. 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.530
 It seems to me that you invent. 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.390
 You must believe me. 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.750
 Here, locked up, you sometimes get so close that your emotions poison others. 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.630
 FROM THE SCENARIST AND DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHOPATH 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.340
 My mother slaughtered me like cattle, FROM THE SCENARIST AND DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHOPATH 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.660
 My mother beat me up like cattle, 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.940
 My dad ate me 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.930
 My sister…. 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.860
 Something terrible is happening. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.620
 She seems to intrude on my mind. 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.910
 You have become too serious about this story with Ernessa. 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.170
 She turns you against me! 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.490
 You didn't even want to know her better. 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.910
 She is my best friend, this is not fair. 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.820
 I can not stand that you are constantly around. 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.730
 What do you mean by "taking over someone"? 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.300
 She destroyed everything I had. 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.920
 There are three things that are present in every vampire story: 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 sex, 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 blood 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.920
 and death. 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.300
 Do you believe in the supernatural? 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.270
