 little dish of the 1932 mom's dinner 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.280
 here I am going to show you how the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.879
 realize it's easy quick fun to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.680
 do as always to do the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.180
 sesame delights you need a 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.690
 cup of sesame seeds 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:57.360
 conv to grind half a cup of grapes 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.520
 dried a little maple syrup and two 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.739
 good spoon of cocoa or carob in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.350
 powder of choice and both without doubt 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.970
 excellent way cinnamon and walnut 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.909
 coconut will be used to coat the eyes 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.409
 in the end then it's very easy there 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.869
 just grind the sesame in a 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.549
 mill then to mix the powder of 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.259
 sesame with chocolate and syrup 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.369
 Maple 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.689
 so you need very little syrup 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.430
 maple must be done just so that 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.770
 the page the dough is sticky all 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.150
 simply put them in 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 small mussels like the mussels 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.110
 easter that or if you have it or otherwise 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.240
 roll them in the hand like here at the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.640
 hand is very simple 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.070
 packed and then we put them to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.690
 freezer for an hour for 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.290
 they harden 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:44.880
 once done, they are molded into them 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.160
 coco fashion dresses like here or else 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.350
 cocoa or two rather 2/4 or a 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.790
 time it's like you want to look 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.910
 it is adorable I find 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.140
 and here they are finished so watch them 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.640
 are eaten very quickly 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.110
 must perhaps double or triple 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.360
 quantities not care to the little eggs and 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.040
 little heart of the snack they are made 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.540
 with the net to dry because me 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.270
 I love it but you can take 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.310
 apricots mango figs 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.290
 you have to rehydrate them in a little bit 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.910
 of water and then listen to them and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.520
 especially do not throw juice bus bike 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.590
 because it's a delight you have to 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.570
 take a cup then it takes a 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.320
 cup of dry blueberry fruit states 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.920
 red 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:29.630
 mix and a cup of almond powder 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.010
 and then the car at the end of the cocoa of your choice 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.570
 So here in the robot to the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.490
 mix the dried fruits and the powder 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.310

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.390

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.630
 I have a 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.209
 and then you put them in the freezer 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.640
 a short hour then you 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.310
