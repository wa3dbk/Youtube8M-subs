there's pretty good loot and the
opponent's<00:00:20.609> aren't<00:00:20.939> difficult<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.750> defeat<00:00:23.660> so

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
notice that I have 40 barbarians I don't

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.819 
notice that I have 40 barbarians I don't
like<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.329> use<00:00:45.390> Giants<00:00:45.899> because<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:46.469> cost<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
like to use Giants because they cost a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.610 
like to use Giants because they cost a
lot<00:00:46.980> they're<00:00:47.579> about<00:00:47.760> 2,000<00:00:48.570> elixir<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
lot they're about 2,000 elixir to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.610 
lot they're about 2,000 elixir to
produce<00:00:50.129> each<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:51.570> even<00:00:52.260> more<00:00:52.410> if<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
produce each and even more if you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.850 
produce each and even more if you
upgrade<00:00:53.039> them<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:54.300> i<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> use<00:00:55.230> barbarians

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
upgrade them so i like to use barbarians

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.189 
upgrade them so i like to use barbarians
they're<00:00:56.250> cost-effective<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.840> soak<00:00:58.170> up

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
they're cost-effective and they soak up

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.860 
they're cost-effective and they soak up
a<00:00:58.379> lot<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.620> damage<00:00:58.800> before<00:00:59.370> they<00:00:59.670> die<00:00:59.870> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
a lot of damage before they die the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.779 
a lot of damage before they die the
trick<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.260> spread<00:01:01.559> them<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.250> they

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
trick is to spread them out so they

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.609 
trick is to spread them out so they
don't<00:01:03.090> clump<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.140> don't<00:01:04.320> lose<00:01:04.470> them

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
don't clump up and you don't lose them

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.460 
don't clump up and you don't lose them
all<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.890> once<00:01:05.270> so<00:01:06.270> base<00:01:06.450> they<00:01:06.750> basically<00:01:07.140> serve

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
all at once so base they basically serve

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.980 
all at once so base they basically serve
as<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> same<00:01:07.920> purpose<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.310> Giants<00:01:08.880> now<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.780> get

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
as the same purpose as Giants now I get

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.230 
as the same purpose as Giants now I get
17<00:01:10.500> wall<00:01:10.710> breakers<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.460> don't<00:01:11.820> intend<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
17 wall breakers but I don't intend to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480 
17 wall breakers but I don't intend to
use<00:01:12.360> them<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.840> every<00:01:13.080> read<00:01:13.310> once<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
use them all in every read once in a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.039 
use them all in every read once in a
while<00:01:14.640> they'll<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> raid<00:01:15.360> where<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.869> actually

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
while they'll be a raid where I actually

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.870 
while they'll be a raid where I actually
do<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.650> use<00:01:16.770> all<00:01:16.979> 17<00:01:17.580> or<00:01:17.850> 16<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.880> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
do have to use all 17 or 16 and that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.780 
do have to use all 17 or 16 and that
depends<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.540> how<00:01:22.170> comfortable<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.770> feel<00:01:22.799> with

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
depends on how comfortable you feel with

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.210 
depends on how comfortable you feel with
deploying<00:01:24.420> those<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.920> feel<00:01:26.040> comfortable

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
deploying those if you feel comfortable

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.670 
deploying those if you feel comfortable
with<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:26.759> 10<00:01:27.000> wall<00:01:27.180> breakers<00:01:27.680> then

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
with just 10 wall breakers then

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.240 
with just 10 wall breakers then
definitely<00:01:29.009> just<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.640> make<00:01:29.790> 10<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.770> go

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
definitely just just make 10 but I go

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.310 
definitely just just make 10 but I go
for<00:01:32.460> 17<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.329> case<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.930> one<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.200> those

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
for 17 just in case I have one of those

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.050 
for 17 just in case I have one of those
difficult<00:01:34.799> rates<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.369> lot<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> resources

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
difficult rates but a lot of resources

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.080 
difficult rates but a lot of resources
on<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.570> line<00:01:37.100> now<00:01:38.100> i<00:01:38.130> only<00:01:38.400> get<00:01:38.610> 40<00:01:38.909> for

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
on the line now i only get 40 for

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.850 
on the line now i only get 40 for
goblins<00:01:39.299> because<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.350> definitely<00:01:40.560> don't

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
goblins because you definitely don't

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.450 
goblins because you definitely don't
need<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.100> many<00:01:41.340> goblins<00:01:41.990> goblins<00:01:42.990> tech

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
so if you're doing it correctly you want

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.179 
so if you're doing it correctly you want
to<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.619> most<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.460> your<00:01:50.490> army<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.149> archers

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.990 
elixir you'll see that he has four
storages<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:22.100> most<00:02:23.100> of<00:02:23.250> his<00:02:23.340> collectors<00:02:23.790> are

pretty low so we have to target though

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.880 
pretty low so we have to target though
the<00:02:27.330> storages<00:02:27.750> because<00:02:28.050> all<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.530> liquor<00:02:28.770> is

closer to is elixir we have almost

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.580 
closer to is elixir we have almost
direct<00:03:06.000> access<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.690> there's<00:03:07.230> only<00:03:07.380> two

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
direct access to it there's only two

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.460 
direct access to it there's only two
levels<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.040> walls<00:03:08.570> um<00:03:09.570> and<00:03:10.020> you'll<00:03:10.200> see<00:03:10.350> that

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
levels of walls um and you'll see that

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.260 
levels of walls um and you'll see that
he<00:03:10.590> probably<00:03:10.770> has<00:03:10.950> hidden<00:03:11.160> Tesla's<00:03:11.670> here<00:03:11.970> so

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
he probably has hidden Tesla's here so

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.830 
he probably has hidden Tesla's here so
we<00:03:13.170> want<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.380> watch<00:03:13.500> out<00:03:13.710> for<00:03:13.890> those<00:03:14.040> now<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.450> did

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
maybe he has other traps so that they

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.540 
maybe he has other traps so that they

damage<00:03:50.310> as<00:03:50.700> an<00:03:51.360> as<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.080> barbarian<00:03:52.470> king<00:03:52.709> um

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
damage as an as the barbarian king um

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.310 
damage as an as the barbarian king um
because<00:03:53.760> she<00:03:54.150> has<00:03:54.300> higher<00:03:54.510> range<00:03:54.840> than<00:03:55.140> any

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
because she has higher range than any

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.710

other<00:03:55.530> unit<00:03:55.890> in<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.070> game<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.690> she's<00:03:57.690> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
other unit in the game and she's the
