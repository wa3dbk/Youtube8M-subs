00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.859
 I want to share with lovers of fish 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.740
 catching invented but also in a way 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.089
 winding leads with hooks 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.640
 way that they never get confused and 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.250
 the case when you need to urgently change 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.289
 ragged fishing leash 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.170
 this can be done quickly and without problems and 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.759
 so take a piece of corrugated cardboard 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.660
 we make cuts with scissors 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.110
 about a centimeter long with two 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.079
 sides below and above and start 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.410
 reel 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.989
 pre-assembled hook leashes 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.989
 but this piece of cardboard and so 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:14.650
 the edge of the loop is obtained 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:19.259
 then loop insert the next hook with 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.259
 leash and continue to reel 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:37.200
 the loop again turned out next 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:37.200
 hook insert and reel 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.229
 loop again next hook 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.229
 insert loop and stretch us 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.229
 reel 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.060
 loop again 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.070
 this carton can be wound 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.070
 endless crochet number 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:33.670
 the order is wound and it does not matter 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.780
 let's say and wound a lot now I want 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.840
 show karts in case of breakage of the leash 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.040
 on fishing tackle how to use 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.130
 you take out this carton you take 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 loosely sticking his own loop 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.000
 the last hook was coiled 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.380
 inspect 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:03.010
 as well as reeled up 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.020
 hook loop is free 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.290
 loops which next time when 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:14.550
 hook will need to remove the leash you 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:24.790
 take this loop again and reel 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:27.850
 looking out here please take off 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.970
 again the loop is free ie food 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.920
 ready to act neither tail nor scales 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.470
 I think that my way of winding 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.470
 leads you need
