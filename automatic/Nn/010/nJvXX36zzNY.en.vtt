think this can be considered a long book

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.700 
think this can be considered a long book

in any word strongest parts in the book

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.620 
in any word strongest parts in the book
and<00:05:18.920> especially<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.520> ending<00:05:20.000> which<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.360> in<00:05:20.510> my

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
and especially the ending which is in my

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.660 
and especially the ending which is in my
opinion<00:05:20.660> its<00:05:21.140> strongest<00:05:21.650> feature<00:05:21.980> actually

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
opinion its strongest feature actually

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.490

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
actually really disliked it and I think

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.580 
actually really disliked it and I think
if<00:06:51.060> you're<00:06:51.180> allergic<00:06:51.510> to<00:06:51.750> experimental

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
if you're allergic to experimental

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
leaves a lot at the same time I think

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.100 
leaves a lot at the same time I think
that<00:06:56.550> if<00:06:56.790> you<00:06:56.910> go<00:06:57.090> through<00:06:57.480> all<00:06:57.510> these<00:06:57.900> pages

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
that if you go through all these pages

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.650 
that if you go through all these pages
you<00:06:58.500> are<00:06:58.560> pretty<00:06:58.920> much<00:06:58.980> bound<00:06:59.460> to<00:06:59.670> end<00:07:00.150> up<00:07:00.420> like

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
you are pretty much bound to end up like
