through<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.110> make<00:01:40.320> sure<00:01:40.350> everything's<00:01:41.130> fully

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
through and make sure everything's fully

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.300 
through and make sure everything's fully
died<00:01:41.930> once<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.140> got<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> color<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:43.950> i'm

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
died once it's got the color on it i'm

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.749 
died once it's got the color on it i'm
going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.610> wrap<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.299> foil<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:47.070> foil<00:01:47.340> is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
going to wrap it in foil and the foil is

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.510 
going to wrap it in foil and the foil is
really<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.710> kind<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.040> secludes

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
really just so that it kind of secludes

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.880 
really just so that it kind of secludes
the<00:01:50.759> hair<00:01:51.030> from<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> rest<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.780> your<00:01:51.899> hair<00:01:52.170> so

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the hair from the rest of your hair so

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.490 
the hair from the rest of your hair so
that<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.100> don't<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.460> die<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.210> areas<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that you don't get die on areas that you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.920 
that you don't get die on areas that you
don't<00:01:55.770> want<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.390> takes<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.659> little<00:01:57.750> bit

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
don't want it and it takes a little bit

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.490 
don't want it and it takes a little bit
of<00:01:57.990> practice<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.030> foil<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.020> wrap<00:02:01.229> up

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
of practice to get the foil to wrap up

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.569 
of practice to get the foil to wrap up
nicely<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.460> that's<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.420> finished<00:02:03.570> product

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
nicely but that's the finished product

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.310 
nicely but that's the finished product
now<00:02:05.579> this<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.759> another<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.990> one<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
now this is another one and this one you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.199 
now this is another one and this one you
actually<00:02:07.860> can<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> little<00:02:08.670> better<00:02:08.789> i'm

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
actually can see a little better i'm

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.800 
actually can see a little better i'm
more<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.660> frame<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:11.390> just<00:02:12.390> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.569> do<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
more in frame and just going to do the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.880 
more in frame and just going to do the
same<00:02:12.989> thing<00:02:13.319> rub

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
same thing rub

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.790 
same thing rub
I<00:02:14.040> into<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> hair<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.090> wrap<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.660> in<00:02:15.780> foil<00:02:16.050> now

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
I into the hair and wrap it in foil now

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.309 
I into the hair and wrap it in foil now
what<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.100> started<00:02:17.520> doing<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:18.270> kind<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.870> twisting

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
what I started doing is kind of twisting

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.860 
what I started doing is kind of twisting
it<00:02:19.410> around<00:02:19.500> my<00:02:19.770> fingers<00:02:20.160> into<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> spiral<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
it around my fingers into a spiral and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.710 
it around my fingers into a spiral and
then<00:02:22.260> applying<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:23.130> foils<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.330> it's<00:02:24.510> all

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
then applying the foils that it's all

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.590 
then applying the foils that it's all
nicely<00:02:25.050> contained<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.240> after<00:02:27.390> i'm

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
nicely contained so this is after i'm

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.140 
nicely contained so this is after i'm
done<00:02:27.750> with<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.080> raspberries<00:02:28.770> color<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.610> as

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
done with the raspberries color and as

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.330 
done with the raspberries color and as
you<00:02:30.270> can<00:02:30.420> see<00:02:30.450> I've<00:02:31.380> got<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> bunch<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.950> foils

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
you can see I've got a bunch of foils

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.820 
you can see I've got a bunch of foils
all<00:02:32.610> throughout<00:02:32.880> my<00:02:33.090> hair<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.630> now<00:02:34.380> I'm<00:02:34.560> going

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
all throughout my hair and now I'm going

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.850 
all throughout my hair and now I'm going
to<00:02:34.950> move<00:02:35.070> on<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.790> pink<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.390> already<00:02:37.290> did<00:02:37.470> one

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
to move on to the pink I already did one

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.040 
to move on to the pink I already did one
strand<00:02:38.280> because<00:02:38.790> basically<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> same

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
strand because basically it's the same

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.110 
strand because basically it's the same
thing<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.739> my<00:02:41.010> things<00:02:41.310> all<00:02:41.459> sudsy<00:02:41.700> because<00:02:42.030> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
thing and my things all sudsy because I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.510 
thing and my things all sudsy because I
dropped<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.570> sink<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.650> now<00:02:44.250> I'm<00:02:44.489> just

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
dropped it in the sink and now I'm just

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.690 
dropped it in the sink and now I'm just
going<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.030> wrap<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.020> piece<00:02:46.320> in<00:02:46.620> foil<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.550> as

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
going to wrap that piece in foil just as

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.520 
going to wrap that piece in foil just as
I<00:02:47.730> did<00:02:47.910> with<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.540> raspberries<00:02:48.989> color<00:02:49.260> and

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
I did with the raspberries color and

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.150 
I did with the raspberries color and
this<00:02:50.100> one<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.700> forgot<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.720> spiral<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.709> now

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
this one I forgot to spiral it and now

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.090 
this one I forgot to spiral it and now
I'm<00:02:53.400> struggling<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.269> shove<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.780> into<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.320> foil

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
I'm struggling to shove it into the foil

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.780 
I'm struggling to shove it into the foil
without<00:02:56.970> getting<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.540> everywhere<00:02:58.519> yeah<00:02:59.519> these

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
without getting it everywhere yeah these

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.020 
without getting it everywhere yeah these
foils<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.900> be<00:03:01.050> kind<00:03:01.230> of<00:03:01.290> tricky<00:03:02.030> especially

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
foils can be kind of tricky especially

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.360 
foils can be kind of tricky especially
if<00:03:03.510> you're<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.500> just<00:03:04.530> jump<00:03:05.010> into<00:03:05.190> it

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
if you're just if you just jump into it

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.220 
if you're just if you just jump into it
you<00:03:05.459> know<00:03:05.489> just<00:03:06.090> wrap<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.600> then<00:03:06.840> it's<00:03:07.019> like

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
you know just wrap it and then it's like

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.790 
you know just wrap it and then it's like
oh<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.220> trap<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.580> but<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:10.320> turned<00:03:10.650> out

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
oh and I can trap it but it turned out

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.040 
oh and I can trap it but it turned out
fine<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.400> mean<00:03:11.820> whatever<00:03:14.000> now<00:03:15.000> I'm<00:03:15.570> just<00:03:15.750> doing

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
fine I mean whatever now I'm just doing

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.050 
fine I mean whatever now I'm just doing
the<00:03:16.170> same<00:03:16.320> thing<00:03:16.590> again<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.400> one<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.610> remember

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
the same thing again that one I remember

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.229 
the same thing again that one I remember
to<00:03:18.209> twist<00:03:18.420> yay<00:03:19.130> so<00:03:20.130> it's<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.310> lot<00:03:20.430> easier<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.850> I

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
to twist yay so it's a lot easier and I

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.690 
to twist yay so it's a lot easier and I
just<00:03:21.420> kind<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.920> pinch<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.040> at<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.250> top<00:03:23.459> and

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
just kind of pinch it at the top and

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.890 
just kind of pinch it at the top and
then<00:03:23.790> gathered<00:03:24.480> around<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.870> bottom<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.519> then

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
then gathered around the bottom and then

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.180 
then gathered around the bottom and then
now<00:03:27.900> I'm<00:03:27.989> going<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.200> do<00:03:28.290> one<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.680> back<00:03:28.860> and

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
now I'm going to do one in the back and

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.710 
now I'm going to do one in the back and
the<00:03:29.340> back<00:03:29.370> ones<00:03:29.970> were<00:03:30.180> probably<00:03:30.480> the

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
the back ones were probably the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.080 
the back ones were probably the
trickiest<00:03:30.900> they<00:03:31.500> come<00:03:32.250> out<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.640> most<00:03:32.820> and

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
trickiest they come out the most and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.910 
trickiest they come out the most and

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
fine and then I did it and then it came

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.680 
fine and then I did it and then it came
out<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:54.990> Anica<00:04:55.919> is<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.310> placement<00:04:56.640> cuz<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.360> put

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
out and Anica is the placement cuz I put

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.090 
out and Anica is the placement cuz I put
it<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.900> little<00:04:57.930> bit<00:04:58.230> higher<00:04:58.440> than<00:04:58.470> I<00:04:58.830> put<00:04:59.010> the

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
it a little bit higher than I put the

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.040 
it a little bit higher than I put the
rest<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.460> this<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.850> for<00:05:00.390> whatever<00:05:00.540> reason<00:05:00.720> I

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
rest of this and for whatever reason I

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.230 
rest of this and for whatever reason I
ended<00:05:01.140> up<00:05:01.290> hating<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:02.430> I<00:05:02.460> just<00:05:02.880> cut<00:05:03.030> my

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
ended up hating it and so I just cut my

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.300 
ended up hating it and so I just cut my
bangs<00:05:03.419> which<00:05:04.050> is<00:05:04.200> fine<00:05:04.440> because<00:05:04.800> they're

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
bangs which is fine because they're

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.490 
bangs which is fine because they're
bangs<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:06.060> I've<00:05:06.419> needed<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.900> cut<00:05:07.050> them<00:05:07.200> anyway

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
bangs and I've needed to cut them anyway

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.280 
bangs and I've needed to cut them anyway
they<00:05:07.680> were<00:05:07.740> getting<00:05:07.919> too<00:05:08.190> long<00:05:08.430> but<00:05:09.290> anywhere

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
they were getting too long but anywhere

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.840 
they were getting too long but anywhere
else<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.770> wouldn't<00:05:10.980> have<00:05:11.100> been<00:05:11.190> so<00:05:11.400> easy<00:05:11.430> to

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
else it wouldn't have been so easy to

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.420 
else it wouldn't have been so easy to
fix<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.419> so<00:05:13.200> I'm<00:05:13.410> very<00:05:13.620> lucky<00:05:13.770> that<00:05:13.979> nothing

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430

but i was able to fix it so um by
cutting<00:05:27.419> which<00:05:27.630> is<00:05:27.840> kind<00:05:28.110> of<00:05:28.290> a<00:05:28.610> more<00:05:29.610> drastic

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
cutting which is kind of a more drastic

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.510 
cutting which is kind of a more drastic
way<00:05:30.330> to<00:05:30.390> fix<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.870> so<00:05:31.380> if<00:05:32.070> you<00:05:32.160> want<00:05:32.310> to<00:05:32.430> avoid

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
way to fix it so if you want to avoid

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.360 
way to fix it so if you want to avoid
cutting<00:05:33.090> your<00:05:33.300> hair<00:05:33.600> i<00:05:33.840> suggest<00:05:34.710> going<00:05:35.010> lower

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
cutting your hair i suggest going lower

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.300 
cutting your hair i suggest going lower
and<00:05:35.700> dying<00:05:36.270> less<00:05:36.870> i<00:05:37.200> knew<00:05:37.470> i<00:05:37.500> wanted<00:05:37.770> this<00:05:38.130> much

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
and dying less i knew i wanted this much

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.670 
and dying less i knew i wanted this much
so<00:05:38.520> that's<00:05:38.669> fine<00:05:38.910> but<00:05:39.479> dying<00:05:39.750> less<00:05:40.080> than<00:05:40.470> you

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
so that's fine but dying less than you

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.920 
so that's fine but dying less than you
think<00:05:40.919> you<00:05:41.190> want<00:05:41.430> because<00:05:42.330> what<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:42.630> wanted

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
think you want because what you wanted

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.830 
think you want because what you wanted
the<00:05:43.020> beginning<00:05:43.470> might<00:05:43.740> not<00:05:44.010> be<00:05:44.340> a<00:05:44.660> what<00:05:45.660> you

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
the beginning might not be a what you

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.560 
the beginning might not be a what you
want<00:05:46.530> in<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:46.800> end<00:05:46.830> or<00:05:47.340> be<00:05:47.640> what<00:05:47.880> you<00:05:48.030> get<00:05:48.360> in

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
want in the end or be what you get in

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.890 
want in the end or be what you get in
the<00:05:48.720> end<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.500> other<00:05:49.740> than<00:05:49.979> adding<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.610> few<00:05:50.820> more

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
the end so other than adding a few more

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.580 
the end so other than adding a few more
pieces<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.500> I'm<00:05:53.280> going<00:05:53.460> to<00:05:53.580> try<00:05:53.850> to<00:05:54.590> blend

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
pieces and I'm going to try to blend

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.170 
pieces and I'm going to try to blend
these<00:05:56.419> because<00:05:57.419> they<00:05:57.690> kind<00:05:57.990> of<00:05:58.910> stopped<00:05:59.910> in

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
these because they kind of stopped in

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.520 
these because they kind of stopped in
chunks<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:01.820> I'm<00:06:02.820> not<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.030> huge<00:06:03.360> fan<00:06:03.539> of<00:06:03.870> that<00:06:04.200> I

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
chunks and I'm not a huge fan of that I

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.920 
chunks and I'm not a huge fan of that I
want<00:06:05.010> to<00:06:05.130> see<00:06:05.310> like<00:06:05.460> right<00:06:05.610> here<00:06:06.030> maybe<00:06:06.630> I'll

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
maybe I'll put like a little I'm a

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.240 
maybe I'll put like a little I'm a
little<00:06:08.820> bit<00:06:08.940> more<00:06:09.150> above<00:06:09.660> it<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:10.140> leave<00:06:11.010> it<00:06:11.039> in

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
little bit more above it and leave it in

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.070 
little bit more above it and leave it in
for<00:06:11.280> a<00:06:11.580> little<00:06:11.669> less<00:06:11.940> time<00:06:11.970> so<00:06:12.510> it's<00:06:12.630> not<00:06:12.810> as

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
for a little less time so it's not as

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.900 
for a little less time so it's not as
dark<00:06:13.560> I<00:06:13.970> might<00:06:14.970> try<00:06:15.150> that<00:06:15.240> so<00:06:15.930> that<00:06:16.050> it's<00:06:16.200> more

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
dark I might try that so that it's more

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.400 
dark I might try that so that it's more
gradual<00:06:17.910> instead<00:06:18.240> of<00:06:18.330> just<00:06:18.510> a<00:06:18.630> blunt<00:06:18.900> laughs
