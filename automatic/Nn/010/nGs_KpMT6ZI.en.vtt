the box and like you can kind of see how

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.570 
the box and like you can kind of see how
like<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.380> white<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.830> was<00:05:01.920> white<00:05:02.130> stitching

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
like the white that was white stitching

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.680 
like the white that was white stitching
and<00:05:02.670> they're<00:05:02.790> kind<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:02.970> black<00:05:03.210> now<00:05:03.420> because

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
and they're kind of black now because

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.200 
and they're kind of black now because
the<00:05:03.780> dirt<00:05:04.020> that's<00:05:04.590> fine<00:05:04.830> don't<00:05:05.220> care<00:05:05.490> kind<00:05:06.180> of

looks better i think because the black
goes<00:05:07.800> on<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.010> light<00:05:08.390> that's<00:05:09.390> fine<00:05:09.630> um<00:05:09.900> these
