00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.009 
application problems in the past but let
me<00:02:31.620> tell<00:02:31.859> you<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.310> detail<00:02:32.819> on<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.390> piece<00:02:33.689> and

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
me tell you the detail on this piece and

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.069 
me tell you the detail on this piece and
the<00:02:35.010> paintwork<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.670> magnificent<00:02:36.540> when<00:02:36.689> I<00:02:36.720> saw

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
the paintwork is magnificent when I saw

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.660 
the paintwork is magnificent when I saw
this<00:02:37.260> piece<00:02:37.500> what<00:02:37.739> made<00:02:37.950> me<00:02:38.069> want<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.489> right

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
this piece what made me want it right

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.780 
this piece what made me want it right
away<00:02:38.819> was<00:02:39.659> this<00:02:39.870> base<00:02:40.170> how<00:02:40.950> he's<00:02:41.129> like<00:02:41.280> ripping

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
away was this base how he's like ripping

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.149 
away was this base how he's like ripping
through<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.060> concrete<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:43.319> like<00:02:43.530> Iron<00:02:43.829> Man

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
through the concrete just like Iron Man

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.759 
through the concrete just like Iron Man
would<00:02:44.370> be<00:02:44.549> if<00:02:44.700> he<00:02:44.819> got<00:02:44.940> pushed<00:02:45.299> back<00:02:45.389> or<00:02:45.989> if<00:02:46.260> he

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
would be if he got pushed back or if he

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.569 
would be if he got pushed back or if he
landed<00:02:47.370> or<00:02:47.549> something<00:02:48.049> but<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:49.319> love<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.370> base

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
landed or something but I love the base

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.679 
landed or something but I love the base
it's<00:02:51.000> really<00:02:51.690> cool<00:02:52.099> really<00:02:53.099> different<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.940> I

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
it's really cool really different and I

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.520 
it's really cool really different and I
like<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:55.470> lot<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.010> detail<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:56.909> this<00:02:57.060> is

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
like it a lot the detail on this is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.979 
like it a lot the detail on this is
really<00:02:58.530> phenomenal<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.760> lights<00:03:00.030> which<00:03:00.329> is

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
really phenomenal the lights which is

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.800 
really phenomenal the lights which is
actually<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.769> think<00:03:02.459> it's<00:03:02.879> his<00:03:03.090> left<00:03:03.389> shoulder

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.940 

hold<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.230> second

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
hold on a second

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.920 
hold on a second
I'm<00:03:08.879> pretty<00:03:09.150> sure<00:03:09.420> it's<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.810> left<00:03:10.049> shoulder

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
I'm pretty sure it's the left shoulder

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.559 
I'm pretty sure it's the left shoulder
yep<00:03:12.959> it's<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.709> left<00:03:13.949> shoulder<00:03:14.329> and<00:03:15.329> there's

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
yep it's a left shoulder and there's

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.710 
yep it's a left shoulder and there's
three<00:03:15.810> switches<00:03:16.169> on<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.680> bad<00:03:16.889> boy

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
three switches on this bad boy

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.720 
three switches on this bad boy
you<00:03:18.720> could<00:03:18.959> switch<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:19.980> off<00:03:20.220> right<00:03:20.489> now

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
you could switch it it's off right now

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.080 
you could switch it it's off right now
you<00:03:21.569> can<00:03:21.750> put<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:21.989> in<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.199> middle<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:23.090> sensor

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
you can put it in the middle for sensor

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.199 
you can put it in the middle for sensor
wear<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.049> like<00:03:25.290> senses<00:03:25.889> or<00:03:26.159> you<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.909> push<00:03:27.090> it

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
wear it like senses or you can push it

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.970 
wear it like senses or you can push it
up<00:03:27.329> for<00:03:27.599> on<00:03:27.720> all<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.169> time<00:03:28.379> I'm<00:03:28.620> gonna<00:03:28.769> leave

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
up for on all the time I'm gonna leave

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.580 
up for on all the time I'm gonna leave
it<00:03:29.159> on<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.459> motion<00:03:29.879> sensor<00:03:30.389> this<00:03:31.260> thing<00:03:31.470> in

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
it on the motion sensor this thing in

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.610 
it on the motion sensor this thing in
his<00:03:31.680> back<00:03:31.980> right<00:03:32.250> here<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:34.260> thing<00:03:34.470> right

his back right here that thing right
there<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:35.099> actually<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.699> motion<00:03:36.090> sensor

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
there is actually the motion sensor

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.339 
there is actually the motion sensor
which<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.709> really<00:03:38.190> cool<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:39.780> something<00:03:40.169> new

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
which is really cool it's something new

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
piece back on here and I'll show you how

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.149 
piece back on here and I'll show you how
it<00:03:47.879> works

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
it works

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:52.440 
it works
it<00:03:50.159> goes<00:03:50.370> on<00:03:50.549> nicely

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
it goes on nicely

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.850 
it goes on nicely
as<00:03:53.290> you<00:03:53.500> see<00:03:53.739> his<00:03:53.950> lights<00:03:54.220> are<00:03:54.459> on<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:56.530> chest

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
as you see his lights are on the chest

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.650 
as you see his lights are on the chest
piece<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.459> eyes<00:03:57.610> light<00:03:57.940> up<00:03:57.970> which<00:03:58.300> is<00:03:58.420> it

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
piece and the eyes light up which is it

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.089 
piece and the eyes light up which is it
looks<00:03:58.840> really<00:03:59.290> cool<00:03:59.560> and<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.709> said<00:04:02.950> the

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
looks really cool and like I said the

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.979 
looks really cool and like I said the
hand<00:04:03.370> pot<00:04:03.790> does<00:04:04.120> not<00:04:04.300> light<00:04:04.510> up<00:04:04.540> which

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
hand pot does not light up which

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.240 
hand pot does not light up which
probably<00:04:05.560> would<00:04:05.769> have<00:04:05.830> been<00:04:05.950> cool<00:04:06.099> if<00:04:06.160> they

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
probably would have been cool if they

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.150 
probably would have been cool if they
did<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.430> but<00:04:06.819> whatever<00:04:07.680> okay<00:04:08.680> it's<00:04:08.890> very

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
did that but whatever okay it's very

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.030 
did that but whatever okay it's very
sensitive<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.720> sense<00:04:11.019> of<00:04:11.170> the<00:04:11.290> motion<00:04:11.680> sensor

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
sensitive the sense of the motion sensor

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.580 
sensitive the sense of the motion sensor
is<00:04:12.190> very<00:04:12.220> sensitive<00:04:12.989> watch<00:04:13.989> this<00:04:14.230> I'll<00:04:14.410> wave

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
is very sensitive watch this I'll wave

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.000 
is very sensitive watch this I'll wave
my<00:04:14.620> hand<00:04:15.010> behind<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.580> and<00:04:15.819> it<00:04:16.180> what<00:04:16.359> goes<00:04:16.540> on<00:04:17.010> it

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
my hand behind it and it what goes on it

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.729 
my hand behind it and it what goes on it
lights<00:04:18.370> up<00:04:18.579> if<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.389> have<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.870> light<00:04:20.049> off<00:04:20.290> in

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
lights up if you have the light off in

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.200 
lights up if you have the light off in
the<00:04:20.829> room<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.220> you<00:04:21.400> turn<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.760> light<00:04:21.910> on<00:04:21.940> when

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
the room and you turn the light on when

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.760 
the room and you turn the light on when
you<00:04:22.300> walk<00:04:22.419> in<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.690> room<00:04:22.810> just<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.500> light

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
you walk in the room just the light

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.580 
you walk in the room just the light
going<00:04:23.979> on<00:04:24.250> makes<00:04:24.729> this<00:04:24.970> thing<00:04:25.210> go<00:04:25.270> off<00:04:25.590> so

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
going on makes this thing go off so

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.320 
going on makes this thing go off so
that's<00:04:26.740> why<00:04:26.919> I<00:04:26.950> shut<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.490> off<00:04:29.820> there<00:04:30.820> you<00:04:30.970> go<00:04:31.150> it

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
that's why I shut it off there you go it

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.690 
that's why I shut it off there you go it
went<00:04:31.450> off<00:04:31.720> again<00:04:31.870> as<00:04:32.590> soon<00:04:32.740> as<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:32.950> move<00:04:33.130> it<00:04:33.340> it

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
went off again as soon as you move it it

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.600 
went off again as soon as you move it it
goes<00:04:33.940> on<00:04:34.210> it's<00:04:34.600> very<00:04:35.020> sensitive<00:04:35.580> so<00:04:36.580> I

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
goes on it's very sensitive so I

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.010 
goes on it's very sensitive so I
actually<00:04:36.880> should<00:04:37.180> have<00:04:37.210> put<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.540> lights<00:04:37.810> are

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
actually should have put the lights are
