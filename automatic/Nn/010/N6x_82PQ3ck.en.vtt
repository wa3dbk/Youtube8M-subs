00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.980
 Hello my name is Dmitri 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.020
 and again we are in shopping remember 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.270
 the words of the face of the stove in our porsche 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.699
 issue let's say we are enough 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.740
 familiarized themselves with the company's furnace 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.960
 tons to him anglo we sent she works 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 looked at or spec features 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.779
 even the project was planned 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.970
 cooked meals 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.679
 but we do not stand still and study 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.050
 excellent education further and now 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.239
 name your little bit different model 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.660
 a number of the furnace top company which is a bit 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.090
 more powerful which, respectively, and size 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.180
 more here 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.660
 me one of these stoves we say 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.620
 Lenny 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.660
 choose and made it a detailed review but 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.790
 before we start learning new 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.470
 oven line and company form I would like 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.840
 focus your attention on 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.510
 quite relevant topic assigned 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.930
 the actual question of pricing and how 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.390
 I buy quality normal teach here 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.710
 I was personally interested in the question 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.020
 I came to the social network 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.320
 message from 1st to teach which 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.530
 took an interest like this 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.600
 interesting phenomenon he did not show one 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.600
 the oven and showed another oven they are very 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.430
 were similar but their price was different 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.960
 about fifty percent polyester 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.960
 graphic 10,000 another . cost 18 17 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.759
 thousand rubles actually now they 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.899
 were being about stove brand and so on i'm 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.240
 let's talk to a friend 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.509
 why can there be such a price range 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.070
 and what could be the reason is all of us 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.050
 we know what steel is used for 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.330
 the production of the night must equip 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.670
 to be high strength quality steel 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.450
 which should be designed for 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.350
 numerous heating and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.130
 numerous cool accordingly 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.050
 characterizes such steel 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.270
 and many different kinds of impurities 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.690
 which, if we allow alloy there 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.640
 added it provides 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.880
 the longevity of our furnace and this 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.670
 provides 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.710
 peril in fact and many 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.190
 all sorts of such important such 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.780
 nuances and peculiarities are not for nothing 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.230
 It has a huge number exists 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.959
 different alliances of some kind 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.489
 specialized companies that 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.660
 are engaged in certification which 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.190
 engaged in licensing 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.800
 like direct check 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.540
 product quality and how it gets 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.880
 on the shelves and if such commissions are not 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.790
 It was the first and the water did not have this 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.580
 the status of a quality product and those 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.720
 same store shelves 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.110
 European hitters are huge 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.150
 amount for example chinese i don't even 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.620
 they say that for example what is untrue 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.110
 maybe not as there either there 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.300
 possible in principle and qualitatively but he 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.580
 may not be intended for manual 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.310
 equipped with everything perfectly understand that 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.740
 why do you need to become very high strength 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.930
 cause because it happens constantly 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.430
 manipulation of heating and cooling all 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.070
 we know that when heated insert 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.470
 It expands on cooling it narrows 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.810
 so the metal must be for 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.980
 this intended appetite should be 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.840
 as I said impurities 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.430
 specialized which is permissible 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.860
 add some kind of elasticity well 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.310
 saying which instead provides 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.890
 long-term product and safety 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.060
 of course except metal and part of the street and 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.470
 other materials 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.840
 this 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.860
 glass is from fireclay tyranny and years 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.170
 tension mechanisms once closing 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.210
 I'm in my last review actively about it 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.520
 says well, for example, if chamotte 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.710
 poor quality ceramics installed 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.320
 inward or chamotte tap just the very 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.380
 of itself is not so hot what quality 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.540
 I won't understand my way 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.280
 the function does not give the exchange direct 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.870
 touching the steel frame this 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.850
 very important and it increases always 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.350
 long term and debt these works 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.570
 oven equipment 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.740
 if something starts to creak in the oven 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.090
 if in the furnace some got 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.820
 done it doesn't close it already 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.560
 an indicator that the oven is already possible 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.580
 tomorrow you will not work like that when 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.840
 same today if the glass in cookies 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.650
 specialized flint forms she 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.770
 may crack 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.110
 all this again nuances and all again 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.570
 little things that can continue to play 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.770
 huge role 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.510
 summarizing my whole speech I want to say 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.820
 what is really apart from the plural 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.560
 nuances about quality yet 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.180
 Russian consumer is slowly but surely 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.200
 catching up with European consumer 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.000
 understanding of the market will require we all 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.890
 we want to drive a quality car 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.520
 we all want to enjoy quality 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.980
 technique 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.860
 we all want to manage quality food 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.440
 and the normal rules which need 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.240
 after all, seeks from our demands 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.009
 depends on the principle the end result of it 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.469
 struck 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:46.080
 if we save jointly and deed 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:49.379
 we lose from the store only a mousetrap 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.659
 so i'm glad there is some shift 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:54.149
 such a positive side and so 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:56.249
 really great thank you u 

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:58.889
 We look with you was Dmitry and ours 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:01.550
 operator ivan sign cutie like 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.550
 bye everyone
