00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
produces a ton of energy so that I don't

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.380 
produces a ton of energy so that I don't
have<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:26.080> work<00:01:26.230> quite<00:01:26.530> as<00:01:26.710> hard<00:01:26.740> so<00:01:27.390> without

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390

guitars<00:02:08.080> again<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.100> decided<00:02:09.490> to

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
guitars again and I decided to

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.270 
guitars again and I decided to
incorporate<00:02:10.350> some<00:02:11.350> of<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.590> current<00:02:11.890> design

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
top and it's very lightweight so it

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.030 
top and it's very lightweight so it

urethane or nitrocellulose finish but I

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.430 
urethane or nitrocellulose finish but I
believe<00:02:45.070> that<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.580> added<00:02:46.269> benefit<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.989> tone

believe that the added benefit in tone

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.860 
believe that the added benefit in tone
and<00:02:47.680> responsiveness<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.670> worth<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.720> extra

and responsiveness is worth the extra

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.740 
and responsiveness is worth the extra
amount<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.350> care<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:50.890> takes<00:02:51.750> another

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.560 
design option or a design feature I
should<00:02:55.300> say<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:58.060> double<00:02:58.360> sides

actually<00:02:59.410> make<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.519> rim<00:03:00.700> assembly<00:03:01.180> out

actually make the the rim assembly out

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.509 
actually make the the rim assembly out

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
about two millimeters thick which gives

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.759 
about two millimeters thick which gives

you a rim that is very strong it's over

an eighth of an inch thick the theory
behind<00:03:12.550> this<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.480> if<00:03:14.050> we<00:03:14.709> could<00:03:14.830> somehow

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
behind this is if we could somehow

behind this is if we could somehow

little change in the angle because

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.909 
little change in the angle because
you're<00:05:08.210> not<00:05:08.360> changing<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:08.960> height<00:05:09.139> of<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.650> of

you neck reset you know you've taken the

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.010 
you neck reset you know you've taken the

neck off guys will kind of compensate

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.629 
neck off guys will kind of compensate
for<00:05:28.050> that<00:05:28.110> though<00:05:28.440> they'll<00:05:28.830> put<00:05:29.250> a<00:05:29.280> little<00:05:29.550> bit

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
for that though they'll put a little bit

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
more angle on it and then they'll raise

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.290
