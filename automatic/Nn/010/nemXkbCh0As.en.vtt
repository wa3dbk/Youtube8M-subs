a<00:00:22.230> lot<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.830> because<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.490> know

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
a lot of it because it's like you know

a lot of it because it's like you know
they're<00:00:23.699> running<00:00:23.789> down<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> hall<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.660> kids

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
but there was some Easter eggs in there

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.269 
but there was some Easter eggs in there
for<00:00:27.510> example<00:00:27.720> when<00:00:27.990> they<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.830> room

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
for example when they go to that room

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.519 
for example when they go to that room
you<00:00:29.490> see<00:00:29.699> all<00:00:29.939> those<00:00:30.090> seemingly<00:00:30.990> dead<00:00:31.289> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
you see all those seemingly dead and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.870 
you see all those seemingly dead and
frozen<00:00:31.740> people<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.520> look<00:00:32.640> closely

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
frozen people but if you look closely

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.080 
frozen people but if you look closely
they're<00:00:33.630> wearing<00:00:34.230> what<00:00:34.469> seems<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> be<00:00:35.090> jail

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
they're wearing what seems to be jail

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.119 
they're wearing what seems to be jail
uniforms<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> could<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.649> people<00:00:37.980> from

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
uniforms so it could be people from

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.069 
uniforms so it could be people from
impel<00:00:38.820> down<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.510> know<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.660> law<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
impel down so we know that law is

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.350 
impel down so we know that law is
definitely<00:00:40.620> hiding<00:00:41.610> more<00:00:41.820> than<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.239> meets

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
definitely hiding more than what meets

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.840 
definitely hiding more than what meets
the<00:00:42.540> eyes<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.870> that's<00:00:43.230> my<00:00:43.379> vacation<00:00:43.559> spot<00:00:44.280> so
