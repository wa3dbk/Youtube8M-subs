let's start with the rear they have a
370z<00:00:34.579> 14-inch<00:00:35.579> rotors<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> rear<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.559> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
brim go on the right that you see is

from<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> Dodge<00:00:39.840> SRT<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.469> world<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.370> don't

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
from the Dodge SRT a world and I don't

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.430 
from the Dodge SRT a world and I don't
know<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> technical<00:00:42.480> specs<00:00:42.960> off<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> top<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
know the technical specs off the top of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.250 
know the technical specs off the top of
my<00:00:43.500> head<00:00:43.710> but<00:00:43.950> they're<00:00:44.700> four<00:00:44.910> Pistons<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
my head but they're four Pistons and I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.229 
my head but they're four Pistons and I
saw<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> factories<00:00:47.100> d31<00:00:47.579> brake<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.940> there<00:00:48.059> but

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
saw the factories d31 brake on there but

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
saw the factories d31 brake on there but
that's<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.629> ebrake<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.590> doesn't<00:00:49.860> serve

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
that's just for ebrake it doesn't serve

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.260 
that's just for ebrake it doesn't serve
any<00:00:50.190> purpose<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.670> not<00:00:50.700> plumbed<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
any purpose it's not plumbed into the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.090 
any purpose it's not plumbed into the
line<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.170> hold<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> car<00:00:52.890> well

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
line so it's just to hold the car well

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.369 
line so it's just to hold the car well
sparked<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.870> move<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> front

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
sparked and so if we move to the front

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.290 
sparked and so if we move to the front
what<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:58.609> sold<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> 17

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.020 
what I have up here is I sold the 17

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
moti Iggy's and got 18 so I could have

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.280 
moti Iggy's and got 18 so I could have
matching<00:01:03.780> set<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.250> had<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.610> six<00:01:05.909> pot<00:01:06.290> big

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
matching set but I had this six pot big

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.920 
matching set but I had this six pot big
brakes<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.640> these<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.880> 14-inch<00:01:09.420> 370z

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
brakes up here so these are 14-inch 370z

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.350 
brakes up here so these are 14-inch 370z
rotors<00:01:10.380> they're<00:01:11.010> 13<00:01:11.460> millimeters<00:01:11.909> thick<00:01:11.939> so

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
rotors they're 13 millimeters thick so

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.109 
rotors they're 13 millimeters thick so
they're<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.720> lot<00:01:13.020> thicker<00:01:13.200> than<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.530> original

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
they're a lot thicker than the original

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.410 
they're a lot thicker than the original
306<00:01:15.119> which<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.420> about<00:01:15.600> 30<00:01:15.890> but<00:01:16.890> these<00:01:17.100> are

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
306 which is about 30 but these are

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.480 
306 which is about 30 but these are
rainbows<00:01:18.420> from<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> Cadillac<00:01:19.200> cts-v<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.070> made<00:01:20.400> my

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
rainbows from a Cadillac cts-v I made my

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
rainbows from a Cadillac cts-v I made my
own<00:01:20.610> special<00:01:21.030> bracket<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> hundred

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
own special bracket and it's a hundred

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.670 
own special bracket and it's a hundred
percent<00:01:22.740> pad<00:01:23.070> contact<00:01:24.110> man<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:25.409> stop

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
percent pad contact man do they stop

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.580 
percent pad contact man do they stop
they<00:01:25.860> stop<00:01:25.890> well<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.869> both<00:01:28.110> all

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
they stop well so I have that both all

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.940 
they stop well so I have that both all
around<00:01:28.970> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> front<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.130> Shiro

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
around on the front I have the Shiro

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.399 
around on the front I have the Shiro
front<00:01:34.950> lip<00:01:35.070> there<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.180> repop<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.200> so

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
front lip there it's just a repop it so

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.910 
front lip there it's just a repop it so
gary<00:01:38.220> Moltres<00:01:38.670> set<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.930> he<00:01:40.140> made<00:01:40.439> before<00:01:40.650> he

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
gary Moltres set that he made before he

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
gary Moltres set that he made before he
sold<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> Z's<00:01:41.670> store<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.329> an

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
sold to the Z's store so it's an

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.929 
sold to the Z's store so it's an
original<00:01:42.630> reproduction<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> will<00:01:43.939> but

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
original reproduction if you will but

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.429 
original reproduction if you will but
let's<00:01:45.119> take<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> look<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.600> hood<00:01:45.750> not<00:01:46.229> much

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
let's take a look at the hood not much

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.389 
let's take a look at the hood not much
has<00:01:46.560> changed<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:51.950> think<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.009> last<00:01:53.159> time<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
has changed I think the last time I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.980 
has changed I think the last time I
posted<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.790> video<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.600> rebuild<00:01:54.899> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
posted a video I was just rebuild the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.179 
posted a video I was just rebuild the
motor<00:01:59.060> sorry<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.210> that

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
motor sorry for that

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.050 
motor sorry for that
so<00:02:01.929> let's<00:02:02.929> see<00:02:03.109> what's<00:02:03.289> changed<00:02:03.939> rebuilt<00:02:04.939> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
so let's see what's changed rebuilt the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.999 
so let's see what's changed rebuilt the
motor<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.600> have<00:02:05.899> a<00:02:06.020> gutted<00:02:06.200> maximum<00:02:06.740> plenum

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
motor I have a gutted maximum plenum

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.619 
motor I have a gutted maximum plenum
intake<00:02:07.100> as<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:07.490> did<00:02:07.640> last<00:02:07.819> time<00:02:07.909> but<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.209> welded

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
intake as I did last time but I welded

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.740 
intake as I did last time but I welded
the<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:10.190> in<00:02:10.580> theory<00:02:10.849> plate<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.180> top<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.599> so

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
the the in theory plate on top of it so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.890 
the the in theory plate on top of it so
doesn't<00:02:11.930> looks<00:02:12.140> better<00:02:12.849> I<00:02:13.849> can't<00:02:14.780> really

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
doesn't looks better I can't really

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.119 
doesn't looks better I can't really
think<00:02:15.019> of<00:02:15.140> anything<00:02:15.319> else<00:02:15.500> I've<00:02:15.590> added<00:02:15.739> just

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
think of anything else I've added just

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.720 
think of anything else I've added just
redid<00:02:16.730> some<00:02:16.940> lines<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.360> whatnot<00:02:18.580> added<00:02:19.580> some

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
redid some lines and whatnot added some

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.000 
redid some lines and whatnot added some
cams<00:02:20.090> as<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.299> stated<00:02:20.540> in<00:02:20.660> last<00:02:20.840> video<00:02:21.140> but<00:02:21.799> this

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
cams as I stated in last video but this

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.420 
cams as I stated in last video but this
time<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.370> dyno'd<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.290> had<00:02:24.290> 25<00:02:24.799> pounds<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.280> boost

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
time I dyno'd and had 25 pounds of boost

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.259 
time I dyno'd and had 25 pounds of boost
with<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.480> stage<00:02:26.780> 3<00:02:26.989> cams<00:02:27.260> from<00:02:27.440> Schneider

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
with the stage 3 cams from Schneider

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.880 
with the stage 3 cams from Schneider
evident<00:02:29.269> when<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.420> had<00:02:29.599> 627<00:02:30.349> little<00:02:30.530> horsepower

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
evident when I had 627 little horsepower

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.670 
evident when I had 627 little horsepower
and<00:02:31.220> about<00:02:31.940> 603<00:02:32.599> foot-pounds<00:02:33.349> of<00:02:33.410> torque<00:02:33.470> to

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
and about 603 foot-pounds of torque to

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.460 
and about 603 foot-pounds of torque to
the<00:02:33.709> wheels<00:02:33.799> so<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.940> will<00:02:35.390> post<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.720> picture<00:02:35.900> or<00:02:36.379> a

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
the wheels so I will post a picture or a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.080 
the wheels so I will post a picture or a
link<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.890> picture<00:02:37.160> of<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.910> dyno

graph for those who want to see that but

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.789 
graph for those who want to see that but
otherwise<00:02:41.420> not<00:02:42.170> else<00:02:42.470> really<00:02:42.709> has<00:02:42.890> changed

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
otherwise not else really has changed

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.710 
otherwise not else really has changed
interior<00:02:45.799> is<00:02:45.890> still<00:02:45.980> clean<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:47.510> some

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
interior is still clean I have some

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.380 
interior is still clean I have some
better<00:02:48.079> formats<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.890> were<00:02:49.489> reproduced<00:02:50.030> and

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
better formats that were reproduced and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.339 
better formats that were reproduced and
they're<00:02:51.379> the<00:02:51.560> original<00:02:52.370> style<00:02:52.730> there<00:02:52.940> so

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
they're the original style there so

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.890 
they're the original style there so
that's<00:02:54.349> really<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.769> oh<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:56.090> one<00:02:56.629> other<00:02:56.660> thing

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
that's really it oh and one other thing

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.990 
that's really it oh and one other thing
I<00:02:57.049> did<00:02:57.200> was<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.440> z32<00:02:57.950> twin<00:02:58.730> turbo

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
I did was the z32 twin turbo

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.330 
I did was the z32 twin turbo
transmission<00:02:59.980> obviously<00:03:00.980> hard<00:03:01.129> to<00:03:01.190> tell

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
transmission obviously hard to tell

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.460 
transmission obviously hard to tell
because<00:03:01.459> it's<00:03:01.640> all<00:03:01.760> installed<00:03:02.090> but<00:03:02.470> my

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
because it's all installed but my

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.580 
because it's all installed but my
factories<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.959> 31:38<00:03:05.959> transmission<00:03:06.470> was

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
factories you 31:38 transmission was

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.900 
factories you 31:38 transmission was
starting<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.859> grind<00:03:07.099> and<00:03:07.220> third<00:03:07.370> gear<00:03:07.579> so<00:03:07.880> it

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
starting to grind and third gear so it

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.240 
starting to grind and third gear so it
was<00:03:08.060> time<00:03:08.180> for<00:03:08.389> a<00:03:08.420> replacement<00:03:08.799> so<00:03:09.799> I<00:03:09.829> got<00:03:10.130> that

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
was time for a replacement so I got that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.860 
was time for a replacement so I got that
in<00:03:10.400> there<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:10.730> lengthen<00:03:11.329> the<00:03:11.420> drive<00:03:11.599> shaft

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
in there and lengthen the drive shaft

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.629 
in there and lengthen the drive shaft
had<00:03:12.109> a<00:03:12.139> short<00:03:12.410> shifter<00:03:12.709> installed<00:03:12.829> and<00:03:13.280> hey<00:03:13.519> it

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
had a short shifter installed and hey it

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.240 
had a short shifter installed and hey it
works<00:03:13.790> great<00:03:14.030> still<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:15.470> anyways<00:03:15.739> that's

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
works great still so anyways that's
