00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
guess maybe he might be dying or

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.170 
guess maybe he might be dying or
something<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.530> he<00:01:04.589> wants<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> best

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
something and he wants to make the best

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
this one is a pretty good one because it

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.740 
this one is a pretty good one because it
has<00:06:31.350> 300<00:06:32.040> attack<00:06:32.310> and<00:06:33.060> I<00:06:33.360> don't<00:06:33.510> know<00:06:33.600> if<00:06:33.690> you

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
can see it in the background but that is

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.730 
can see it in the background but that is
Jews<00:06:35.670> adventista<00:06:36.480> he<00:06:36.840> didn't<00:06:37.080> bring<00:06:37.260> out<00:06:37.470> and

his<00:06:38.400> legs<00:06:38.700> are<00:06:38.850> I<00:06:38.910> guess<00:06:39.060> his<00:06:39.600> legs<00:06:39.870> might<00:06:40.140> need

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
his legs are I guess his legs might need

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.730 
his legs are I guess his legs might need
the<00:06:40.500> things<00:06:41.460> for<00:06:41.670> the<00:06:41.790> gun<00:06:42.290> so<00:06:43.290> it's<00:06:43.530> called

would<00:06:50.280> highly<00:06:50.400> suggest<00:06:50.870> m/m<00:06:51.870> camp<00:06:52.620> and<00:06:52.890> camo

would highly suggest m/m camp and camo

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.970 
would highly suggest m/m camp and camo
to<00:06:53.670> get<00:06:53.820> first<00:06:54.090> because<00:06:54.510> n<00:06:54.720> in<00:06:55.200> size<00:06:55.440> or<00:06:55.650> course

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:55.980 
to get first because n in size or course

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.960 
to get first because n in size or course
because<00:06:56.160> they'd<00:06:56.310> probably<00:06:56.580> be<00:06:56.760> the<00:06:56.850> most

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
because they'd probably be the most

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.230 
because they'd probably be the most
weird<00:06:57.270> ones<00:06:57.570> to<00:06:57.750> find<00:06:57.990> so<00:06:58.770> overall<00:06:59.490> I<00:06:59.790> like

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
weird ones to find so overall I like
