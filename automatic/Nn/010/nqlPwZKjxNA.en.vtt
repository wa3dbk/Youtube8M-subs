 more its power but until the year 1994 with 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.900
 the launch of 2000 with 4 with the

 super nintendo this exceptional game 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.590
 he was the first to use pre graphics 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.270
 rendered in 3-d generating a game 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.190
 best visually accomplished of the time 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.570
 that added to the excellent control and 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.430
 soundtrack makes it a 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.500
 true classic that I do not hesitate to play every 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.750
 Once strong in the game we control 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.280
 donkey kong and diddy we will pick up bananas 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.170
 and other items that will help us in the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.790
 game we will be eliminating the noise with 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.020
 help of wooden barrels also 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.280
 we count as above metallic that 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.450
 we can bounce on the wall 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.239
 we find about why the fuck 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.540
 ok ok ok lieutenant ranking game 15 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.540

 Donkey Kong is riding another donkey 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.540

 first scene we should get to 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.680
 where is ramp 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.080
 then we go back and leave it 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 around here we climb the palm trees and 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.680
 we want where the bananas indicate for 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.720
 get the metal barrel now comes 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.670
 how difficult we have to ride in 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.830
 education of bouncing against the wall 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.479

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.679

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.950
 jump or the attack the error 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.899
 will disappear 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.250
 it also works with diaz and depending 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.479
 of the accuracy with which we do it 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.409
 we will have the normal character or banana 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.610
