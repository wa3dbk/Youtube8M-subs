sure if you can download apps from the
App<00:01:19.020> Store<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.700> very<00:01:20.700> much<00:01:20.759> doubt<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.420> but<00:01:21.770> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
App Store I very much doubt it but it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.469 
App Store I very much doubt it but it
also<00:01:22.920> has<00:01:23.130> an<00:01:23.280> FM<00:01:23.549> radio<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.299> see

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
there so that's a complete redesign a

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.719 
there so that's a complete redesign a
little<00:01:27.750> bit<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.409> an<00:01:28.590> ipod<00:01:28.920> touch<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
little bit more like an ipod touch but a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.420

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.790 
effectively an iphone 4 but without the
phone<00:04:09.030> capability

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
phone capability

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.940 
phone capability
and<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.340> networking<00:04:10.730> stuff<00:04:11.210> it<00:04:11.960> has<00:04:12.140> facetime

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
and the networking stuff it has facetime

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.710 
and the networking stuff it has facetime
so<00:04:13.340> now<00:04:13.610> you'll<00:04:13.790> be<00:04:13.820> able<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.180> presumably

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
so now you'll be able to presumably

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.900 
so now you'll be able to presumably
facetime<00:04:15.470> between<00:04:15.800> iphone<00:04:16.130> for<00:04:16.370> ipod<00:04:16.730> touch

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
facetime between iphone for ipod touch

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.380 
facetime between iphone for ipod touch
users<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:19.070> they're<00:04:19.610> building<00:04:19.970> up<00:04:20.060> a<00:04:20.180> network

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
users so they're building up a network

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.030 
users so they're building up a network
where<00:04:20.600> people<00:04:21.290> will<00:04:21.380> be<00:04:21.500> able<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:21.920> know

John<00:04:25.460> think<00:04:25.940> is<00:04:26.060> going<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.270> be<00:04:26.390> amazing<00:04:26.660> when

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
John think is going to be amazing when

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.980 
John think is going to be amazing when
when<00:04:27.740> people<00:04:28.070> start<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.460> use<00:04:28.610> this<00:04:28.990> massively

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
when people start to use this massively

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.050 
when people start to use this massively
because<00:04:30.470> at<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.650> moment<00:04:30.680> that<00:04:31.490> everybody<00:04:31.880> has

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
because at the moment that everybody has

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.830 
because at the moment that everybody has
an<00:04:32.180> iphone<00:04:32.510> 4<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:34.760> know<00:04:34.910> facetime<00:04:35.540> isn't

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
an iphone 4 and you know facetime isn't

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.380 
an iphone 4 and you know facetime isn't
something<00:04:36.170> that<00:04:36.200> i<00:04:36.410> use<00:04:36.710> regularly<00:04:37.390> so

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
something that i use regularly so

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.910 
something that i use regularly so
hopefully<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.990> will<00:04:39.080> change<00:04:39.140> when<00:04:39.560> people

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
hopefully that will change when people

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.420 
hopefully that will change when people
start<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.280> get<00:04:40.460> I've<00:04:40.580> ipod<00:04:41.300> touches<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:43.250> does

to<00:05:13.040> ninety<00:05:13.580> nine<00:05:13.760> dollars<00:05:14.180> which<00:05:14.360> i<00:05:14.510> think<00:05:14.570> is

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
to ninety nine dollars which i think is

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.470 
to ninety nine dollars which i think is
amazing<00:05:15.230> it<00:05:15.380> used<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.710> be<00:05:15.890> around<00:05:16.490> 250<00:05:17.450> i

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
amazing it used to be around 250 i

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.570 
amazing it used to be around 250 i
believe<00:05:18.040> and<00:05:19.210> it's<00:05:20.210> a<00:05:20.330> lot<00:05:20.540> smaller<00:05:20.720> and

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
believe and it's a lot smaller and

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.180 
believe and it's a lot smaller and
basically<00:05:22.580> it<00:05:22.940> doesn't<00:05:23.240> have<00:05:23.330> a<00:05:23.390> hard<00:05:23.630> drive

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
basically it doesn't have a hard drive

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.400 
basically it doesn't have a hard drive

you to you know just a little like a
social<00:06:19.100> networking

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880

iTunes Store and you can say like it's a
bit<00:06:24.350> like<00:06:24.700> Facebook<00:06:25.700> similar<00:06:26.240> to<00:06:26.390> Facebook

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
bit like Facebook similar to Facebook

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.690 
bit like Facebook similar to Facebook
rather<00:06:27.050> than<00:06:27.230> light<00:06:27.440> not<00:06:27.920> really<00:06:28.250> exactly<00:06:28.460> the

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
rather than light not really exactly the

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.960 
rather than light not really exactly the
same<00:06:29.200> I'm<00:06:30.200> not<00:06:30.410> too<00:06:30.620> confident<00:06:31.490> on<00:06:31.670> how<00:06:31.820> it

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
same I'm not too confident on how it

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.290 
same I'm not too confident on how it
works<00:06:32.210> just<00:06:32.420> yet<00:06:32.900> but<00:06:33.140> when<00:06:33.650> more<00:06:34.400> artists<00:06:35.030> and

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
works just yet but when more artists and

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.870 
works just yet but when more artists and
you<00:06:35.420> know<00:06:35.570> friends<00:06:35.870> start<00:06:36.590> to<00:06:36.770> use<00:06:37.340> ping<00:06:37.640> then

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
you know friends start to use ping then

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.880 
you know friends start to use ping then
hopefully<00:06:38.270> you'll<00:06:38.990> get<00:06:39.140> it<00:06:39.290> just<00:06:39.470> a<00:06:39.560> bit<00:06:39.590> more

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
hopefully you'll get it just a bit more

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.800 
hopefully you'll get it just a bit more
