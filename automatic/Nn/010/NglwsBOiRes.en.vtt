00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
Christopher Nolan when memento Kim I

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.280 
Christopher Nolan when memento Kim I
read<00:05:57.610> him<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:58.060> then<00:05:58.240> seeing<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.810> film<00:05:59.080> and

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
read him and then seeing the film and

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.940 
read him and then seeing the film and
thought<00:05:59.500> well<00:05:59.770> this<00:06:00.300> this<00:06:01.300> director<00:06:01.900> you<00:06:02.800> know

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
thought well this this director you know

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.360 
thought well this this director you know
every<00:06:03.670> studio<00:06:04.200> should<00:06:05.200> be<00:06:05.440> after<00:06:05.620> this<00:06:05.950> man<00:06:06.190> I

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
every studio should be after this man I

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.980 
every studio should be after this man I
was<00:06:06.520> indeed<00:06:06.760> they<00:06:06.940> wear<00:06:07.150> you<00:06:07.480> know<00:06:07.510> because

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
was indeed they wear you know because

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.140 
was indeed they wear you know because
they<00:06:08.110> were<00:06:08.140> still<00:06:08.470> knocked<00:06:08.710> out<00:06:08.950> by<00:06:09.160> this<00:06:09.220> very

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
they were still knocked out by this very

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.600 
they were still knocked out by this very
very<00:06:10.330> clever<00:06:10.600> film<00:06:12.870> and<00:06:13.870> I<00:06:14.470> think<00:06:15.100> there<00:06:15.460> is<00:06:15.580> a

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
very clever film and I think there is a

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.930 
very clever film and I think there is a
sense<00:06:16.150> to<00:06:16.510> the<00:06:17.140> studio's<00:06:17.590> want<00:06:17.860> to<00:06:18.070> they<00:06:18.910> want

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
sense to the studio's want to they want

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.090 
sense to the studio's want to they want
to<00:06:19.210> recreate<00:06:19.690> or<00:06:20.050> want<00:06:20.230> to<00:06:20.290> get<00:06:20.410> back<00:06:20.620> to<00:06:20.890> when

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
to recreate or want to get back to when

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.160 
to recreate or want to get back to when
those<00:06:21.790> great<00:06:22.150> films<00:06:22.510> that<00:06:22.630> were<00:06:22.750> made<00:06:22.930> in<00:06:22.960> that

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:23.170 
those great films that were made in that

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.350 
those great films that were made in that
like<00:06:23.350> say<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.680> 1970s<00:06:24.580> you<00:06:24.790> know<00:06:24.910> that<00:06:25.150> was<00:06:25.240> the

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
like say the 1970s you know that was the

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.340 
like say the 1970s you know that was the
golden<00:06:25.810> era<00:06:26.500> I<00:06:26.770> feel<00:06:28.950> and<00:06:29.970> I<00:06:30.970> do<00:06:31.120> sense<00:06:32.110> they

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
golden era I feel and I do sense they

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:38.460 
golden era I feel and I do sense they
want<00:06:32.560> to<00:06:34.170> experiment<00:06:35.170> with<00:06:35.440> talent<00:06:36.070> that<00:06:37.470> is

as rich as now as those bunch of

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.460 
as rich as now as those bunch of
directors<00:06:43.210> that<00:06:43.300> came<00:06:43.510> up<00:06:43.630> in<00:06:43.780> the<00:06:43.840> 70s<00:06:44.350> you
