marks but basically if you can do like a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.200 
marks but basically if you can do like a
circle<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.290> dot<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.490> infinite

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
circle and a dot you can do infinite

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.780 
circle and a dot you can do infinite
possibilities<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.520> really

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
possibilities and it's really really

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.090 
possibilities and it's really really
easy<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> other<00:01:19.560> things<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> note

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
easy so one of the other things to note

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.030 
easy so one of the other things to note
about<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.759> coloring<00:01:21.330> brush<00:01:21.810> pens<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.710> that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
about the coloring brush pens is that

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.999 
about the coloring brush pens is that
they're<00:01:23.400> transparent<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:24.930> translucent<00:01:25.009> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
they're transparent or translucent and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.539 
they're transparent or translucent and
you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:27.030> blend<00:01:27.869> them<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.130> you'll<00:01:29.280> see

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
you can blend them and so you'll see

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.649 
you can blend them and so you'll see
that<00:01:29.700> they're<00:01:29.820> different<00:01:30.030> colors<00:01:30.329> are

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that they're different colors are

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.260 
that they're different colors are
created<00:01:31.259> when<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.890> overlap<00:01:32.700> them<00:01:32.970> which<00:01:33.150> i

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
created when you overlap them which i

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.730 
created when you overlap them which i
think<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:33.689> great<00:01:33.960> except<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
think is really great except that the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.830 
think is really great except that the
nibs<00:01:35.040> don't<00:01:35.490> actually<00:01:36.000> pick<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.240> anything

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
nibs don't actually pick up anything

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.179 
nibs don't actually pick up anything
from<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> previous<00:01:37.560> marker<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.040> they

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
from the previous marker because they

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.859 
from the previous marker because they
dry<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.640> fast<00:01:38.670> which<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.720> even

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
dry so fast which I really like so even

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
dry so fast which I really like so even
though<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.259> created<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:40.950> dark<00:01:41.400> color

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
though we created a really dark color

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.490 
though we created a really dark color
across<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.450> center<00:01:42.780> which<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.290> see

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
across the center which you can see

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.609 
across the center which you can see
right<00:01:43.530> there<00:01:44.360> I'm<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:45.689> getting<00:01:46.110> any<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
right there I'm not getting any of that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.649 
right there I'm not getting any of that
coloration<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.340> nib<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.090> awesome

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
coloration on my nib which is awesome

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.050 
coloration on my nib which is awesome
okay<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> little<00:01:50.250> 3<00:01:50.399> by<00:01:50.549> 4<00:01:50.759> piece<00:01:50.939> of

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
okay so I have a little 3 by 4 piece of

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.130 
okay so I have a little 3 by 4 piece of
paper<00:01:51.240> we're<00:01:51.390> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.570> create<00:01:51.750> our<00:01:51.840> first

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
paper we're going to create our first

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.719 
paper we're going to create our first
card<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:52.710> gonna<00:01:52.829> use<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.040> side<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
card and I'm gonna use a side of the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.209 
card and I'm gonna use a side of the
brush<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.540> create<00:01:54.659> some<00:01:55.110> dash<00:01:55.500> lines<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.100> what

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
brush to create some dash lines and what

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.590 
brush to create some dash lines and what
I've<00:01:56.310> done<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.610> I've<00:01:56.729> actually<00:01:56.880> grabbed<00:01:57.299> all

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
I've done is I've actually grabbed all

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.920 
I've done is I've actually grabbed all
the<00:01:57.899> blue<00:01:58.290> pens<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.640> using<00:02:00.600> all

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the blue pens that I have and using all

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.090 
the blue pens that I have and using all
the<00:02:01.140> different<00:02:01.229> blue<00:02:01.530> pens<00:02:01.740> I'm<00:02:01.920> just

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the different blue pens I'm just

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.789 
the different blue pens I'm just
alternating<00:02:02.750> different<00:02:03.750> dashes<00:02:04.259> some<00:02:04.619> are

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
alternating different dashes some are

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.010 
alternating different dashes some are
you<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.399> different<00:02:05.969> sizes<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.810> very

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
you know different sizes it's not very

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.389 
you know different sizes it's not very
hard<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.649> see<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> finished<00:02:08.190> card

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
hard but you can see the finished card

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.249 
hard but you can see the finished card
is<00:02:08.520> very<00:02:08.729> different<00:02:09.119> from<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.629> card<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.140> we

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
is very different from the card that we

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.809 
is very different from the card that we
have<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.739> I'm<00:02:10.920> gonna<00:02:11.009> take<00:02:11.280> advantage<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
have so I'm gonna take advantage of the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.850 
have so I'm gonna take advantage of the
transparency<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.780> these<00:02:13.319> coloring

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
transparency of these coloring

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.890 
transparency of these coloring
brush<00:02:14.010> pens<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.640> I'm<00:02:15.150> gonna<00:02:15.270> start<00:02:15.540> layering

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
brush pens and I'm gonna start layering

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.810 
brush pens and I'm gonna start layering
so<00:02:16.440> I'm<00:02:16.560> gonna<00:02:16.680> draw<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.430> thick<00:02:17.610> line

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
so I'm gonna draw just a thick line

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.940 
so I'm gonna draw just a thick line
across<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.120> again<00:02:18.510> I'm<00:02:18.690> using<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.140> side<00:02:19.500> of

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
across it again I'm using the side of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.250 
across it again I'm using the side of
the<00:02:20.280> brush<00:02:20.610> nib<00:02:20.940> for<00:02:21.360> all<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.050> create

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
the brush nib for all of this to create

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.310 
the brush nib for all of this to create
that<00:02:22.380> really<00:02:22.710> fat<00:02:23.160> bold<00:02:23.670> line<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:25.050> fat

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
that really fat bold line and that fat

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.200 
that really fat bold line and that fat
bold<00:02:25.530> line<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.830> also<00:02:26.040> great<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.700> side<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.090> it

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
bold line is also great the side of it

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.150 
bold line is also great the side of it
cuz<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.600> color<00:02:27.930> things<00:02:28.290> up<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.710> quickly

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
cuz you can color things up so quickly

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.340 
cuz you can color things up so quickly
so<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.430> just<00:02:29.640> can<00:02:29.760> put<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.060> yellow<00:02:30.450> right<00:02:30.900> over

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
so I just can put that yellow right over

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.080 
so I just can put that yellow right over
the<00:02:31.470> top<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.710> those<00:02:31.950> colors<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:32.910> get

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
the top of those colors and I can get

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.400 
the top of those colors and I can get
some<00:02:33.330> mixing<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.990> look<00:02:34.200> at<00:02:34.320> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
some mixing and if you look at the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.230 
some mixing and if you look at the
finished<00:02:34.770> you'll<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.880> instance<00:02:35.940> that

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
finished you'll see for instance that

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.330 
finished you'll see for instance that
blue<00:02:36.480> +<00:02:36.690> yellow<00:02:36.720> eagles<00:02:37.230> green<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:37.890> that's<00:02:38.040> how

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
blue + yellow eagles green so that's how

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.090 
blue + yellow eagles green so that's how
my<00:02:38.610> color<00:02:39.540> seemed<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.050> fade<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.709> just<00:02:40.890> sort<00:02:41.040> of

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
my color seemed to fade and just sort of

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.460 
my color seemed to fade and just sort of
green<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.790> blue<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:42.300> just<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:42.959> quick

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
green to blue it's just a really quick

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.710 
green to blue it's just a really quick
and<00:02:43.620> easy<00:02:43.920> way<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.910> make<00:02:45.180> something<00:02:45.480> really

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
and easy way to make something really

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.230 
and easy way to make something really
fast<00:02:46.410> ok<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.490> we're<00:02:47.580> gonna<00:02:47.640> get<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:47.880> little<00:02:48.000> more

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
fast ok so we're gonna get a little more

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.180 
fast ok so we're gonna get a little more
complicated<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:49.080> time<00:02:49.440> I'm<00:02:49.800> gonna<00:02:49.890> take<00:02:50.160> a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
complicated this time I'm gonna take a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.340 
complicated this time I'm gonna take a
sort<00:02:50.490> of<00:02:50.550> olive<00:02:51.030> green<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.420> I'm<00:02:51.810> gonna<00:02:51.930> draw

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
sort of olive green and I'm gonna draw

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.979 
sort of olive green and I'm gonna draw
some<00:02:52.920> angled<00:02:53.489> lines<00:02:53.700> again<00:02:54.090> using<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.570> side

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
some angled lines again using the side

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.360 
some angled lines again using the side
of<00:02:55.560> my<00:02:56.310> brush<00:02:57.030> tip<00:02:57.390> there<00:02:57.720> are<00:02:58.590> these<00:02:58.860> perfect

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
of my brush tip there are these perfect

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.610 
of my brush tip there are these perfect
lines<00:02:59.580> no<00:03:00.209> are<00:03:00.480> they<00:03:00.630> even<00:03:00.930> perfectly

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
lines no are they even perfectly

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.070 
lines no are they even perfectly
diagonal<00:03:02.459> no<00:03:02.850> but<00:03:03.120> that's<00:03:03.300> part<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.630> wonky

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
diagonal no but that's part of the wonky

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.050 
diagonal no but that's part of the wonky
fun<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:04.709> I'm<00:03:04.800> gonna<00:03:04.920> have<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.190> series<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
fun so I'm gonna have a series going the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.370 
fun so I'm gonna have a series going the
opposite<00:03:06.480> direction<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:07.020> see<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.290> this

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
opposite direction you can see that this

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.530 
opposite direction you can see that this
is<00:03:07.500> gonna<00:03:07.620> create<00:03:07.890> diamonds<00:03:08.280> now<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.150> want<00:03:09.480> to

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
is gonna create diamonds now I want to

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.720 
is gonna create diamonds now I want to
connect<00:03:09.959> everywhere<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.620> overlaps<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.430> divide

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
connect everywhere it overlaps to divide

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.660 
connect everywhere it overlaps to divide
the<00:03:11.940> diamonds<00:03:12.450> into<00:03:12.630> triangles<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:14.520> is

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
the diamonds into triangles this is

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.100 
the diamonds into triangles this is
really<00:03:14.940> cool<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.239> they're<00:03:15.360> kind<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.660> wonky<00:03:15.810> so

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
really cool and they're kind of wonky so

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.540 
really cool and they're kind of wonky so
you<00:03:16.170> may<00:03:16.320> have<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.530> make<00:03:16.650> some<00:03:16.860> adjustments<00:03:17.489> in

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
you may have to make some adjustments in

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.100 
you may have to make some adjustments in
the<00:03:17.670> line<00:03:17.850> it's<00:03:18.060> not<00:03:18.120> gonna<00:03:18.420> be<00:03:18.600> straight<00:03:18.900> to

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
the line it's not gonna be straight to

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.479 
the line it's not gonna be straight to
make<00:03:19.230> sure<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.560> they<00:03:19.709> all<00:03:19.860> match<00:03:20.070> up<00:03:20.100> and

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
make sure that they all match up and

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.280 
make sure that they all match up and
then<00:03:20.730> I'm<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.390> color<00:03:21.600> all<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.110> ones

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
then I'm going to color all the ones

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.500 
then I'm going to color all the ones
that<00:03:22.380> point<00:03:22.680> down<00:03:22.830> pink<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.459> all<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.299> ones

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that point down pink and all the ones

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.130 
that point down pink and all the ones
that<00:03:24.600> point<00:03:24.930> up<00:03:25.110> blue<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.810> other<00:03:27.930> thing

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
that point up blue and the other thing

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
that point up blue and the other thing
to<00:03:28.260> note<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:28.560> because<00:03:28.830> these<00:03:28.950> are

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
to note is just because these are

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.070 
to note is just because these are
transparent<00:03:29.820> try<00:03:30.000> not<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.330> overlap<00:03:30.690> too<00:03:30.900> much

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
transparent try not to overlap too much

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.620 
transparent try not to overlap too much
or<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.410> will<00:03:31.790> get<00:03:32.790> some<00:03:32.940> other<00:03:33.060> extra<00:03:33.450> color

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
or you will get some other extra color

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.259 
or you will get some other extra color
so<00:03:33.840> she<00:03:33.870> may<00:03:34.019> be<00:03:34.080> fun<00:03:34.350> now<00:03:34.530> again<00:03:34.769> fat<00:03:35.190> thin

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
so she may be fun now again fat thin

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.770 
so she may be fun now again fat thin
okay<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:36.930> side<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.650> nib<00:03:37.980> or<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:39.030> tip<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.660> it

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
okay so side of the nib or the tip of it

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.050 
okay so side of the nib or the tip of it
so<00:03:39.959> I'm<00:03:40.110> gonna<00:03:40.260> go<00:03:40.530> ahead<00:03:40.860> now<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.430> I'm<00:03:41.910> gonna

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
so I'm gonna go ahead now and I'm gonna

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.960 
so I'm gonna go ahead now and I'm gonna
do<00:03:42.269> some<00:03:42.480> dash<00:03:42.900> lines<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.890> I'm<00:03:44.220> using<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.640> tip

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
do some dash lines and I'm using the tip

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.090 
do some dash lines and I'm using the tip
of<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.750> is<00:03:45.989> going<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.320> give<00:03:46.590> me<00:03:46.799> that

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
of it and this is going to give me that

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.860 
of it and this is going to give me that
cute<00:03:47.459> little<00:03:47.549> stitch<00:03:47.910> look<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.360> I<00:03:48.570> think<00:03:48.600> a

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
cute little stitch look and I think a

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.330 
cute little stitch look and I think a
lot<00:03:48.989> of<00:03:49.019> times<00:03:49.260> with<00:03:49.410> doodling<00:03:49.739> it's<00:03:49.950> the

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
lot of times with doodling it's the

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.280 
lot of times with doodling it's the
details<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:51.090> makes<00:03:51.239> such<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.480> big<00:03:51.690> difference

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
details that makes such a big difference

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.509 
details that makes such a big difference
because<00:03:52.470> when<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.830> look<00:03:53.010> at<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.190> finished

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
because when you look at the finished

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.430 
because when you look at the finished
card<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:54.480> looks<00:03:54.510> very<00:03:54.870> detailed<00:03:55.170> but<00:03:55.350> you

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
card it looks very detailed but you

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.699 
card it looks very detailed but you
could<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.860> how<00:03:56.280> easy<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.910> was<00:03:57.330> to<00:03:57.690> build<00:03:58.110> so

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
could see how easy it was to build so

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.820 
could see how easy it was to build so
pretty<00:03:59.190> awesome<00:03:59.610> pretty<00:04:00.120> easy<00:04:00.360> so<00:04:01.350> next<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:01.799> a

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
pretty awesome pretty easy so next is a

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.680 
pretty awesome pretty easy so next is a
sort<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.130> Southwest<00:04:02.790> theme<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.330> I'm<00:04:03.420> creating

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
sort of Southwest theme so I'm creating

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.920 
sort of Southwest theme so I'm creating
a<00:04:04.140> zigzag<00:04:04.769> shape<00:04:05.070> using<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.489> side<00:04:06.000> of<00:04:06.570> that

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
a zigzag shape using the side of that

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.150 
a zigzag shape using the side of that
brush<00:04:07.470> nib<00:04:07.860> and<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:10.410> reason<00:04:10.769> for<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.950> side

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
brush nib and the reason for the side

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
brush nib and the reason for the side
again<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.579> just<00:04:11.610> because<00:04:11.850> they<00:04:11.940> want<00:04:12.120> that

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
again is just because they want that

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.699 
again is just because they want that
fatter<00:04:12.480> line<00:04:12.750> if<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:12.989> end<00:04:13.140> up<00:04:13.170> using<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.530> tip

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
fatter line if you end up using the tip

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.860 
fatter line if you end up using the tip
nobody<00:04:14.160> cares<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.640> hard<00:04:14.910> part<00:04:15.269> here<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.750> it's

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
nobody cares the hard part here and it's

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.300 
nobody cares the hard part here and it's
not<00:04:15.930> really<00:04:16.260> hard<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.680> that<00:04:16.890> you're<00:04:17.100> actually

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
not really hard is that you're actually

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.370 
not really hard is that you're actually
gonna<00:04:17.519> do<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.850> opposite<00:04:18.540> of<00:04:18.690> what<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.079> see<00:04:19.260> to

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
gonna do the opposite of what you see to

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.500 
gonna do the opposite of what you see to
create<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.650> kind<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.919> diamond<00:04:20.489> shape<00:04:20.760> instead

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
create a kind of diamond shape instead

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.230 
create a kind of diamond shape instead
of<00:04:21.750> doing<00:04:22.740> an<00:04:22.860> echo<00:04:23.250> which<00:04:23.640> would<00:04:23.820> be<00:04:23.940> like<00:04:24.090> if

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
of doing an echo which would be like if

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.410 
of doing an echo which would be like if
the<00:04:24.330> whole<00:04:24.570> thing<00:04:24.599> was<00:04:25.020> exacerbated<00:04:26.120> as<00:04:27.120> not

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
the whole thing was exacerbated as not

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.380 
the whole thing was exacerbated as not
this<00:04:27.840> idea<00:04:28.200> of<00:04:28.290> creating<00:04:28.710> these<00:04:29.190> diamonds<00:04:29.640> so

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
this idea of creating these diamonds so

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.290 
this idea of creating these diamonds so
now<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.600> second<00:04:31.260> color<00:04:31.470> is<00:04:31.860> gonna<00:04:32.400> go<00:04:32.610> on<00:04:32.880> one

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
now the second color is gonna go on one

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.420 
now the second color is gonna go on one
side<00:04:33.660> which<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.500> can<00:04:34.650> see<00:04:34.860> there<00:04:35.070> pretty

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
side which you can see there pretty

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.180 
side which you can see there pretty
easily<00:04:35.700> right<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.540> then<00:04:37.170> if<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.890> went<00:04:38.040> on<00:04:38.130> the

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
easily right and then if it went on the

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.190 
easily right and then if it went on the
outside<00:04:38.760> of<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.060> line<00:04:39.180> there<00:04:39.510> it's<00:04:39.810> gonna<00:04:39.990> go

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
outside of the line there it's gonna go

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.990 
outside of the line there it's gonna go
on<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.380> outside<00:04:40.920> of<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.190> next<00:04:41.460> one<00:04:41.640> but<00:04:41.850> then

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
on the outside of the next one but then

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.460 
on the outside of the next one but then
it's<00:04:42.120> on<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.330> inside<00:04:42.570> of<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.050> orange<00:04:43.320> line

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
it's on the inside of the orange line

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.140 
it's on the inside of the orange line
according<00:04:43.890> to<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.070> orange<00:04:44.310> line<00:04:44.460> below<00:04:44.760> it<00:04:44.790> so

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
according to the orange line below it so

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.940 
according to the orange line below it so
it's<00:04:45.300> gonna<00:04:45.390> go<00:04:45.600> on<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.750> inside<00:04:46.320> of<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.530> was

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
it's gonna go on the inside of that was

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.950 
it's gonna go on the inside of that was
that<00:04:47.100> confusing<00:04:47.640> but<00:04:48.120> basically<00:04:48.180> I'm<00:04:48.750> just

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
that confusing but basically I'm just

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.510 
that confusing but basically I'm just
trying<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.140> create<00:04:49.290> these<00:04:49.560> diamond<00:04:50.190> shapes

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
trying to create these diamond shapes

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.750 
trying to create these diamond shapes
over<00:04:51.180> and<00:04:51.420> over<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:51.900> over<00:04:52.320> again<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:53.430> if<00:04:53.670> you

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
over and over and over again and if you

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.610 
over and over and over again and if you
focus<00:04:54.150> on<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.540> I<00:04:54.570> think<00:04:55.050> it'll<00:04:55.170> make<00:04:55.380> sense

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
focus on that I think it'll make sense

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.650 
focus on that I think it'll make sense
and<00:04:55.950> what<00:04:56.130> I'm<00:04:56.220> gonna<00:04:56.370> do<00:04:56.700> is<00:04:56.940> just<00:04:56.970> continue

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
and what I'm gonna do is just continue

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.420 
and what I'm gonna do is just continue
to<00:04:57.690> layer<00:04:57.990> color<00:04:58.440> after<00:04:58.830> color<00:04:59.070> sort<00:04:59.340> of

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
to layer color after color sort of

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.070 
to layer color after color sort of
randomly<00:05:00.200> going<00:05:01.200> through<00:05:01.590> my<00:05:02.100> box<00:05:02.760> of<00:05:03.080> markers

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
randomly going through my box of markers

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.900 
randomly going through my box of markers
just<00:05:04.380> picking<00:05:04.680> colors<00:05:04.980> that<00:05:05.220> I<00:05:05.250> think<00:05:05.580> are<00:05:05.670> fun

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
just picking colors that I think are fun

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.050 
just picking colors that I think are fun
and<00:05:06.180> look<00:05:06.330> good<00:05:06.420> together<00:05:06.600> and<00:05:07.260> you<00:05:08.250> know<00:05:08.370> make

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
and look good together and you know make

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.490 
and look good together and you know make
me<00:05:09.210> happy<00:05:09.600> because<00:05:09.780> I<00:05:09.840> think<00:05:09.960> one<00:05:10.320> of<00:05:10.350> the

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
me happy because I think one of the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.620 
me happy because I think one of the
greatest<00:05:10.920> things<00:05:11.130> about<00:05:11.280> color<00:05:11.790> is<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:12.420> it

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
greatest things about color is that it

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.150 
greatest things about color is that it
makes<00:05:12.750> you<00:05:12.870> happy<00:05:13.200> and<00:05:13.470> doodling<00:05:14.010> is

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
makes you happy and doodling is

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.460 
makes you happy and doodling is
certainly<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.490> relaxing<00:05:15.240> way<00:05:15.360> to<00:05:15.420> engage<00:05:15.810> with

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
certainly a relaxing way to engage with

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.340 
certainly a relaxing way to engage with
color<00:05:16.860> so<00:05:17.160> now<00:05:17.700> the<00:05:18.030> finished<00:05:18.360> one<00:05:18.570> and<00:05:18.870> the

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
color so now the finished one and the

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.170 
color so now the finished one and the
process<00:05:19.830> one<00:05:20.040> you<00:05:20.160> can<00:05:20.310> see<00:05:20.490> again<00:05:20.820> it's<00:05:21.060> the

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
process one you can see again it's the

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.880 
process one you can see again it's the
little<00:05:21.510> tiny<00:05:21.750> details<00:05:22.140> that<00:05:22.260> make<00:05:22.380> a<00:05:22.410> big<00:05:22.620> big

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
little tiny details that make a big big

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.050 
little tiny details that make a big big
difference<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:23.370> this<00:05:23.550> time<00:05:23.760> we're<00:05:23.940> actually

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
difference so this time we're actually

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.640 
difference so this time we're actually
gonna<00:05:24.270> go<00:05:24.450> for<00:05:24.480> a<00:05:24.660> brown<00:05:24.930> marker<00:05:25.230> and<00:05:25.530> I<00:05:25.590> know

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
gonna go for a brown marker and I know

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.530 
gonna go for a brown marker and I know
Brown<00:05:26.040> is<00:05:26.280> not<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.580> color<00:05:26.910> that<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.210> lot<00:05:27.420> of

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
Brown is not a color that a lot of

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.270 
Brown is not a color that a lot of
detail<00:05:27.870> people<00:05:28.080> or<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.470> lot<00:05:28.680> of<00:05:28.770> color<00:05:29.010> people

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
detail people or a lot of color people

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.490 
detail people or a lot of color people
use<00:05:29.520> a<00:05:29.550> lot<00:05:29.790> but<00:05:30.330> it<00:05:30.420> really<00:05:30.600> does<00:05:30.870> set<00:05:31.260> off

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
use a lot but it really does set off

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.320 
use a lot but it really does set off
these<00:05:31.680> bright<00:05:31.920> colors<00:05:31.950> nicely<00:05:32.700> so<00:05:32.880> I'm<00:05:32.970> really

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
these bright colors nicely so I'm really

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.090 
these bright colors nicely so I'm really
adding<00:05:33.690> some<00:05:33.840> simple<00:05:34.140> details<00:05:34.440> again<00:05:34.710> using<00:05:35.010> a

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
adding some simple details again using a

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.900 
adding some simple details again using a
very<00:05:35.370> tip<00:05:35.700> so<00:05:36.240> like<00:05:36.540> the<00:05:36.660> little<00:05:36.870> X<00:05:37.080> or<00:05:37.290> cross

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
very tip so like the little X or cross

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.250 
very tip so like the little X or cross
right<00:05:38.910> in<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.210> center<00:05:39.540> adding<00:05:39.840> some<00:05:39.990> dash

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
right in the center adding some dash

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.840 
right in the center adding some dash
lines<00:05:40.290> just<00:05:40.770> like<00:05:40.860> we<00:05:41.040> did<00:05:41.190> on<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.310> triangle

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
lines just like we did on the triangle

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.790 
lines just like we did on the triangle
card<00:05:42.120> outlining<00:05:42.780> some<00:05:43.110> things<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.470> define

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
card outlining some things to define

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.950 
card outlining some things to define
them<00:05:44.040> adding<00:05:44.400> little<00:05:44.880> almost<00:05:45.300> stitch<00:05:45.600> marks

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
them adding little almost stitch marks

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.210 
them adding little almost stitch marks
which<00:05:46.110> gives<00:05:46.350> it<00:05:46.470> that<00:05:46.500> real<00:05:46.890> sort<00:05:47.160> of

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
which gives it that real sort of

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.730 
which gives it that real sort of
Southwest<00:05:47.970> blanket<00:05:48.660> feeling<00:05:49.080> which<00:05:49.290> I<00:05:49.440> really

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
Southwest blanket feeling which I really

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.800 
Southwest blanket feeling which I really
really<00:05:49.770> like<00:05:50.010> so<00:05:50.940> there<00:05:51.090> you<00:05:51.180> can<00:05:51.240> see<00:05:51.570> my

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
super quick as it was in fast-forward

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.520 
super quick as it was in fast-forward

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
but here are some other options again

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.740 
but here are some other options again

here's<00:06:03.120> a<00:06:03.180> fluent<00:06:03.450> a<00:06:03.480> fun<00:06:03.660> idea<00:06:04.190> go<00:06:05.190> ahead<00:06:05.370> and

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
here's a fluent a fun idea go ahead and

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.160 
here's a fluent a fun idea go ahead and
scan<00:06:05.880> in<00:06:06.060> your<00:06:06.090> cars<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:06.540> print<00:06:06.930> them<00:06:07.050> out

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
scan in your cars and print them out

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.480 
scan in your cars and print them out
onto<00:06:07.380> cardstock<00:06:07.950> which<00:06:08.100> is<00:06:08.190> what<00:06:08.310> I've<00:06:08.370> done

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
onto cardstock which is what I've done

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.130 
onto cardstock which is what I've done
here<00:06:08.670> then<00:06:08.850> you<00:06:08.940> can<00:06:09.090> cut<00:06:09.360> them<00:06:09.480> apart<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.990> use

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
here then you can cut them apart and use

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.660 
here then you can cut them apart and use
them<00:06:10.290> again<00:06:10.560> and<00:06:10.680> again<00:06:10.740> and<00:06:11.010> again<00:06:11.250> so<00:06:11.310> you<00:06:11.490> do

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
them again and again and again so you do

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.040 
them again and again and again so you do
the<00:06:11.790> work<00:06:12.000> once<00:06:12.330> but<00:06:12.540> you<00:06:12.630> have<00:06:12.780> them<00:06:12.930> forever

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
the work once but you have them forever

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.560 
the work once but you have them forever
and<00:06:13.860> I've<00:06:14.430> also<00:06:14.580> done<00:06:14.820> some<00:06:14.880> in<00:06:15.150> black<00:06:15.360> and

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
and I've also done some in black and

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.680 
and I've also done some in black and
white<00:06:15.720> using<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.730> pigma<00:06:17.730> brush<00:06:18.150> pen<00:06:18.450> which

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
white using the pigma brush pen which
