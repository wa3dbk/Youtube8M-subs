00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
started using the NFC technology inside

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.400 
started using the NFC technology inside
galaxy<00:00:06.930> s3<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:08.220> here<00:00:08.340> we<00:00:08.430> have<00:00:08.519> two<00:00:08.730> cards<00:00:09.000> with

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
galaxy s3 so here we have two cards with

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.900 
galaxy s3 so here we have two cards with
technology<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.620> works<00:00:10.769> with<00:00:10.920> NFC<00:00:11.340> chips

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
