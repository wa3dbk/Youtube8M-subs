00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.209
 hello from michelangelo moggia 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.679
 today we take a nice dip in Flemish art with one of the undisputed masters 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.489
 of the 400 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.629
 white in which for a long time he was considered the inventor of painting ad 

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:25.449
 oil 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.199
 in reality it is not really so but surely fuck one of the first to do 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.949
 rediscover improving this technique 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.920
 the portrait of the Arnolfini spouses is perhaps his most famous work 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.180
 what a marriage represents 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.060
 but we see lamellar in detail 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.080
 the protagonists are Giovanni Arnolfini a merchant of laundry, abrusci and of the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.410
 his wife giovanna cenami 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.260
 the clothes they wear testify that we are facing two people 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.940
 certainly rich wealthy 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.940
 2 have a solemn attitude because they are getting married 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.720
 he takes the woman's hand and raises his right hand as if he were about to 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.480
 utter an oath 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.780
 the wife with the other hand holds the belly that appears slightly swollen 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.760
 and this has been interpreted as a reference to motherhood as a 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.110
 augury 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.899
 to capture the event 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.530
 the two spouses called one of the best artists in the jan van area 

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:20.970
 eyck indeed 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.590
 in this case, however, there is also another function, that of witness 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.910
 once marrying they used to swear in front of two witnesses 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.730
 and then later we went to church by the priest to formalize 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.730
 the Union 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.170
 here the painter in this case is one of the two witnesses 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.360
 look at the mirror hanging on the wall at the bottom 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.350
 over two spouses obviously from behind you see two other people in front of them 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.520
 one of these. Baptist 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.180
 but there is another interesting detail in the wall above the mirror you put the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.600
 painter's signature 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.590
 juan les pins eric fulltiltpoker more translated from Latin means i 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.710
 state appliances. 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.430
 no party who didn't put this painted it but American Indians but 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.759
 appliances were his own to confirm that he is one of the witnesses 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.599
 event 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.010
 painting also very rich in details according to the typical tradition of 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.269
 Flemish painting 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.519
 and many of these years a symbolic meaning 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.639
 for example the little dog at the feet of the couple who lightens a little tone 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.589
 solemn of the painting represents to me the fidelity that binds the two spouses 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:30.879
 this is precisely because the dog is a senile animal reviewed 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:36.439
 also the chandelier with a single lit candle with symbolic meaning 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.879
 the flame represents the love between the two spouses 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.659
 besides at the time in the houses I like I don't like for a candle the 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.639
 wedding day 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.919
 the oranges in the background instead near the window remind us of the earth 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:53.499
 of origin of giovanni arnolfini that is italy 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:56.979
 but also his wealth because at that time only those who owned a lot 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:57.630
 money 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.299
 he could afford products that came so far 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.949
 the same can be said of the precious oriental rug on the wooden floor 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.049
 that can be seen behind levels dressed in Giovanni 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.499
 the two protagonists are also barefoot as evidenced by the fire of 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:14.749
 bellavista 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:18.699
 this is because I read that perhaps the house was taken off his shoes 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.699
 and then I break everything and then they'll make you video spouse 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.289
 finally two words about style 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:29.649
 it is an oil painting a technique that enhances the shine of the 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:33.539
 painting and gives the opportunity to take great care of detail thanks to 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:37.910
 glazes or glazings are transparent layers of color 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.779
 that allow you to define the various site objects 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.349
 I have a precision really 24 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.169
 it is a picture realized with meticulous work as you can 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.089
 check by observing the various details 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.870
 it is the final effect is an extremely defined vision of driving 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.370
 to the point of being almost artificial
