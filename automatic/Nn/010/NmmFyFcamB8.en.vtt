00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.790
 and now that I want is that there is no hurry is that he gets excited 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.339
 but despite having to speak 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:15.320
 beto says critics favorite game and all this that is not a person with 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.499
 What to do with her 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.559
 with the garbage that is recycled has its own medicine industry home 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.019
 house would have a protection in place 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:26.859
 and she behind 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.659
 joão pessoa 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.170
 it was a personal life struggle 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.000
 do not fall for the real 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.630
 Vicente Calderón 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.730
 thank you 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.050
 threat of cold war 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.050
 if we had passed 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.090
 in the same direction 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.420
 is it true that he wants to see something like this for people with music based on 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 payment modalities 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.270
 so I am able to jump over 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.760
 in the afternoon 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.240
 We work with advertising. 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.400
 70 year old mage and citizenship and dignity question do not make a 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.250
 Where are you going to stop only now that we're 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.660
 it only depends on how many years 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.060
 this afternoon I live to eight years of work but three people who live 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.450
 I said it here 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.510
 call now and there is also no place to throw the trash 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.820
 in being marginalized is a job that I guess 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.910
 but is being marginalized 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.829
 if we had adapted to the standard they were in the valley bottom 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.079
 sure it's a certainty I do not believe so 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.079
 sirtes so we made it available to locals 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.480
 If it was lamented by the city council the same in every 15 days it would not be 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.810
 favorite is to take a track always gave us to work 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.780
 how I said citizen's life 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020
 so it has not been validated 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.929
 of course because sometimes doors we can not hide 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.220
 I wish I had more time to get used to it 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.220
 the city's estimate 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.090
 by the end of the year and a half in the mugs something like this 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.430
 while the doctor directly and indirectly combats dengue combat 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.840
 other puts upset and woven society footwear 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.589
 the rival of the relegation zone 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.429
 carl soan goes 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:28.339
 the power that has to search has no way to use informed 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:29.879
 rescued survivor 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.249
 I think it's a little shame here. 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.319
 If you were here, you're sure to throw trash here. 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.699
 should take advantage of his father instead of putting the unisul wagon is now to enjoy 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.699
 its phase of implementing reforms 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.700
 It may even be that we have the home of the physical department 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.559
 in the city of nature to invent 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.559
 how do you forward what you eat to do the same 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.989
 the prelate of nature more about the fair can do a new thing without fail
