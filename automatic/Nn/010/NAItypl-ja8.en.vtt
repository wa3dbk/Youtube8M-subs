predictions<00:00:58.230> no<00:00:59.039> I'm<00:00:59.309> I'm<00:00:59.609> sticking<00:01:00.239> with

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
predictions no I'm I'm sticking with

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.090 
predictions no I'm I'm sticking with
both<00:01:00.780> target<00:01:02.510> very<00:01:03.510> much<00:01:03.750> they<00:01:04.650> were<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
both target very much they were going to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.219 
both target very much they were going to
achieve<00:01:05.489> by<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.729> end<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.210> 2014

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
achieve by the end of 2014

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.490 
achieve by the end of 2014
okay<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.740> by<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.100> end<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.729> 2014<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.350> is

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
okay so by the end of 2014 so this is

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.950 
okay so by the end of 2014 so this is
still<00:01:10.770> over<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> two-year<00:01:11.640> outlook<00:01:12.000> exactly

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
still over a two-year outlook exactly

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
still over a two-year outlook exactly
because<00:01:13.260> what<00:01:13.470> happened<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.369> my<00:01:14.549> cycle

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
because what happened that I in my cycle

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.929 
because what happened that I in my cycle
theory<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.630> when<00:01:16.439> whenever<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.340> predict<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
theory when when whenever I predict the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.450 
theory when when whenever I predict the
positive<00:01:18.540> cycle<00:01:18.750> trend<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.320> coming<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.830> if

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
positive cycle trend is coming and if

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.660 
positive cycle trend is coming and if
suppose<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.180> 76<00:01:22.170> or<00:01:22.380> 96<00:01:22.890> hours<00:01:23.189> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
suppose for the 76 or 96 hours the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.999 
suppose for the 76 or 96 hours the
positivity<00:01:24.150> doesn't<00:01:24.750> come<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
positivity doesn't come then I think the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.160 
positivity doesn't come then I think the
negativity<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:26.759> will<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> positivity<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
negativity or will the positivity and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.170 
negativity or will the positivity and
that's<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.799> exactly<00:01:28.979> happened<00:01:29.700> when<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> was

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
that's what exactly happened when I was

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.789 
that's what exactly happened when I was
with<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> November<00:01:31.140> interview<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.740> I

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
with you in the November interview and I

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.289 
with you in the November interview and I
predicted<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.460> goal<00:01:32.700> will<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
predicted that the goal will going to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.460 
predicted that the goal will going to
hit<00:01:34.400> nineteen<00:01:35.400> nineteen<00:01:36.210> fifty<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.810> which

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
hit nineteen nineteen fifty and which

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.120 
hit nineteen nineteen fifty and which
never<00:01:38.270> happened<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.990> immediately<00:01:40.920> if

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
never happened and and immediately if

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.130 
never happened and and immediately if
you<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.579> my<00:01:41.700> website<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> 22nd<00:01:43.079> or

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
you see on my website on the 22nd or

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.980 
you see on my website on the 22nd or
21st<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.829> November<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.790> immediately<00:01:45.390> came<00:01:45.810> out

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
21st of November I immediately came out

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.200 
21st of November I immediately came out
with<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> update<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.009> negativities<00:01:47.640> or

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
with the update that the negativities or

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.260 
with the update that the negativities or
any<00:01:48.630> overruling<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> positive<00:01:50.369> cycles<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.090> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
any overruling the positive cycles so it

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.639 
any overruling the positive cycles so it
means<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> gold<00:01:51.960> may<00:01:52.200> remain<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
means that the gold may remain the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.530 
means that the gold may remain the
sideways<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.579> don't<00:01:53.790> go<00:01:53.970> high<00:01:54.210> leverage

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
sideways so don't go high leverage

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.810 
sideways so don't go high leverage
