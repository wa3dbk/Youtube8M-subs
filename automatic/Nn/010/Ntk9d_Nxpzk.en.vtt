slight disadvantage as in they don't let
you<00:01:35.159> put<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.340> screw<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.790> they've<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.479> some

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
you put the screw in they've got some

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.620 
you put the screw in they've got some
crazy<00:01:37.170> wall<00:01:37.650> off<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.280> either<00:01:38.490> maybe<00:01:39.060> help<00:01:39.299> stop

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
crazy wall off to either maybe help stop

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.929 
crazy wall off to either maybe help stop
vibrations<00:01:40.259> or<00:01:40.439> something<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.820> way

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
vibrations or something but the way

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.270 
vibrations or something but the way
around<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:43.140> screw<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.770> you'll

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
around that is just screw it in you'll

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
around that is just screw it in you'll
take<00:01:44.610> off<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> little<00:01:44.970> bit<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.240> plastic<00:01:45.360> from

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
take off a little bit of plastic from

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.319 
take off a little bit of plastic from
the<00:01:45.930> fan<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.409> then<00:01:47.250> we<00:01:47.310> need<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.549> attach<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the fan and then we need to attach it to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.200 
the fan and then we need to attach it to
the<00:01:48.420> H<00:01:48.570> 100<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.280> want<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.610> reattach

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the H 100 so then I want you to reattach

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.719 
the H 100 so then I want you to reattach
it<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> fans<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.170> put<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.409> earlier<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.979> we

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it to the fans we put in earlier and we

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
it to the fans we put in earlier and we
have<00:01:53.880> air<00:01:54.630> coming<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.110> from<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.409> bump

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
have air coming in from the bump

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.719 
have air coming in from the bump
going<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> top<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.630> once<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.079> goes<00:01:58.200> in

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
going out at the top so once it goes in

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.770 
going out at the top so once it goes in
you<00:01:59.729> get<00:01:59.850> slowed<00:02:00.119> down<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.329> little<00:02:00.479> bit<00:02:00.630> by<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
you get slowed down a little bit by the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.170 
you get slowed down a little bit by the
radiator<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> gets<00:02:02.100> picked<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.460> again<00:02:02.610> by

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
radiator then it gets picked up again by

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.090 
radiator then it gets picked up again by
the<00:02:03.240> outside<00:02:03.659> which<00:02:04.229> hopefully<00:02:04.469> should<00:02:04.740> mean

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the outside which hopefully should mean

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.249 
the outside which hopefully should mean
more<00:02:05.310> airflow<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.909> through<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> H<00:02:06.570> 100<00:02:07.110> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
more airflow going through the H 100 and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.219 
more airflow going through the H 100 and
a<00:02:07.740> call<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.129> processor<00:02:08.690> Corsair<00:02:09.690> has<00:02:09.929> even

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
a call the processor Corsair has even

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.839 
a call the processor Corsair has even
thought<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.590> might<00:02:10.770> want<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.310> so

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
thought you might want to do this so

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.760 
thought you might want to do this so
there<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.420> CPU<00:02:13.020> fan<00:02:13.349> pin

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
there is for CPU fan pin

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.400 
there is for CPU fan pin
on<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.430> caller<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.970> can<00:02:15.300> plug<00:02:15.450> into<00:02:15.630> now<00:02:16.290> I'm

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
on the caller you can plug into now I'm

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.350 
on the caller you can plug into now I'm
not<00:02:16.530> using<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.920> I'm<00:02:17.070> using<00:02:17.460> bollocks<00:02:17.880> pins<00:02:18.150> as

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
not using it I'm using bollocks pins as

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.820 
not using it I'm using bollocks pins as
as<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.840> can<00:02:18.990> hear<00:02:19.550> it's<00:02:20.550> very<00:02:20.850> quiet<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:22.650> is

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
as you can hear it's very quiet this is

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.660 
as you can hear it's very quiet this is
the<00:02:22.950> audio<00:02:23.220> straight<00:02:23.670> from<00:02:23.880> my<00:02:23.970> camera<00:02:25.670> deadly

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
the audio straight from my camera deadly

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.910 
the audio straight from my camera deadly
silence<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.330> it's<00:02:27.930> moving<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.320> lot<00:02:28.530> more<00:02:28.560> air

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
than it did before now I forgot to film

than it did before now I forgot to film
the<00:02:31.410> old<00:02:31.560> temperatures<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.520> can<00:02:32.730> tell<00:02:32.850> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the old temperatures but I can tell you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.480 
the old temperatures but I can tell you
they<00:02:33.150> were<00:02:33.180> between<00:02:33.600> 70<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.290> 78<00:02:34.890> degrees<00:02:35.190> at
