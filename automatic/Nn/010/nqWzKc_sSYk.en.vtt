00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.580 

so<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:15.840> we're<00:00:15.930> going<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.080> do<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.350> we're<00:00:16.530> gonna

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
so what we're going to do is we're gonna

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.310 
so what we're going to do is we're gonna
do<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.280> test<00:00:17.640> here<00:00:18.030> which<00:00:18.210> will<00:00:18.390> actually<00:00:18.780> show

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.700 

two<00:00:22.320> different<00:00:22.440> things<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:24.350> is<00:00:25.350> going<00:00:25.590> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
two different things one is going to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.100 
two different things one is going to
show<00:00:27.680> how<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:29.010> reacts<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.700> the<00:00:29.850> surface<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
show how it reacts to the surface and

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.600 
show how it reacts to the surface and
then<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.710> also<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.370> show<00:00:33.020> how<00:00:34.020> well<00:00:34.610> it

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
then it's also going to show how well it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.260 
then it's also going to show how well it
drains<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.220> I<00:00:38.309> said<00:00:38.550> we've<00:00:38.730> got<00:00:38.760> our<00:00:39.030> road

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
drains so as I said we've got our road

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.010 
drains so as I said we've got our road
ready<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.900> use<00:00:40.140> seed<00:00:40.890> starting<00:00:41.340> mix<00:00:41.550> only<00:00:42.540> in

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
ready to use seed starting mix only in

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.560 
ready to use seed starting mix only in
our<00:00:43.170> green<00:00:43.890> container<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.580> in<00:00:45.239> our<00:00:45.390> red

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
our green container here in our red

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.390 
our green container here in our red
container<00:00:45.900> we've<00:00:46.110> got<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.530> same<00:00:46.769> thing<00:00:47.159> but

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
container we've got that same thing but

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:59.950 
container we've got that same thing but
we've<00:00:47.519> added<00:00:47.730> compost<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.449> it<00:00:49.010> so

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.860 

what's<00:01:00.590> happening<00:01:04.480> dad<00:01:05.480> look<00:01:05.600> like<00:01:05.690> it's

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
what's happening dad look like it's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.109 
what's happening dad look like it's
going<00:01:06.080> anywhere

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.730 

it's<00:01:12.540> basically<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:12.930> sitting<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it's basically just sitting on the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.780 
it's basically just sitting on the
surface<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.700> soil<00:01:16.189> it's<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.430> really

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
surface of the soil it's not really

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.999 
surface of the soil it's not really
draining<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.390> all<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:20.780> can<00:01:21.780> move<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.890> around

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
draining at all I can move that around

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:35.230 
draining at all I can move that around
and<00:01:23.990> it's<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.590> anywhere

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.999 

I<00:01:35.299> don't<00:01:36.020> even<00:01:36.110> see<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.409> dripping<00:01:36.650> out<00:01:36.890> of<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
I don't even see it dripping out of the

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.740 
I don't even see it dripping out of the
bottom<00:01:39.310> by<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.340> way<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:40.759> water<00:01:41.090> spot<00:01:41.509> was

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
bottom by the way this water spot was

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.999 
bottom by the way this water spot was
already<00:01:42.290> there

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.560 

yeah<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.149> not<00:01:48.630> going<00:01:48.899> anywhere<00:01:50.570> so

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
yeah it's just not going anywhere so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.719 
yeah it's just not going anywhere so
I'll<00:01:51.659> go<00:01:51.899> ahead<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.110> put<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.350> down<00:01:52.729> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
I'll go ahead and put that down and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:05.420 
I'll go ahead and put that down and
let's<00:01:54.119> go<00:01:54.689> ahead<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.530> one

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.139 

it<00:02:06.000> does<00:02:06.210> bubble<00:02:06.600> up<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.810> little<00:02:06.990> bit<00:02:08.149> but

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it does bubble up a little bit but

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.920 
it does bubble up a little bit but
you'll<00:02:09.330> notice

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.610 

it<00:02:16.930> does<00:02:17.140> eventually<00:02:17.440> go<00:02:17.800> away

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:35.330 

and<00:02:24.620> eventually<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.220> drains<00:02:25.460> though

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.280 

I<00:02:35.430> know<00:02:35.970> we<00:02:36.360> just<00:02:36.390> need<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.780> add<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> little<00:02:37.080> more

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
I know we just need to add a little more

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:51.490 
I know we just need to add a little more
to<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.680> don't<00:02:37.890> we

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.050 

it's<00:02:52.010> pretty<00:02:52.250> obvious<00:02:52.550> which<00:02:52.730> one<00:02:52.790> is

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
it's pretty obvious which one is

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:02.670 
it's pretty obvious which one is
draining<00:02:53.270> better

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.390 

I'm<00:03:03.680> gonna<00:03:03.890> pour<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:04.490> water<00:03:04.820> out<00:03:04.940> that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
I'm gonna pour this water out that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.740 
I'm gonna pour this water out that
doesn't<00:03:07.400> seem<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.880> really<00:03:08.030> want<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.390> go<00:03:08.510> down

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
doesn't seem to really want to go down

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:21.470 
doesn't seem to really want to go down
into<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.170> soil

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.449 

and<00:03:22.220> what<00:03:23.220> do<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.310> notice<00:03:24.920> I'm<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:26.190> of

and what do you notice I'm just of

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.839 
and what do you notice I'm just of

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
course just taking this top part off dry

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:40.130 
course just taking this top part off dry
as<00:03:32.909> a<00:03:32.970> bone

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.830 

all<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.230> way<00:03:41.290> down<00:03:41.439> to<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.590> bottom<00:03:45.840> soaking

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
all the way down to the bottom soaking

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.990 
all the way down to the bottom soaking
wet

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.290
