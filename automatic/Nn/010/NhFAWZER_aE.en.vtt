00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.399

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.200
 yes you can't have that at the campsite 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.640
 We heard yesterday but it is done 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.360

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.310
 Martians there well maybe 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.870
 from barbecuing 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.930
 this would make it different from the normal with 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.160
 easter is yes it is the colder with easter 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.990
 Event it a bit of it 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.250
 the sun is shining and yet not glowing 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.360
 hot but it may be a little bit 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.130
 be pleasant 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.900
 And well that is really winter 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.660
 but with Easter it's normal 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.690
 warmer so last year it was around 15 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.490
 20 degrees now the freeze is a bit 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.040
