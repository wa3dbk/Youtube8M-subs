actually hook this up wirelessly it will
have<00:06:07.199> a<00:06:07.259> little<00:06:07.469> latency<00:06:07.949> but<00:06:08.419> really<00:06:09.419> it's

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539 
have a little latency but really it's

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:10.780

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.340 
not clack at the moment but that may be

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.730 
not clack at the moment but that may be
possible<00:07:25.850> in<00:07:25.940> the<00:07:26.030> future<00:07:26.060> updates<00:07:26.720> and<00:07:27.020> then

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
possible in the future updates and then

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.460 
possible in the future updates and then
and<00:07:28.700> you<00:07:28.730> can<00:07:29.270> play<00:07:29.480> two<00:07:29.780> of<00:07:29.930> those<00:07:30.050> at<00:07:30.380> the

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.470 
and you can play two of those at the

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.260 
and you can play two of those at the
same<00:07:30.650> time<00:07:30.830> you<00:07:31.160> play<00:07:31.370> two<00:07:31.430> at<00:07:31.730> the<00:07:31.820> same<00:07:32.000> time

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
same time you play two at the same time

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.450 
same time you play two at the same time
and<00:07:32.570> you<00:07:32.660> can<00:07:32.690> also<00:07:32.930> record<00:07:33.470> high<00:07:33.890> resolution

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460 
and you can also record high resolution

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.520 
and you can also record high resolution
audio<00:07:34.550> coming<00:07:35.360> into<00:07:35.480> the<00:07:35.660> device<00:07:35.930> that's

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530 
audio coming into the device that's

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.930 
audio coming into the device that's
something<00:07:36.800> that<00:07:36.920> no<00:07:37.070> other<00:07:37.100> device<00:07:37.550> can<00:07:37.760> do<00:07:37.850> at

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:37.940 
something that no other device can do at

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.020 
something that no other device can do at
the<00:07:38.060> moment<00:07:39.310> alright<00:07:40.310> so<00:07:40.610> this<00:07:40.700> is<00:07:40.850> really

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.030 
the moment alright so this is really

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.070 
the moment alright so this is really
it's<00:07:41.570> kind<00:07:41.810> of<00:07:41.840> high-end<00:07:42.140> and<00:07:43.270> it<00:07:44.270> won't<00:07:44.660> last

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 
it's kind of high-end and it won't last

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.810 
it's kind of high-end and it won't last
long<00:07:45.380> and<00:07:45.530> many<00:07:45.740> DJ's<00:07:46.100> will<00:07:46.310> be<00:07:46.490> walking

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:46.820 
long and many DJ's will be walking

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.040 
long and many DJ's will be walking
around<00:07:47.000> with<00:07:47.210> stuff<00:07:47.630> like<00:07:47.690> this<00:07:47.870> in<00:07:47.990> the

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.050 
around with stuff like this in the

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.030 
around with stuff like this in the
pocket<00:07:48.200> that's<00:07:48.620> correct

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.040 
pocket that's correct

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.350 
pocket that's correct
hopefully<00:07:49.400> that's<00:07:49.640> the<00:07:49.730> concept<00:07:50.120> and

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.360 
hopefully that's the concept and

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.270 
hopefully that's the concept and
hopefully<00:07:50.660> people<00:07:50.810> catch<00:07:51.080> on<00:07:51.260> music<00:07:52.160> is

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 
hopefully people catch on music is

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.790 
hopefully people catch on music is
mobile<00:07:52.640> these<00:07:52.790> days<00:07:53.000> so<00:07:53.300> we<00:07:53.870> do<00:07:54.380> everything<00:07:54.410> we

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 
mobile these days so we do everything we

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.050 
mobile these days so we do everything we
can<00:07:54.920> to<00:07:54.980> make<00:07:55.130> that<00:07:55.280> possible<00:07:55.490> and<00:07:55.940> you

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:56.060 
can to make that possible and you

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.520 
can to make that possible and you
company<00:07:56.420> you've<00:07:56.690> been<00:07:56.720> doing<00:07:57.110> this<00:07:57.230> for<00:07:57.500> a

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:57.530 
company you've been doing this for a

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.990 
company you've been doing this for a
while<00:07:57.590> this<00:07:58.010> kind<00:07:58.190> of<00:07:58.220> technology<00:07:58.490> or

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.000 
while this kind of technology or

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.310 
while this kind of technology or
so<00:07:59.300> this<00:07:59.450> do<00:07:59.660> you<00:07:59.780> do<00:07:59.900> this<00:08:00.080> this<00:08:00.260> is

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:00.320 
so this do you do this this is

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.860 
so this do you do this this is
relatively<00:08:00.860> new<00:08:00.980> but<00:08:01.130> we've<00:08:01.790> had<00:08:02.030> our<00:08:02.480> company

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:02.870 
relatively new but we've had our company

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.200 
relatively new but we've had our company
specializes<00:08:03.020> in<00:08:03.770> engineering<00:08:04.370> so<00:08:04.580> we<00:08:05.090> have

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.210 
specializes in engineering so we have

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.560 
specializes in engineering so we have
this<00:08:05.360> technology<00:08:05.860> algorithms<00:08:06.860> so<00:08:07.250> we<00:08:08.210> decided

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:08.570 
this technology algorithms so we decided

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.470 
this technology algorithms so we decided
to<00:08:08.630> make<00:08:08.750> a<00:08:08.810> device<00:08:09.110> of<00:08:09.350> it
