right on top right here you have a
rubber<00:04:32.770> gasket<00:04:33.159> make<00:04:33.699> sure<00:04:33.849> this<00:04:34.060> gasket

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
rubber gasket make sure this gasket

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.839 
rubber gasket make sure this gasket
comes<00:04:34.870> off<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.740> know<00:04:35.830> in<00:04:35.919> 20<00:04:36.189> years<00:04:36.340> I've<00:04:36.639> only

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
comes off you know in 20 years I've only

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.510 
comes off you know in 20 years I've only
seen<00:04:37.240> one<00:04:37.689> time<00:04:38.050> when<00:04:38.620> this<00:04:38.770> gasket<00:04:39.069> did<00:04:39.400> not

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
seen one time when this gasket did not

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.510 
seen one time when this gasket did not
come<00:04:39.699> off<00:04:39.879> with<00:04:40.569> the<00:04:40.689> filter<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:42.069> would<00:04:42.400> say

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
come off with the filter so I would say

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.300 
come off with the filter so I would say
99%<00:04:43.389> of<00:04:43.719> the<00:04:44.110> time<00:04:44.349> it<00:04:44.590> does<00:04:44.740> come<00:04:44.949> off<00:04:44.979> but

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
99% of the time it does come off but

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.860 
99% of the time it does come off but
make<00:04:45.520> sure<00:04:45.729> it<00:04:45.819> does<00:04:45.969> come<00:04:46.150> off<00:04:46.270> because<00:04:46.659> when

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
make sure it does come off because when

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.290 
make sure it does come off because when
you<00:04:46.990> reinstall<00:04:47.439> the<00:04:47.560> new<00:04:47.680> filter<00:04:48.099> if<00:04:48.280> this<00:04:49.030> old

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
you reinstall the new filter if this old

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.950 
you reinstall the new filter if this old
rubber<00:04:49.659> gasket<00:04:50.379> is<00:04:50.740> still<00:04:51.129> on<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.610> mount<00:04:51.960> then

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
rubber gasket is still on the mount then

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.809 
rubber gasket is still on the mount then
it's<00:04:53.349> going<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.770> leak<00:04:53.979> so<00:04:54.280> just<00:04:54.490> don't<00:04:54.699> forget

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
it's going to leak so just don't forget

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.769 
it's going to leak so just don't forget
to<00:04:55.060> check<00:04:55.330> that<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:58.090> again<00:04:58.270> this<00:04:58.360> is<00:04:58.509> your<00:04:58.599> old

00:04:58.769 --> 00:04:58.779 
to check that so again this is your old

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:00.990 
to check that so again this is your old
filter<00:04:59.169> and<00:04:59.379> this<00:04:59.650> may<00:04:59.830> be<00:04:59.889> a<00:05:00.009> little<00:05:00.159> bit<00:05:00.819> of<00:05:00.909> a

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
filter and this may be a little bit of a

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.670 
filter and this may be a little bit of a
better<00:05:01.210> view<00:05:01.509> as<00:05:01.719> you<00:05:02.020> can<00:05:02.169> see<00:05:02.289> you<00:05:02.409> have<00:05:02.469> this

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
better view as you can see you have this

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.230 
better view as you can see you have this
rubber<00:05:02.889> gasket<00:05:03.189> make<00:05:03.580> sure<00:05:03.729> it<00:05:03.849> comes<00:05:04.000> off

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
rubber gasket make sure it comes off

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.929 
rubber gasket make sure it comes off
with<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.110> old<00:05:05.169> filter<00:05:05.439> so<00:05:06.340> we<00:05:06.430> grab<00:05:06.639> our<00:05:06.819> new

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:06.939 
with the old filter so we grab our new

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.379 
with the old filter so we grab our new
filter<00:05:07.360> what<00:05:08.199> you're<00:05:08.319> going<00:05:08.529> to<00:05:08.650> do<00:05:08.830> is<00:05:09.009> just

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
filter what you're going to do is just

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.959 
filter what you're going to do is just
stick<00:05:10.389> your<00:05:10.569> finger<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.219> the<00:05:12.219> new<00:05:12.370> oil<00:05:12.699> and

stick your finger and the new oil and
just<00:05:13.960> lightly<00:05:14.430> coat<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:16.409> gasket<00:05:17.409> this<00:05:17.590> will

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
just lightly coat the gasket this will

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.320 
just lightly coat the gasket this will
make<00:05:17.889> it<00:05:18.039> easier<00:05:18.490> to<00:05:18.729> remove<00:05:21.029> down<00:05:22.029> the<00:05:22.150> road

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
make it easier to remove down the road

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.519 
make it easier to remove down the road
when<00:05:22.539> you're<00:05:22.659> ready<00:05:22.810> to<00:05:22.960> do<00:05:23.110> so

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:23.529 
when you're ready to do so

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:25.469 
when you're ready to do so
and<00:05:24.159> once<00:05:24.340> you<00:05:24.430> do<00:05:24.580> that<00:05:24.610> just<00:05:25.029> go<00:05:25.180> ahead<00:05:25.210> and

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
and once you do that just go ahead and

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.149 
and once you do that just go ahead and
look<00:05:25.569> at<00:05:25.659> the<00:05:25.779> directions<00:05:26.349> every<00:05:26.529> filter<00:05:26.919> is<00:05:27.099> a

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
look at the directions every filter is a

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.219 
look at the directions every filter is a
little<00:05:27.400> bit<00:05:27.520> different<00:05:28.000> as<00:05:28.509> you<00:05:28.719> can<00:05:28.870> see<00:05:29.020> here

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
little bit different as you can see here

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.110 
little bit different as you can see here
it<00:05:29.349> just<00:05:29.469> states<00:05:29.770> clean<00:05:30.339> the<00:05:30.460> mounting<00:05:30.849> point

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
it just states clean the mounting point

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.430 
it just states clean the mounting point
which<00:05:31.270> I'll<00:05:31.419> do<00:05:31.569> off-camera<00:05:31.990> you<00:05:32.110> don't<00:05:32.319> need

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
which I'll do off-camera you don't need

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.140 
which I'll do off-camera you don't need
to<00:05:32.529> see<00:05:32.680> that<00:05:32.710> in<00:05:33.339> other<00:05:33.520> words<00:05:33.610> this<00:05:33.879> is<00:05:34.029> the

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
to see that in other words this is the

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.029 
to see that in other words this is the
mounting<00:05:34.539> point<00:05:34.810> on<00:05:34.990> the<00:05:35.139> motor<00:05:35.349> so<00:05:35.860> just

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
mounting point on the motor so just

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.279 
mounting point on the motor so just
clean<00:05:36.190> off<00:05:36.339> the<00:05:36.490> surface<00:05:36.699> add<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.870> little<00:05:38.139> bit

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
clean off the surface add a little bit

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.950 
clean off the surface add a little bit
of<00:05:38.319> oil<00:05:38.589> on<00:05:38.979> this<00:05:39.849> rubber<00:05:40.029> gasket<00:05:40.300> which<00:05:40.750> we

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
of oil on this rubber gasket which we

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.159 
of oil on this rubber gasket which we
did<00:05:41.229> and<00:05:41.469> turn<00:05:42.460> it<00:05:42.580> one<00:05:42.879> turn<00:05:43.360> so<00:05:43.629> in<00:05:44.050> other
