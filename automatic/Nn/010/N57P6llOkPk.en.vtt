00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
and doing this again don't expect a

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.690 
and doing this again don't expect a
different<00:04:35.720> result<00:04:35.870> we<00:04:36.830> both<00:04:37.070> know<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.550> nine

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
different result we both know the nine

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.900 
different result we both know the nine
of<00:04:37.730> clubs<00:04:38.030> comes<00:04:38.510> out<00:04:38.720> at<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.990> end<00:04:39.170> and<00:04:39.620> that

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
of clubs comes out at the end and that

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.400 
of clubs comes out at the end and that
would<00:04:40.910> cause<00:04:41.090> a<00:04:41.120> bit<00:04:41.420> of<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.630> paradox<00:04:41.840> the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
would cause a bit of a paradox the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.070 
would cause a bit of a paradox the
second<00:04:42.800> time<00:04:42.980> around<00:04:43.630> so<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.720> solve<00:04:44.930> this

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080
