00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
a third of a cup so we'll just pop that

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.449 
a third of a cup so we'll just pop that
in<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:17.590> we<00:02:18.400> saw<00:02:18.640> mix<00:02:18.880> out<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:20.560> combine<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.340> get

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
in and we saw mix out to combine and get

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.150 
in and we saw mix out to combine and get
rid<00:02:21.640> of<00:02:21.670> any<00:02:21.910> lumps<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.470> think<00:02:23.860> she<00:02:26.160> both

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
rid of any lumps and I think she both

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.070 
rid of any lumps and I think she both
don't<00:02:27.459> stress<00:02:27.640> about<00:02:27.670> too<00:02:28.060> much<00:02:28.180> cleaner<00:02:28.569> P&amp;G

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
don't stress about too much cleaner P&amp;G

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.140 
don't stress about too much cleaner P&amp;G
and<00:02:29.260> make<00:02:29.380> some<00:02:29.620> with<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:30.010> cream<00:02:30.700> at<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.000> end

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
and make some with that cream at the end

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.870 
and make some with that cream at the end
so<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:32.200> lungs<00:02:32.350> will<00:02:32.560> come<00:02:32.709> around<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:33.670> then<00:02:33.790> I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
so the lungs will come around so then I

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.910 
so the lungs will come around so then I

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.710 

ok<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.590> then<00:03:28.740> that<00:03:29.100> second<00:03:29.550> act<00:03:29.760> after<00:03:30.300> lemon

duties<00:03:30.960> do<00:03:31.110> not<00:03:31.140> go<00:03:31.830> then<00:03:32.040> you're<00:03:32.160> not<00:03:32.220> going

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
duties do not go then you're not going

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.360 
duties do not go then you're not going
to<00:03:32.460> get<00:03:32.550> it<00:03:32.670> as<00:03:32.790> stiff<00:03:33.120> but<00:03:33.420> that's<00:03:33.750> probably

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
to get it as stiff but that's probably

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.820 
to get it as stiff but that's probably
as<00:03:35.370> hope<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.700> we're<00:03:35.820> going<00:03:36.030> together<00:03:36.830> so

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
as hope this we're going together so

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.990 
as hope this we're going together so
then<00:03:37.980> we'll<00:03:38.130> just<00:03:38.250> divide<00:03:38.430> our<00:03:38.730> mixture

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
then we'll just divide our mixture

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:54.710

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
it was but that's okay I'll be enough

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.710 
it was but that's okay I'll be enough
air<00:04:01.380> in<00:04:01.410> there<00:04:01.860> too<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.430> keep<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:03.000> texture<00:04:03.690> of

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
air in there too to keep the texture of

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:17.080
