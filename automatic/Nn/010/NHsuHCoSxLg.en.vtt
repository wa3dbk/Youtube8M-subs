00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
said so with this game it seems like

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.160 
said so with this game it seems like
when<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.000> actually<00:02:21.210> shoot<00:02:21.690> someone<00:02:21.990> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
when you actually shoot someone you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.930 
when you actually shoot someone you
actually<00:02:22.380> hit<00:02:22.890> them<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.310> your<00:02:23.520> screen<00:02:23.760> in

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
actually hit them on your screen in

actually hit them on your screen in
battlefield<00:02:24.420> 4<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.750> saw<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.410> lot<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.860> would<00:02:26.040> be

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
battlefield 4 I saw it a lot I would be

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.590 
battlefield 4 I saw it a lot I would be
shooting<00:02:26.490> at<00:02:26.610> people<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.120> they<00:02:27.570> just

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
shooting at people and they just

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.120

wouldn't<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.260> dying<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.740> seemed<00:02:28.890> like<00:02:29.040> it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
wouldn't be dying it seemed like it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.320 
wouldn't be dying it seemed like it
seems<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.430> my<00:02:29.550> hit's<00:02:29.790> weren't<00:02:30.120> even

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
registering and that was a huge problem

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.760 
registering and that was a huge problem

actually surprising to say I guess EA

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.410 
actually surprising to say I guess EA
really<00:02:46.560> did<00:02:46.740> learn<00:02:46.950> from<00:02:47.010> last<00:02:47.820> year<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.270> year

really did learn from last year the year

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.450 
really did learn from last year the year
before<00:02:48.480> when<00:02:48.930> battlefield<00:02:49.380> 4<00:02:49.710> launch<00:02:49.950> that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
they really do need to get their shit

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.230 
they really do need to get their shit
together<00:02:51.990> as<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.070> mediocre<00:02:53.550> campaign

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
together as to it the mediocre campaign

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.090

that<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.630> battlefield<00:02:55.320> hardline<00:02:55.920> is

that is battlefield hardline is

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.830 
that is battlefield hardline is
definitely<00:02:56.520> better<00:02:56.700> than<00:02:56.850> battlefield<00:02:57.510> 4<00:02:57.720> and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
definitely better than battlefield 4 and

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.050 
definitely better than battlefield 4 and
threes<00:02:58.080> campaign<00:02:58.530> but<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.370> nothing<00:02:59.640> to

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
threes campaign but it is nothing to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.210 
threes campaign but it is nothing to
groundbreaking<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.140> played<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:01.920> valve

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
groundbreaking if you played just valve

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
and robbers seen the story is somewhat

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.680 
and robbers seen the story is somewhat
interesting<00:03:08.310> but<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.180> nothing<00:03:09.510> to

a few things I didn't like about the
game<00:03:14.700> one<00:03:15.030> being<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.600> had<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.840> pre<00:03:16.050> order

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
game one being that you had to pre order

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.990 
game one being that you had to pre order
to<00:03:16.470> get<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> few<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.220> guns<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.670> that's

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
to get a few of the guns and that's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.550 
to get a few of the guns and that's
saying<00:03:18.270> something<00:03:18.360> because<00:03:18.690> there<00:03:19.080> isn't<00:03:19.410> too

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
saying something because there isn't too

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.410 
saying something because there isn't too
many<00:03:19.800> guns<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.340> game<00:03:20.580> which<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.120> also

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
many guns in the game which is also

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.940 
many guns in the game which is also
another<00:03:21.840> problem<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.650> think<00:03:22.709> it's

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
another problem but I just think it's

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.980 
another problem but I just think it's
really<00:03:23.130> shady<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:24.120> pretty<00:03:24.390> much<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.810> had<00:03:24.959> to

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
really shady that pretty much you had to

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.840 
really shady that pretty much you had to
pre<00:03:25.320> order<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.800> get<00:03:25.950> some<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.370> guns<00:03:26.640> and

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
pre order to get some of the guns and

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.690 
pre order to get some of the guns and
also<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.810> operator<00:03:28.290> class<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.800> bit<00:03:29.040> o<00:03:29.220> P<00:03:29.490> I

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
also the operator class is a bit o P I

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.630 
also the operator class is a bit o P I
know<00:03:29.760> because<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.420> use<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.310> it

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
know because I use it and it just it

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.220 
know because I use it and it just it
just<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.910> little<00:03:32.940> p<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.510> kind<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.780> do<00:03:33.959> need<00:03:34.140> to

just a little p you kind of do need to

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.270
