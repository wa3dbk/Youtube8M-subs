00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.980
 and they have had to spend about two years 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.810
 so that the almussafes factory is 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.510
 suitable for the manufacture of the new 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.550
 mondeo 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.840
 for this new line of big cars 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.670
 that until now had never been 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.250
 manufactured in Valencia has been made 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.470
 expansion of 86 thousand square meters is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.420
 500 new robots have been assembled and 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.650
 generated 5,000 new jobs between 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.650
 direct and indirect 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.450
 we are facing the fourth generation of a 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.710
 emblematic model for the brand 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.600
 North American Fort 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.420
 The mondeo has been manufactured and sold 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.430
 both in the USA and in Europe and in 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.059
 previous generations were manufactured in 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.879
 Germany- the first molding was presented 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.460
 in 1993 and to date have been sold 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.820
 4.5 million units throughout the 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.820
 world 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.740
 d 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.300
 the wait has allowed the new molding 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.190
 combine the latest technologies with a 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.380
 Attractive and original design where 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.450
 highlights the huge calender of the brand 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.370
 we already know from models like the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.860
 party and the ecosport and that will soon look 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.409
 the new Focus and other models 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.539
 the range 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.609
 this front that reminds a lot of the 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.710
 the aston martin gives you a point 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:32.569
 of aggressiveness that contributes in some 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.520
 large and elongated optical groups 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.479
 led and adaptive that facilitate 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.479
 night driving 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.820
 place 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.960
 the adaptive headlights of net are 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.240
 composed of 500 pieces that work 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.189
 in unison to measure the outside light the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.350
 speed and even the position of the 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.030
 flyer and with that information go 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.540
 modifying the light beam to make it 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.670
 as efficient as possible 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.690
 they take into account if it is raining at 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.280
 start the windshield wiper 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.420
 they are complemented with lights 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.420
 supplementary spin 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.360
 on the sides we can see two 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.280
 marked lines that cross it giving 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.990
 continuity to the design of the front and 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.060
 taking it to the back that 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.130
 both in the version of 5 and like that of 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.870
 four doors house a large trunk 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.430
 framed by great pilots who 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.730
 make up the back corners of the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 car 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.299
 in terms of measurements the new generation 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.790
 It is lower and longer than the previous 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.680
 what confers the final design better 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.079
 aerodynamic and a more elegant look 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.120
 the finishes have improved in quality and 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.219
 it has the zink technology of 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.019
 new generation braking aid 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:58.019
 and the option of automatic parking 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.989
 there will be two levels of equipment trend 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.400
 and titanium and already from the bottom it 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.060
 You will enjoy a wide range of 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.060
 elements 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.030
 one of the great novelties 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.280
 technologies that the mondeo incorporates are 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.870
 the rear belts with airbag that 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.120
 next to the new rear suspension 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.159
 integral make it an ideal vehicle 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.580
 for large trips and trips in 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.580
 family 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.210
 another novelty is the preacher 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.890
 collision with pedestrian detection that 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.360
 can detect if there are people in the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.670
 road that can be crossed by 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.440
 in front of the vehicle or are nearby and 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.989
 apply the brakes automatically 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.920
 If the driver does not respond to warnings 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.290
 the system processes information 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.180
 compiled by a camera installed in 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.250
 the windshield and a radar placed on the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.349
 bumper and crosses it with a base 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.239
 pedestrian forms data to help 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.010
 to distinguish people from the typical 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.280
 objects and elements present in the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.280
 highway 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.250
 at the time of the launch it will have 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.500

 four-door sport brick or 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.470
 familiar and another great novelty the hybrid 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.760
 first hybrid petrol-electric model 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.760

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.630
 include the engines I know like 15 liters and 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.280
 2 liters next to the efficient and powerful 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.380
 1 liter eco bus that will reach
