00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:12.320
 Here we start repairing parts louder 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.320
 a tinsmith arrested from their goods 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.250
 The next recommended process is pretty 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.520
 close next part you 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:36.090
 you can accidentally scratch the skin 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.090
 something else is desirable to glue it 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:45.580
 what about yoga once more and then we will be 2 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.100
 thousand decorate no no phil and here 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.949
 also stick well of course it pads 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.269
 you will take off the subgenre 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:59.260
 the device doesn’t glue anything neatly 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:01.989
 further rotary machine preferably such 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.010
 have a very good thing about her 2 2 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.940
 there are provisions 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:15.490
 the rotor which smokes and there is a simple 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:17.620
 rotor smoothing position 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.380
 then it is all jinxed but simple 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:27.219
 position roped a little further 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.930
 degrease this place June putty 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.520
 inside the arch will also run runs 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.430
 with a partner we do that to us 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.320
 it would be easier to bring out the edging 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.580
 cantik goes goes it for smears 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.960
 ends before cantica was arrested 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.660
 we draw a cantical not just impose 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.840
 first the days of putty then here and he 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.000
 kitchen understand what curve it turns out yes 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.810
 it's more I agree and ready then 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.690
 itself only because we do not usually do so 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.100
 I usually the first layer is all the same 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.270
 putty 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.770
 defect and then sizing tape and 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.420
 mark skates 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.050
 I will skins with the help of coal and there will be 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.489
 everything is visible and so I start it 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.230
 irrelevant here will take shape 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:20.760
 Well, call on his task to make a form 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.580
 original fan first layer 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.310
 putty goulash show twice 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.630
 lila girl 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.630
 maybe 3 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.260
 but here is not a very big defect 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.330
 There is no such deep principle 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.910
 pretty i would say neatly done 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.560
 the same arrow here, look at the tape stuck 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.560
 and by it now 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.310
 peeled off 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.160
 itself that students pulls out here it is 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.440
 sizing again now with the other 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:05.260
 hand will impose bite 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:08.299
 the first layer we fill well 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:14.440
 preferably desirable neater but not 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:14.440
 fundamentally will be more 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.379
 i will be suggestive so careless i would sweat 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:28.310
 certainly I would have done so now here 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.760
 still put these places to be and tea 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.760
 look at broken for 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:43.970
 Here's how to create even if no choice 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.970
 things just stay catching up under conti 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.319
 why are there different minds I don’t know 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.620
 sloppy would have done immediately and on top 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.860
 or 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.349
 Come on, hold the camera let me if you 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.349
 only see not to stain the hold-hold 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.890
 see you can do it right away 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:14.050
 the edging is highlighted and there is little putty 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.040
 just doing our job here on this 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.040
 arrows 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.009
 it starts to harden 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.009
 Well, let's go to what angle 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.030
 helped u black 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.030
 it immediately run 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.420
 but certainly covered because 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.420
 no sloppy little 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.640
 108 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.940
 what news business card 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.580
 it looks like it will pass and 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.839
 all the shore won glue epaulet 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.750
 overlay 1 toy 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.389
 earring circle oval three layers this 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.930
 last 3 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.630
 but it doesn’t all depend 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.530
 from you prepared here with him 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:54.389
 Leningrad turned out to be small 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.990
 there was a repair channels claw that's what 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.990
 huge spot 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.270
 so it was necessary so the stars got up 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.270
 how the stars began to speak seryoga 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:17.860
 Now it is showing just how it happened 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:17.860
 seriously prepared this details painted 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.200
 this place was grounded 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.390
 but here everything is clear now for her to wash 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.390
 will help 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.729
 and give to the client 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.570
 happily
