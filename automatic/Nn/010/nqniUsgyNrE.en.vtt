and<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.879> don't<00:00:51.090> really<00:00:51.210> think<00:00:51.329> that's<00:00:51.660> true<00:00:52.379> but

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and I don't really think that's true but

and I don't really think that's true but
we're<00:00:53.250> gonna<00:00:53.340> put<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> test<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.260> I<00:00:55.260> am

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
we're gonna put it to the test and I am

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
we're gonna put it to the test and I am
aware<00:00:56.100> that<00:00:56.160> there<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> new<00:00:57.000> kind<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.449> dirt

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
aware that there is a new kind of dirt

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.049 
aware that there is a new kind of dirt
in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> game<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.379> has<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.890> value<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.370> zero<00:00:59.520> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
in the game it has a value of zero and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.779 
in the game it has a value of zero and
nothing<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.899> spread<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.789> it's

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
nothing can be spread to it and it's

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.149 
nothing can be spread to it and it's
mostly<00:01:03.000> found<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.600> these<00:01:03.899> Mesa<00:01:04.199> plateaus<00:01:04.799> as

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
mostly found in these Mesa plateaus as

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.160 
mostly found in these Mesa plateaus as
we<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:05.670> here<00:01:05.700> now<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.450> yourself<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:07.140> not

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
we can see here now you yourself are not

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.780 
we can see here now you yourself are not
able<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.619> attain<00:01:07.890> these<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.310> let's<00:01:08.460> use<00:01:08.670> some

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
able to attain these and let's use some

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.420 
able to attain these and let's use some
third-party<00:01:09.030> means<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:10.979> put<00:01:11.280> your

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
third-party means but if you do put your

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.730 
third-party means but if you do put your
center<00:01:11.760> button<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.299> creative<00:01:12.840> mode<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.320> will

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
center button with creative mode it will

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.649 
center button with creative mode it will
give<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.369> regular<00:01:14.640> slab<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> dirt<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
give you just a regular slab of dirt and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.030 
give you just a regular slab of dirt and
just<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.960> compare<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.799> that's<00:01:16.979> in

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
just to compare it to the one that's in

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.469 
just to compare it to the one that's in
the<00:01:17.159> building<00:01:17.460> blocks<00:01:17.700> portion<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the building blocks portion of the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
the building blocks portion of the
creative<00:01:18.840> mode<00:01:18.990> inventory<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.830> exactly<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
creative mode inventory it's exactly the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.700 
creative mode inventory it's exactly the
same<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.509> you're<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.140> what<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
same so you're not going to get what is

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.230 
same so you're not going to get what is
there<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.460> not<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> test<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.090> in

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
there now I'm not going to test this in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.730 
there now I'm not going to test this in
the<00:01:24.330> Mesa<00:01:24.509> biome<00:01:24.750> quite<00:01:25.110> yet<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the Mesa biome quite yet we're going to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.320 
the Mesa biome quite yet we're going to
test<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.159> plains<00:01:26.460> first<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.030> then

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
test it in the plains first and then

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.249 
test it in the plains first and then
we'll<00:01:27.420> check<00:01:27.630> out<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:28.049> how<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
we'll check out and see how the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:02:14.790 
we'll check out and see how the
megataiga<00:01:28.710> reacts

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.140 

well<00:02:15.800> guys<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:15.980> think<00:02:16.280> that's<00:02:16.460> proof<00:02:16.700> enough<00:02:16.820> to

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
well guys I think that's proof enough to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.210 
well guys I think that's proof enough to
see<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.600> pods<00:02:17.870> all<00:02:18.110> does<00:02:18.350> not<00:02:18.560> spread<00:02:18.950> like

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
see that pods all does not spread like

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.280 
see that pods all does not spread like
mycelium<00:02:19.880> after<00:02:20.300> all<00:02:20.480> at<00:02:20.870> least<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.200> this

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
mycelium after all at least in this

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.720 
mycelium after all at least in this
biome<00:02:21.650> now<00:02:21.860> let's<00:02:22.070> test<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.460> see<00:02:22.610> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
biome now let's test and see the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:41.460 
biome now let's test and see the
megataiga

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.380 

well<00:02:42.470> alright<00:02:43.040> actually<00:02:43.610> when<00:02:43.760> FK<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.239> about

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
well alright actually when FK for about

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.869 
well alright actually when FK for about
45<00:02:44.840> minutes<00:02:45.110> just<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.920> see<00:02:46.129> if<00:02:46.250> maybe<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.700> was<00:02:46.849> a

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
45 minutes just to see if maybe it was a

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.330 
45 minutes just to see if maybe it was a
really<00:02:47.239> really<00:02:47.540> slow<00:02:47.900> creep<00:02:48.230> but<00:02:48.590> nothing<00:02:49.220> at

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
really really slow creep but nothing at

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.180 
really really slow creep but nothing at
all<00:02:49.489> so<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.019> prove<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.379> you<00:02:51.470> guys<00:02:51.650> this

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
all so just to prove to you guys this

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.220 
all so just to prove to you guys this
stuff<00:02:52.459> does<00:02:52.670> not<00:02:52.879> spread<00:02:53.299> so<00:02:53.720> anyways<00:02:54.049> guys

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
stuff does not spread so anyways guys

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.589 
stuff does not spread so anyways guys
for<00:02:54.620> now<00:02:54.799> at<00:02:54.980> least<00:02:55.010> there<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.670> no<00:02:56.000> use<00:02:56.329> for

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
for now at least there is no use for

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.539 
for now at least there is no use for
pods<00:02:56.810> all<00:02:57.110> whatsoever<00:02:57.620> it's<00:02:58.250> just<00:02:58.459> a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
to craft the packed ice whatsoever now

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.270 
to craft the packed ice whatsoever now
as<00:03:32.810> far<00:03:32.959> as<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.170> characteristics<00:03:33.890> of<00:03:34.010> packed

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
as far as the characteristics of packed

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.550 
as far as the characteristics of packed
ice<00:03:34.549> it<00:03:35.209> is<00:03:35.390> still<00:03:35.599> just<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:36.049> slippy<00:03:36.440> and

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
ice it is still just a slippy and

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.770 
ice it is still just a slippy and
slighty<00:03:36.919> as<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.400> regular<00:03:37.760> ice<00:03:37.940> and<00:03:38.299> in<00:03:38.630> my

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
slighty as the regular ice and in my

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.539 
slighty as the regular ice and in my
opinion<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.530> looks<00:03:39.739> a<00:03:39.799> little<00:03:39.919> better<00:03:40.130> as<00:03:40.340> well

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
opinion it looks a little better as well

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.099 
opinion it looks a little better as well
and<00:03:40.819> as<00:03:41.030> far<00:03:41.239> as<00:03:41.389> the<00:03:41.510> speed<00:03:41.780> for<00:03:42.079> the

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
and as far as the speed for the

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.620 
and as far as the speed for the
hyperwarp<00:03:42.680> walking<00:03:43.160> pads<00:03:43.430> it's<00:03:43.910> exactly<00:03:44.450> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
hyperwarp walking pads it's exactly the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.479 
hyperwarp walking pads it's exactly the
same<00:03:44.840> stuff<00:03:45.139> now<00:03:45.769> there's<00:03:45.950> also<00:03:46.130> another

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
same stuff now there's also another

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.520 
same stuff now there's also another
really<00:03:47.030> really<00:03:47.450> nice<00:03:47.630> feature<00:03:47.959> about<00:03:48.109> packed

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
really really nice feature about packed

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.159 
really really nice feature about packed
ice<00:03:48.769> it<00:03:49.760> doesn't<00:03:50.120> really<00:03:50.239> melt<00:03:50.510> so<00:03:50.870> it's<00:03:51.019> great

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
ice it doesn't really melt so it's great

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.479 
ice it doesn't really melt so it's great
to<00:03:51.349> build<00:03:51.560> with<00:03:51.879> and<00:03:53.889> last<00:03:54.889> but<00:03:54.980> not<00:03:55.129> least<00:03:55.190> I

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
to build with and last but not least I

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.199 
to build with and last but not least I
think<00:03:55.669> this<00:03:55.760> would<00:03:55.910> be<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.120> appropriate

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
think this would be the appropriate

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.360 
think this would be the appropriate
video<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.470> highlight<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:57.889> changes<00:03:58.250> with

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
video to highlight the changes with

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.729 
video to highlight the changes with
sugar<00:03:58.639> cane<00:03:58.910> nothing<00:03:59.510> mechanically<00:03:59.989> just

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
sugar cane nothing mechanically just

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.500 
sugar cane nothing mechanically just
aesthetics<00:04:01.280> depending<00:04:01.970> on<00:04:02.060> what<00:04:02.209> biome

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
aesthetics depending on what biome

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.180 
aesthetics depending on what biome
you're<00:04:02.720> in<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.139> sugarcane<00:04:03.440> might<00:04:03.980> just

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
you're in the sugarcane might just

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.460 
you're in the sugarcane might just
change<00:04:04.400> colors<00:04:04.879> and<00:04:05.209> some<00:04:05.750> of<00:04:05.900> them<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.260> might

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
change colors and some of them you might

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.559
