60 and then

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.900 
60 and then
my<00:01:12.650> engineer<00:01:13.100> program<00:01:13.250> would<00:01:13.550> freak<00:01:13.760> out

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
my engineer program would freak out

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.240 
my engineer program would freak out
about<00:01:14.120> someone<00:01:14.660> just<00:01:15.410> pretty<00:01:15.710> magic<00:01:16.130> but

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
about someone just pretty magic but

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.770 
about someone just pretty magic but
which<00:01:16.370> one<00:01:16.550> of<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:16.940> could<00:01:17.150> have<00:01:17.270> it's

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
which one of you could have it's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.540 
which one of you could have it's
complicated<00:01:18.320> on<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.500> Pro<00:01:18.860> Tools<00:01:19.070> life<00:01:19.280> don't

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
complicated on the Pro Tools life don't

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.190 
complicated on the Pro Tools life don't
work<00:01:19.640> without<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:19.910> good<00:01:20.150> is<00:01:20.330> just<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:21.050> it's<00:01:21.140> a

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
work without a good is just but it's a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.750 
work without a good is just but it's a
different<00:01:21.500> filament<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.040> me<00:01:22.160> when<00:01:22.400> because

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
different filament to me when because

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.820 
different filament to me when because
the<00:01:23.270> machine<00:01:23.600> usually<00:01:24.050> sounds<00:01:24.470> a<00:01:24.530> different

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
the machine usually sounds a different

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.310 
the machine usually sounds a different
way<00:01:24.920> yeah<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:25.580> we<00:01:25.880> started<00:01:26.450> like<00:01:26.660> looking

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
way yeah and so we started like looking

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.110 
way yeah and so we started like looking
at<00:01:27.410> developments<00:01:27.980> some<00:01:28.160> some<00:01:28.490> pads<00:01:28.730> and<00:01:29.000> all

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
at developments some some pads and all

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.370 
at developments some some pads and all
this<00:01:29.210> kind<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.450> stuff<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:29.870> then<00:01:30.050> it's<00:01:30.260> like

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
this kind of stuff and then it's like

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
this kind of stuff and then it's like
okay<00:01:30.620> that's<00:01:30.770> gonna<00:01:30.860> be<00:01:30.950> really<00:01:31.130> complicated

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
okay that's gonna be really complicated

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.620 
okay that's gonna be really complicated
maybe<00:01:31.760> we<00:01:31.820> just<00:01:31.970> do<00:01:32.150> something<00:01:32.360> that

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
maybe we just do something that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.690 
maybe we just do something that
contributes<00:01:33.380> south<00:01:33.770> do<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.010> have<00:01:34.220> they<00:01:34.520> have

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
contributes south do we have they have

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.230 
contributes south do we have they have
like<00:01:34.880> about<00:01:36.370> 70,000<00:01:37.370> taillights<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.820> silent

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
like about 70,000 taillights of silent

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.150 
like about 70,000 taillights of silent
as<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.600> sounds<00:01:38.780> like<00:01:38.870> 16<00:01:39.200> years<00:01:39.380> old<00:01:39.560> Wow

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
to a point we got the prototype box back

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.930 
to a point we got the prototype box back
and<00:02:43.990> put<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.190> ringer<00:02:45.460> make<00:02:45.610> sure<00:02:45.760> we're

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
and put it to the ringer make sure we're

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.850 
and put it to the ringer make sure we're
the<00:02:46.060> logical<00:02:46.660> ProTools<00:02:47.230> make<00:02:47.440> sure<00:02:47.530> sounded

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
the logical ProTools make sure sounded

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.980 
the logical ProTools make sure sounded
right<00:02:47.980> machine<00:02:48.340> for<00:02:48.490> this<00:02:48.610> did<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.540> we

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
right machine for this did that and we

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.600 
right machine for this did that and we
spent<00:02:50.170> another<00:02:50.350> one<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:50.860> like<00:02:50.950> everything

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610

that was wrong like let's go fix it yeah
we<00:02:54.220> went<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.460> EQ<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.910> sound<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.630> they're<00:02:55.780> all

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
we went to EQ the sound so they're all

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.480 
we went to EQ the sound so they're all
EQ<00:02:56.200> they're<00:02:56.440> all<00:02:56.590> like<00:02:56.770> sounds<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.340> you

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
EQ they're all like sounds that you

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.520 

because<00:04:38.150> it's<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:38.510> only<00:04:38.870> beat<00:04:39.080> machine<00:04:39.350> it

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
because it's the only beat machine it

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.350 
because it's the only beat machine it
has<00:04:39.560> a<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:40.190> has<00:04:40.250> actually<00:04:40.700> pitch<00:04:40.850> wheels<00:04:41.060> on<00:04:41.210> it

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
has a it has actually pitch wheels on it

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.780 
has a it has actually pitch wheels on it
my<00:04:41.600> addition<00:04:41.990> wheels<00:04:42.140> on<00:04:42.290> it<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.560> so<00:04:43.520> it<00:04:43.640> gives

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
my addition wheels on it and so it gives
