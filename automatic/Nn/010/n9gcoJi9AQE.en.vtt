but it's kind very difficult to see in

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.890 
but it's kind very difficult to see in
fact<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.150> might<00:01:48.270> even<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.540> been<00:01:48.600> on<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
fact it might even have been on the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.749 
fact it might even have been on the
other<00:01:49.020> side<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:50.250> anyway

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
other side but anyway

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.460 
other side but anyway
generally<00:01:51.509> speaking<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.960> bike<00:01:52.140> has<00:01:52.320> nice

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470

time<00:01:52.680> together<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.369> from<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
time together you can see from the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
time together you can see from the
videos<00:01:53.940> there<00:01:54.150> me<00:01:54.390> riding<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.900> bike<00:01:55.110> starts
