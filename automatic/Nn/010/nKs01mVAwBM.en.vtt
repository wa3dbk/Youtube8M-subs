00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.660 
apps to the iOS and Android market but I
know<00:00:12.330> weird<00:00:12.780> let's<00:00:12.990> get<00:00:13.170> into<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.469> so<00:00:19.670> lately

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
app for that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.660 
app for that
however<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:22.800> Mario<00:00:23.189> that's<00:00:23.550> not

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
however with Mario that's not

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.240

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
looking into making apps as well as

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.730 
looking into making apps as well as
other<00:00:29.640> websites<00:00:30.090> as<00:00:30.210> well<00:00:30.260> now<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.470> there

games<00:00:38.489> via<00:00:38.879> an<00:00:39.000> emulator<00:00:39.600> however<00:00:40.469> these<00:00:40.680> Enya

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
games via an emulator however these Enya

laters<00:00:41.340> don't<00:00:41.579> really<00:00:41.820> optimize<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.570> full

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
laters don't really optimize the full

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.150 
laters don't really optimize the full
amount<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> RAM<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> cell

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
amount of RAM that you have on a cell

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400 
amount of RAM that you have on a cell
phone<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> little<00:00:45.660> glitchy<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
phone and it is a little glitchy and the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
phone and it is a little glitchy and the
controls<00:00:46.950> at<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> bottom<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> screen<00:00:48.360> if

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
controls at the bottom of the screen if

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.850 
controls at the bottom of the screen if
you<00:00:48.570> look<00:00:48.719> really<00:00:48.989> closely<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.620> where<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you look really closely to where the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.279 
you look really closely to where the
thumbs<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.090> little<00:00:51.120> sketchy<00:00:51.750> because

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
thumbs are it's a little sketchy because

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.959 
thumbs are it's a little sketchy because
I<00:00:52.320> mean<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.710> had<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.430> buttons

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
I mean you had to kind of have buttons

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
I mean you had to kind of have buttons
on<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.539> screen<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.890> not

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
on the screen and it's just not

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.340 
on the screen and it's just not
optimized<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.329> phone<00:00:57.480> itself<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
optimized for the phone itself and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.840 
optimized for the phone itself and
that's<00:00:58.590> because<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> wasn't<00:00:59.309> made<00:00:59.579> by<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
that's because it wasn't made by the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.000 
that's because it wasn't made by the
company<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.390> made<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> game<00:01:01.079> itself<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.890> was

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
company that made the game itself it was

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.830 
company that made the game itself it was
made<00:01:02.250> by<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> person<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.390> wanted<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
made by a person that just wanted to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.000 
made by a person that just wanted to
play<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.110> game<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.769> made<00:01:04.920> an

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
play the game and so they made an

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.250 
play the game and so they made an
emulator<00:01:05.489> for<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:06.960> you're<00:01:07.080> seeing

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
emulator for it so what you're seeing

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
emulator for it so what you're seeing
right<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.979> rom<00:01:08.310> being<00:01:08.850> played<00:01:09.119> on

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
right here is just a rom being played on

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
right here is just a rom being played on
an<00:01:09.420> emulator<00:01:09.710> however<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> future

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
an emulator however in the future

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.370 
an emulator however in the future
Nintendo's<00:01:11.970> planning<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.570> trying<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> make<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
Nintendo's planning on trying to make a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.980 
Nintendo's planning on trying to make a
game<00:01:13.680> similar<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.509> they<00:01:15.630> wanted<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
game similar to this but they wanted to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.230 
game similar to this but they wanted to
make<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.229> optimized<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.549> company<00:01:18.030> and

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
make it optimized for the company and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.690 
make it optimized for the company and
the<00:01:18.420> phone<00:01:18.630> itself<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:20.189> exactly<00:01:20.280> does

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the phone itself so what exactly does

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.640 
the phone itself so what exactly does
this<00:01:20.759> mean<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.689> Nintendo<00:01:21.869> made<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> app

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
this mean well if Nintendo made the app

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.460 
this mean well if Nintendo made the app
specifically<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> Nokia<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.270> an<00:01:24.750> iPhone<00:01:25.200> 5s

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
specifically for a Nokia or an iPhone 5s

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.200 
specifically for a Nokia or an iPhone 5s
it<00:01:25.979> would<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.189> able<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> optimize<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> full

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
it would be able to optimize the full

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.520 
it would be able to optimize the full
amount<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> RAM<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.990> iPhone<00:01:28.290> has<00:01:28.439> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
amount of RAM that the iPhone has to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.280 
amount of RAM that the iPhone has to
offer<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:29.460> well<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.790> optimizing<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> a7

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
