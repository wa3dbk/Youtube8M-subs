00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560 

alright<00:00:00.989> so<00:00:01.170> let's<00:00:01.439> take<00:00:01.560> a<00:00:01.620> look<00:00:01.829> at<00:00:01.920> dynamesh

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:02.570 
alright so let's take a look at dynamesh

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.110 
alright so let's take a look at dynamesh
in<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:04.410> case<00:00:04.650> what<00:00:05.069> we're<00:00:05.220> going<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.400> need<00:00:05.819> is

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
in this case what we're going to need is

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.070 
in this case what we're going to need is
some<00:00:06.600> kind<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.960> tool<00:00:07.880> project<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.269> always<00:00:09.750> pick

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
some kind of tool project I always pick

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.810 
some kind of tool project I always pick
on<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.349> cube<00:00:10.710> because<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:11.400> just<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:11.610> much

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
on this cube because it's just so much

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.700 
on this cube because it's just so much
fun<00:00:12.500> turn<00:00:13.500> off<00:00:13.620> perspective<00:00:15.260> this<00:00:16.260> time<00:00:16.529> we're

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
fun turn off perspective this time we're

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.120 
fun turn off perspective this time we're
going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.980> take<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.029> down<00:00:18.150> all<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.449> way<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:19.130> one

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
going to take it down all the way to one

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.310 
going to take it down all the way to one
and<00:00:20.369> then<00:00:21.029> we're<00:00:21.240> going<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.510> reconstruct

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
and then we're going to reconstruct

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.279 
and then we're going to reconstruct
subdivide<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.449> then<00:00:24.449> delete<00:00:24.779> higher<00:00:25.019> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
subdivide and then delete higher and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.870 
subdivide and then delete higher and
then<00:00:26.250> divide<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.510> basically<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.429> nice

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
then divide so basically it's this nice

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.110 
then divide so basically it's this nice
sphere<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:30.990> sphere<00:00:31.679> has<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.489> certain

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
sphere and the sphere has a certain

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.950 
sphere and the sphere has a certain
topology<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.920> topology<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.780> one<00:00:36.780> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
topology and the topology is one that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.810 
topology and the topology is one that
you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.200> mess<00:00:37.410> around<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.920> quite<00:00:38.280> often<00:00:38.489> so

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you can mess around with quite often so

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.060 
you can mess around with quite often so
you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.390> go<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.140> take<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.860> move

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
you can go like this and take the move

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.139 
you can go like this and take the move
elastic<00:00:41.790> tool<00:00:44.059> make<00:00:45.059> your<00:00:45.210> brush<00:00:45.360> bigger<00:00:47.149> but

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
elastic tool make your brush bigger but

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.580 
elastic tool make your brush bigger but
once<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.930> certain<00:00:49.070> part<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.760> this

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
once you get to a certain part like this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.729 
once you get to a certain part like this
you'll<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> poly<00:00:53.460> frame<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
you'll see that the poly frame on it is

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.130 
you'll see that the poly frame on it is
very<00:00:55.739> stretched<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.370> very<00:00:57.000> oblong<00:00:57.539> now<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
very stretched out very oblong now you

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
very stretched out very oblong now you
could<00:00:58.530> add<00:00:58.770> more<00:00:58.800> Polly's<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.910> that's<00:01:00.329> true

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
could add more Polly's that that's true

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.860 
could add more Polly's that that's true
I<00:01:00.899> could<00:01:01.739> hit<00:01:02.129> divide<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:03.480> I'll<00:01:03.629> have

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
I could hit divide and then I'll have

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.950 
I could hit divide and then I'll have
even<00:01:04.229> more<00:01:04.409> polygons<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.299> then<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.390> could<00:01:06.570> get

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
even more polygons and then I could get

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.850 
even more polygons and then I could get
away<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.170> some<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:07.740> crazy<00:01:08.490> shapes<00:01:09.710> but<00:01:10.710> at

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
away with some more crazy shapes but at

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.070 
away with some more crazy shapes but at
one<00:01:11.010> point<00:01:11.040> you're<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.820> make<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.869> so

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
one point you're going to make it so

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.530 
one point you're going to make it so
that<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:14.159> wouldn't<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.490> able<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.700> add<00:01:14.880> legs<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that you wouldn't be able to add legs to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.499 
that you wouldn't be able to add legs to
this<00:01:15.689> character<00:01:16.140> there's<00:01:16.590> no<00:01:16.710> doubt<00:01:19.520> okay<00:01:20.520> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
this character there's no doubt okay so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.539 
this character there's no doubt okay so
that's<00:01:21.840> where<00:01:22.020> dynamesh<00:01:22.530> comes<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.040> what<00:01:23.430> if

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that's where dynamesh comes in what if

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.859 
that's where dynamesh comes in what if
you<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.060> go<00:01:24.270> past<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.979> normal<00:01:26.750> now<00:01:27.750> as

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
you want to go past the normal now as

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.640 
you want to go past the normal now as
long<00:01:28.020> as<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.259> use<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.650> elastic<00:01:29.189> move<00:01:29.490> tool<00:01:30.650> this

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
long as I use the elastic move tool this

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.609 
long as I use the elastic move tool this
mess<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.340> okay<00:01:33.090> anytime<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> add<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> new<00:01:34.409> level

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
mess out okay anytime I add a new level

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.700 
mess out okay anytime I add a new level
it<00:01:34.920> should<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.220> alright<00:01:38.720> but<00:01:39.720> let's<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:40.470> into

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it should be alright but let's go into

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.550 
it should be alright but let's go into
dynamesh<00:01:41.100> I'll<00:01:41.340> show<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.579> how<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.210> works<00:01:42.560> so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
dynamesh I'll show you how that works so

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.030 
dynamesh I'll show you how that works so
we'll<00:01:44.520> take<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.939> mesh<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.710> first<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.979> just

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
we'll take this mesh and first I'm just

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.670 
we'll take this mesh and first I'm just
going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.729> now<00:01:48.630> I'll<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:48.960> go<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
going to now I'll just go in here and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.870 
going to now I'll just go in here and
blur<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.840> I'm<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.649> into

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
blur it and I'm going to go into

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.310 
blur it and I'm going to go into
dynamesh<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.299> don't<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.079> want<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
dynamesh but I don't think I want to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.310 
dynamesh but I don't think I want to
start<00:01:55.560> with<00:01:55.649> 128<00:01:56.490> even<00:01:57.450> though<00:01:57.630> i'll<00:01:57.990> show<00:01:58.229> you

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
start with 128 even though i'll show you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.889 
start with 128 even though i'll show you
the<00:01:58.500> advantages<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.189> maybe<00:01:59.700> going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.180> 128

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the advantages of maybe going to 128

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.440 
the advantages of maybe going to 128
right<00:02:01.049> off<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> bat<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.340> we'll<00:02:02.520> go<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.820> 24

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
right off the bat so we'll go like 24

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.059 
right off the bat so we'll go like 24
and<00:02:03.719> dynamesh<00:02:06.380> now<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> take<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
and dynamesh now it's going to take the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.850 
and dynamesh now it's going to take the
lowest<00:02:08.520> level<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.330> fight<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.470> hit

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
lowest level so to fight that I just hit

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.820 
lowest level so to fight that I just hit
undo<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.520> delete<00:02:12.030> lower<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:13.080> now<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.559 

we'll<00:02:16.830> go<00:02:16.980> with<00:02:17.129> 128<00:02:19.370> so<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.610> see<00:02:20.790> there's

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
we'll go with 128 so you can see there's

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.530 
we'll go with 128 so you can see there's
a<00:02:21.629> lot<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.840> polygons<00:02:22.379> here<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:24.180> might<00:02:24.390> be

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
a lot of polygons here and that might be

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.830 
a lot of polygons here and that might be
a<00:02:24.569> little<00:02:24.810> difficult<00:02:25.080> for<00:02:25.590> some<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.040> manage<00:02:26.840> so

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
a little difficult for some to manage so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.600 
a little difficult for some to manage so
messing<00:02:28.590> wrong<00:02:28.769> with<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.010> resolution<00:02:29.550> a

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
messing wrong with the resolution a

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.550 
messing wrong with the resolution a
little<00:02:29.879> bit<00:02:30.030> keep<00:02:30.450> your<00:02:30.690> hand<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.230> undo

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
little bit keep your hand on the undo

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.110 
little bit keep your hand on the undo
until<00:02:32.130> you're<00:02:32.250> happy<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:35.640> looks<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:36.000> lot

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
until you're happy that looks a lot

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.400 
until you're happy that looks a lot
better<00:02:37.430> now<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:39.180> idea<00:02:39.540> here<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.019> get<00:02:40.380> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
better now the the idea here is to get a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.140 
better now the the idea here is to get a
base<00:02:41.160> mesh<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.569> can<00:02:42.720> sculpt<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:44.150> so

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
base mesh that you can sculpt on so

00:02:45.150 --> 00:03:02.090 
base mesh that you can sculpt on so
let's<00:02:45.420> go<00:02:45.540> insane<00:02:45.930> start<00:02:46.790> just

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.830 

see<00:03:02.820> no<00:03:02.970> matter<00:03:03.090> what<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.420> do<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:05.070> form<00:03:05.840> stays

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
see no matter what I do the form stays

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:19.010 
see no matter what I do the form stays
pretty<00:03:07.170> good

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.870 

alright<00:03:19.680> at<00:03:19.770> some<00:03:19.950> point<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.340> should<00:03:20.370> pick<00:03:20.700> an

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
alright at some point you should pick an

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:33.670 
alright at some point you should pick an
angle<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.980> just<00:03:22.980> kind<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.220> go<00:03:23.370> with<00:03:23.400> it

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.099 

and<00:03:34.129> of<00:03:34.340> course<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.819> goal<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.420> any<00:03:35.569> ZBrush

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
and of course the goal of any ZBrush

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.160 
and of course the goal of any ZBrush
project<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:37.129> deals<00:03:37.609> with<00:03:37.730> dynamesh<00:03:38.239> is<00:03:38.480> to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
project that deals with dynamesh is to

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.039 
project that deals with dynamesh is to
make<00:03:39.319> something<00:03:39.879> amazingly<00:03:40.879> weird<00:03:41.269> and<00:03:41.540> try

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
make something amazingly weird and try

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.380 
make something amazingly weird and try
to<00:03:42.109> form<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.680> into<00:03:42.799> some<00:03:43.609> kind<00:03:43.819> of<00:03:43.969> vehicle

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
to form it into some kind of vehicle

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.539 
to form it into some kind of vehicle
that<00:03:45.079> that's<00:03:45.439> usually<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.010> premise<00:03:46.400> of

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
that that's usually the premise of

00:03:46.549 --> 00:04:00.490 
that that's usually the premise of
things

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:17.099 

mine<00:04:01.500> could<00:04:01.739> be<00:04:01.860> a<00:04:01.890> skull

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.379 

so<00:04:17.530> when<00:04:17.829> I<00:04:17.859> get<00:04:18.069> to<00:04:18.219> a<00:04:18.250> point<00:04:18.519> where<00:04:18.669> things

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
so when I get to a point where things

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.719 
so when I get to a point where things
are<00:04:19.599> starting<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.049> get<00:04:20.199> a<00:04:20.259> little<00:04:20.409> wonky<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:21.189> can

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
are starting to get a little wonky I can

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.550 
are starting to get a little wonky I can
go<00:04:21.909> over<00:04:22.000> here<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.360> hold<00:04:22.659> ctrl<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.110> click<00:04:23.439> and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
go over here and hold ctrl and click and

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.320 
go over here and hold ctrl and click and
drag<00:04:23.710> down<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:25.419> will<00:04:25.599> Ramesh<00:04:26.169> it<00:04:26.409> and

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
drag down that will Ramesh it and

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:36.149 
drag down that will Ramesh it and
equalize<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:31.860> mesh<00:04:34.469> and<00:04:35.469> you<00:04:35.740> can<00:04:35.889> see<00:04:36.009> no

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
equalize the mesh and you can see no

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.830 
equalize the mesh and you can see no
matter<00:04:36.280> what<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.550> do<00:04:36.669> I<00:04:36.819> can<00:04:37.210> pretty<00:04:37.360> much<00:04:37.479> save

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
matter what I do I can pretty much save

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.589 
matter what I do I can pretty much save
myself<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.620> just<00:04:39.000> equalize<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.030> mesh<00:04:42.599> all

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
myself and just equalize the mesh all

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.450 
myself and just equalize the mesh all
right<00:04:43.840> now<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:45.159> moral<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.639> story<00:04:45.669> is<00:04:46.030> this

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
right now the moral of the story is this

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.580 
right now the moral of the story is this
now<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:48.729> can<00:04:48.969> night<00:04:49.090> not<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.539> can't<00:04:50.050> go<00:04:50.199> back<00:04:50.529> I

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
now I can night not I can't go back I

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.980 
now I can night not I can't go back I
can't<00:04:51.069> reconstruct<00:04:51.460> subdivide<00:04:52.300> because

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
can't reconstruct subdivide because

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.189 
can't reconstruct subdivide because
really<00:04:53.439> there<00:04:54.400> is<00:04:54.580> none<00:04:54.909> that<00:04:55.419> it's<00:04:55.990> a

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
really there is none that it's a

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.100 
really there is none that it's a
triangle<00:04:56.830> at<00:04:57.039> that<00:04:57.279> point<00:04:57.629> so<00:04:58.629> just<00:04:58.960> be<00:04:59.080> very

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
triangle at that point so just be very

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.230 
triangle at that point so just be very
careful<00:04:59.379> about<00:04:59.889> what<00:05:00.340> you<00:05:00.370> choose<00:05:00.699> as<00:05:00.909> far<00:05:01.120> as

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
careful about what you choose as far as

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.649 
careful about what you choose as far as
resolution<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:02.020> concerned<00:05:03.180> because<00:05:04.180> anything

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:04.659 
resolution is concerned because anything

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:08.100 
resolution is concerned because anything
that<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:05.110> choose<00:05:05.789> that's<00:05:07.020> basically<00:05:08.020> how

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
that you choose that's basically how

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.189 
that you choose that's basically how
it's<00:05:08.379> going<00:05:08.500> to<00:05:08.529> go<00:05:08.669> now<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:10.810> could<00:05:11.020> take

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
it's going to go now you could take

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.679 
it's going to go now you could take
Dinah<00:05:11.439> mention<00:05:11.830> turn<00:05:12.009> it<00:05:12.159> off<00:05:12.279> hit<00:05:13.240> dynamesh

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:13.689 
Dinah mention turn it off hit dynamesh

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:17.670 
Dinah mention turn it off hit dynamesh
again<00:05:14.819> it<00:05:15.819> but<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.479> notice<00:05:16.779> you<00:05:16.930> can't<00:05:17.169> up<00:05:17.409> the

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
again it but you notice you can't up the

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.369 
again it but you notice you can't up the
polygons<00:05:18.189> you're<00:05:18.699> stuck<00:05:19.029> at<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.379> original

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:20.379 
polygons you're stuck at the original

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.430 
polygons you're stuck at the original
resolution<00:05:20.710> that<00:05:21.129> you<00:05:21.279> chose<00:05:21.639> here<00:05:22.300> so<00:05:23.139> a<00:05:23.169> way

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
resolution that you chose here so a way

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.709 
resolution that you chose here so a way
around<00:05:23.589> that<00:05:23.889> is<00:05:24.250> to<00:05:24.339> make<00:05:24.969> it<00:05:25.089> a<00:05:25.180> poly<00:05:25.419> mesh

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
around that is to make it a poly mesh

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:34.439 
around that is to make it a poly mesh
and<00:05:27.360> then<00:05:28.360> go<00:05:28.750> back<00:05:28.930> into<00:05:31.080> dynamesh<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:33.449> then

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
and then go back into dynamesh and then

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:39.749 
and then go back into dynamesh and then
you<00:05:34.599> can<00:05:34.750> up<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:34.990> resolution<00:05:35.800> there<00:05:38.759> so

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
you can up the resolution there so

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:47.450 
you can up the resolution there so
that's<00:05:39.969> that's<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.419> great<00:05:40.750> way<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:40.960> fix<00:05:41.259> that

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.159 

now<00:05:47.819> what<00:05:48.030> if<00:05:48.120> you<00:05:48.240> wanted<00:05:48.509> to<00:05:48.569> go<00:05:48.660> back<00:05:48.840> down

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
now what if you wanted to go back down

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.590 
now what if you wanted to go back down
levels<00:05:49.620> so<00:05:49.880> let's<00:05:50.880> say<00:05:51.030> I<00:05:51.090> wanted<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.449> make<00:05:51.539> a

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
levels so let's say I wanted to make a

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.089 
levels so let's say I wanted to make a
lower<00:05:51.900> level<00:05:52.139> of<00:05:52.470> this<00:05:53.090> you<00:05:54.090> could<00:05:54.270> do<00:05:54.449> that

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
lower level of this you could do that

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:01.909 
lower level of this you could do that
first<00:05:56.099> off<00:05:56.340> go<00:05:57.030> over<00:05:57.240> here<00:05:57.479> to<00:06:00.620> make<00:06:01.620> a<00:06:01.650> poly

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
first off go over here to make a poly

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.860 
first off go over here to make a poly
mesh<00:06:02.160> and<00:06:02.900> then<00:06:03.900> take<00:06:04.169> this<00:06:04.380> poly<00:06:04.710> mesh<00:06:05.009> and<00:06:05.870> do

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
mesh and then take this poly mesh and do

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.980 
mesh and then take this poly mesh and do
a<00:06:10.160> decimation<00:06:11.160> master<00:06:11.729> so<00:06:12.120> pre-process

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
a decimation master so pre-process

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.890 
a decimation master so pre-process
current<00:06:15.050> then<00:06:16.050> a<00:06:17.150> decimation<00:06:18.150> master<00:06:18.630> you<00:06:18.750> can

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
current then a decimation master you can

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.689 
current then a decimation master you can
choose<00:06:19.110> like<00:06:19.319> maybe<00:06:19.560> one<00:06:19.860> percent<00:06:20.250> decimation

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
choose like maybe one percent decimation

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.320 
choose like maybe one percent decimation
and<00:06:21.320> decimate<00:06:22.340> so<00:06:23.340> there<00:06:23.520> we<00:06:23.639> go<00:06:23.669> I<00:06:24.000> have<00:06:24.150> now<00:06:24.300> a

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
and decimate so there we go I have now a

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.740 
and decimate so there we go I have now a
lower<00:06:24.750> level<00:06:25.099> resolution<00:06:26.099> mesh<00:06:26.509> based<00:06:27.509> on

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
lower level resolution mesh based on

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:37.070 
lower level resolution mesh based on
that<00:06:27.900> design<00:06:33.380> cool<00:06:34.490> so<00:06:35.490> great<00:06:35.820> for<00:06:36.080> making

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
that design cool so great for making

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.200 
that design cool so great for making
little<00:06:37.440> pieces<00:06:37.740> of<00:06:37.919> armor<00:06:38.340> and<00:06:38.810> whatnot<00:06:39.810> but

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
little pieces of armor and whatnot but

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.890 
little pieces of armor and whatnot but
remember<00:06:42.210> that<00:06:42.840> when<00:06:43.199> you<00:06:43.320> go<00:06:43.530> to<00:06:43.590> divide<00:06:44.159> this

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
remember that when you go to divide this

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.439 
remember that when you go to divide this
it's<00:06:45.900> going<00:06:46.229> to<00:06:46.319> look<00:06:46.470> a<00:06:46.560> little<00:06:46.680> wonky<00:06:47.449> so

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
it's going to look a little wonky so

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.570 
it's going to look a little wonky so
what<00:06:48.630> I<00:06:48.659> would<00:06:48.780> do<00:06:49.110> is<00:06:49.349> since<00:06:50.159> it's<00:06:50.370> already

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
what I would do is since it's already

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.180 
what I would do is since it's already
kind<00:06:51.000> of<00:06:51.060> smooth<00:06:51.449> is<00:06:51.690> take<00:06:52.229> off<00:06:52.440> smooth<00:06:52.889> and

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
kind of smooth is take off smooth and

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.100 
kind of smooth is take off smooth and
divide<00:06:53.970> it<00:06:56.240> and<00:06:57.240> then<00:06:57.419> just<00:06:57.690> hit<00:06:57.810> it<00:06:57.870> with<00:06:58.080> a

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
divide it and then just hit it with a

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:05.020 
divide it and then just hit it with a
polish<00:06:59.570> and<00:07:00.800> you<00:07:01.800> can<00:07:01.979> find<00:07:02.340> polish<00:07:02.820> under<00:07:03.300> the

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
polish and you can find polish under the

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:11.810 
polish and you can find polish under the
deformation<00:07:08.990> there<00:07:09.990> we<00:07:10.080> go<00:07:10.199> say<00:07:10.650> so<00:07:11.610> now<00:07:11.759> you

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
deformation there we go say so now you

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.930 
deformation there we go say so now you
have<00:07:11.969> levels<00:07:12.539> that<00:07:12.690> you<00:07:12.750> can<00:07:12.990> sculpt<00:07:13.409> on<00:07:13.500> still

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.939 

what<00:07:17.940> about<00:07:18.030> you<00:07:18.270> vs<00:07:18.539> right<00:07:19.349> you're<00:07:19.740> going<00:07:19.830> to

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:19.949 
what about you vs right you're going to

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:22.939 
what about you vs right you're going to
ask<00:07:20.070> about<00:07:20.310> those<00:07:20.520> you<00:07:21.300> can<00:07:21.539> do<00:07:21.719> you<00:07:21.870> v's<00:07:22.110> they

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:22.949 
ask about those you can do you v's they

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:28.450 
ask about those you can do you v's they
are<00:07:23.099> in<00:07:23.250> here<00:07:23.460> UV<00:07:23.880> master<00:07:24.360> you<00:07:25.349> can<00:07:25.530> say<00:07:26.479> unwrap

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
are in here UV master you can say unwrap

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.420 
are in here UV master you can say unwrap
and<00:07:29.460> now<00:07:29.940> if<00:07:30.630> you<00:07:30.840> look<00:07:30.990> over<00:07:31.169> here<00:07:31.259> under<00:07:32.219> UV

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430 
and now if you look over here under UV

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.010 
and now if you look over here under UV
map<00:07:33.050> you<00:07:34.050> can<00:07:34.229> go<00:07:34.500> more<00:07:34.830> few<00:07:35.099> V<00:07:35.719> and<00:07:36.719> this<00:07:36.750> will

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 
map you can go more few V and this will

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.510 
map you can go more few V and this will
show<00:07:37.229> you<00:07:37.289> what<00:07:37.530> the<00:07:37.680> UVs<00:07:38.039> look<00:07:38.340> like

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 
show you what the UVs look like

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.290 
show you what the UVs look like
stretched<00:07:39.120> out<00:07:39.389> just<00:07:39.930> hit<00:07:40.110> frame<00:07:40.789> it's<00:07:41.789> a<00:07:42.120> big

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300 
stretched out just hit frame it's a big

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:49.070 
stretched out just hit frame it's a big
huge<00:07:42.539> hot<00:07:42.750> mess<00:07:42.990> but<00:07:43.680> it<00:07:44.009> is<00:07:44.280> unwrapped<00:07:44.729> it<00:07:48.080> was

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 
huge hot mess but it is unwrapped it was

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.180 
huge hot mess but it is unwrapped it was
a<00:07:49.110> pretty<00:07:49.349> hot<00:07:49.590> mess<00:07:50.810> version<00:07:51.810> of<00:07:52.020> a<00:07:52.530> will<00:07:52.919> just

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.190 
a pretty hot mess version of a will just

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.279 
a pretty hot mess version of a will just
call<00:07:53.340> a<00:07:53.490> vertebra<00:07:54.090> there<00:07:54.419> we<00:07:54.570> go<00:07:54.719> it<00:07:55.110> looks

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:55.289 
call a vertebra there we go it looks

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:57.649 
call a vertebra there we go it looks
like<00:07:55.349> a<00:07:55.440> vertebra<00:07:55.909> so<00:07:56.909> that's<00:07:57.150> a<00:07:57.300> little<00:07:57.389> bit

00:07:57.649 --> 00:07:57.659 
like a vertebra so that's a little bit

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:01.340 
like a vertebra so that's a little bit
about<00:07:57.870> decimation<00:07:58.529> or<00:07:58.800> dynamesh<00:07:59.870> how<00:08:00.870> you<00:08:00.930> can

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:01.350 
about decimation or dynamesh how you can

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.470 
about decimation or dynamesh how you can
grade<00:08:01.560> it<00:08:01.650> with<00:08:01.800> that<00:08:02.070> summation<00:08:02.370> master<00:08:03.060> how

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:03.480 
grade it with that summation master how

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.450 
grade it with that summation master how
you<00:08:03.540> can<00:08:03.870> put<00:08:04.080> you<00:08:04.200> v's<00:08:04.440> on<00:08:04.680> it<00:08:04.860> still<00:08:05.130> and

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 
you can put you v's on it still and

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.920 
you can put you v's on it still and
still<00:08:06.270> have<00:08:06.390> a<00:08:06.420> usable<00:08:06.870> mash<00:08:07.520> loosely<00:08:08.930> talked

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:09.930 
still have a usable mash loosely talked

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.700 
still have a usable mash loosely talked
about<00:08:10.640> usable<00:08:11.640> mesh<00:08:11.820> but<00:08:12.300> still<00:08:12.750> good<00:08:13.470> to<00:08:13.560> go

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:13.710 
about usable mesh but still good to go

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.490 
about usable mesh but still good to go
enjoy
