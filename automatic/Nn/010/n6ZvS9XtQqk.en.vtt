yellow i move away from the panel the
light<00:01:26.729> turns<00:01:27.000> red<00:01:27.619> that's<00:01:28.619> indicating<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
light turns red that's indicating that

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.840 
light turns red that's indicating that
there<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> no<00:01:30.360> sun<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.189> there<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> enough

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
there is no sun and then there is enough

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.620 
there is no sun and then there is enough
Sun<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> charging<00:01:34.380> voltage<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.240> let's<00:01:36.450> look

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
Sun for a charging voltage so let's look

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.950 
Sun for a charging voltage so let's look
at<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.990> little<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.560> closely<00:01:38.869> here<00:01:39.869> you

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
at this a little more closely here you

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.460 
at this a little more closely here you
have<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> multimeter<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.979> DC<00:01:43.369> as<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.320> see

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
have a multimeter on DC as you can see

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.980 
have a multimeter on DC as you can see
we<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.649> twelve<00:01:47.040> point<00:01:47.430> five<00:01:47.570> bolts<00:01:48.570> right

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
we have twelve point five bolts right

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.240 
we have twelve point five bolts right
now<00:01:49.259> coming<00:01:50.220> from<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:50.909> solar<00:01:51.420> panel<00:01:52.250> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
now coming from that one solar panel the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.730 
now coming from that one solar panel the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.630 
pain always rated for 17 point 4 volts I
know<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> hundred<00:01:56.520> percent

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
know it's not a hundred percent

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.020 
know it's not a hundred percent

and<00:02:12.299> charged<00:02:13.079> this<00:02:13.379> one<00:02:13.829> series<00:02:14.670> 24<00:02:15.359> battery

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.750 

so<00:02:23.850> solar<00:02:24.120> works<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:25.100> mean<00:02:26.100> if<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.640> going

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
so solar works I mean if this is going

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.490 
so solar works I mean if this is going
to<00:02:26.850> work<00:02:27.030> indoors<00:02:29.450> again<00:02:30.450> east<00:02:30.990> facing<00:02:31.290> window

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
to work indoors again east facing window

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.370 
to work indoors again east facing window
overcast<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:34.220> cheaper<00:02:35.220> panels<00:02:35.730> then<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.720> quality

system quality panels south-facing are

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.040
