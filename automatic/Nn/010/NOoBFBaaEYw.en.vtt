this microphone for voiceovers in the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.760 
this microphone for voiceovers in the
past<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.930> had<00:02:01.049> some<00:02:01.259> awesome<00:02:01.439> ideas

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
past because I had some awesome ideas

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.249 
past because I had some awesome ideas
for<00:02:02.219> videos<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.149> know<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.600> it

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
for videos but you know it's it

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.260 
for videos but you know it's it
overloaded<00:02:05.100> microphones<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.149> if

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
overloaded microphones like this like if

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.119 
overloaded microphones like this like if
I<00:02:06.390> did<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> dog<00:02:06.869> bark<00:02:07.320> or<00:02:07.500> something<00:02:07.829> like<00:02:07.920> that
