00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.529 
really streaky so I'm just gonna start
by<00:00:42.969> applying<00:00:43.570> it<00:00:43.840> on<00:00:43.989> my<00:00:44.170> little<00:00:44.410> finger<00:00:48.539> I'm

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
by applying it on my little finger I'm

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.209 
by applying it on my little finger I'm
just<00:00:49.719> dipping<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.079> brush<00:00:50.260> in<00:00:50.500> and<00:00:50.710> wiping<00:00:51.070> off

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
just dipping the brush in and wiping off

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.250 
just dipping the brush in and wiping off
one<00:00:51.519> side<00:00:51.789> of<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.000> brush<00:00:52.179> and<00:00:52.809> then<00:00:52.929> I'm<00:00:53.079> going

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
one side of the brush and then I'm going

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
one side of the brush and then I'm going
to<00:00:53.320> apply<00:00:53.440> it<00:00:53.620> down<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.160> nail<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.920> right<00:01:00.100> you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
to apply it down the nail all right you

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.029 
to apply it down the nail all right you
can<00:01:00.519> see<00:01:00.820> hopefully<00:01:01.719> you<00:01:01.870> can<00:01:02.050> see<00:01:02.469> but<00:01:02.859> that

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
can see hopefully you can see but that

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.040 
can see hopefully you can see but that
is<00:01:03.219> very<00:01:03.640> strictly<00:01:04.089> especially<00:01:04.600> towards<00:01:04.989> the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
is very strictly especially towards the

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.569 
is very strictly especially towards the
end<00:01:05.550> know<00:01:06.550> when<00:01:07.030> you've<00:01:07.180> applied<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.400> it

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
end know when you've applied it and it

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.550 
end know when you've applied it and it
starts<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:10.000> go<00:01:10.119> streaky<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.689> temptation<00:01:11.320> is

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
starts to go streaky the temptation is

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.429 
starts to go streaky the temptation is
to<00:01:11.590> keep<00:01:12.520> going<00:01:12.579> over<00:01:13.030> it<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.299> over<00:01:13.540> it<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:14.140> to

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
to keep going over it and over it and to

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.100 
to keep going over it and over it and to
try<00:01:14.619> and<00:01:14.650> make<00:01:14.799> it<00:01:15.070> non<00:01:15.340> streaky<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.210> way<00:01:16.390> but

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
try and make it non streaky that way but

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.149 
try and make it non streaky that way but
you're<00:01:17.200> actually<00:01:17.530> only<00:01:17.619> going<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:17.950> make<00:01:18.009> it

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
you're actually only going to make it

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.700 
you're actually only going to make it
worse<00:01:18.369> so<00:01:20.729> what<00:01:21.729> I<00:01:21.759> suggest<00:01:21.970> today<00:01:22.509> is<00:01:22.960> try<00:01:23.649> to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
worse so what I suggest today is try to

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.149 
worse so what I suggest today is try to
only<00:01:24.040> apply<00:01:24.780> three<00:01:25.780> strokes<00:01:26.320> of<00:01:26.560> nail<00:01:26.770> polish

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
only apply three strokes of nail polish

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.270 
only apply three strokes of nail polish
right<00:01:28.000> that's<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.390> recommended<00:01:28.899> I<00:01:29.290> mind<00:01:29.619> but

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
right that's the recommended I mind but

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.090 
right that's the recommended I mind but
it's<00:01:30.670> really<00:01:30.970> hard<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.450> do<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.689> in<00:01:31.869> three<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
it's really hard to do it in three so

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.870 
it's really hard to do it in three so
what<00:01:33.310> I<00:01:33.340> try<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.850> do<00:01:34.060> is<00:01:34.240> no<00:01:34.450> more<00:01:34.659> than<00:01:34.840> five<00:01:35.880> so

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
what I try to do is no more than five so

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.499 
what I try to do is no more than five so
one<00:01:37.299> die<00:01:37.540> in<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.689> middle

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
one die in the middle

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.690 
one die in the middle
ideally<00:01:40.509> one<00:01:40.750> on<00:01:40.899> each<00:01:41.049> side<00:01:41.219> but<00:01:42.219> you're

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
ideally one on each side but you're

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.609 
ideally one on each side but you're
gonna<00:01:42.880> really<00:01:43.630> need<00:01:43.930> a<00:01:43.990> bit<00:01:44.200> more<00:01:44.229> than<00:01:44.500> that

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
gonna really need a bit more than that

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.730 
gonna really need a bit more than that
so<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:46.509> can<00:01:46.780> see<00:01:47.049> again<00:01:47.500> that<00:01:47.799> is<00:01:48.700> streaky<00:01:49.740> so

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
so you can see again that is streaky so

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.190 
so you can see again that is streaky so
don't<00:01:51.280> do<00:01:51.399> any<00:01:51.610> more<00:01:51.850> than<00:01:52.030> five<00:01:52.360> strokes<00:01:52.960> and

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
don't do any more than five strokes and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.090 
don't do any more than five strokes and
then<00:01:53.439> leave<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:54.100> dry<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:56.560> hopefully

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
then leave it to dry and then hopefully

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.770 
then leave it to dry and then hopefully
when<00:01:57.399> you<00:01:57.430> go<00:01:57.640> back<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.000> apply<00:01:58.270> your<00:01:58.420> next

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
when you go back and apply your next

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:08.440 
when you go back and apply your next
coat<00:01:58.990> that's<00:01:59.320> not<00:01:59.560> going<00:01:59.859> to<00:01:59.950> look<00:02:00.130> as<00:02:00.359> streaky

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.420 

try<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.660> get<00:02:09.869> too<00:02:10.259> much<00:02:10.289> polish<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.250> your

you have too little you're gonna have to
go<00:02:16.620> back<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:17.130> read<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:18.420> really<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:19.020> you

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
that's a bigger nail so it's just

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.630 
that's a bigger nail so it's just
learned<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.379> bit<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.620> common<00:03:11.950> sense<00:03:12.129> and<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.489> bit

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
learned a bit of common sense and a bit

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.050 
learned a bit of common sense and a bit
of<00:03:12.730> judgment<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.980> now<00:03:15.129> the<00:03:15.189> little<00:03:15.670> finger

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
of judgment so now the little finger

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.390 
of judgment so now the little finger
should<00:03:16.209> be<00:03:16.269> dry<00:03:16.569> by<00:03:16.810> now<00:03:17.040> or<00:03:18.040> at<00:03:18.099> least<00:03:18.280> that

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
should be dry by now or at least that

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.800 
should be dry by now or at least that
straily<00:03:18.730> enough<00:03:18.909> for<00:03:19.090> me<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.299> start<00:03:19.359> applying

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
straily enough for me to start applying

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.020 
straily enough for me to start applying
the<00:03:20.019> next<00:03:20.319> coat<00:03:20.579> normally<00:03:21.579> by<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.790> time

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
the next coat normally by the time

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.300 
the next coat normally by the time
you've<00:03:22.180> done<00:03:22.209> ten<00:03:22.659> nails<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.739> first<00:03:24.010> nail

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310

will be ready for the second cooked so

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.099 
will be ready for the second cooked so
again<00:03:27.879> I'm<00:03:28.000> just<00:03:28.209> dipping<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.510> brush<00:03:28.659> in<00:03:28.900> I'm

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
again I'm just dipping the brush in I'm

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.710 
again I'm just dipping the brush in I'm
wiping<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.620> off<00:03:29.739> on<00:03:30.280> one<00:03:30.489> side<00:03:30.790> I'm<00:03:31.359> just<00:03:31.540> going

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
wiping it off on one side I'm just going

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:45.440 
wiping it off on one side I'm just going
to<00:03:31.750> apply<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:32.049> straight<00:03:32.290> down<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.859> nail

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.540 

and<00:03:46.050> I<00:03:46.140> think<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.440> some<00:03:46.590> like<00:03:46.920> four<00:03:47.160> strokes

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
and I think of some like four strokes

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.120 
and I think of some like four strokes
there<00:03:47.849> and<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.050> see<00:03:49.349> that<00:03:49.709> it's<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.950> lot

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
there and you can see that it's a lot

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.080 
there and you can see that it's a lot
less<00:03:50.310> streaky<00:03:50.819> no<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:53.040> fact<00:03:53.250> it's<00:03:53.489> not<00:03:53.670> streaky

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
less streaky no in fact it's not streaky

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.949

at all compared to the nail beside it so

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.940
