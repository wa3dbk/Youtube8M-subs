parents and they say considering the

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.420 
parents and they say considering the
difficulty<00:00:11.410> of<00:00:11.440> getting<00:00:11.890> a<00:00:11.980> job<00:00:12.190> these<00:00:12.370> days

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
difficulty of getting a job these days

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.070

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
and the amount of student debt that you

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.019 
and the amount of student debt that you
would<00:00:14.230> accumulate<00:00:14.559> is<00:00:15.010> it<00:00:15.490> really<00:00:15.790> worth

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
would accumulate is it really worth

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.189 
would accumulate is it really worth
going<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.480> university<00:00:17.080> at<00:00:17.170> all<00:00:17.380> I<00:00:18.900> think<00:00:19.900> so

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
going to university at all I think so

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.540 
going to university at all I think so
but<00:00:20.680> maybe<00:00:20.980> not<00:00:21.310> for<00:00:21.369> everyone<00:00:22.060> I<00:00:22.510> think<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
but maybe not for everyone I think the

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.930 
but maybe not for everyone I think the
greatest<00:00:25.090> gift<00:00:26.160> parents<00:00:27.160> can<00:00:27.369> give<00:00:27.670> their

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:27.940 
greatest gift parents can give their

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.380 
greatest gift parents can give their
children<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:29.560> an<00:00:29.740> education<00:00:30.369> I<00:00:30.609> think<00:00:31.060> in

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
children is an education I think in

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.220 
children is an education I think in
education<00:00:31.570> if<00:00:32.379> you<00:00:33.539> spend<00:00:34.539> the<00:00:34.720> money<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.140> the

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
education if you spend the money and the

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.410 
education if you spend the money and the
person<00:00:35.590> has<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:36.130> ambition<00:00:36.399> and<00:00:36.640> they<00:00:37.030> learn

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
person has the ambition and they learn

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.740 
person has the ambition and they learn
how<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:37.989> use<00:00:38.440> their<00:00:38.800> minds<00:00:39.340> they<00:00:40.030> will<00:00:40.300> find

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
how to use their minds they will find

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.770 
how to use their minds they will find
the<00:00:41.200> path<00:00:41.380> it<00:00:41.950> may<00:00:42.370> not<00:00:42.579> be<00:00:42.820> there<00:00:43.090> from<00:00:43.570> day

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
the path it may not be there from day

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.170 
the path it may not be there from day
one<00:00:44.050> but<00:00:44.649> you'll<00:00:44.920> eventually<00:00:45.250> find<00:00:45.730> that<00:00:45.969> path

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
one but you'll eventually find that path

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.090 
one but you'll eventually find that path
I<00:00:46.390> don't<00:00:46.510> look<00:00:46.809> back<00:00:47.050> at<00:00:47.350> all<00:00:47.649> the<00:00:47.680> debt<00:00:48.070> I

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
I don't look back at all the debt I

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.970 
I don't look back at all the debt I
incurred<00:00:48.640> in<00:00:49.629> getting<00:00:50.170> my<00:00:50.260> education<00:00:50.350> with

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
incurred in getting my education with

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.810 
incurred in getting my education with
one<00:00:51.399> day<00:00:51.879> of<00:00:52.149> regret<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:52.690> it<00:00:52.840> took<00:00:53.020> me<00:00:53.430> over<00:00:54.430> a

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
one day of regret and it took me over a

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.690 
one day of regret and it took me over a
decade<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.450> pay<00:00:55.690> it<00:00:55.780> back<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:57.010> I<00:00:57.219> never

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
decade to pay it back but I never

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.090 
decade to pay it back but I never
regretted<00:00:58.180> it<00:00:58.329> our<00:00:58.930> families<00:00:59.379> frightened<00:01:00.010> of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
regretted it our families frightened of

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.160 
regretted it our families frightened of
the<00:01:00.219> debt<00:01:00.640> that's<00:01:00.910> left<00:01:01.570> at<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:01.840> end<00:01:01.960> of<00:01:02.050> a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
the debt that's left at the end of a

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.959 
the debt that's left at the end of a
university<00:01:02.829> degree<00:01:02.949> now<00:01:03.219> with<00:01:03.370> tuition<00:01:03.550> fees

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
university degree now with tuition fees

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.749 
university degree now with tuition fees
as<00:01:04.210> well<00:01:04.360> as<00:01:04.479> your<00:01:04.659> maintenance<00:01:05.409> costs<00:01:05.740> so<00:01:06.369> I'm

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
as well as your maintenance costs so I'm

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.429 
as well as your maintenance costs so I'm
sure<00:01:06.999> they<00:01:07.209> are<00:01:07.299> because<00:01:07.600> numbers<00:01:07.959> when<00:01:08.289> you

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
sure they are because numbers when you

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.859 
sure they are because numbers when you
look<00:01:08.619> at<00:01:08.740> them<00:01:08.889> in<00:01:09.009> in<00:01:09.219> aggregate<00:01:09.670> are<00:01:10.270> quite

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
look at them in in aggregate are quite

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.980 
look at them in in aggregate are quite
quite<00:01:11.200> scary<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:13.090> but<00:01:13.329> I<00:01:13.389> think<00:01:13.600> this<00:01:13.689> is<00:01:13.810> why

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
quite scary but but I think this is why

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.529 
quite scary but but I think this is why
we<00:01:14.229> have<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.560> put<00:01:14.709> it<00:01:14.829> in<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:14.979> context<00:01:15.399> that

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
we have to put it in the context that

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.969 
we have to put it in the context that
everybody's<00:01:16.539> circumstances<00:01:16.749> are<00:01:17.590> entirely

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
everybody's circumstances are entirely

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.800 
everybody's circumstances are entirely
individual<00:01:18.549> and<00:01:18.909> you've<00:01:19.060> got<00:01:19.329> to<00:01:19.479> do<00:01:19.599> whatever

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
individual and you've got to do whatever

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.529 
individual and you've got to do whatever
the<00:01:20.020> right<00:01:20.170> thing<00:01:20.439> for<00:01:20.469> you<00:01:20.920> is<00:01:21.099> and<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:22.420> of

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
the right thing for you is and it is of

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.269 
the right thing for you is and it is of
course<00:01:22.719> partly<00:01:23.200> a<00:01:23.229> financial<00:01:23.649> decision<00:01:23.889> but

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:24.279 
course partly a financial decision but

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:26.160 
course partly a financial decision but
it's<00:01:24.849> also<00:01:25.029> much<00:01:25.299> broader<00:01:25.599> decision<00:01:26.109> about

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
it's also much broader decision about

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.319 
it's also much broader decision about
what<00:01:26.439> you<00:01:26.529> want<00:01:26.679> out<00:01:26.799> of<00:01:26.889> your<00:01:27.009> life<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:28.270> I

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
what you want out of your life and I

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.019 
what you want out of your life and I
think<00:01:28.509> if<00:01:28.779> you<00:01:28.869> boil<00:01:29.139> it<00:01:29.319> down<00:01:29.349> to<00:01:29.529> a<00:01:29.829> simple<00:01:30.700> do

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:31.029 
think if you boil it down to a simple do

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:32.309 
think if you boil it down to a simple do
I<00:01:31.060> want<00:01:31.329> to<00:01:31.450> end<00:01:31.599> up<00:01:31.719> with<00:01:31.869> this<00:01:31.959> level<00:01:32.229> of

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
I want to end up with this level of

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.109 
I want to end up with this level of
student<00:01:32.619> debt<00:01:32.709> or<00:01:32.889> not<00:01:32.919> you're<00:01:33.729> going<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.939> miss

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
student debt or not you're going to miss

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.139 
student debt or not you're going to miss
the<00:01:34.270> wider<00:01:34.479> benefits<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.289> potentially

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
the wider benefits of potentially

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.309 
the wider benefits of potentially
broadening<00:01:37.149> your<00:01:37.209> education<00:01:37.719> I<00:01:37.929> mean<00:01:38.169> what

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
broadening your education I mean what

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.929 
broadening your education I mean what
we've<00:01:38.409> got<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.649> consider<00:01:38.979> now<00:01:39.279> is<00:01:39.579> that<00:01:39.759> going

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
we've got to consider now is that going

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.190 
we've got to consider now is that going
to<00:01:40.060> university<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:40.689> one<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.929> the<00:01:41.049> major

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
to university is one of the major

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.080 
to university is one of the major
financial<00:01:41.529> decisions<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:42.549> were<00:01:42.639> making<00:01:42.969> our

financial decisions that were making our

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.289 
financial decisions that were making our
life<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:43.929> I<00:01:44.229> would<00:01:44.829> say<00:01:45.099> make<00:01:45.609> that<00:01:45.819> make<00:01:46.119> it

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
life so I would say make that make it

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.059 
life so I would say make that make it
