00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
will like it quite a lot if we just take

will like it quite a lot if we just take

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
a look around spawn you can see that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.849 
a look around spawn you can see that
this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> already<00:00:20.820> quite<00:00:21.330> beautiful<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.289> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
you and then you can see that the spawns

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840 
you and then you can see that the spawns
right<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:34.020> quite<00:00:34.350> close<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.739> 0-0<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.489> of

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
right here quite close to 0-0 and of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.490 
right here quite close to 0-0 and of
course<00:00:36.090> next<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> Mesa<00:00:36.809> that's<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> right

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
course next to the Mesa that's the right

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.319 
course next to the Mesa that's the right
thing<00:00:37.530> over<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.730> already<00:00:38.910> saw

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
thing over here and then you already saw

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.810 
thing over here and then you already saw
the<00:00:39.590> forests<00:00:40.590> over<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.160> Plains<00:00:41.520> its

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the forests over here so it's Plains its

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.450 
the forests over here so it's Plains its
roofed<00:00:42.329> forest<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.110> birch<00:00:43.950> forest<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
roofed forest and birch forest and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.920 
roofed forest and birch forest and
probably<00:00:44.789> there's<00:00:45.000> also<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.600> normal

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
probably there's also a bit of normal

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.100 
probably there's also a bit of normal
forest<00:00:46.110> yeah<00:00:46.379> here<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.930> yeah<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> think

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
forest yeah here it is and yeah I think

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.200 
forest yeah here it is and yeah I think
that<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> quite<00:00:50.129> nice<00:00:50.370> location<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that this is a quite nice location to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.900 
that this is a quite nice location to
spawn<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.680> also<00:00:52.860> got<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
spawn in but then we also got all the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.020 
spawn in but then we also got all the
other<00:00:54.059> things<00:00:54.570> quite<00:00:55.079> close<00:00:55.350> by<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:56.610> furthest

need also we've got Guardian tempers in
the<00:01:25.140> ocean<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:26.189> course<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.580> witch<00:01:26.759> hat<00:01:27.000> here

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the ocean and of course a witch hat here

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.260 
the ocean and of course a witch hat here
in<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.930> swamp<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:29.070> let<00:01:29.340> us<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.670> back<00:01:29.729> into

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
in this swamp so let us get back into

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.510 
in this swamp so let us get back into
the<00:01:30.390> game<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.689> take<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> look<00:01:31.500> at<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the game and take a look at some of the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.890 
the game and take a look at some of the
places<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:34.579> back<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.700> spawn<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.540> can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
places so back at spawn here we can

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.170 
places so back at spawn here we can
quickly<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> look<00:01:38.009> around<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:39.150> think

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
quickly have a look around and I think

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
quickly have a look around and I think
we<00:01:39.479> should<00:01:39.659> check<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.350> Mesa<00:01:40.530> first<00:01:40.920> cause

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
we should check out the Mesa first cause

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.090 
we should check out the Mesa first cause
it's<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.270> looking<00:01:42.479> quite<00:01:42.869> nice<00:01:43.110> how<00:01:44.040> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
it's really looking quite nice how you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.789 
it's really looking quite nice how you
would<00:01:44.540> expect<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> Mesa<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.649> would<00:01:46.770> just

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
would expect the Mesa and it would just

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.880 
would expect the Mesa and it would just
cross<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.850> fly<00:01:48.329> over<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:49.320> we'll<00:01:49.530> come

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
cross it and fly over it then we'll come

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.069 
cross it and fly over it then we'll come
over<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.149> mushroom<00:01:51.570> island

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
over to the mushroom island

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.590 
over to the mushroom island
in<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.799> second<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
in just a second here so this is the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.539 
in just a second here so this is the
Mesa<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.590> red<00:01:55.740> sand<00:01:56.070> been<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> bit<00:01:56.460> of

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
Mesa with the red sand been a bit of

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.190 
Mesa with the red sand been a bit of
ocean<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.829> then<00:01:58.829> over<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.899> we<00:02:00.899> should<00:02:00.930> see

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
ocean and then over here we should see

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.289 
ocean and then over here we should see
at<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.740> there<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.579> mushroom<00:02:02.939> island

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
at the up there it is a mushroom island

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.940 
at the up there it is a mushroom island
and<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.960> cool<00:02:04.140> thing<00:02:04.170> about<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.649> mushroom

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and the cool thing about this mushroom

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.859 
and the cool thing about this mushroom
island<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:05.969> only<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.329> mushroom

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
island is that it's not only a mushroom

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.139 
island is that it's not only a mushroom
island<00:02:07.020> here<00:02:07.409> there's<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.459> stronghold

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
island here there's also a stronghold

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.990 
island here there's also a stronghold
right<00:02:09.629> underneath<00:02:09.989> here<00:02:10.610> over<00:02:11.610> there<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.849> can

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
right underneath here over there you can

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.670 
right underneath here over there you can
already<00:02:12.239> see<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.599> Potter<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.230> think

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
already see the Potter I think

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.649 
already see the Potter I think
that<00:02:13.799> this<00:02:14.010> potty<00:02:14.340> room<00:02:14.609> itself<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.329> not<00:02:15.510> in

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
that this potty room itself is not in

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.360 
that this potty room itself is not in
the<00:02:15.840> mushroom<00:02:16.109> island<00:02:16.290> anymore<00:02:16.590> but<00:02:16.859> parts<00:02:17.219> of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
the mushroom island anymore but parts of

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.500 
the mushroom island anymore but parts of
the<00:02:17.609> strong<00:02:18.329> wood<00:02:18.510> are<00:02:18.870> definitely<00:02:19.439> in<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
the strong wood are definitely in the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.670 
the strong wood are definitely in the
mushroom<00:02:21.510> island<00:02:21.719> so<00:02:22.109> there<00:02:22.319> won't<00:02:22.409> be<00:02:22.590> any

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
mushroom island so there won't be any

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.679 
mushroom island so there won't be any
mobs<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.310> these<00:02:23.579> rooms<00:02:23.879> here<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.390> example

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
mobs in these rooms here for example

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.839 
mobs in these rooms here for example
just<00:02:25.079> from<00:02:25.230> sabonis<00:02:25.829> and<00:02:26.629> if<00:02:27.629> we<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:28.079> go<00:02:28.290> back

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
just from sabonis and if we just go back

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.140 
just from sabonis and if we just go back
north

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
north

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.770 
north
let<00:02:30.420> me<00:02:30.510> check<00:02:30.629> so<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.840> don't<00:02:31.049> get<00:02:31.139> lost<00:02:31.200> here<00:02:32.780> we

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
let me check so I don't get lost here we

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.690 
let me check so I don't get lost here we
can<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.139> look<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:34.620> our<00:02:34.799> left<00:02:35.189> because

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
can have a look to our left because

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.809 
can have a look to our left because
there<00:02:35.969> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.299> see<00:02:36.540> then<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.489> we've<00:02:38.489> got

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
there you can see then that we've got

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.970 
there you can see then that we've got
the<00:02:39.359> ocean<00:02:39.930> monument<00:02:40.079> let<00:02:40.409> me<00:02:40.500> reload<00:02:40.799> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the ocean monument let me reload the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.619 
the ocean monument let me reload the
trunks<00:02:41.280> they<00:02:41.400> are<00:02:41.519> quite<00:02:41.969> slow<00:02:42.359> right<00:02:42.599> now

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
trunks they are quite slow right now

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.670 
trunks they are quite slow right now
there<00:02:43.139> it<00:02:43.290> is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
there it is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.940 
there it is
so<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:45.510> ocean<00:02:45.900> monument<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.349> first<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:46.769> is

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
so the ocean monument the first one is

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.729 
so the ocean monument the first one is
right<00:02:47.129> next<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.639> Mesa<00:02:47.849> too<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:49.650> think

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
right next to the Mesa too and I think

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.119 
right next to the Mesa too and I think
that<00:02:50.129> that<00:02:50.250> is<00:02:50.430> quite<00:02:50.639> awesome<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:52.889> the

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
that that is quite awesome so on the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.030 
that that is quite awesome so on the
other<00:02:53.280> side<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.510> mesa<00:02:54.750> then<00:02:55.109> we've<00:02:55.859> got

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
other side of the mesa then we've got

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.520 
other side of the mesa then we've got
the<00:02:56.129> spawn<00:02:56.400> here<00:02:56.639> again<00:02:56.909> and<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.469> see

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
the spawn here again and you can see

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.089 
the spawn here again and you can see
that<00:02:59.540> the<00:03:00.540> roof<00:03:00.719> forest<00:03:01.169> is<00:03:01.349> quite<00:03:01.650> large<00:03:01.889> and

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
that the roof forest is quite large and

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.670 
that the roof forest is quite large and
I<00:03:02.250> really<00:03:02.489> like<00:03:02.669> the<00:03:02.909> roof<00:03:03.090> forest<00:03:03.680> just

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
I really like the roof forest just

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.020 
I really like the roof forest just
because<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.129> its<00:03:05.250> green<00:03:05.489> color<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.879> might

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
because of its green color you might

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.990 
because of its green color you might
want<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.389> light<00:03:06.629> this<00:03:06.810> up<00:03:07.040> quite<00:03:08.040> good<00:03:08.219> but<00:03:08.430> I

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
want to light this up quite good but I

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.149 
want to light this up quite good but I
think<00:03:09.540> it's<00:03:09.659> a<00:03:09.750> nice<00:03:09.900> biome<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.469> start<00:03:10.799> in<00:03:10.950> and

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
think it's a nice biome to start in and

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.920 
think it's a nice biome to start in and
something<00:03:11.549> maybe<00:03:11.700> not<00:03:11.969> that<00:03:12.120> user<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.780> you

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
something maybe not that user that you

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.459 
something maybe not that user that you
always<00:03:13.139> do<00:03:13.469> and<00:03:14.180> then<00:03:15.180> over<00:03:15.569> here<00:03:15.599> we<00:03:15.900> get<00:03:16.139> to<00:03:16.439> a

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
always do and then over here we get to a

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.390 
always do and then over here we get to a
swamp<00:03:17.219> and<00:03:17.780> in<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.019> swamp<00:03:19.379> of<00:03:19.560> course<00:03:20.190> we've

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
swamp and in the swamp of course we've

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.939 
swamp and in the swamp of course we've
got<00:03:20.430> our<00:03:20.760> witch<00:03:21.150> hut<00:03:21.419> on<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.199> other<00:03:22.349> side<00:03:22.680> if

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
got our witch hut on the other side if

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.530 
got our witch hut on the other side if
we<00:03:23.129> would<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.430> gone<00:03:23.579> this<00:03:23.849> way<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.120> will

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
we would have gone this way you will

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.890 
we would have gone this way you will
have<00:03:24.599> come<00:03:25.109> to<00:03:25.319> a<00:03:25.349> desert<00:03:25.949> which<00:03:26.639> has<00:03:26.909> even<00:03:27.239> a

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.110 

temple<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.169> a<00:03:31.409> year<00:03:31.709> or<00:03:32.040> two<00:03:32.519> or<00:03:32.849> three

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
temple and a year or two or three

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.629 
temple and a year or two or three
villages<00:03:33.629> I<00:03:33.900> don't<00:03:34.470> know<00:03:34.620> how<00:03:34.739> many<00:03:34.799> it<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.310> is

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
villages I don't know how many it it is

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.330
