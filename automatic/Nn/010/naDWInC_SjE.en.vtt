this pivot point is the origin point
that's<00:02:09.119> those<00:02:09.450> are<00:02:09.659> two<00:02:09.810> words<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.200> go<00:02:10.649> hand

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
that's those are two words that go hand

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.820 
that's those are two words that go hand
in<00:02:11.009> hand<00:02:11.069> also<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.690> i<00:02:12.780> change<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.470> 3d

in hand also so if i change this to 3d
cursor<00:02:14.069> this<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.330> i<00:02:15.420> hit<00:02:15.630> scale<00:02:16.080> again<00:02:16.440> it's

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
cursor this and i hit scale again it's

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.690 
cursor this and i hit scale again it's
going<00:02:17.040> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
going to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.350 
going to
l<00:02:17.819> from<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.810> origin<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.650> 3d<00:02:23.040> cursor

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
l from the origin of the the 3d cursor

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.880 
l from the origin of the the 3d cursor
and<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:26.220> say<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.519> hit<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.180> press<00:02:27.840> D<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.410> duplicate

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and so say I hit I press D to duplicate

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.009 
and so say I hit I press D to duplicate
this<00:02:29.069> hold<00:02:29.370> ctrl<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:30.180> constrain<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.870> move

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
this hold ctrl to constrain it and move

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.820 
this hold ctrl to constrain it and move
it<00:02:31.519> exactly<00:02:32.519> one<00:02:32.670> over<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.620> hold

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
it exactly one over like that and I hold

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.370 
it exactly one over like that and I hold
shift<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.340> select<00:02:35.730> both<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.150> them<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:37.019> hit<00:02:37.170> s

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
shift to select both of them and I hit s

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.470 
shift to select both of them and I hit s
to<00:02:37.620> scale<00:02:37.769> again<00:02:38.160> they're<00:02:38.610> both<00:02:38.819> going<00:02:39.150> to

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
to scale again they're both going to

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.229 
to scale again they're both going to
scale<00:02:39.989> from<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:42.090> basic<00:02:42.660> point<00:02:42.870> there

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
scale from that the basic point there

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.410 
scale from that the basic point there
but<00:02:45.239> let's<00:02:45.630> see<00:02:45.930> say<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.530> had<00:02:47.190> I'll<00:02:47.819> delete<00:02:48.150> this

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
but let's see say I had I'll delete this

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.509 
but let's see say I had I'll delete this
one<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:51.830> actually<00:02:52.830> I'm<00:02:53.099> going<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.280> delete

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
one and actually I'm going to delete

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.089 
one and actually I'm going to delete
that<00:02:53.580> also<00:02:54.180> let's<00:02:54.660> hit<00:02:54.810> shift<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.799> let's

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
that also let's hit shift a and let's

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.339 
that also let's hit shift a and let's
add<00:02:56.280> another<00:02:56.840> cone<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.849> let's<00:02:59.849> hit<00:03:00.000> G<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.140> grab

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
add another cone and let's hit G to grab

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.229 
add another cone and let's hit G to grab
it<00:03:01.380> control<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.130> constrain<00:03:02.519> it<00:03:02.670> bring<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:02.970> up

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
it control to constrain it bring it up

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.449 
it control to constrain it bring it up
and<00:03:05.480> say<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.510> hit<00:03:06.780> David<00:03:07.190> duplicate<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.340> and

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
and say I hit David duplicate it and

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.449 
and say I hit David duplicate it and
then<00:03:09.319> once<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.470> duplicate<00:03:11.010> something<00:03:11.250> you

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
then once you duplicate something you

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.979 
then once you duplicate something you
don't<00:03:11.610> have<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.940> hit<00:03:12.090> G<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.480> grab<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.840> it

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
don't have to hit G to grab it it

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.350 
don't have to hit G to grab it it
automatically<00:03:13.650> goes<00:03:13.920> into<00:03:13.980> grab<00:03:14.430> mode<00:03:14.760> so

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
automatically goes into grab mode so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.880 
automatically goes into grab mode so
just<00:03:15.690> once<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.079> duplicate<00:03:16.620> something

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
just once you duplicate something

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.030 
just once you duplicate something
immediately<00:03:17.430> hit<00:03:17.700> ctrl<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.750> want<00:03:19.040> to

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
immediately hit ctrl if you want to

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.920 
immediately hit ctrl if you want to
position<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.549> precisely<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.269> it<00:03:21.510> will<00:03:21.630> snap

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
position it precisely and it will snap

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.530 
position it precisely and it will snap
so<00:03:22.799> we'll<00:03:22.950> move<00:03:23.069> this<00:03:23.250> one<00:03:23.459> exactly<00:03:23.819> over<00:03:24.329> and

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
so we'll move this one exactly over and

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.080 
so we'll move this one exactly over and
then<00:03:25.230> I'll<00:03:25.739> shift<00:03:26.160> select<00:03:26.549> this<00:03:26.670> other<00:03:26.910> one

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
then I'll shift select this other one

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.509 
then I'll shift select this other one
and<00:03:27.209> hit<00:03:27.359> d<00:03:27.569> again<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.139> this<00:03:28.519> duplicates

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
and hit d again and this duplicates

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.360 
and hit d again and this duplicates
these<00:03:29.730> will<00:03:30.000> hold<00:03:30.090> ctrl<00:03:30.600> and<00:03:30.900> move<00:03:31.889> this<00:03:32.069> over

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
these will hold ctrl and move this over

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.860 
these will hold ctrl and move this over
and<00:03:33.380> let's<00:03:34.380> just<00:03:34.530> say<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.910> make<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:36.480> even

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
and let's just say to make this even

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.099 
and let's just say to make this even
I'll<00:03:38.180> duplicate<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.329> one<00:03:39.540> by<00:03:39.660> pressing<00:03:40.019> d

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
I'll duplicate this one by pressing d

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.300 
I'll duplicate this one by pressing d
hold<00:03:40.440> ctrl<00:03:40.859> move<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:41.970> over<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.739> I<00:03:43.739> now<00:03:43.980> have

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
hold ctrl move it over and I now have

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.650 
hold ctrl move it over and I now have
these<00:03:44.639> five<00:03:45.180> codes<00:03:45.889> if<00:03:46.889> I<00:03:47.400> right<00:03:48.299> click<00:03:48.329> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
these five codes if I right click to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.009 
these five codes if I right click to
lasso<00:03:49.290> select<00:03:49.709> them<00:03:49.889> all<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:51.180> press<00:03:51.480> scale

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
lasso select them all and I press scale

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.530 
lasso select them all and I press scale
you<00:03:52.590> can<00:03:52.739> see<00:03:52.980> how<00:03:53.280> they<00:03:53.549> all<00:03:53.790> scale<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
you can see how they all scale to the

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.610 
you can see how they all scale to the
point<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.109> where<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:56.160> 3d<00:03:56.700> cursor<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.620> and

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
point of where that 3d cursor is and

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.360 
point of where that 3d cursor is and
that<00:03:58.889> is<00:03:59.100> because<00:03:59.690> under<00:04:00.690> our<00:04:00.900> pivot<00:04:01.829> point<00:04:02.190> we

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
that is because under our pivot point we

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.160 
that is because under our pivot point we

these down individually what you would

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.070 
these down individually what you would
do<00:04:44.940> is<00:04:45.240> under<00:04:46.230> your<00:04:47.000> pivot<00:04:48.000> point<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.990> would

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
do is under your pivot point you would

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.950 
do is under your pivot point you would
select<00:04:49.320> individual<00:04:50.130> origins<00:04:50.610> then<00:04:51.510> what

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
select individual origins then what

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.840 
select individual origins then what
that's<00:04:52.170> going<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:52.470> do<00:04:52.620> is<00:04:52.800> cause<00:04:53.040> each<00:04:53.400> object

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
that's going to do is cause each object

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.450 
that's going to do is cause each object
to<00:04:54.390> scale<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.720> its<00:04:55.050> own<00:04:55.290> specific<00:04:55.890> origin

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
to scale to its own specific origin

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.930 
to scale to its own specific origin
point<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.210> now<00:04:57.570> if<00:04:57.690> i<00:04:57.780> press<00:04:57.990> s<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.290> scale<00:04:58.650> it

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
point so now if i press s to scale it

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.360 
point so now if i press s to scale it
they're<00:04:59.940> all<00:04:59.970> going<00:05:00.420> to<00:05:00.510> scale<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.350> their<00:05:02.130> same

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
they're all going to scale to their same

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.630 
they're all going to scale to their same
point<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:03.360> i'll<00:05:04.320> hit<00:05:04.530> G<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.190> grab<00:05:05.370> them<00:05:05.580> and

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
point and i'll hit G and grab them and

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.880 
point and i'll hit G and grab them and
bring<00:05:05.910> them<00:05:05.940> down<00:05:06.090> now<00:05:07.820> currently<00:05:08.820> we<00:05:09.270> have

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
bring them down now currently we have

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.820 
bring them down now currently we have
five<00:05:10.890> individual<00:05:11.760> objects<00:05:12.240> but<00:05:13.050> if<00:05:13.260> we<00:05:13.440> wanted

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
five individual objects but if we wanted

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.640 
five individual objects but if we wanted
to<00:05:13.890> well<00:05:14.700> see<00:05:15.120> if<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.420> select<00:05:15.630> them<00:05:15.870> if<00:05:16.260> I<00:05:16.440> select

that<00:05:43.580> say<00:05:44.580> I<00:05:44.640> wanted<00:05:45.060> all<00:05:45.390> these<00:05:45.600> cones<00:05:46.140> to<00:05:46.470> be

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
that say I wanted all these cones to be

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.840 
that say I wanted all these cones to be
to<00:05:47.340> act<00:05:47.550> like<00:05:47.700> one<00:05:48.030> object<00:05:49.370> what<00:05:50.370> I<00:05:50.400> would<00:05:50.640> do

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
to act like one object what I would do

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.060 
to act like one object what I would do
then<00:05:51.090> is<00:05:51.450> go<00:05:51.720> back<00:05:51.870> into<00:05:52.050> object<00:05:52.530> mode<00:05:52.590> and

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
ways we can do this one the quickest way

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.630 
ways we can do this one the quickest way
and<00:06:32.760> mathematical<00:06:33.600> way<00:06:33.720> to<00:06:33.860> get<00:06:34.860> the<00:06:35.130> origin

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
and mathematical way to get the origin

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.840

this magical Indian tepee and not at the
center<00:07:02.400> what<00:07:03.400> we<00:07:03.490> can<00:07:03.640> do<00:07:03.820> is<00:07:04.150> just<00:07:04.180> hit<00:07:05.170> tab<00:07:05.440> to

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
center what we can do is just hit tab to

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.070 
center what we can do is just hit tab to
go<00:07:05.830> into<00:07:05.980> edit<00:07:06.100> mode<00:07:06.250> press<00:07:07.000> a<00:07:07.240> to<00:07:07.270> select<00:07:07.660> all

go into edit mode press a to select all

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.560 
go into edit mode press a to select all
and<00:07:08.350> G<00:07:09.070> to<00:07:09.250> grab<00:07:09.460> and<00:07:09.880> you'll<00:07:10.330> see<00:07:10.540> that

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 
and G to grab and you'll see that

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.070 
and G to grab and you'll see that
everything<00:07:11.440> moves<00:07:12.430> but<00:07:12.970> that<00:07:13.180> point<00:07:13.540> so<00:07:13.840> you

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
everything moves but that point so you

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.050 
everything moves but that point so you
can<00:07:14.620> then<00:07:15.000> align<00:07:16.000> your<00:07:16.210> object<00:07:16.720> to<00:07:16.960> where<00:07:17.170> you

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 
can then align your object to where you

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.400 
can then align your object to where you
want<00:07:19.060> that<00:07:19.120> point<00:07:19.540> to<00:07:19.660> be<00:07:19.780> so<00:07:19.930> I<00:07:19.990> want<00:07:20.170> to<00:07:20.200> be<00:07:20.350> at

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410 
want that point to be so I want to be at

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.950 
want that point to be so I want to be at
the<00:07:20.500> top<00:07:20.710> and<00:07:21.010> then<00:07:21.730> hit<00:07:21.940> tab<00:07:22.330> and<00:07:22.720> then<00:07:22.810> I'll

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
the top and then hit tab and then I'll

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.360 
the top and then hit tab and then I'll
hit<00:07:23.110> G<00:07:23.320> to<00:07:23.440> grab<00:07:23.620> this<00:07:23.800> and<00:07:23.890> put<00:07:24.010> it<00:07:24.100> back<00:07:24.160> up

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
hit G to grab this and put it back up

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.770 
hit G to grab this and put it back up
that's<00:07:24.670> just<00:07:24.760> a<00:07:24.880> quick<00:07:25.030> and<00:07:25.300> dirty<00:07:25.450> way<00:07:25.630> to

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
that's just a quick and dirty way to

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.380 
that's just a quick and dirty way to
move<00:07:26.620> your<00:07:26.860> object<00:07:27.550> around<00:07:27.730> to<00:07:27.940> get<00:07:28.060> to<00:07:28.240> the

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.390 
move your object around to get to the

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.510 
move your object around to get to the
pivot<00:07:29.230> point<00:07:29.470> you<00:07:29.590> want<00:07:29.770> so<00:07:30.010> now<00:07:30.190> if<00:07:30.340> we<00:07:30.370> get

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
pivot point you want so now if we get

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.060 
pivot point you want so now if we get
rotate<00:07:30.940> it<00:07:31.120> rotates<00:07:31.630> exactly<00:07:32.490> around<00:07:33.780> that

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.070 
rotate it rotates exactly around that

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.920 
rotate it rotates exactly around that
origin<00:07:36.070> or<00:07:36.310> pivot<00:07:36.550> point<00:07:36.940> so<00:07:37.210> i'll<00:07:37.270> hit<00:07:37.360> ctrl<00:07:37.720> z

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:37.930 
origin or pivot point so i'll hit ctrl z

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.420 
origin or pivot point so i'll hit ctrl z
then<00:07:38.740> if<00:07:38.860> we<00:07:39.010> hit<00:07:39.100> five<00:07:40.000> to<00:07:40.330> go<00:07:40.420> into<00:07:40.570> top<00:07:41.340> and<00:07:42.340> I

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.430 
then if we hit five to go into top and I

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.730 
then if we hit five to go into top and I
press<00:07:42.730> R<00:07:42.940> to<00:07:43.000> rotate<00:07:43.600> you'll<00:07:43.810> see<00:07:44.020> they're<00:07:44.590> all

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:44.740 
press R to rotate you'll see they're all

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.160 
press R to rotate you'll see they're all
rotating<00:07:45.280> around<00:07:45.550> that<00:07:45.850> point<00:07:46.030> as<00:07:46.210> well<00:07:46.330> let

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.170 
rotating around that point as well let

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.470 
rotating around that point as well let
it<00:07:47.200> control<00:07:47.470> Z<00:07:47.770> and<00:07:48.010> then<00:07:48.580> of<00:07:48.730> course<00:07:48.760> the

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:49.480 
it control Z and then of course the

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.410 
it control Z and then of course the
pivot<00:07:49.750> point<00:07:49.960> not<00:07:50.170> only<00:07:50.200> controls<00:07:51.090> this<00:07:52.090> where

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:52.420 
pivot point not only controls this where

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.910 
pivot point not only controls this where
the<00:07:52.510> center<00:07:52.750> of<00:07:52.840> something<00:07:53.110> rotates<00:07:53.560> but<00:07:53.770> also

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:53.920 
the center of something rotates but also

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.060 
the center of something rotates but also
where<00:07:54.220> it<00:07:54.340> scales<00:07:54.930> but<00:07:55.930> then<00:07:56.140> we<00:07:56.350> can<00:07:56.680> if<00:07:57.010> we

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.070 
where it scales but then we can if we
