00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
said like the galaxies destroyed and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.240 
said like the galaxies destroyed and
sucks<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.539> everyone<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.050> yeah<00:00:28.920> well<00:00:29.039> he<00:00:29.220> also

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
said that when the new galaxies formed

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.260 
said that when the new galaxies formed
life<00:00:31.949> would<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.189> formed<00:00:32.489> you're<00:00:32.700> partially

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
life would be formed you're partially

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
life would be formed you're partially
correct<00:00:33.630> except<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> missed<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.800> detail

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
correct except you missed one in detail

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.760 
correct except you missed one in detail
matpat<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.690> detail<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> life<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
matpat and that detail is that life is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
matpat and that detail is that life is
takes<00:00:38.579> millions<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.270> years<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> develop

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
takes millions of years to develop

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.459 
takes millions of years to develop
through<00:00:40.469> cells<00:00:41.000> through<00:00:42.000> forming<00:00:42.690> particles

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
through cells through forming particles

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.069 
through cells through forming particles
like<00:00:43.710> water<00:00:44.480> developing<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> land<00:00:45.750> then

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
like water developing the land then

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.670 
like water developing the land then
humans<00:00:46.649> come<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.160> okay<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:48.170> evolution<00:00:49.170> they

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
humans come in okay for evolution they

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.670 
humans come in okay for evolution they
don't<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.010> appear<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.550> away<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.960> don't

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
don't just appear right away and don't

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.860 
don't just appear right away and don't
give<00:00:52.920> me<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> shit<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.329> been<00:00:54.539> evolved

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
give me that shit like it's been evolved

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.680 
give me that shit like it's been evolved
over<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> thousand<00:00:55.739> years<00:00:55.920> no<00:00:56.219> right<00:00:56.940> no<00:00:57.480> he

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
over a thousand years no right no he

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
over a thousand years no right no he
claims<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> happens<00:00:58.379> right<00:00:58.680> after<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
claims it happens right after that and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.459 
claims it happens right after that and
if<00:01:00.329> somebody<00:01:00.600> made<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> claim<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.020> didn't<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.350> my

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
if somebody made a claim I didn't do my

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
if somebody made a claim I didn't do my
research<00:01:01.739> well<00:01:02.640> guess<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> have<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> thing

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
research well guess what I have a thing

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.740 
research well guess what I have a thing
called<00:01:03.660> school<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.949> yeah<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.090> been<00:01:06.150> hammered

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
called school so yeah it's been hammered

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
called school so yeah it's been hammered
and<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.170> takes<00:01:07.380> millions<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.950> years<00:01:08.010> oh<00:01:08.310> by<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and it takes millions of years oh by the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.570 
and it takes millions of years oh by the
way<00:01:08.549> I'm<00:01:08.729> taking<00:01:08.760> biology<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:10.110> yeah<00:01:10.439> first<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
way I'm taking biology so yeah first of

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.120 
way I'm taking biology so yeah first of
all<00:01:11.729> an<00:01:11.820> organism<00:01:12.510> needs<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.350> based<00:01:13.950> off

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
all an organism needs to have based off

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.249 
all an organism needs to have based off
a<00:01:14.159> host<00:01:14.610> cell<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.600> I'm<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:15.780> gonna<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.080> into

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
a host cell but I'm not gonna get into

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.740 
a host cell but I'm not gonna get into
that<00:01:16.560> crap<00:01:17.100> because<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.180> too<00:01:18.330> much<00:01:18.450> shit

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
to come through only two more arguments

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.300 
to come through only two more arguments
do<00:01:20.759> they<00:01:21.119> feel<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.450> lot<00:01:21.810> anyhow<00:01:22.619> next<00:01:23.130> he

do they feel like a lot anyhow next he
refers<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.479> Zelda<00:01:24.900> timeline<00:01:24.930> how<00:01:25.530> it

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
refers to the Zelda timeline how it

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.590 
refers to the Zelda timeline how it
connects<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.040> Mario<00:01:26.340> did<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.850> say<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
connects and Mario did you say that the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.420 
connects and Mario did you say that the
Zelda<00:01:27.869> timeline<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.350> bullshit<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.310> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
Zelda timeline is bullshit in one of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.810 
Zelda timeline is bullshit in one of
your<00:01:29.700> theories<00:01:30.320> matpat<00:01:31.380> yeah<00:01:32.340> you're<00:01:32.610> being

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
your theories matpat yeah you're being

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.140 
your theories matpat yeah you're being
hypocritical<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.729> but<00:01:35.729> there's<00:01:35.970> just

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
hypocritical now I see but there's just

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.340 
hypocritical now I see but there's just
one<00:01:36.270> more<00:01:36.630> argument<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:38.869> really<00:01:39.869> mad<00:01:40.049> Pat

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
one more argument I just really mad Pat

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.580 
one more argument I just really mad Pat
he<00:01:41.220> says<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.909> Mario<00:01:42.479> games<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.079> how<00:01:43.380> come

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
he says in Mario games but how come

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.170 
he says in Mario games but how come
Mario<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.159> die<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.579> many<00:01:44.759> times<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.060> bring

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
Mario can die so many times and bring

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.330 
Mario can die so many times and bring
back<00:01:45.390> lives<00:01:45.750> that's<00:01:46.619> because<00:01:47.070> it's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
back lives that's because it's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.639 
back lives that's because it's
programmed<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.360> way<00:01:48.420> matpat<00:01:49.320> it's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
programmed that way matpat it's

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.160 
programmed that way matpat it's
programmed<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> game<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.899> he<00:01:52.020> can

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
programmed in the game so that he can

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.649 
programmed in the game so that he can
come<00:01:52.409> back<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.920> extra<00:01:53.040> lives<00:01:55.280> it's<00:01:56.280> just

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
come back for extra lives it's just

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.120 
come back for extra lives it's just
