00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.849
 look at this machine does not appear 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.719
 being different from all others is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:20.939
 instead a very special machine 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:23.189
 let's look inside and here is one 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.460
 surprise because it is a machine that is 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:35.399
 driving all by itself without none at 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:38.700
 steering wheel is a car that can circulate 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.090
 normally because it slows down and accelerates 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.399
 when necessary stop stops e 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.260
 brakes when it gets too close to the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.260
 vehicle that precedes it 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.090
 and here are some of the images taken 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.579
 from the helicopter and here we see the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.309
 car even goes alone to 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.190
 normal speed respecting the traffic lights 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.469
 and also giving precedence 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.329
 in short, it does everything it does 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.650
 normal car with driver 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.030
 following the satellite route the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.619
 the whole world is being planned 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.189
 cars of this type 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.119
 and this has been achieved 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.580
 from the engineering institute 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.860
 of the university of Parma that one of the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.920
 most advanced centers 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.290
 think that already in 2010 four of 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 these cars carried out the first 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.390
 intercontinental journey going from 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.670
 parma to shanghai 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.900
 here we see images of 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.820
 that journey of over 15,000 km 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.000
 considered a milestone in the field 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.549
 of cars without a guide for reasons of 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.850
 security a person sat behind the wheel 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.700
 but without touching the controls 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.090
 human interventions occurred only 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.470
 in particular situations such as 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.990
 example in traffic conditions 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.329
 congested for reasons of opportunity 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.909
 last July in parma it was 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.399
 carried out the first test in the world of 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.979
 automatic driving in the city inside the 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.890
 city ​​traffic and a part of the 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.099
 route was made without any 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.530
 book launch and with the machine that if any 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.260
 he was going alone now we are right 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.610
 entered the campus 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.380
 university of parma 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.959
 certainly the strange effect 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.459
 the healthy g8 the car with no one 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.650
 here are some people who 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.430
 he crossed the street as soon as he came 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:42.549
 snow stops and then with another 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.100
 machine and start again as it does to one 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.670
 car went around alone without 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.860
 villa tube what kind of instrumentation 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.480
 use can explain it with 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.430
 professor alberto broggi than here 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.940
 at the University of Parma for more than 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.200
 twenty years takes care of the design 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.200
 of this type of vehicles 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.200
 good morning good morning then 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.310
 how does it work 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.650
 but as for the journey 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.500
 we have installed some more maps 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.920
 sophisticated satellite maps 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.990
 traditional 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.520
 regarding the obstacles instead 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.100
 we have installed sensors 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.470
 laser cameras that allow the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.110
 vehicle to look in front of back 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.239
 and to the side for these cameras though 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.400
 they recognize the image this is a point 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.560
 important to recognize the image 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.810
 they recognize what is represented 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.850
 in the image for example pedestrians and 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.370
 vehicles such as pedestrians and vehicles 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.200
 road signs or can read the 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.820
 road signs see traffic signs 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.290
 locate and read it then hear 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.050
 let's talk a little about the uses then of 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.209
 this future spot at brac provides but 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.380
 surely this is the method for the 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.480
 mobility of the future 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.940
 this will be the way we will move 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.489
 automatic vehicles with no one on board 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.530
 It's security will definitely be a lot 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.180
 safer than guided vehicles 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.489
 manually because the driver does not 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.900
 distracts we have automatic driver and 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.329
 he does not drink and therefore will surely be 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.340
 always attentive to the titan road of 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.620
 anger uses normal in 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.870
 car this system can be 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.330
 apply to other types of vehicles a 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.820
 many types of vehicles such as ai 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.950
 agricultural vehicles have a 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.770
 tractor that automatically does the 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.990
 field work with no one on board e 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.750
 for 24 hours a day this really 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.419
 it could mean having a tremendous amount 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.250
 food production for all 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.560
 certainly in large areas e 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.330
 this means that even the truck 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.120
 they can leave version around 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.750
 even the truck alone and also in 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.750
 total security 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.010
 it follows
