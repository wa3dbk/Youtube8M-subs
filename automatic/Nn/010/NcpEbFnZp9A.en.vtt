have said they don't enjoy doing it we

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.840 
have said they don't enjoy doing it we
feel<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> benefit<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.570> too<00:00:45.870> large<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.350> ignore

the<00:00:47.850> thing<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.870> honestly<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the thing is is that honestly it's a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.819 
the thing is is that honestly it's a
pretty<00:00:49.890> minor<00:00:50.370> benefit<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> same<00:00:52.170> time<00:00:52.440> if

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
pretty minor benefit at the same time if

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.500 
pretty minor benefit at the same time if
people<00:00:53.250> don't<00:00:53.430> want<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> do<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.969> no<00:00:54.360> one's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
people don't want to do it no one's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.529 
people don't want to do it no one's
forcing<00:00:54.780> them<00:00:55.020> into<00:00:55.110> doing<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.539> don't

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
forcing them into doing it like I don't

forcing them into doing it like I don't
know<00:00:57.750> Blizzard<00:00:58.590> logic<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> moment<00:00:59.399> it's

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
know Blizzard logic at the moment it's

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.270 
know Blizzard logic at the moment it's
really<00:00:59.760> bad<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:01.230> anyway<00:01:01.500> let's<00:01:01.920> look<00:01:02.070> at<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
really bad so anyway let's look at the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
really bad so anyway let's look at the
way<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.609> want<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.210> option<00:01:04.080> 1

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
way as they want to do this option 1

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.830 
way as they want to do this option 1
something<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.070> magic<00:01:05.430> fine<00:01:05.640> cap<00:01:05.970> they<00:01:06.600> want<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
something a magic fine cap they want to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.050 
something a magic fine cap they want to
set<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> magic<00:01:07.380> flying<00:01:07.560> cap<00:01:07.830> maybe<00:01:08.250> between<00:01:08.549> 100

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
set a magic flying cap maybe between 100

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.590 
set a magic flying cap maybe between 100
and<00:01:09.090> 200<00:01:09.299> percent<00:01:09.810> while<00:01:10.320> MV<00:01:10.680> provides<00:01:11.100> 75%<00:01:11.939> so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and 200 percent while MV provides 75% so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.420 
and 200 percent while MV provides 75% so
you<00:01:12.689> would<00:01:12.780> need<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.619> really<00:01:14.040> small

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you would need a really really small

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.359 
you would need a really really small
amount<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.090> FF<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.720> hit<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> hard<00:01:16.229> cap<00:01:16.500> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
amount of FF to hit the hard cap the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.380 
amount of FF to hit the hard cap the
problem<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:19.549> it's<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:21.090> good

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
problem with this is that it's not good

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.600 
problem with this is that it's not good
because<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.409> certain<00:01:22.860> pieces<00:01:23.100> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
because you can get certain pieces that

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.030 
because you can get certain pieces that
will<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:24.060> good<00:01:24.659> stats<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.560> MF<00:01:25.860> on

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
will have good stats and have MF on

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.880 
will have good stats and have MF on
which<00:01:26.909> will<00:01:27.689> mean<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.869> people<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.380> full<00:01:28.619> MF

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
which will mean that people have full MF

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.490 
which will mean that people have full MF
constantly<00:01:29.430> which<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.970> distribute<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.320> is

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
constantly which is distribute this is

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.830 
constantly which is distribute this is
logic<00:01:31.829> behind<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.220> pros<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.460> cons<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.150> pretty

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
logic behind the pros and cons is pretty

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.440 
logic behind the pros and cons is pretty
questionable<00:01:34.439> honestly<00:01:35.000> but<00:01:36.000> let's<00:01:36.180> move<00:01:36.299> on

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
questionable honestly but let's move on

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.649 
questionable honestly but let's move on
to<00:01:36.479> option<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.310> option<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.790> my<00:01:39.000> opinion<00:01:39.270> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
to option to option to in my opinion is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.020 
to option to option to in my opinion is
a<00:01:39.689> lot<00:01:39.960> better<00:01:40.170> than<00:01:40.320> option<00:01:40.650> 1<00:01:40.880> because<00:01:41.880> you

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
a lot better than option 1 because you

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.090 
a lot better than option 1 because you
can<00:01:42.150> still<00:01:42.360> I'm<00:01:42.479> our<00:01:42.630> swap<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.799> requires

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
can still I'm our swap it just requires

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.490 
can still I'm our swap it just requires
a<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.430> more<00:01:44.509> like<00:01:46.640> preparation<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.820> guess<00:01:48.090> on

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
a bit more like preparation I guess on

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.260 
a bit more like preparation I guess on
gaining<00:01:49.500> MF<00:01:49.950> over<00:01:50.310> time<00:01:50.520> if<00:01:50.790> they're<00:01:50.970> gaining

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
gaining MF over time if they're gaining

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.569 
gaining MF over time if they're gaining
the<00:01:51.390> whole<00:01:51.659> while<00:01:51.899> once<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.950> honestly<00:01:53.130> is

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the whole while once I think honestly is

a pretty decent idea and I wouldn't even

end of the day no one honestly cares

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.620 
end of the day no one honestly cares
about<00:03:47.410> like<00:03:48.370> envy<00:03:48.940> starts<00:03:49.300> when<00:03:49.510> they're

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
about like envy starts when they're

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.800 
about like envy starts when they're
progressing<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.650> option<00:03:51.100> for<00:03:51.550> is<00:03:51.850> pretty

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
progressing so option for is pretty

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.460 
progressing so option for is pretty
pointless<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:55.090> just<00:03:55.959> don't<00:03:56.110> think<00:03:56.260> it'd<00:03:56.410> be

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
pointless and I just don't think it'd be

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.650 
pointless and I just don't think it'd be
a<00:03:56.620> great<00:03:56.709> addition<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.190> game<00:03:57.430> option<00:03:58.420> five

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
a great addition to the game option five

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.630 
a great addition to the game option five
is<00:03:58.989> actually<00:03:59.350> pretty<00:03:59.739> smarter<00:04:00.220> than<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.489> come

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
is actually pretty smarter than to come

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.490 
is actually pretty smarter than to come
up<00:04:00.730> with<00:04:00.760> which<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.239> prolly<00:04:01.540> wise<00:04:01.780> option<00:04:02.020> five

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
up with which is prolly wise option five

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.140 
up with which is prolly wise option five
