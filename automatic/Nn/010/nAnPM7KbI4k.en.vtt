into the effects of the amp because

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.509 
into the effects of the amp because
there's<00:00:53.429> no<00:00:53.609> reverb<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.769> a<00:00:55.799> 50

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519

a<00:01:01.530> master<00:01:02.010> feedback<00:01:02.959> control<00:01:03.959> which<00:01:04.199> which<00:01:04.559> if

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
a master feedback control which which if

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.820 
a master feedback control which which if
you<00:01:05.430> dial<00:01:05.730> it<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.450> dials<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.170> power<00:01:07.410> tubes

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you dial it up it dials the power tubes

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.520 
you dial it up it dials the power tubes
actually<00:01:08.190> up<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.870> you<00:01:09.960> get<00:01:10.050> like<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> full

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
actually up so you get like the full

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.280 
actually up so you get like the full
power<00:01:10.800> tube<00:01:11.100> saturation<00:01:11.930> presents<00:01:12.930> bass

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
power tube saturation presents bass

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.730 
power tube saturation presents bass
middle<00:01:13.920> treble<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.030> preamp<00:01:15.510> which<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.900> kind

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
middle treble and a preamp which is kind

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.430 
middle treble and a preamp which is kind
of<00:01:16.800> like<00:01:17.010> your<00:01:17.250> gain<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.140> can<00:01:19.260> really

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
of like your gain so you can really

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.320 
of like your gain so you can really
drive<00:01:19.830> up<00:01:20.040> some<00:01:20.280> some<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:20.880> tasty

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
drive up some some really tasty

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.690 
drive up some some really tasty
distortion<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.080> I've<00:01:22.950> got<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> set<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> little

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
distortion so I've got it set a little

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.850 
distortion so I've got it set a little
low<00:01:23.970> right<00:01:24.240> now<00:01:24.390> kind<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.020> cleaner<00:01:25.350> type

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
low right now kind of a cleaner type

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.780 
low right now kind of a cleaner type
setting

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:42.170 

you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.899 

nice<00:01:43.180> clean<00:01:43.840> sound<00:01:44.290> -<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.710> breaks<00:01:45.369> up<00:01:45.580> a<00:01:45.729> little

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
nice clean sound - it breaks up a little

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.730 
nice clean sound - it breaks up a little
bit<00:01:46.090> but<00:01:46.330> you<00:01:46.540> can<00:01:46.570> get<00:01:46.930> some<00:01:47.110> nice<00:01:47.259> clean<00:01:47.530> out

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
bit but you can get some nice clean out

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.910 
bit but you can get some nice clean out
of<00:01:47.860> it<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:49.390> definitely<00:01:49.540> not<00:01:49.780> a<00:01:49.840> jazz<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.530> by

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
of it it's definitely not a jazz and by

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.430 
of it it's definitely not a jazz and by
any<00:01:51.100> means<00:01:51.369> but<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:51.940> really<00:01:52.690> rocks<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.350> then

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
any means but it really rocks and then

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.690 
any means but it really rocks and then
really<00:01:54.100> great<00:01:54.280> for<00:01:54.490> blues<00:01:54.700> so<00:01:55.659> I'll<00:01:55.869> dial<00:01:56.080> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
really great for blues so I'll dial the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.109 
really great for blues so I'll dial the
gain<00:01:57.700> up<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.950> feed<00:02:00.280> back<00:02:00.490> ups<00:02:00.790> for<00:02:01.030> the

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
gain up now the feed back ups for the

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.460 
gain up now the feed back ups for the
power<00:02:01.330> tubes<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:04.060> preamp<00:02:04.450> distortion<00:02:05.229> so

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
power tubes in the preamp distortion so

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:45.300 
power tubes in the preamp distortion so
you<00:02:05.530> can<00:02:05.770> really<00:02:05.979> hear<00:02:06.160> his<00:02:06.310> own<00:02:44.310> distortion

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
you can really hear his own distortion

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.020 
you can really hear his own distortion
on<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.489> it's<00:02:45.970> very<00:02:46.180> articulate<00:02:47.670> at<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.790> same

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
on it it's very articulate at the same

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.560 
on it it's very articulate at the same
time<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:50.280> I'm<00:02:51.280> gonna<00:02:51.430> dial<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.850> distortion<00:02:52.420> up

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
time so I'm gonna dial the distortion up

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.610 
time so I'm gonna dial the distortion up
even<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.900> little<00:02:53.049> more

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
even a little more

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:26.670 
even a little more
it<00:02:54.370> really<00:02:54.579> gets<00:02:54.940> a<00:02:55.120> nice<00:02:56.190> Marshall

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.500 

so<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:30.019> can<00:03:30.170> hear<00:03:30.849> nice<00:03:31.849> distortion

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
so that you can hear nice distortion

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.589 
so that you can hear nice distortion
thick<00:03:33.069> but<00:03:34.069> articulate<00:03:34.939> really<00:03:35.889> nice<00:03:36.889> tone<00:03:37.599> it

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
thick but articulate really nice tone it

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.160 
thick but articulate really nice tone it
also<00:03:38.750> has<00:03:39.019> a<00:03:39.049> second<00:03:39.829> input<00:03:40.430> which<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.359> lower

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
also has a second input which is a lower

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.280 
also has a second input which is a lower
DB<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.549> it

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
DB so it

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.750 
DB so it
there's<00:03:45.290> no<00:03:45.379> channel<00:03:45.799> switching<00:03:46.250> per<00:03:46.459> se<00:03:46.700> but

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
there's no channel switching per se but

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.629 
there's no channel switching per se but
you<00:03:47.090> could<00:03:47.239> plug<00:03:48.019> into<00:03:48.230> there<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:49.489> know

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
you could plug into there and you know

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.300 
you could plug into there and you know
uh<00:03:49.669> you<00:03:50.510> know<00:03:50.599> let's<00:03:50.810> input<00:03:50.989> basic<00:03:51.919> stuff<00:03:52.129> on

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
uh you know let's input basic stuff on

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.610 
uh you know let's input basic stuff on
them<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:55.209> that's<00:03:56.209> about<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:56.750> for<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.169> loose

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
them so that's about it for the loose

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.079 
them so that's about it for the loose
box<00:03:58.540> thanks<00:03:59.540> for<00:03:59.689> watching
