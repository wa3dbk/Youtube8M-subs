start you end up tacking on the fabric
and<00:02:47.610> you're<00:02:47.850> inking<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.660> with<00:02:48.810> nine<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.200> make

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
and you're inking it with nine to make

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.440 
and you're inking it with nine to make
it<00:02:49.440> nice<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.650> strong<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.060> process<00:02:51.360> that

you could do a whole wing in a day once
you've<00:03:57.150> mastered<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.630> technique<00:03:58.020> it<00:03:58.230> goes

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
you've mastered the technique it goes

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.680 
you've mastered the technique it goes
pretty<00:03:58.739> swiftly<00:03:59.160> actually<00:03:59.670> so<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.239> could<00:04:00.570> do

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
pretty swiftly actually so you could do

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.540 
pretty swiftly actually so you could do
a<00:04:00.720> whole<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:03.630> learnt<00:04:04.050> this<00:04:04.170> last<00:04:04.470> year<00:04:04.890> in<00:04:05.340> a

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
a whole I learnt this last year in a

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.910 
a whole I learnt this last year in a
couple<00:04:05.820> of<00:04:05.880> hours<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.600> I'm<00:04:06.900> relearned<00:04:07.680> it

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
couple of hours and I'm relearned it

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.110 
couple of hours and I'm relearned it
yesterday<00:04:08.370> morning<00:04:09.560> so<00:04:10.560> once<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.610> once<00:04:11.880> it's

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
yesterday morning so once you once it's

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.640 
yesterday morning so once you once it's
there<00:04:12.209> you've<00:04:12.750> got<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.959> basics<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.440> sort<00:04:13.620> of

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
there you've got the basics it sort of

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.979 
there you've got the basics it sort of
sticks<00:04:13.860> in<00:04:14.040> your<00:04:14.070> mind<00:04:14.340> we<00:04:15.209> have<00:04:15.360> got<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.570> manual

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
sticks in your mind we have got a manual

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.960 
sticks in your mind we have got a manual
provided<00:04:16.440> with<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.070> company<00:04:17.489> actually<00:04:17.609> and

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
provided with the company actually and

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.370 
provided with the company actually and
there's<00:04:18.120> also<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.390> video<00:04:18.570> on<00:04:18.840> YouTube<00:04:19.260> I

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
there's also a video on YouTube I

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.990 
there's also a video on YouTube I
believe<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.890> show<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.280> process<00:04:20.520> so

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
believe to show you the process so

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000 
believe to show you the process so
there's<00:04:21.180> plenty<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.480> ways<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:21.900> can<00:04:22.080> end<00:04:22.410> up

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
there's plenty of ways you can end up

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.409 
there's plenty of ways you can end up
gaining<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.460> knowledge<00:04:23.580> of<00:04:23.790> how<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.000> do<00:04:24.270> it

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
gaining the knowledge of how to do it

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:33.580 
gaining the knowledge of how to do it
but<00:04:24.960> obviously<00:04:25.080> practicing<00:04:26.040> is<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.250> best<00:04:26.430> way

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.290 

we're<00:04:34.590> here<00:04:34.770> now<00:04:34.800> with<00:04:34.979> Dave<00:04:35.550> Stonebridge<00:04:36.090> the

full-size mock-up of the Swift aircraft
itself<00:04:41.460> Dave<00:04:42.300> can<00:04:42.539> you<00:04:42.600> tell<00:04:42.810> me<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.930> little<00:04:43.020> bit

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
itself Dave can you tell me a little bit

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.020 
itself Dave can you tell me a little bit
about<00:04:43.410> this<00:04:43.560> development<00:04:44.039> please<00:04:44.220> yeah<00:04:44.850> well

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
about this development please yeah well

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.060 
about this development please yeah well
we<00:04:45.120> started<00:04:45.449> development<00:04:45.840> in<00:04:45.990> 2007<00:04:46.889> and

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
we started development in 2007 and

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.580 
we started development in 2007 and
basically<00:04:48.030> it's<00:04:48.300> been<00:04:48.449> a<00:04:48.509> bit<00:04:48.690> of<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.840> long<00:04:49.320> slog

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
basically it's been a bit of a long slog

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.230 
basically it's been a bit of a long slog
to<00:04:49.830> get<00:04:50.009> to<00:04:50.130> where<00:04:50.250> we<00:04:50.400> are<00:04:50.550> but<00:04:50.820> essentially

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
to get to where we are but essentially

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.340 
to get to where we are but essentially
where<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.419> aeroplane<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:51.900> mean<00:04:52.139> we<00:04:52.229> just

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
where the aeroplane I mean we just

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.230 
where the aeroplane I mean we just
wanted<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.680> bring<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.979> here<00:04:53.160> we<00:04:53.880> wanted<00:04:54.180> to

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
wanted to bring it here we wanted to

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.730 
wanted to bring it here we wanted to
have<00:04:54.509> an<00:04:54.600> aircraft<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.050> fulfilled<00:04:55.470> three

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
have an aircraft that fulfilled three

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.219 
have an aircraft that fulfilled three
markets<00:04:56.190> LS<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.789> kit<00:04:57.180> as<00:04:57.449> well<00:04:57.690> as<00:04:57.810> a<00:04:57.840> certified

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
markets LS a kit as well as a certified

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.260 
markets LS a kit as well as a certified
aircraft<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:59.400> it's<00:04:59.520> actually<00:04:59.759> taken<00:05:00.030> quite<00:05:00.210> a

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
aircraft so it's actually taken quite a

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.749 
aircraft so it's actually taken quite a
time<00:05:01.139> to<00:05:01.289> actually<00:05:01.530> develop<00:05:01.710> that<00:05:02.009> we<00:05:02.610> also

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 
time to actually develop that we also

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.430 
time to actually develop that we also
wanted<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.150> full<00:05:03.389> range<00:05:03.630> of<00:05:03.750> engines<00:05:04.139> from<00:05:04.289> a

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
wanted to full range of engines from a

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.620 
wanted to full range of engines from a
hundred<00:05:05.070> horsepower<00:05:05.310> up<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.699> 260<00:05:06.509> horsepower

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
hundred horsepower up to 260 horsepower

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.770 
hundred horsepower up to 260 horsepower
but<00:05:07.440> actually<00:05:08.280> changing<00:05:08.610> the<00:05:08.699> airframe<00:05:09.090> so

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
but actually changing the airframe so

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.020 
but actually changing the airframe so
you<00:05:10.050> know<00:05:10.169> to<00:05:11.009> try<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.430> get<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.669> into<00:05:11.880> one

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
you know to try and get that into one

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.089 
you know to try and get that into one
design<00:05:12.210> has<00:05:12.539> taken<00:05:12.870> quite<00:05:13.050> some<00:05:13.259> time<00:05:13.500> but

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
design has taken quite some time but

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.279 
design has taken quite some time but
fundamentally<00:05:14.699> so<00:05:15.570> this<00:05:15.720> is<00:05:15.900> where<00:05:16.169> we<00:05:16.259> are

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
fundamentally so this is where we are

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.080 
fundamentally so this is where we are
the<00:05:16.620> shape<00:05:16.889> dimensions<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.729> law<00:05:17.849> will<00:05:18.060> be

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
the shape dimensions the law will be

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.240 
the shape dimensions the law will be
uniform<00:05:18.870> across<00:05:19.139> the<00:05:19.320> range<00:05:19.530> the<00:05:20.039> only

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
uniform across the range the only

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.469 
uniform across the range the only
difference<00:05:20.580> will<00:05:20.699> be<00:05:20.729> for<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.000> 260

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
difference will be for the 260

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.120 
difference will be for the 260
horsepower<00:05:21.630> nose<00:05:22.229> will<00:05:22.380> be<00:05:22.470> slightly<00:05:22.949> longer

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
horsepower nose will be slightly longer

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.360 
horsepower nose will be slightly longer
okay<00:05:23.849> but<00:05:24.599> in<00:05:24.720> terms<00:05:24.960> of<00:05:25.229> yeah<00:05:25.740> 200<00:05:26.130> horsepower

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
okay but in terms of yeah 200 horsepower

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.240 
okay but in terms of yeah 200 horsepower
and<00:05:26.880> below<00:05:27.090> that<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.479> amp<00:05:27.750> yeah<00:05:28.349> it<00:05:29.099> will<00:05:29.190> be

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
and below that the amp yeah it will be

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.070 
and below that the amp yeah it will be
this<00:05:29.490> and<00:05:30.090> when<00:05:30.330> we'll<00:05:30.509> be<00:05:30.539> seeing<00:05:30.870> flying

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
this and when we'll be seeing flying

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.820 
this and when we'll be seeing flying
next<00:05:31.800> year<00:05:32.180> that's<00:05:33.180> pretty<00:05:33.360> confident<00:05:33.840> have

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
next year that's pretty confident have

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:42.029 
next year that's pretty confident have
to<00:05:34.949> be<00:05:35.070> done

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.920 

yesterday<00:05:42.849> we<00:05:43.029> took<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.300> chance<00:05:43.539> to<00:05:43.719> talk<00:05:43.900> to

yesterday we took the chance to talk to

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.409 
yesterday we took the chance to talk to

while we were chatting to Mike we also

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.209 
while we were chatting to Mike we also
brought<00:05:52.300> up<00:05:52.449> the<00:05:52.479> subject<00:05:52.809> of<00:05:53.110> IFR<00:05:53.860> flights

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
brought up the subject of IFR flights

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.129 
brought up the subject of IFR flights
for<00:05:54.430> permit<00:05:54.789> aircraft<00:05:55.210> something<00:05:55.960> there's

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:56.139 
for permit aircraft something there's

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.540 
for permit aircraft something there's
certainly<00:05:56.589> been<00:05:56.680> gaining<00:05:57.009> sending<00:05:57.430> of<00:05:57.490> a

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
certainly been gaining sending of a

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.679 
certainly been gaining sending of a
groundswell<00:05:57.909> of<00:05:58.089> opinion<00:05:58.599> amongst<00:05:59.349> pilots

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:00.689 
groundswell of opinion amongst pilots

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:02.909 
groundswell of opinion amongst pilots
well<00:06:01.689> that's<00:06:01.960> an<00:06:02.020> interesting<00:06:02.379> question<00:06:02.499> and

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
well that's an interesting question and

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.119 
well that's an interesting question and
obviously<00:06:03.399> I<00:06:03.430> know<00:06:03.580> where<00:06:03.879> you're<00:06:03.999> asking<00:06:04.389> it

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
obviously I know where you're asking it

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.969 
obviously I know where you're asking it
in<00:06:06.129> my<00:06:06.309> la<00:06:06.759> job<00:06:07.240> I<00:06:07.659> was<00:06:08.139> very<00:06:08.319> instrumental<00:06:08.589> in

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
in my la job I was very instrumental in

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.700 
in my la job I was very instrumental in
moving<00:06:09.309> this<00:06:09.580> project<00:06:09.969> along<00:06:10.409> from<00:06:11.409> a<00:06:11.469> CIA

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
moving this project along from a CIA

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.379 
moving this project along from a CIA
perspective<00:06:12.219> I<00:06:12.279> think<00:06:12.309> beyond<00:06:12.969> it<00:06:13.180> will<00:06:13.270> be

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
perspective I think beyond it will be

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.409 
perspective I think beyond it will be
not<00:06:13.599> unfair<00:06:14.050> to<00:06:14.199> say<00:06:14.349> that<00:06:14.379> um<00:06:15.029> the<00:06:16.029> project's

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
not unfair to say that um the project's

not unfair to say that um the project's

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:18.939 
making good progress we've a lot more

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:21.779

work<00:06:19.120> to<00:06:19.149> do<00:06:19.330> yet<00:06:19.569> with<00:06:19.779> the<00:06:19.870> laa<00:06:20.110> to<00:06:20.639> make<00:06:21.639> sure

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
work to do yet with the laa to make sure

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.110 
work to do yet with the laa to make sure
we<00:06:21.999> have<00:06:22.210> a<00:06:22.419> fit<00:06:22.960> for<00:06:23.169> purpose<00:06:23.610> air<00:06:24.610> worthiness

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
we have a fit for purpose air worthiness

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.670 
we have a fit for purpose air worthiness
standard<00:06:25.659> against<00:06:25.930> which<00:06:25.960> we<00:06:26.229> can<00:06:26.349> judge<00:06:26.529> the

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
standard against which we can judge the

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.100 
standard against which we can judge the
aircraft<00:06:27.069> but<00:06:27.309> um<00:06:27.599> so<00:06:28.599> long<00:06:28.749> as<00:06:28.899> the<00:06:28.990> aircraft

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
aircraft but um so long as the aircraft

the pilot is rated and the aircraft
suitably<00:06:34.539> equipped<00:06:34.949> we<00:06:35.949> can<00:06:36.159> see<00:06:36.370> no

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
suitably equipped we can see no

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.489 
suitably equipped we can see no
principled<00:06:37.419> reason<00:06:37.539> why<00:06:37.990> we<00:06:38.169> shouldn't<00:06:38.349> allow

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:38.499 
principled reason why we shouldn't allow

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:43.529 
principled reason why we shouldn't allow
this<00:06:38.800> so<00:06:41.399> we<00:06:42.399> don't<00:06:42.580> want<00:06:42.759> to<00:06:42.969> we<00:06:43.270> don't<00:06:43.360> want

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
this so we don't want to we don't want

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:44.820 
this so we don't want to we don't want
to<00:06:43.599> pull<00:06:43.779> a<00:06:43.809> date<00:06:44.020> out<00:06:44.199> of<00:06:44.319> the<00:06:44.379> Hat<00:06:44.559> but<00:06:44.740> I

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:44.830 
to pull a date out of the Hat but I

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.199 
to pull a date out of the Hat but I
think<00:06:44.979> what<00:06:45.129> we<00:06:45.219> can<00:06:45.339> say<00:06:45.610> is<00:06:45.819> that<00:06:46.029> in<00:06:46.149> the

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:46.209 
think what we can say is that in the

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:47.699 
think what we can say is that in the
not-too-distant<00:06:46.569> future<00:06:46.899> we<00:06:47.349> should<00:06:47.529> be<00:06:47.620> able

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:47.709 
not-too-distant future we should be able

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:51.059 
not-too-distant future we should be able
to<00:06:47.830> see<00:06:48.009> some<00:06:48.309> movement<00:06:48.969> some<00:06:49.949> prototyping<00:06:50.949> of

to see some movement some prototyping of

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:52.949 
to see some movement some prototyping of
the<00:06:51.159> process<00:06:51.580> and<00:06:51.849> a<00:06:51.879> few<00:06:52.120> aircraft<00:06:52.300> launched

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:52.959 
the process and a few aircraft launched

the process and a few aircraft launched
into<00:06:53.289> intercloud

weather with a view to making it

weather with a view to making it
something<00:06:57.519> that's<00:06:57.669> more<00:06:58.330> accessible<00:06:58.659> later

00:06:59.159 --> 00:06:59.169 
something that's more accessible later

something that's more accessible later
as<00:06:59.439> we<00:06:59.800> know<00:06:59.919> the<00:07:00.069> Vulcan<00:07:00.490> was<00:07:00.999> approved<00:07:01.360> for<00:07:01.449> a

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:04.899 
day IFR the other week so I'm no reason

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:06.959 
day IFR the other week so I'm no reason
why<00:07:05.050> some<00:07:05.589> of<00:07:05.620> the<00:07:05.769> LA<00:07:06.039> permit<00:07:06.430> fleet<00:07:06.639> can't<00:07:06.849> be

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:06.969 
why some of the LA permit fleet can't be

why some of the LA permit fleet can't be
