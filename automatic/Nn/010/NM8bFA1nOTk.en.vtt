00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.380

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.070
 the antiquity of the meat character 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.220
 all this is about walking 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.690
 some things of friends that have already retired 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.650
 that already 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.650
 they left 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.740
 by his side 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.760
 and this all the things that are old 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.760
 I know you are doing history 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.990
 out there you buy that those two cyclists 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.189
 yes 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.080
 so I think the medal and the 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.360
 magazine but all that given what you 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.880
 are you doing 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.980
 and the work that they are doing what 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.550
 you want to do in the antiquities of the 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.550
 wrestling I hope a jump 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:17.110
 but what good I congratulate 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.110
 show what to do before giving you 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.780
 I really that's how it is for me or 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.209
 I do not have words because, because 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.859
 see here for example we were time 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.709
 talking not I wanted everyone 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.540
 you were like participating in this 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.090
 he is right now giving me a gift 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.879
 example the lagarde jacket is 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.250
 jacket in the option in the seventies and 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.500
 they are this is a relic is not how I 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.180
 comment now I have it there and 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.359
 I would like someone to know then 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.060
 how to take care of it and put it as it should be 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.250
 right now in some exhibition in something 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.360
 and well, it 's my commitment to 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:00.380
 you can not later like 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.110
 Then I can share everything and 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.880
 have it on display to be part 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.380
 of the followers so way this one 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.890
 also so that you have the equipment 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.890
 full 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.240
 I believe that if people see it 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.590
 recognizes that it is not the most expensive 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.240
 problem and it's over you already have your hours of 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.570
 flight how many 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.459
 a teacher somewhat tired with time 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.230
 that has been saved because also 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.239
 the designs of this layer tell us a 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.160
 little story you design yourself 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:42.300
 all this is part 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.300
 DurÃ¡n is wrong 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.660
 of the Aztecs and how is part of the 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.340
 character well I also want you to have 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.340
 something here present 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.430
 it can not be helped 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.040
 in the layers in 75 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.740
 plus 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.900
 and I think that the person who is 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.830
 falling you will not find others 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.830
 find this 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.639
 and this since I started to change 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.289
 and it is a complete being 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.819
 and if you can see it you will find it in 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.819
 other magazines and 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.280
 the truth is a big fan of yours I say 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.100
 that the people who are seeing us then 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.320
 there are many people who appreciate you 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.140
 we want to thank all of that 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.000
 career that you have given not only in Mexico 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.710
 but in Japan around the world has 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.710
 represented Mexican wrestling 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.820
 a youtube program 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:27.040
 presented me for fighting followed by such 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.950
 I was out but I'm still 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.960
 going with another souvenir with other things 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.820
 but you 're not going to find and you're going to 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.350
 give an account 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.350
 and from there you can take the time 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.570
 Y 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.639
 these are unique things because 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.639
 usually does not sign masks 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.250
 and more because all the time we spend 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.230
 talking together I thank you and then 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.870
 well this is going to be good 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.650
 connection I hope you do not come to visit the 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.650
 house after 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.210
 yes 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:30.569
 brother carlos greets
