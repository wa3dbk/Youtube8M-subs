water fire and grass while the Pokemon
types<00:00:43.530> would<00:00:43.680> work<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.789> mean<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.000> in

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
types would work and I mean that in

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.750 
types would work and I mean that in
terms<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:46.230> chef<00:00:46.590> three<00:00:46.920> pokemon<00:00:47.219> types

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
terms of which chef three pokemon types

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.450 
terms of which chef three pokemon types
have<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.750> Pokemon<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.800> super<00:00:50.280> strong

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
have a Pokemon that is super strong

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.240 
have a Pokemon that is super strong
against<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.710> weak<00:00:52.710> against<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> other

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
against one and weak against the other

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.479 
against one and weak against the other
and<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:54.059> works<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.449> all<00:00:54.510> three<00:00:54.719> pokemon

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
and that works for all three pokemon

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.069 
and that works for all three pokemon
because<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.610> know<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.789> fire<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.629> weak<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
because we know that fire is weak to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.779 
because we know that fire is weak to
water<00:00:58.289> our<00:00:58.440> water<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.859> weak<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.160> grass<00:00:59.399> grass

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
