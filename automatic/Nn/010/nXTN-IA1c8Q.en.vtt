2,000 miles previous owner has got the

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.360 
2,000 miles previous owner has got the
River<00:02:55.360> limiting<00:02:56.360> lights<00:02:56.930> set<00:02:57.920> up<00:02:58.099> ten

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
River limiting lights set up ten

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.130 
River limiting lights set up ten
thousand<00:02:58.879> when<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.120> can<00:02:59.269> go<00:02:59.420> up<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.690> thirteen

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
thousand when it can go up to thirteen

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.440 
thousand when it can go up to thirteen
so

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450

see<00:03:01.990> what<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.140> can<00:03:02.350> do

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.890 

let's<00:03:08.580> see<00:03:08.790> what<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.000> sounds<00:03:09.360> like<00:03:09.420> going

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
let's see what it sounds like going

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.610 
let's see what it sounds like going
right<00:03:10.140> up<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> limit

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
right up to the limit

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.270 
right up to the limit
ready

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.530 

well<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.310> don't<00:03:18.550> know<00:03:18.640> if<00:03:18.790> you've<00:03:18.910> got<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.360> but

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
well I don't know if you've got that but

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:26.800 
well I don't know if you've got that but
that<00:03:19.629> sounded<00:03:20.019> pretty<00:03:20.080> cool

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.089 

it<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.800> good<00:03:28.010> fun<00:03:28.330> it's<00:03:29.330> a<00:03:29.390> Hurley<00:03:29.660> goodbye

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.099 

in<00:03:34.189> 211<00:03:35.319> and<00:03:36.319> I<00:03:36.439> was<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:36.680> third<00:03:36.980> I<00:03:37.959> don't<00:03:38.959> even

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
in 211 and I was in third I don't even

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.900 
in 211 and I was in third I don't even
have<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.439> think<00:03:39.680> about<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:40.700> corners

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.480 

at<00:03:44.360> all<00:03:46.090> it's<00:03:47.090> incredible<00:03:47.630> incredible<00:03:48.490> an

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
at all it's incredible incredible an

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.940 
at all it's incredible incredible an
amazing<00:03:50.030> machine<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.600> just<00:03:51.200> don't<00:03:51.590> know<00:03:51.740> if<00:03:51.770> I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
amazing machine I just don't know if I

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.670 
amazing machine I just don't know if I
suit<00:03:52.220> them<00:03:52.400> anymore

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
suit them anymore

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.810 
suit them anymore
lovely<00:03:54.790> okay<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:57.710> so<00:03:57.980> much<00:03:58.190> faster<00:03:58.490> than

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
lovely okay and it's so much faster than

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.990 
lovely okay and it's so much faster than
the<00:03:58.940> thruxton<00:03:59.420> it's<00:03:59.630> just<00:03:59.810> on<00:04:00.140> an<00:04:00.230> unlevel<00:04:01.000> but

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
the thruxton it's just on an unlevel but

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.300 
the thruxton it's just on an unlevel but
it<00:04:02.990> doesn't<00:04:03.290> look<00:04:03.380> anything<00:04:03.710> like<00:04:03.890> the

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
it doesn't look anything like the

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.809 
it doesn't look anything like the
Thruxton<00:04:05.210> at<00:04:05.630> all

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.479 

so<00:04:09.360> I've<00:04:09.420> got<00:04:09.510> 105<00:04:10.140> brake<00:04:10.500> horsepower<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.250> think

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
so I've got 105 brake horsepower I think

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.839 
so I've got 105 brake horsepower I think
50<00:04:11.969> Newton<00:04:12.329> meters<00:04:12.659> a<00:04:12.719> talk

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
50 Newton meters a talk

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.240 
50 Newton meters a talk
yeah<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.060> it's<00:04:15.150> obviously<00:04:15.530> tuned<00:04:16.530> for<00:04:16.979> power

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
yeah and it's obviously tuned for power

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.900 
yeah and it's obviously tuned for power
rather<00:04:17.669> than<00:04:17.940> talk<00:04:19.100> having<00:04:20.100> all<00:04:20.310> these<00:04:20.549> revs

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
rather than talk having all these revs

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.029 
rather than talk having all these revs
to<00:04:21.090> play<00:04:21.299> with<00:04:21.539> almost<00:04:21.930> twice<00:04:22.259> as<00:04:22.320> many<00:04:22.650> as<00:04:22.889> I'm

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
to play with almost twice as many as I'm

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.990 
to play with almost twice as many as I'm
used<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.990> it's<00:04:24.990> quite<00:04:25.229> fun<00:04:25.590> it's<00:04:26.550> very<00:04:26.610> good

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
used to it's quite fun it's very good

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.430 
used to it's quite fun it's very good
fun<00:04:27.770> right<00:04:28.770> well<00:04:29.009> this<00:04:29.130> is<00:04:29.370> quite<00:04:29.699> something

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
fun right well this is quite something

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.129 
fun right well this is quite something
having<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.500> whale<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:31.889> time<00:04:32.630> but<00:04:33.630> it's<00:04:33.900> just

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
having a whale of a time but it's just

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.870 
having a whale of a time but it's just
so<00:04:34.440> easy<00:04:35.039> to<00:04:35.520> go<00:04:35.669> so<00:04:36.060> fast<00:04:36.539> on<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.400> do<00:04:38.400> feel

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
so easy to go so fast on it I do feel

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.080 
so easy to go so fast on it I do feel
like<00:04:38.910> I'm<00:04:39.360> just<00:04:39.389> sitting<00:04:39.900> on<00:04:40.910> sitting<00:04:41.910> on<00:04:42.000> the

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
like I'm just sitting on sitting on the

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.800 
like I'm just sitting on sitting on the
engine

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.600 

which<00:04:47.790> I'm<00:04:48.790> not<00:04:48.940> sure<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.120> like<00:04:49.270> I<00:04:49.450> don't<00:04:49.570> know

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
which I'm not sure I like I don't know

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.260 
which I'm not sure I like I don't know
and<00:04:51.610> see<00:04:51.970> bumpy<00:04:52.389> bumpy<00:04:52.660> road<00:04:52.920> comfy<00:04:54.120> now<00:04:55.120> that

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
and see bumpy bumpy road comfy now that

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.460 
and see bumpy bumpy road comfy now that
they<00:04:55.450> these<00:04:55.630> bumps<00:04:56.050> are<00:04:56.139> much<00:04:56.290> more

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
they these bumps are much more

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.550 
they these bumps are much more
comfortable<00:04:56.740> than<00:04:57.010> they<00:04:57.850> would<00:04:58.030> be<00:04:58.350> on<00:04:59.350> my

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
comfortable than they would be on my

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.589 
comfortable than they would be on my
thruxton

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
thruxton

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:13.300 
thruxton
and<00:05:02.169> it's<00:05:02.289> still<00:05:02.409> bumpy<00:05:02.830> but<00:05:03.129> much<00:05:03.309> better

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.780 

that's<00:05:13.850> under<00:05:14.060> full<00:05:14.270> throttle<00:05:15.400> that's<00:05:16.400> right

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
that's under full throttle that's right

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.600 
that's under full throttle that's right
yeah<00:05:17.330> it's<00:05:17.690> quite<00:05:17.900> fun<00:05:18.200> but<00:05:18.470> then

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.730 

doesn't<00:05:22.909> feel<00:05:23.090> ballistic<00:05:24.050> maybe<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.409> speed

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
doesn't feel ballistic maybe the speed

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.279 
doesn't feel ballistic maybe the speed
ship<00:05:25.009> will<00:05:25.189> feel<00:05:25.550> ballistic<00:05:26.090> 330<00:05:26.930> break

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
ship will feel ballistic 330 break

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.850 
ship will feel ballistic 330 break
instead<00:05:27.590> of<00:05:27.939> 105<00:05:28.939> I<00:05:29.210> don't<00:05:29.419> have

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.010 

but<00:05:34.130> pop<00:05:34.310> this<00:05:34.460> extra<00:05:34.820> power<00:05:35.450> I<00:05:35.480> don't<00:05:35.780> think

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
but pop this extra power I don't think

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.630 
but pop this extra power I don't think
it's<00:05:36.200> worth<00:05:36.440> getting<00:05:36.650> rid<00:05:36.860> of<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.010> thrust<00:05:37.280> for

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
it's worth getting rid of the thrust for

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:45.939 
it's worth getting rid of the thrust for
this<00:05:37.780> got<00:05:38.780> terrible

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.020 

and<00:05:46.949> I've<00:05:47.100> only<00:05:47.280> locked<00:05:47.490> up<00:05:47.639> the<00:05:47.729> rear<00:05:47.850> wheel<00:05:48.000> a

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
and I've only locked up the rear wheel a

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.960 
and I've only locked up the rear wheel a
couple<00:05:48.360> of<00:05:48.419> time

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
couple of time

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.430 
couple of time
there's<00:05:50.970> no<00:05:51.150> jerking<00:05:51.449> us<00:05:51.690> and<00:05:51.870> there's<00:05:52.020> I<00:05:52.110> jerk

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
there's no jerking us and there's I jerk

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.180 
there's no jerking us and there's I jerk
it<00:05:52.590> myself

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
it myself

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.110 
it myself
as<00:05:54.060> it<00:05:54.360> were<00:05:55.400> it's<00:05:56.400> weird

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
as it were it's weird

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.060 
as it were it's weird
hey<00:05:57.419> I<00:05:57.930> had<00:05:58.260> one<00:05:58.410> of<00:05:58.500> these<00:05:58.620> for<00:06:01.010> thousands<00:06:02.010> and

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
hey I had one of these for thousands and

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.730 
hey I had one of these for thousands and
thousands<00:06:02.550> of<00:06:02.639> miles<00:06:02.820> but<00:06:03.290> this<00:06:04.290> is<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.560> new

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
thousands of miles but this is the new

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.780 
thousands of miles but this is the new
iteration<00:06:05.510> perhaps<00:06:06.800> perhaps<00:06:07.800> with<00:06:08.220> the<00:06:08.430> arrow

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
iteration perhaps perhaps with the arrow

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.220 
iteration perhaps perhaps with the arrow
I'd<00:06:09.150> be<00:06:09.330> more

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230
