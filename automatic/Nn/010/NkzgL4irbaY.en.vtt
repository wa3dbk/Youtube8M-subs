 even terrain looks very nice 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.650
 on the lips and twigs walking a little bit 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.599
 principle with a catalog of such similar to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.570

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.930

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.930

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.070

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.390
 they are applied each and then wean 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.800
 it is your pigment that is applied 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.780
 they hold on tight for a while 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.220
 the brightest shades have this property 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.890
 as well as the delivery would let me show you 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.900

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.180
 Sea Castle 3 rubles for you but the cop in 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.400
 I stayed even in the morning so by 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.159
 perseverance can recommend them from 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.799
 someone is looking for so much lipstick so here 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.759
 this shade was poisoned on my lips 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.110
 so bright is called principle with 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.770
 the catalog is also pretty similar 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:37.979
 shade very beautiful this type 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:44.780
 also said summer is very beautiful 2 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:50.400
 shades really flies right 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.440
 the pigment is incredibly strong 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.510
 on the prize of the number of girls I have not yet 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.740
 applied 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.060
 can't tell you how he will be himself 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.460
 carry on balm 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.590
 but after these lipsticks really stockings 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.470
 need is forcibly important not a cube and therefore 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.890
 that the cubes are overdried all someone does not like 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.490
 dry weather lipstick that dries this 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.880
 fudge is not for you the leading fudge is 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.940
 juicy peach 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.400
 he looks like that jump in the muse directory 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.600
 the directory seems to me a little different 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:29.330
 because this shade is pretty 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:34.890
 brighter than the darker cubits skin 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:37.310
 turns on the skin it looks like this 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.510

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.220
 a little more simple brighter 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.310
 It looks like this 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:58.610
 by force 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:01.569
 such a red color is also very 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.170

 directory it seems so that's it 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.790
 this last shade 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:26.030

 as if ripe grapes then he is so paying 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.970
 the same skin tone here it seems 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.460
 strawberries are much darker than in the catalog 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.370
 it is the most beautiful shade and sectors 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:26.620
 Here it is really like I 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:26.620
 just a bastard of such awards for such 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:35.690

 black some dark but very cool 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.610
 and very track 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.000
 in what looks like a half a year 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.469
 hue is an exquisite bodily nicotine 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.699
 in the sampler, he's probably a little darker 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:06.830
 principle is similar with a directory like this 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:10.009
 ordinary brown so brown 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.500
 beige tint and especially i wouldn't 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.889
 I said that I am a lover of this 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.979

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:22.610
 looks pretty and the last shade 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:27.590
 so delicately violet called probes 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:32.300
 it still seems a little bit lighter 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:36.099
 on the handle and it basically looks 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:40.539
 top quark on the lips is also very bright 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:43.550
