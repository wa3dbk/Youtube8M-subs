00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.439
 Nyenrode was able to do this on the Netherlands' most prestigious business university 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.789
 they mainly try to gain insight into the hard figures 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.039
 find the answer to the question how the company reports financially the most 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.729
 becomes successful 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:19.909
 the 84-year-old paul de blot was calculated for this two years ago 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:24.129
 each other to establish the first chair of business spirituality in the Netherlands 

00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:24.970
 to target 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.019
 and because of the enormous success he can stick to it for two years now I 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.249
 publicly rate the best spurter 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.740
 So that shows that it is indeed 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.280
 a hole is being made 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.900
 I actually have it there 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.590
 I may say so 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.260
 gemert 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.290
 I have tip the point of my life 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.310
 concentration camp 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.470
 I noticed there 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.140
 he climbed 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.330
 the strikers 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.720
 and then comes the control 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.540
 and he is capable of anything 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.030
 premier toronto of something beautiful and that has french city 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.030
 he is the power of spyker 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.460
 the hunger for that spirituality is only increasing 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.590
 the businesslife 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.920
 yes i knew so anyway more than you have to figure yourself he was only man 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.329
 but also not always on 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.850
 heerenveen and theo is very popular nowadays 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.530
 I can also imagine that this time your time and limited course will be different by d 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.530
 soft g soft sides of life more with this family 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.830
 yes, and that this time will increasingly participate 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.230
 and how that should go according to bild you have to work according to insight no went 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.050
 so back to the core 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.620
 if you then feel like being a citizen 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.170
 a point by point of this still with the family the plague entrepreneurs and the family 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.740
 to undertake 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.170
 it still appears 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.170
 because he is for power public of the family 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.810
 the family goes out of your way because you have an opponent 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.550
 the company has no trouble with opposing family 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.120
 This man and woman have all sexes at all times 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.610
 what does that mean 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.630
 that anyway 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.340
 type there is a connection on his steps 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.739
 the brit looks at his things 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.449
 sweet to do not grant a lady with the soft and sweet pit stops 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.449
 But that point is the disappointing data 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.350
 follow the path of love and your company will reap the benefits 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.119
 satisfied and creative employees loyal customers m profitability 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:35.319
 and that is of course good for the students 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.749
 finally a final tip of plots for all existing and future 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.109
 entrepreneurs 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.509
 Weert Anp hits the front 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.359
 anp adb fights for what people do for them 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.799
 this can take hold 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.119
 to know 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.369
 do you have a piece 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.329
 whatever reads 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.329
 cheapest one price is you smile 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.099

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:05.899
