 those by the margin program is to say

 order to buy any ingots 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.100
 from 1 to 100 grams 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.030
 or if you want it and also you can 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.250
 through the marketing program if by 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.580
 example a person does not have means 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.770
 enough you can buy all this 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.460
 whole by minimum value of 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.080
 seven thousand euros making a pre-payment 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.390
 worth 500 euros 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.320
 the rest eating will pay in installments with your 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.070
 money 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.670
 or else he will pay for it with the bonds that 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.280
 company receipts 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.440
 for recommending the company that is to say for 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.540
 bring you clients 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.150
 how the marketing problem works 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.590
 While the program have brands 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.720
 decisions as follows 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.060
 Each customer makes a purchase per 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.610
 value of 7 thousand euros a minimum purchase 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.440
 criticism to the client to perform said 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.180
 buy then they have the right to participate 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.820
 in the program 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.090
 you have to make a pre-payment by value 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:17.500
 minimum of 500 euros can be a value 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.260
 top up to 6,500 and the entire amount 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.230
 remaining or you will pay with your money 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.209
 or we may have said it with the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.680
 bonuses that I receive I may be able to 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:32.560
 recommend the company and you get a 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.030
 person when he prepares well 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.040
 very good question 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.620
 let's imagine that we go to a dealer 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.239
 of mercedes cars and we're going to 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.830
 make a purchase of a vehicle what 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.830
 first thing we're going to do is select 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.570
 in this case we will select the product 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.480
 which are ingots of investment euros 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.270
 well we would do a prepayment normally a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.680
 20 30 percent that when 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.560
 asked for the medium not when we 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.209
 deliver to pay the amount 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.190
 remaining that we receive in return that you 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.890
 we receive an invoice that is the right 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.750
 to receive the product in this case would be 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.209
 it would be exactly the same thing we will receive 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.310
 an invoice for having said the deposit 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.180
 and for making the purchase of the set 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.850
 whole, although the rates vary 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.100
 to the newspaper can practically happen 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.130
 because for the same seven thousand euros not 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.630
 receive the whole set may 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.510
 lack the public to have the odd 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.090
 assistant and if for example the rates of 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.830
 euro would then receive the set of 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.950
 ingots burials or even some 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.379
 alludes to the traditional ingot more 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.010
 briefly this is the operation of 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:49.760
 what happens is a person performs 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.220
 prepayment over 500 speaks well very 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.290
 good question when the prepayment is 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.879
 higher than 500 for example thousand 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.610
 five hundred euros 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:01.459
 for 500 euros would be the prepayment for the 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.519
 set of seven thousand will not place you in 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.470
 the marketing program well in all 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.379
 the remaining thousand for the remaining thousand 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.040
 because in your back office they will appear 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.870
 gold bullion so the company will 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.380
 will sell euro bullion by value of 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.389
 the thousand euros while all those 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.630
 sales of those next thousand euros the 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.210
 company will receive its own reward 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.330
 your own benefit and with your own 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.430
 benefit will place the customer in the 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.220
 marketing program is to say in a 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.170
 order list 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.050
 and what would happen in the event that a 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.360
 Prepay person and do not make the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.630
 recommendations for the company in this 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.630
 case is simply past two cycles 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.470
 Gold would be sold for the value of 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.470
 money you have 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.990
 good as you could check in 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.460
 these simple questions have been clarified 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.020
 many questions about the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.560
 operation of the company in 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.560
 governments
