00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and apply sort of in a V here and and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.979 
and apply sort of in a V here and and
perhaps<00:02:19.230> some<00:02:19.709> on<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.250> front<00:02:20.609> of<00:02:20.819> my<00:02:20.969> legs<00:02:21.239> as

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
perhaps some on the front of my legs as

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.229 
perhaps some on the front of my legs as
well<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:23.310> i'll<00:02:23.370> probably<00:02:23.579> be<00:02:23.790> using<00:02:23.939> that

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
well and so i'll probably be using that

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.390 
well and so i'll probably be using that
our<00:02:24.480> upcoming<00:02:24.930> parties<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.920> think<00:02:26.189> this<00:02:26.250> will

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
our upcoming parties I think this will

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.309 
our upcoming parties I think this will
be<00:02:26.459> great<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.150> really<00:02:27.599> popular<00:02:28.140> come

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
be great and really popular come

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.849 
be great and really popular come
christmas<00:02:28.859> 2010<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.230> one<00:02:31.230> because<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:31.680> so

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
christmas 2010 and one because it's so

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.789 
christmas 2010 and one because it's so
different<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:33.079> to<00:02:34.079> just<00:02:34.349> because<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
different and to just because of the

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.149 
different and to just because of the
coloring<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:35.939> see<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:37.079> tinge<00:02:37.920> it's

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
coloring you can see that the tinge it's

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.300 
coloring you can see that the tinge it's
got<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.609> there<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.150> i<00:02:39.959> just<00:02:40.799> try<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.129> move

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
got to it there and i just try and move

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.059 
got to it there and i just try and move
my<00:02:41.489> light<00:02:41.700> rekluse<00:02:43.340> with<00:02:44.340> me<00:02:44.540> so<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:46.560> can<00:02:46.769> see

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
my light rekluse with me so you can see

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.349 
my light rekluse with me so you can see
it<00:02:47.250> shimmers<00:02:47.700> there<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:50.819> sort<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.239> got

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
it shimmers there and and it sort of got

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.809 
it shimmers there and and it sort of got
a<00:02:51.450> blue<00:02:53.269> blue<00:02:54.269> look<00:02:54.569> rather<00:02:54.900> than<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
a blue blue look rather than the

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.699 
a blue blue look rather than the
rose-colored<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:57.030> usually<00:02:57.480> get<00:02:57.689> and<00:02:57.959> i

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
rose-colored that usually get and i

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.640 
rose-colored that usually get and i
think<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.310> will<00:02:59.489> really<00:02:59.549> really<00:02:59.969> suit<00:03:00.329> and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
think this will really really suit and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.559 
think this will really really suit and
people<00:03:01.650> with<00:03:01.799> my<00:03:01.950> coloring<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.609> well<00:03:02.819> with<00:03:03.419> the

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
people with my coloring as well with the

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.839 
people with my coloring as well with the
dark<00:03:03.840> hair<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.560> I've<00:03:05.189> got<00:03:05.459> sort<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.760> a

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
dark hair and I've got sort of a

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.050 
dark hair and I've got sort of a
blue-black<00:03:06.329> tinge<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.870> mine<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.700> and<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.819> think

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
blue-black tinge to mine and and I think

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.179 
blue-black tinge to mine and and I think
it<00:03:09.180> all<00:03:09.329> it<00:03:09.870> does<00:03:10.079> really<00:03:10.319> complements<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
it all it does really complements it

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.819 
it all it does really complements it
much<00:03:12.090> more<00:03:12.359> than<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.689> Pink's<00:03:13.079> actually<00:03:13.560> and

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
much more than the Pink's actually and

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.399 
much more than the Pink's actually and
and<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.879> looks<00:03:15.120> nice<00:03:15.389> with<00:03:15.689> I've<00:03:15.870> got<00:03:16.019> a<00:03:16.049> tiny

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
and it looks nice with I've got a tiny

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.550 
and it looks nice with I've got a tiny
bit<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:17.010> center<00:03:17.669> pay<00:03:18.109> bronzer<00:03:19.109> here<00:03:19.349> you

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
bit of the center pay bronzer here you

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.619 
bit of the center pay bronzer here you
can<00:03:19.769> just<00:03:19.799> see<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.220> dark<00:03:20.579> there<00:03:20.879> it

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
can just see the dark there it

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.800 
can just see the dark there it
complements<00:03:22.409> it<00:03:22.560> really<00:03:22.889> really<00:03:23.129> well<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.810> so

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
complements it really really well and so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.839 
complements it really really well and so
I<00:03:25.139> think<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.769> should<00:03:25.919> get<00:03:26.159> this<00:03:26.340> i<00:03:26.549> think<00:03:26.729> it's

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
I think you should get this i think it's

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.789 
I think you should get this i think it's
fantastic<00:03:27.079> definitely<00:03:28.079> go<00:03:28.199> out<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.500> try<00:03:28.739> it

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
fantastic definitely go out and try it

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.129 
fantastic definitely go out and try it
and<00:03:29.220> hand<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.269> pop<00:03:30.479> in<00:03:30.599> your<00:03:30.659> handbag<00:03:30.959> as

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
and hand it to pop in your handbag as

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.899 
and hand it to pop in your handbag as
well<00:03:31.169> so<00:03:31.889> if<00:03:31.979> you're<00:03:32.099> looking<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.489> bit<00:03:32.519> worse

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
well so if you're looking a bit worse

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.460 
well so if you're looking a bit worse

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
bit more and and yeah i like to say I'd

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.319 
bit more and and yeah i like to say I'd
apply<00:03:40.079> it<00:03:40.139> under<00:03:40.409> here<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.919> the<00:03:41.280> tip<00:03:41.639> that<00:03:42.269> I

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
help slim your entire face so maybe not

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.719 
help slim your entire face so maybe not
quite<00:03:52.319> on<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.650> end<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.829> my<00:03:52.889> nose<00:03:53.159> there<00:03:53.400> that's

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
quite on the end of my nose there that's

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.909 
quite on the end of my nose there that's
quite<00:03:53.939> shiny<00:03:54.269> I'll<00:03:54.540> blob<00:03:54.780> that<00:03:54.959> down<00:03:55.199> but<00:03:55.859> if

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
quite shiny I'll blob that down but if

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.089 
quite shiny I'll blob that down but if
you<00:03:55.979> just<00:03:56.159> saw<00:03:56.310> put<00:03:56.609> it<00:03:56.729> there<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.439> tip<00:03:58.829> is

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
you just saw put it there and the tip is

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.960 
you just saw put it there and the tip is
to<00:03:59.759> get<00:04:00.449> a<00:04:00.479> tiny<00:04:00.840> bit<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.349> put<00:04:02.099> source<00:04:02.819> of

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
to get a tiny bit and put source of

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.530 
to get a tiny bit and put source of
under<00:04:03.239> your<00:04:03.359> chin<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.079> on<00:04:04.199> your<00:04:04.409> jawline<00:04:04.859> here

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
under your chin and on your jawline here

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.740 
under your chin and on your jawline here
like<00:04:06.540> so<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.379> this<00:04:07.650> will<00:04:07.859> get<00:04:08.099> rid<00:04:08.129> of<00:04:08.370> any

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
like so and this will get rid of any

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.099 
like so and this will get rid of any
shudders<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.079> might<00:04:10.259> have<00:04:10.530> then<00:04:11.370> just

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
shudders that you might have then just

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.960 
shudders that you might have then just
mix<00:04:13.109> this<00:04:13.349> stand<00:04:13.650> up<00:04:13.799> quite<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.370> lot<00:04:14.400> more<00:04:14.699> and

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
mix this stand up quite a lot more and
