00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
 well here we have a solenoid valve that 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:09.380
 despite being inactive 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.750
 lets water pass a small amount 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.680
 but what it does is activate the pump that 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.420
 I have 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.070
 if you do not have bombs you do not realize 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.660
 but if you notice the bill 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.090
 when you arrive it will arrive quite 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.090
 increased the water bill 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.930
 and I have a pump that gives supplies 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.930
 water to the house 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:38.290
 and risked and activated every two for three 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.080
 and I guess it's going to be because in the 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:45.100
 solenoid valve has some problem 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.230
 and I go in and let's see what problem it has 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.670
 well here we have the solenoid valve and 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.090
 before her we have a stopcock 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.990
 that we are going to close 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.990
 cling more 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.890
 ok we have him lacerÃ³ valve without 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.020
 current first thing we're going to do 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.100
 is to remove this piece that is the one 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.640
 activate and deactivate 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.640
 the valve is also called read today 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.640
 den and we 're going to screw it 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.030
 carefully 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.290
 let's not miss this piece that 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.160
 have here 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.160
 it is very well 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.430
 we go there so you do not miss 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.430
 and now 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.440
 let's go removing the screws these 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.440
 screws 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.070
 we are going to put this tool of 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.070
 separate from the wall and be able to work more 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.070
 all right 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.700
 we are removing the screws 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.690
 we have already loosened all the screws and 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.690
 let's see what we find 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.290
 well this is what you have inside is a 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.170
 membrane with a spring 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.530
 and they have to adjust very well with the 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.579
 gum that is down then as you see 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:38.410
 look here you have traces of how lime or 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:41.680
 of sand and that has to be washed very well 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.620
 if you look down there 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.209
 it also looks like grit you see is 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.599
 remove it because if not the rubber does not adjust 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.599
 well and then always let water pass 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.430
 well very carefully we are going to wash 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:02.610
 this piece that has to work very 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.610
 all right 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.930
 and now we're going to take it out with a cloth 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.969
 very well taking care that no 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.540
 there is no rest of lime or sand 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.540
 nothing 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.360
 all that flour that's left over there we're going to 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.290
 remove it also open having a 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.290
 little the stopcock 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.030
 you see that it has disappeared from sand yet 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.780
 so let's take out with the rag 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.780
 of case 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.110
 and we are going to put the piece in its place 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.700
 since everything is clean 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:04.420
 supposedly clean 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.750
 ok and we put the screws in your 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.750
 site 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.140
 this is the main valve that I have 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.370
 for the irrigation system 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.370
 is with a timer 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:26.280
 it opens and lets water pass to the other 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.830
 that I have later in the garden 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.880
 but this is the main one or the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.380
 essential that it has to be clean because 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.620
 When it's closed, you should not miss 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:41.370
 water none but first if you have 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.860
 bombs you hear every two by three and if you do not 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.860
 you have a bomb then the bill you 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.800
 whole of what a comb is worth 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.400
 let's also clean the board of the pse 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.120
 of noy of much case had 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.160
 something we are also going to give a few laps 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.449
 in reverse 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.370
 so that later to the thread I do not know 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.370
 the cable was not strangled 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.650
 and we are going to put it without it falling out of this 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.650
 piece 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.460
 let's open the key step 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:33.340
 we have to not lose any place 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:35.700
 we have this tool here what 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.700
 we activate 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.010
 we see that they work 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.010
 and activate them 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.520
 I've been here for several minutes and I do not know 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.520
 activates the pump which means that 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.860
 we have done the job well done 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:55.090
 normally before every minute every two 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.090
 minutes was activated
