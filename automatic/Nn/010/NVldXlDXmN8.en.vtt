number one I use the Eco I love the Eco

number one I use the Eco I love the Eco
because<00:00:45.199> it's<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.530> huge<00:00:46.430> wide<00:00:46.879> dispersion<00:00:47.629> it

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
because it's a huge wide dispersion it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.410 
because it's a huge wide dispersion it
doesn't<00:00:48.890> have<00:00:48.980> a<00:00:49.010> huge<00:00:49.339> throw<00:00:49.850> compared<00:00:50.300> to

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
doesn't have a huge throw compared to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.350 
doesn't have a huge throw compared to
the<00:00:50.660> UV<00:00:51.019> LED<00:00:51.440> 16<00:00:51.920> but<00:00:52.460> it's<00:00:52.549> got<00:00:52.699> real<00:00:53.030> white

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
the UV LED 16 but it's got real white

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.180 
the UV LED 16 but it's got real white
coverage<00:00:53.809> about<00:00:54.260> three<00:00:54.530> of<00:00:54.650> these<00:00:54.799> and<00:00:55.040> I<00:00:55.129> can

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
coverage about three of these and I can

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.880 
coverage about three of these and I can
float<00:00:55.580> a<00:00:55.640> real<00:00:56.000> nice<00:00:56.269> you<00:00:56.479> know<00:00:56.690> dance<00:00:57.350> for<00:00:57.650> are

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
float a real nice you know dance for are

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.039 
float a real nice you know dance for are
full<00:00:58.159> of<00:00:58.280> students<00:00:58.670> then<00:00:59.420> there<00:00:59.600> is<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.839> UV

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
full of students then there is the UV

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.590 
full of students then there is the UV
LED<00:01:01.040> 16<00:01:01.580> that's<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:01.970> one<00:01:02.119> that<00:01:02.239> I<00:01:02.299> personally

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
LED 16 that's the one that I personally

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.439 
LED 16 that's the one that I personally
like<00:01:02.960> because<00:01:03.710> it's<00:01:04.159> smaller<00:01:04.640> it<00:01:05.269> has<00:01:05.420> a

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
like because it's smaller it has a

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.270 
like because it's smaller it has a
tighter<00:01:05.869> beam<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.409> I<00:01:06.439> use<00:01:06.560> four<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:06.890> them<00:01:07.130> to

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
tighter beam so I use four of them to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.310 
tighter beam so I use four of them to
fill<00:01:07.460> up<00:01:07.549> an<00:01:07.670> entire<00:01:07.729> gym<00:01:08.299> but<00:01:08.570> that's<00:01:09.049> not<00:01:09.290> a

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
fill up an entire gym but that's not a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.200 
fill up an entire gym but that's not a
lot<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.710> lights<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.040> fill<00:01:10.310> up<00:01:10.430> an<00:01:10.549> entire<00:01:10.640> gym

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
lot of lights to fill up an entire gym

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.230 
lot of lights to fill up an entire gym
it's<00:01:11.780> got<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.110> huge<00:01:12.619> throw<00:01:13.220> on<00:01:13.520> it<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:13.850> it's

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
it's got a huge throw on it and it's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.690 
it's got a huge throw on it and it's
bright<00:01:14.600> plus<00:01:15.049> it's<00:01:15.350> DMX<00:01:15.860> Abul<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.549> great

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
bright plus it's DMX Abul and the great

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.160 
bright plus it's DMX Abul and the great
thing<00:01:16.850> about<00:01:16.939> it<00:01:17.119> being<00:01:17.240> DMX<00:01:17.630> Bowl<00:01:17.840> is<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.140> I

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
thing about it being DMX Bowl is that I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.749 
thing about it being DMX Bowl is that I
can<00:01:18.409> turn<00:01:18.560> them<00:01:18.680> on<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:18.950> off<00:01:19.040> whenever<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.490> need

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
can turn them on and off whenever I need

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.520 
can turn them on and off whenever I need
to<00:01:19.970> I<00:01:20.150> can<00:01:20.299> make<00:01:20.540> them<00:01:20.720> strobe<00:01:21.140> I<00:01:21.290> can<00:01:21.439> make

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
to I can make them strobe I can make

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.109 
to I can make them strobe I can make
some<00:01:21.680> really<00:01:22.310> really<00:01:22.430> cool<00:01:22.700> effects<00:01:23.030> with

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
some really really cool effects with

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.710 
some really really cool effects with
these<00:01:23.299> lights<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.790> when<00:01:25.790> I<00:01:25.820> saw<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.120> size<00:01:26.480> of

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
these lights so when I saw the size of

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.210 
these lights so when I saw the size of
this<00:01:26.810> because<00:01:27.080> this<00:01:27.230> is<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.440> size<00:01:27.680> of<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.920> UV

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
this because this is the size of the UV

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.880 
this because this is the size of the UV
LED<00:01:28.550> 16<00:01:28.970> I<00:01:29.150> was<00:01:29.510> expecting<00:01:30.080> that<00:01:30.110> exact<00:01:30.620> same

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
LED 16 I was expecting that exact same

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.160 
LED 16 I was expecting that exact same
type<00:01:31.820> but<00:01:32.300> then<00:01:32.390> after<00:01:32.600> I<00:01:32.660> thought<00:01:32.840> about<00:01:32.900> it

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
type but then after I thought about it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.660 
type but then after I thought about it
is<00:01:33.380> there's<00:01:33.560> no<00:01:33.770> way<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.190> battery<00:01:34.430> is

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
is there's no way that a battery is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.920 
is there's no way that a battery is
gonna<00:01:34.850> be<00:01:34.940> able<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.150> put<00:01:35.360> out<00:01:35.450> that<00:01:35.630> kind<00:01:35.840> of

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
gonna be able to put out that kind of

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.649 
gonna be able to put out that kind of
power<00:01:36.080> maybe<00:01:36.409> maybe<00:01:36.710> not<00:01:36.890> I<00:01:37.220> was<00:01:38.180> really

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
power maybe maybe not I was really

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.200 
power maybe maybe not I was really
pleasantly<00:01:39.409> surprised<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.430> see<00:01:40.640> that<00:01:40.909> this

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
pleasantly surprised to see that this

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.790 
pleasantly surprised to see that this
actually<00:01:41.659> combines<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.230> little<00:01:42.440> bit<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.620> both

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
actually combines a little bit of both

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.850 
actually combines a little bit of both
this<00:01:43.370> combines<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.300> overall<00:01:45.050> compact<00:01:45.650> size

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
this combines the overall compact size

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.820 
this combines the overall compact size
of<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.460> LED<00:01:46.940> UV<00:01:47.240> 16<00:01:47.690> with<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.560> wide

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
of the LED UV 16 with the wide

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.399 
of the LED UV 16 with the wide
dispersion<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.850> Eco<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:51.080> know<00:01:51.200> it's

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
dispersion of the Eco and you know it's

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.820 
dispersion of the Eco and you know it's
still<00:01:51.680> bright<00:01:51.979> but<00:01:52.790> it's<00:01:53.540> got<00:01:53.870> a<00:01:54.080> nice<00:01:54.440> wide

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
still bright but it's got a nice wide

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.530 
still bright but it's got a nice wide
dispersion<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.760> these<00:01:55.940> and<00:01:56.210> I<00:01:56.270> hit<00:01:56.450> an

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
dispersion to of these and I hit an

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.300 
dispersion to of these and I hit an
entire<00:01:56.810> cafeteria<00:01:57.530> full<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:57.950> middle

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
entire cafeteria full of middle

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.580 
entire cafeteria full of middle
schoolers<00:01:58.720> okay<00:01:59.720> now<00:01:59.960> back<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.260> the

the UV 16 on the very front we have 10

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.350 
the UV 16 on the very front we have 10
LEDs<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.410> believe<00:02:26.830> these<00:02:27.160> look<00:02:27.310> like<00:02:27.459> SM<00:02:27.850> DS<00:02:28.090> but

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
LEDs I believe these look like SM DS but

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.949 
LEDs I believe these look like SM DS but
either<00:02:28.569> way<00:02:28.870> very<00:02:29.680> nice<00:02:29.950> bright<00:02:30.540> not<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.569> cheap

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
the great fixture battery life on this

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.160 
the great fixture battery life on this
has<00:03:54.549> been<00:03:54.579> really<00:03:55.359> good<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.780> haven't<00:03:55.989> actually
