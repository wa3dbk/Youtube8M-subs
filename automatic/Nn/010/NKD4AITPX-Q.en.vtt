00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.760
 must have noticed is one with cartoon 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:56.699
 inspired by naruto this event is 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.699
 very popular is in the young audience 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.000
 in this drawing I told you to bring a 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.900
 very faithful appearance of the anime 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.659
 original and so I did not have as many 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.840
 hair techniques eg not 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.299
 I have used many techniques of which 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.330
 I used another video produced by 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.220
 that I wanted to pass on a pretty vision 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.220
 faithful of the original anime 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.080
 for those who do not know our channel for 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.240
 we always seek to bring the narration of the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.520
 through the artist who made the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.429
 drawing for you to understand 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.970
 techniques and most of the time 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:48.630
 you will learn the techniques of 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.050
 so you can make drawings in 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.050
 House 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.890
 I used two skin tones like that 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.010
 a darker skin tone on top than 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.560
 stayed only in those spots of naruto 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.730
 he has on the cheek and a color of 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.610
 more realistic clearer skin in the direction 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.150
 to be more like the anime of the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.150
 original 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.070
 You can see that the hair here 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:56.350
 in this drawing was quite different from the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:59.050
 video number 1 and said goodbye to 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.630
 naruto art is a spy of the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.370
 naruto on the way know the owner of 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:10.590
 sco wanted to make naruto in the way he knows 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.590
 to make it more epic according to him 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.170
 over the goal on the shoulder shading 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.110
 also on the face and now the shading 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:07.730
 in the hair all using the shading 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.880
 Darker and not in a tone is darker. 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.220
 of the color that you were receiving sanitation 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.530
 for example on the face could have 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.530
 also used a darker color of 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.480
 skin like the shape of shadow I used 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.540
 really a shadow made we are 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.280
 now doing to hair bleeding 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.330
 which gives you an idea that hair is 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.820
 taken 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.680
 in the case of this design the sun would be in the 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.870
 the top right corner of the screen and 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.669
 Naruto's upper left corner is 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.669
 You keep tolerating the front. 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:05.219
 I used several shades of blue to 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.529
 make this background very simple background only 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:09.659
 using only several shades of blue 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:29.189
 to look like heaven 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:31.349

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.939
