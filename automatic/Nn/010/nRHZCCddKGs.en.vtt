00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:04.199

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.059
 Hello, how are you all good and 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.410
 welcome to the channel from aysén to code yo 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.840
 I am sergio well you can follow on twitter 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.430
 for arrogando navas 10 and on facebook by 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.020
 the sena code good I'm going to talk about 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.090
 an application for mac that serves to 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.980
 completely eliminate the applications 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.990
 that we have installed do not leave any 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.250
 kind of trace as you already know for 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.109
 delete a mac application 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.150
 we just go to the finder ' 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.589
 let's go to the applications tab now 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.450
 that we saw all the applications that 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.100
 we have installed we are not going 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.800
 to go to one that I want to eliminate this from 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.329
 here where newswire because I have another 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.129
 vienna which is the one that will use from 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.059
 from now this is a fitz reader 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.800
 Well well in this application 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.219
 normally to eliminate it we have to 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 do 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.050
 right button and we give you to move to 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.359
 the trash bin but they're always going to 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.160
 remain waste in the folders of the 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.690
 bookstore for example where good is 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.820
 they save temporary files and all 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.039
 these little things not as you see if we give to 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.809
 show content of the package we see everything 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.179
 the content that this file has 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.890
 dot app in which for good is at 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.420
 final the application itself and some 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.520
 important files like the latest 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.930
 updates and such not good the case 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.030
 is that if we want to eliminate completely 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.070
 all the files not only the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.850
 application the best of everything or so 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.939
 less what I am going to you today 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.700
 is an application that is called up clean 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.820
 air is to be here to notice that this is the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.190
 url the developer is free max soft if 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.780
 you put on your official page you go to 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.220
 to go to the set tab app 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.530
 cleaner and from here you will be able to 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.390
 download this application completely 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.549
 obviously the developer 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380
 accepts donations, so if it serves you 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.020
 application well I recommend that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.460
 you have not good cases that from here 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.979
 giving him this little button here we go to 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.659
 can download this application a 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.380
 Very important thing is compatible with 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.970
 mac os x 10.4 onwards which is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.759
 quite interesting because it serves with 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.830
 many versions of mac good I already 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.390
 I have installed this application os 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.130
 I'm going to show how it works 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.240
 here we go to on launchpad this is the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.360
 application that I'm talking about 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.800
 atc liner good we just put them 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.479
 here in app cleaner this is the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.039
 application in question we give to 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.080
 applications let's see all the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.060
 applications that we have installed in 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.380
 the application folder according 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.209
 from here for example, if we want 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.700
 remove some for example this from 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.790
 amnesia then we would give to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.560
 we would see the brand to look for and 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.690
 he would not search all the files that 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.390
 have this application and we could 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.920
 delete when we click on clear I 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.420
 I want to teach it in another way that is 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.099
 more universal in case you have some 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.590
 application installed there in another 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.810
 folder simply go to the fánder to 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.930
 the applications tab or the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.130
 folder where you have in the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.810
 application that you want to remove 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.030
 I'm going to erase as I said net 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.040
 newswire of agreement this is the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.410
 application we just take it and the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.360
 we dragged once we dragged 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.010
 because we see here that we have for a 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.450
 side will delete us the app file 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.450
 that this is what we would eliminate 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.970
 us doing this he giving to 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.440
 transfer to the bin but also we 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.329
 they are going to delete all these files that 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.069
 let's see down here or folders 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.620
 agreement we are going to eliminate all this from 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.209
 here that this would not be eliminated if 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.569
 we send to the trash 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.400
 the app file this pp file which 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.019
 it seems a pretty cool application 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.970
 if you want to keep your 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.390
 team because for example I found myself 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.520
 with situations that eliminating 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.260
 so that by doing right button on the 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.580
 application folder and trans and 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.410
 moving to trash this 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.550
 application to eliminate it then good a 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.140
 I remember once I deleted the 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.670
 steam application that is a platform 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.830
 of video games where you can 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.300
 download video games from we and such and 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.530
 Well I deleted the application but the 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.090
 games that I had downloaded did not 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.800
 had eliminated because they were in a 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.600
 folder around lost for good for 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.820
 completely eliminate everything 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.830
 related to an application the best 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.320
 is to use a cleaner that is completely 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.440
 free and is what I recommend good 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.410
 we have already selected net newswire let's go 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.450
 to eliminate it we give to eliminate and already 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.040
 we have completely eliminated all 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.540
 the files related to these 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.670
 applications and we go to the trash 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.250
 let's see that here we have everything from 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.560
 agreement we could get it back if we do 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.780
 right button and take out of the trash 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.700
 but if we give it to empty well 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.830
 we are going to completely eliminate the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.480
 application also fixes the ones that we have 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.519
 here also the widgets widgets 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.709
 where we will be able to eliminate the bits 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.359
 that we want and if we give 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.100
 others, well, we also have here 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.010
 for example we can eliminate the flash 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.260
 and other plugins or other applications that 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.660
 we have installed here nothing 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.670
 I just wanted to tell you about these 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.710
 recommend the application app cleaner 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.010
 which is free and really is very 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.180
 I recommend it very much helpful and nothing 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.100
 I hope you have served the video and 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.260
