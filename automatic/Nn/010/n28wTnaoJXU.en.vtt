a<00:00:10.760> different<00:00:10.790> take<00:00:11.210> well<00:00:11.750> if<00:00:11.809> you<00:00:11.930> were<00:00:11.990> to

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
a different take well if you were to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.440 
a different take well if you were to
drop<00:00:12.320> in<00:00:12.559> from<00:00:12.800> mars<00:00:13.190> three<00:00:13.610> weeks<00:00:13.880> ago<00:00:14.059> and

and<00:02:32.270> took<00:02:33.020> apart<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.860> terrific<00:02:34.670> South<00:02:34.940> Florida

now<00:02:38.960> I<00:02:38.990> believe<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.470> either<00:02:39.890> TCU<00:02:40.550> or

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
now I believe that either TCU or

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.150 
now I believe that either TCU or
Cincinnati<00:02:41.690> would<00:02:42.170> give<00:02:42.440> any<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.950> top

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
Cincinnati would give any of the top

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.030 
Cincinnati would give any of the top
three<00:02:43.340> teams<00:02:43.640> Florida<00:02:44.210> Alabama<00:02:44.480> or<00:02:44.870> Texas<00:02:45.320> all

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
three teams Florida Alabama or Texas all

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.940 
three teams Florida Alabama or Texas all
they<00:02:46.250> could<00:02:46.310> handle<00:02:46.520> in<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.510> BCS<00:02:48.200> Championship

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
they could handle in a BCS Championship

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.430 
they could handle in a BCS Championship
Game<00:02:48.980> were<00:02:49.459> they<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.730> play<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.780> reason<00:02:51.020> is

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
Game were they to play and the reason is

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.730 
Game were they to play and the reason is
that<00:02:51.709> TCU<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.580> Cincinnati<00:02:53.270> are<00:02:53.620> firing<00:02:54.620> on

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
that TCU and Cincinnati are firing on

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.550 
that TCU and Cincinnati are firing on
every<00:02:55.490> face<00:02:55.760> they<00:02:56.270> are<00:02:56.420> complete<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.080> they

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
every face they are complete and they

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.530 
every face they are complete and they
are<00:02:57.709> dominant<00:02:58.310> where<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.820> other<00:02:58.970> top<00:02:59.209> three

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
are dominant where the other top three

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.830 
are dominant where the other top three
very<00:03:00.080> good<00:03:00.350> but<00:03:01.070> neither<00:03:01.250> complete<00:03:01.610> nor

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
very good but neither complete nor

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.120 
very good but neither complete nor
dominant<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:02.959> this<00:03:03.410> i<00:03:03.590> have<00:03:03.740> on<00:03:03.890> great
