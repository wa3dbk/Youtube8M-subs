00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.360 
get the rest of it so we want to yeah
because<00:00:55.199> we've<00:00:55.410> noticed<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.920> these<00:00:56.039> remakes

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
because we've noticed with these remakes

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.889 
because we've noticed with these remakes
as<00:00:56.579> well<00:00:56.730> they're<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.120> since<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.570> remake

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
as well they're like since the remake

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.569 
as well they're like since the remake
songs<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:58.500> better<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:59.219> we're<00:00:59.489> getting

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
songs to get better like we're getting

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.670 
songs to get better like we're getting
better<00:00:59.879> each<00:01:00.300> time<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.690> make<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> video<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
better each time we make a video the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.520 
better each time we make a video the
like<00:01:01.890> even<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:03.210> said<00:01:03.390> we'd<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.690> tips<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.140> 21

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
like even we said we'd or tips on 21

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.929 
like even we said we'd or tips on 21
because<00:01:04.769> that's<00:01:05.010> when<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> quality<00:01:05.640> starts

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
because that's when the quality starts

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.630 
because that's when the quality starts
to<00:01:06.000> step<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.659> even<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.619> still<00:01:07.799> not

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to step up but even then it's still not

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
to step up but even then it's still not
as<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.720> will<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.930> nowhere<00:01:10.110> near

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
as it's not there will be nowhere near

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.770 
as it's not there will be nowhere near
as<00:01:10.500> good<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:11.159> what<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.939> by<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
as good as what we have now and by the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.750 
as good as what we have now and by the
time<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.260> there<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.670> episodes<00:01:14.670> will

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
time we get there the episodes will

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.190 
time we get there the episodes will
probably<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.299> good<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.900> end<00:01:16.049> up

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
probably be so good that will end up

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.320 
probably be so good that will end up
just<00:01:16.350> wine<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.770> remake<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> whole<00:01:17.490> series<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
just wine to remake the whole series and

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.690 
just wine to remake the whole series and
that'd<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.439> annoying<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.310> yeah

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
that'd be really really annoying so yeah

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.730 
that'd be really really annoying so yeah
and<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.150> probably<00:01:21.330> kick<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and that was probably kick this in the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740 
and that was probably kick this in the
ass<00:01:22.860> where<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.310> grandpa's<00:01:23.880> taking<00:01:24.150> those<00:01:24.360> ages

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
ass where is grandpa's taking those ages

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.570 
ass where is grandpa's taking those ages
as<00:01:24.900> poignant<00:01:25.170> about<00:01:25.530> years<00:01:25.860> since<00:01:26.400> we've

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
as poignant about years since we've

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.010 
as poignant about years since we've
started<00:01:26.670> doing<00:01:27.030> these<00:01:27.150> rebates<00:01:27.509> because<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
started doing these rebates because it

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.130 
started doing these rebates because it
takes<00:01:28.229> forever<00:01:28.549> yeah<00:01:29.549> exactly<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.390> just

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
takes forever yeah exactly so just

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.319 
takes forever yeah exactly so just
probably<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.070> would<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.939> kind<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
probably I would think with I kind of

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.810 
probably I would think with I kind of
losing<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> bit<00:01:34.020> because<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:35.430> only<00:01:35.549> go

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
losing it a bit because like we only go

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910 
losing it a bit because like we only go
on<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.180> channel<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.750> answer<00:01:37.259> questions<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
on the channel to answer questions and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
on the channel to answer questions and
avoid<00:01:38.159> stuff<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.939> need<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.600> get

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
avoid stuff like we need to kind of get

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.390 
avoid stuff like we need to kind of get

and do the next episodes actually 34 or
35<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:41.150> think<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:41.510> did<00:02:41.630> fight<00:02:42.010> okay<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.340> let's

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
35 I think we did fight okay so let's

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.870 
35 I think we did fight okay so let's
say<00:02:43.700> after<00:02:43.850> 45<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:45.560> u.s.<00:02:45.980> cabal<00:02:46.310> comes<00:02:46.670> out

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
say after 45 the u.s. cabal comes out

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.570 
say after 45 the u.s. cabal comes out
because<00:02:47.780> we've<00:02:47.930> had<00:02:48.080> all<00:02:48.320> your<00:02:48.890> absence<00:02:49.370> but

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
because we've had all your absence but

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.910 
because we've had all your absence but
it<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.970> then<00:02:50.360> we<00:02:50.540> don't<00:02:50.780> say<00:02:50.960> 12<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.530> remake

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
it and then we don't say 12 the remake

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.740 
it and then we don't say 12 the remake
because<00:02:52.430> it'll<00:02:52.790> be<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:52.940> lot<00:02:53.180> better<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.660> lot

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
because it'll be a lot better a lot

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.110 
because it'll be a lot better a lot
funnier<00:02:54.200> political<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.130> lot<00:02:55.370> more<00:02:55.550> in<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.940> we
