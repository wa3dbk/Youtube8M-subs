 Tips to stabilize the forehand today 

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:11.530
 Well, but you're also stuck videos I want a little talk Matoyuu of 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.410
 Stabilizing the forehand How can I stabilize the fore drive? 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:19.840
 I often get the question 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:25.060
 In me like this, when I move my weight like this I swing like this 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:28.390
 Instead of thinking like that, always keep hitting in the position you enter 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.840
 I think that such a place will be important 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.230
 After all 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.720
 The person who is making this mistake will soon break down 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.800
 It's in here, but if it's a bit off, it's a swing even if you're off a bit 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.650
 I can not go as expected 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.010
 It will be a swing that can not enter 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:50.170
 Said the way always swing this to enter the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:54.440
 I think it will be important to keep hitting while you enter 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.250
 Please see the video aware there
