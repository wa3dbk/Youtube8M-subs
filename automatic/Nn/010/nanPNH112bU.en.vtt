00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.410 
you can see with those there's this
pulls<00:02:55.010> note<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.370> hits<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:55.730> right<00:02:55.910> there<00:02:56.180> and

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
pulls note it hits that right there and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.190 
pulls note it hits that right there and
then<00:02:56.980> once<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.190> happens<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.870> can<00:02:59.989> actually

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
then once that happens you can actually

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.400 
then once that happens you can actually
just<00:03:00.590> pull<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.609> whole<00:03:01.760> lock<00:03:02.000> cylinder<00:03:02.450> out

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.870 

let's<00:03:06.100> go<00:03:06.250> that's<00:03:06.460> how<00:03:06.580> that<00:03:06.670> works<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.700> then

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
let's go that's how that works and then

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.440 
let's go that's how that works and then
I'll<00:03:09.910> show<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.240> how<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.480> get<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:11.440> door<00:03:11.650> handle

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
I'll show you how to get the door handle

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.830 
I'll show you how to get the door handle
apart<00:03:13.450> from<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:15.810> building<00:03:16.810> piece<00:03:18.840> housing

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
apart from the building piece housing

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.740 
apart from the building piece housing
how<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:21.090> all<00:03:22.090> right<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:22.390> what<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:22.540> want<00:03:22.690> to

do you want to take a channel locks like

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.850 
do you want to take a channel locks like
this<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.940> you<00:03:28.060> want<00:03:28.270> to<00:03:28.480> get<00:03:29.320> one<00:03:29.500> end<00:03:29.680> right

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
this and you want to get one end right

here and one end right here and then

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.810 
here and one end right here and then
what<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.620> will<00:03:32.800> do<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:33.070> it'll<00:03:33.370> push<00:03:33.610> this

what that will do is it'll push this
piece<00:03:34.090> out<00:03:34.420> like<00:03:34.810> this<00:03:35.020> and<00:03:35.290> then<00:03:36.190> there's

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
piece out like this and then there's

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.570 
piece out like this and then there's
holes<00:03:37.030> right<00:03:37.300> here<00:03:37.360> for<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.590> this<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.430> go

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
holes right here for this and this to go

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:49.250 
holes right here for this and this to go
in<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.870> I'll<00:03:40.930> show<00:03:41.110> you

see<00:03:50.260> what<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.560> does<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.670> moves<00:03:51.849> this<00:03:51.940> piece

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
see what that does it moves this piece

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.680 
see what that does it moves this piece
over<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:54.280> allows<00:03:54.640> that<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.269> come<00:03:55.510> out

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
over and it allows that to come out

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.160 
over and it allows that to come out
through<00:03:55.930> those<00:03:56.080> holes<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:58.299> then<00:03:58.420> just<00:03:58.930> slide

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
through those holes and then just slide

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.560 
through those holes and then just slide
sir<00:03:59.349> it<00:03:59.470> out
