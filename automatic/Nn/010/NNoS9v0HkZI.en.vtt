00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.220
 youtube 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.590

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.520
 youtube 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.200

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.290
 the first mister they work very well 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.180
 I want to see a kind of 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.000
 video games that can be activated 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.860
 inside any linen here a 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.260

 prince verso bombi I remove spokes 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.880
 Casino is pretty much what you need to do 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.530
 you simply have to start a 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.520
 video and then the keypad time visited 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.200
 1980 what happens 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.290
 look at a little that we can do one 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.290
 written michel comte the practically a 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.180
 they play that which an account starts 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.460
 upside down honest life time below though 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.330
 has restarted and attention because it happens 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.710
 all these things are my delirium 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.750
 that come down from the other and us 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.840
 we must shoot and prevent that 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.990
 they destroy our videos and of course 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.880
 I'm a legendary pro player and therefore not 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.970
 they will hit me seas and then this video 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.909
 it could last hours or that pain that 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.970
 it is not known practically destroying quotes 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.770
 out of phase you see the cracks that you 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.530
 insinuate to free of mister black is 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.229
 practically equal to the goal and too much that 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.560
 the second we will see what will happen like that 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.880
 particular attention to the last ones if there 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 they were about to crash on ovi store 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.000
 blacks 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.040
 too many crashing attention remove 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.600
 then guys there's another easter egg 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.520
 dedicated to the world of video games a 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.900
 they are little enough because it is like half an hour 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.240
 that I'm trying to do it but not me 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.700
 succeeds when I tried them again 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.380
 they all succeeded anyway 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.570
 consists in activating the play of 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.340
 snake inside a video is 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.900
 you should practically start a 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.300
 random video that press historical a 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.760
 left at the top 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.940
 simultaneously but it works making me 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.500
 play bad guys this despite 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.020
 that works but if I tried on firefox 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.200
 for example because I know that chrome is you 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.200
 wet 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.569
 very well after seeing these easter 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.510
 that need to change the interface 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.310
 graphics and other special things 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.290
 that happen while we type something 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.610
 inside the search box 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.180
 yes if you write a few words 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.459
 a lot of things happen with airplanes 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.640

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.709

 color described a nice shit in short 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.340
 another thing a little bit more than that 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.830
 happens if we go to write vineyards up 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.010

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.800
 I wrote badly not cooked but overcooked 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.730
 goal practically does not make this effect 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.459
