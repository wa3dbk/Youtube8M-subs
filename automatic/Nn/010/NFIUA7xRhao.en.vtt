00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.200
 what is the mood 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.599
 I have to ask myself how do you think so 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.599
 gold 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.800
 So the evening has then 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.360
 in fact to the end and I use 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.430
 that's always a bit about the last one 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.100
 year to pass what I did 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.400
 has done everything and what this is that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.910
 here shows that people here on the 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.820
 stage that belong to you and you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.890
 did a crazy job because 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.710
 if I see this here what happens here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.460
 is the dig up here you can do that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.330
 not all of them are jam-packed 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.430
 harms that have not all 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.449
 persevered with journalists 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.070
 Photographers with cameramen last year 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:15.590
 80 journalists were there this year 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:23.210
 there were 170 journalists as the video of the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:23.210
 were stronger than the echo stronger 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.520
 stronger than ever 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.240
 because somebody is not 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.340
 made you but because you do that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:48.259
 has done here on stage because the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:49.970
 come all of you a few 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.190
 pay was that it was really that kind of 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.119
 groups 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.670
 Last year, these 80 journalists 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.399
 taken care of that and now be careful 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.590
 listen carefully 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:10.340
 50 million people from the video 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:15.410
 has experienced him so much 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:18.260
 Contrast and many thanks to you many 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.640
 thanks to all sponsors this year 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.370
 We really managed that 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.560
 pretty well we'll be there 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.019
 make it even better next year 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.940
 Many thanks to the top sponsors to the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:34.480
 telekom to youtube to media and mobile 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.480
 he should 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.980
 and on sunday I always think 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.109
 bit back there, I always think 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.870
 bit back when I started 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.599
 on youtube I had no idea 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.510
 what's going on there I have mobile 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.549
 and uploaded and suddenly there were 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.420
 many views on it and there I have 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.150
 look who else is there and 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.780
 I think I win first 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.780
 youtube discovered 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.620
 haiti it was not at that time had 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:14.329
 I think 7000 but subscribers to the 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:21.290
 no one knew I go first in 2009 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:22.939
 So I discovered that here I think 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.359
 someone vaguely right you can once briefly 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.250
 another microphone is enough 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:34.110
 outside 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:37.240
 [Applause] 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:44.440
 And the best is always coming to an end 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:47.350
 in the video you can see that 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.290
 best always comes to the end with the 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.200
 video that is i know you have one 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.640

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.890
 I can not answer now no 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.010
 into what is best for you 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.590
 shot and the best in the video days 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.460
 is the player of legend and he gives 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:17.000
 This year, the outsiders have 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:17.740

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.660
 the lucky ones are outsiders or 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.660
