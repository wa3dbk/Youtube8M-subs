scale really fast how can you miss an

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.540 
scale really fast how can you miss an
example<00:02:40.440> yeah<00:02:40.680> like<00:02:40.890> if<00:02:41.070> you're<00:02:41.250> doing<00:02:41.520> a

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
example yeah like if you're doing a

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.420 
example yeah like if you're doing a
liquor<00:02:42.360> run<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.930> know<00:02:43.050> you're<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.190> up<00:02:44.280> and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
liquor run you know you're going up and

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.700 
liquor run you know you're going up and
down<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:49.280> would<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.310> like<00:02:50.460> pass<00:02:51.180> run<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
down you just would be like pass run and

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.350 
down you just would be like pass run and
normally<00:02:52.710> on<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:53.130> slower<00:02:53.520> horner<00:02:53.910> on<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> slow

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
normally on a slower horner on a slow

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.390 
normally on a slower horner on a slow
accident<00:02:54.900> horn<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.590> would<00:02:55.740> make<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.280> little

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
accident horn it would make it a little

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.100 
accident horn it would make it a little
bit<00:02:56.610> harder<00:02:56.940> for<00:02:57.120> me<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.240> play<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.690> so

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
bit harder for me to play that so

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.080 
bit harder for me to play that so
obviously<00:02:58.560> in<00:02:58.710> students<00:02:59.220> hands<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.790> would<00:02:59.910> be

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
obviously in students hands it would be

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.780 
obviously in students hands it would be
even<00:03:00.150> worse<00:03:00.420> because<00:03:00.750> they're<00:03:01.710> you<00:03:02.490> know<00:03:02.610> when

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
even worse because they're you know when

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.280 
even worse because they're you know when
you<00:03:02.910> have<00:03:03.090> when<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.690> student<00:03:04.020> you're

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
you have when you have a student you're

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.800 
you have when you have a student you're
trying<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.850> trying<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.090> make<00:03:06.510> sure<00:03:06.660> that

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
trying to trying to make sure that

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.320 
trying to trying to make sure that
everything<00:03:06.840> works<00:03:07.350> properly<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.580> he

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
everything works properly so that he

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.850 
everything works properly so that he
doesn't<00:03:09.480> develop<00:03:09.750> bad<00:03:10.020> habits<00:03:10.080> he<00:03:10.590> doesn't

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
doesn't develop bad habits he doesn't

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.710 
doesn't develop bad habits he doesn't
start<00:03:11.040> pressing<00:03:11.250> down<00:03:11.580> on<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.790> keys<00:03:12.060> too<00:03:12.390> hard

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
start pressing down on the keys too hard

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.960 
start pressing down on the keys too hard
because<00:03:13.680> there's<00:03:14.070> air<00:03:14.250> leaks<00:03:14.520> because<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
because there's air leaks because of the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.680 
because there's air leaks because of the
cheap<00:03:15.210> audio<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:16.020> already<00:03:16.500> now<00:03:17.510> if<00:03:18.510> a

actually know okay my kid is going to go
pro<00:04:44.380> with<00:04:44.560> this<00:04:44.740> or<00:04:45.040> he<00:04:45.280> wants<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.699> play<00:04:45.820> it<00:04:46.090> you

pro with this or he wants to play it you

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.570 
pro with this or he wants to play it you
know<00:04:46.449> more<00:04:46.780> than<00:04:46.960> just<00:04:47.169> you<00:04:47.500> know<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.830> couple<00:04:48.130> of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
know more than just you know a couple of

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.480 
know more than just you know a couple of
years<00:04:48.760> when<00:04:49.690> you<00:04:49.780> talk<00:04:49.990> about<00:04:50.020> Malik<00:04:50.650> what

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
years when you talk about Malik what

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.710 
years when you talk about Malik what
does<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.610> really<00:04:51.850> mean<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.360> how<00:04:52.510> does<00:04:52.540> it

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
does it really mean and how does it

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.820 
does it really mean and how does it
really<00:04:52.990> hurt<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.710> player<00:04:53.979> um<00:04:55.320> if<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.560> look<00:04:56.710> at

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
really hurt the player um if you look at

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.190 
really hurt the player um if you look at
the<00:04:56.919> pads<00:04:57.419> when<00:04:58.419> you<00:04:58.540> push<00:04:58.780> down<00:04:58.810> a<00:04:59.380> peg<00:05:00.419> it<00:05:01.419> has

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
the pads when you push down a peg it has

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.370 
the pads when you push down a peg it has
the<00:05:02.530> pad<00:05:03.340> actually<00:05:03.760> seals<00:05:04.150> against<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.080> metal

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
the pad actually seals against the metal

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.700 
the pad actually seals against the metal
so<00:05:06.340> this<00:05:06.760> this<00:05:07.120> pad<00:05:07.419> actually<00:05:07.960> seals<00:05:08.410> against

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
so this this pad actually seals against

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.190 
so this this pad actually seals against
the<00:05:08.889> metal<00:05:09.160> and<00:05:09.460> what<00:05:10.030> that<00:05:10.180> does<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.540> actually

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
the metal and what that does it actually

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.150 
the metal and what that does it actually
I'm<00:05:12.150> completely<00:05:13.150> a<00:05:13.300> complete<00:05:13.900> seal<00:05:14.169> so<00:05:14.889> when

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
I'm completely a complete seal so when

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.969 
I'm completely a complete seal so when
you<00:05:15.280> start<00:05:15.490> playing<00:05:15.729> you<00:05:16.120> have<00:05:16.360> leaks

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
you start playing you have leaks

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.460 
you start playing you have leaks
sometimes<00:05:17.979> a<00:05:18.160> pad<00:05:18.400> will<00:05:18.880> not<00:05:19.120> completely<00:05:20.080> seal

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
sometimes a pad will not completely seal

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.270 
sometimes a pad will not completely seal
against<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.490> actual<00:05:21.669> tonal<00:05:22.360> so<00:05:23.280> there'll

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
against the the actual tonal so there'll

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.150 
against the the actual tonal so there'll
be<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.400> little<00:05:24.760> bit<00:05:25.030> of<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.479> air<00:05:26.289> escaping<00:05:27.010> from

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
be a little bit of a air escaping from

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.100 
be a little bit of a air escaping from
there<00:05:27.400> and<00:05:27.880> when<00:05:28.030> that<00:05:28.240> happens<00:05:28.270> when<00:05:28.930> there's

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
there and when that happens when there's

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.040 
there and when that happens when there's
air<00:05:29.350> escaping<00:05:29.830> from<00:05:30.010> from<00:05:30.610> that<00:05:31.330> seal<00:05:31.690> because

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
air escaping from from that seal because

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.680 
air escaping from from that seal because
it's<00:05:32.289> supposed<00:05:32.590> to<00:05:32.650> be<00:05:32.770> a<00:05:32.800> tight<00:05:33.070> seal<00:05:33.690> then

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
it's supposed to be a tight seal then

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.450 
it's supposed to be a tight seal then
you<00:05:34.810> have<00:05:34.990> problems<00:05:35.410> such<00:05:35.740> as<00:05:35.770> sometimes

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
you have problems such as sometimes

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.790 
you have problems such as sometimes
intonation<00:05:37.150> problems<00:05:37.660> sometimes<00:05:37.840> it's

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
intonation problems sometimes it's

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.800 
intonation problems sometimes it's
harder<00:05:39.220> to<00:05:39.250> hit<00:05:39.460> that<00:05:39.669> note<00:05:39.940> you<00:05:40.479> know<00:05:40.599> the

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
harder to hit that note you know the

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.480 
harder to hit that note you know the
student<00:05:41.139> might<00:05:41.260> have<00:05:41.410> to<00:05:41.530> press<00:05:41.860> harder<00:05:42.370> on

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
student might have to press harder on

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.100 
student might have to press harder on
the<00:05:42.610> instrument<00:05:42.910> which<00:05:43.479> is<00:05:43.630> going<00:05:43.780> to<00:05:43.870> cause

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
the instrument which is going to cause

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.900 
the instrument which is going to cause
more<00:05:44.410> stress<00:05:44.620> on<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.070> joints<00:05:45.099> and<00:05:45.610> of<00:05:45.669> course

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
more stress on the joints and of course

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.520 
more stress on the joints and of course
on<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.240> actual<00:05:47.050> purgation<00:05:47.440> the<00:05:48.220> actual<00:05:48.820> key

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
on the actual purgation the actual key

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.370 
on the actual purgation the actual key
so<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:50.830> also<00:05:51.610> get<00:05:51.729> squeezed<00:05:52.060> so<00:05:52.840> that's

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
so you also get squeezed so that's

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.860 
so you also get squeezed so that's
that's<00:05:54.220> when<00:05:54.490> I<00:05:54.520> when<00:05:54.970> I<00:05:55.000> talk<00:05:55.240> about<00:05:55.270> early

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
that's when I when I talk about early

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.500 
that's when I when I talk about early
that's<00:05:56.229> what<00:05:56.470> that<00:05:56.650> means<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.940> seal<00:05:58.210> that

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
that's what that means the seal that

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.719 
that's what that means the seal that
that<00:05:58.810> it<00:05:58.930> makes<00:05:59.139> when<00:05:59.470> it<00:05:59.650> when<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:00.400> touches

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
that it makes when it when it touches

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.000 
that it makes when it when it touches
the<00:06:00.940> metal<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:01.479> the<00:06:01.570> pad<00:06:01.810> it<00:06:02.380> makes<00:06:02.650> a<00:06:02.770> seal

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
the metal to the pad it makes a seal

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.800 
the metal to the pad it makes a seal
it's<00:06:03.250> supposed<00:06:03.550> to<00:06:03.639> be<00:06:03.789> completely<00:06:04.210> sealed<00:06:04.570> a

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
it's supposed to be completely sealed a

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.960 
it's supposed to be completely sealed a
tight<00:06:05.260> seal<00:06:05.530> so<00:06:05.979> that<00:06:06.220> no<00:06:06.400> air<00:06:06.430> escapes

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
tight seal so that no air escapes

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.040 
tight seal so that no air escapes
through<00:06:07.210> through<00:06:07.690> that<00:06:07.810> hole<00:06:09.810> what<00:06:10.810> would<00:06:10.930> you

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
through through that hole what would you

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.250 
through through that hole what would you
i<00:06:11.080> mean<00:06:11.380> this<00:06:11.800> is<00:06:11.860> this<00:06:12.039> is<00:06:12.580> not<00:06:12.610> a<00:06:13.169> brand<00:06:14.169> that

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
i mean this is this is not a brand that

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.210 
i mean this is this is not a brand that
most<00:06:15.010> people<00:06:15.840> think<00:06:16.840> right<00:06:17.110> off<00:06:17.139> your<00:06:17.560> top<00:06:17.800> so

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
most people think right off your top so

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.779 
most people think right off your top so
how<00:06:18.580> would<00:06:18.639> this<00:06:18.910> comparator<00:06:19.570> um<00:06:20.550> this<00:06:21.550> is

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
how would this comparator um this is

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.890 
how would this comparator um this is
actually<00:06:22.180> comparable<00:06:22.690> I<00:06:23.139> would<00:06:23.530> say<00:06:24.900> actually

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
actually comparable I would say actually

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.960 
actually comparable I would say actually
