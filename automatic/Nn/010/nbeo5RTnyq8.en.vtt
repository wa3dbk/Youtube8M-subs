 Daniel of the 1,699 channel and in this 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.020
 I am going to show you how to improve 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.180
 the performance of your pc graphics 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.480
 so they can play or do any 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.310
 graphic design task without having 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.759
 problems with what the edition is 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.739
 obviously this videotutorial is also 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.100
 compatible for all people or 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:38.160
 all PCs that have a computer 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.600
 no graphics card if you have a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.940
 graphics card this tutorial 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.980
 It can also help you but well I do not 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.629
 I have this time card 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.570
 graphics or anything I will work with the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.789
 graphics that windows offers with the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.879
 monitor the graphics that the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.519
 monitor more than anything and the card 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.219
 integrated that brings and in our 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.739
 motherboard is simple and easy going to 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.080
 to be able to improve the graphics to be able to 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.390
 record videos can use this 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.750
 advanced design programs without you 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.460
 we do our our project so much 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.810
 our composition good simply 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.270
 we will go 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.320
 for whom graphics properties 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.970
 will occupy this driver we will prevent that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.920
 when we are recording for example 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.649
 leave this message like the one you are 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.890
 watching at this moment and we're going to 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.929
 remove it so we do not have problems 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.630
 basically and I'm going to say it 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.240
 I'm going to ignore it or I'm just going to 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.399
 close and I will continue here recording 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.380
 good in these kinds of mistakes are 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.630
 frequent also goes out when you're 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.429
 recording a gameplay you get that message 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.740
 also when you're trying to 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.830
 render some composition in after 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.689
 effects or cinema 4d you will leave these 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.149
 good options first thing that you have to 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.179
 do is go here activate right let's go 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.580
 to options properties of graphics and 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.220
 we're just going to go here to what 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.200
 is the intel graphics in this case what 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.780
 let's work with the intel driver 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.880
 I hope you have what this option is 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.950
 I leave you down a link so you can 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.140
 download your drivers and download 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.700
 of drivers whether you have any 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.040
 operating system on this occasion 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.170
 we are working with windows 7 but 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.510
 it is also for windows 8 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.790
 you are going to see this video you are going to 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.620
 update your drivers and within 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.690
 that package of drivers is going to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.209

 this little software that allows you 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.810
 manage the multimedia graphics of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.390
 of your operating system simply 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.610

 we are just going to click here 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.950
 where the graphic driver is downloaded 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.510
 let's update what is our 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.610
 graphic controller in this case I will 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.440
 send one in this case will send me 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.750
 a simple intel page and 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.560
 we are simply going to update what 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.209
 our server is our driver 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.960
 the graphics are just going to give 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.630
 here 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.750

 updated and we will give it in run 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.230
 here we give in which we agree 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.620
 and we install what is our last 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.750
 update of our drivers 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.340
 graphics drivers simply 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.850

 finished the system update 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.120
 it's completed here he mentions it 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.760
 we're just going to start 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.130
 to be able to touch what our drivers are 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.500
 we will get a window of 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.240
 confirmation we are going to say yes and 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.210

 our drivers what are the 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.400
 graphics we're just going to see here in 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.560
 what it is to look for drivers we are going to 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.270
 detect this program automatically 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.590
 is going to make us downloads here brings the 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.780
 number of downloads and the number of 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.210
 installation here you're just going to 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.070
 give in search and update once 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.080
 you have done this, you are going to get 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.170
 what is the latest update in your 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.800

 we can leave aside this page is 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.290
 you will find it in the description of 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.720
 video just with go there is here go to 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.670
 download your graphic driver with that 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.950
 you are going to get what is the last 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.140
 update in your graphics once 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.420
 this is going to go to the part of three of 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.270
 here in configuration probably you 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.850
 you have until this part you will give 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.200
 here in custom configuration 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.930
 you probably have it here simply 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.180
 you are going to distill this box and this is 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.120
 once you have it here simply 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.950
 you take to the end to high quality 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.230
 we are simply going to give it to apply and 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.360
 accept here in apply we will see 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.320
 in accepting we will give in what is 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.630
 means we're going to leave him as he is 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.580
 here you do not have to move anything let's go 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.280
 We are going to give energy here 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.990
 maximum performance we're just going in 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.690
 apply again we're going to give in 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.030
 accept and we can give you in accepting the 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.980
 Changes have already had effects for 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.990
 finish this tutorial simply 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.660
 let's go here the team right click you 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.190
 we are going to give in properties let's see 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.460
 what is the window of our system 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.830
 let's go to the advanced configuration 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.350
 here only in what is this this 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.730
 window we are going to give you in configuration 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.640
 here in performance let's go to 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.380
 configuration and here we get what it is 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.670
 let the team choose the 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.430
 most appropriate configuration 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:03.190
 we are going to omit we will give in adjust 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.260
 to get the best appearance always 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.670
 simply by doing this we are going to 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.740
 get what is the best performance 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.620
 offered by our operating system 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.320
 for him they are graphics we are going to give him here 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.230
 in applying we will give in accepting and 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.510
 just accept simply we close 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.850
 this and you're going to be able to get what it is 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.320
 an improvement in what your graphics are 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.330
 simply and simply enough 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.020

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.570
 the changes 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.310
 be updated and take effect once 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.560
 done this as you can observe I no longer 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.120
 the message has come out I am recording 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.740
 right now with qantas and it has not 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.170
 I left the message that I have to 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.880
 improve the quality of my graphics and 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.400
 all this this message that came to the 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.050
