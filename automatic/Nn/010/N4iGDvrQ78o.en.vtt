solid<00:00:31.439> game<00:00:31.619> overall<00:00:31.920> 505<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.820> Hutton<00:00:33.420> had<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
solid game overall 505 and Hutton had a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.750 
solid game overall 505 and Hutton had a
lot<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.809> chances<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.649> couple<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.579> my

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
lot of chances that a couple of my

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.610 
lot of chances that a couple of my
rushes<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.270> capitalized<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.500> in

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
rushes and capitalized on that one in

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.049
