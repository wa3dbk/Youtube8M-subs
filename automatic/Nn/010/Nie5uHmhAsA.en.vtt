00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello it's a bit difficult to register later 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.870
 all this time actually the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.639
 our really very long time 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.730
 since the last time I registered a 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.170
 video and unfortunately my computer has me 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.360
 given a lot of problems in the last one 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.920
 period and I also lost the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.150
 recordings I had made to 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.859
 January February and a little bit of the cosmos 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 just so if you are interested in me 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.320
 I can stay again also because 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.109
 many were shopping videos though 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.619
 nothing else we start from scratch e 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.140
 pious 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.600
 in today's video I wanted to talk to you a little 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.040
 of what happened lately a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.989
 you will have some trouble or trouble 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.950
 read probably on facebook when 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.070
 I've restarted 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.719
 I started to react 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 in fact today's video has a title 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.860
 a bit special and concerns mine 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.530
 hair you know that is said of a woman 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.539
 that when he makes big changes to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.280
 own hair actually all that 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.500
 it also has repercussions in life and therefore 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.680
 it's going to happen as it happened 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.140
 something also in real life and it is 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.180
 just like that in my case I did 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.159
 first the hair and then everything happened 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.280
 the rest, however, already there was some commotion 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.380
 even before making this big 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 change in my hair I know that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.479
 so interested to know why for how 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.340
 what have I done 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.460
 I tell you briefly obviously I don't have 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.840
 made me the blonde hair at home has them 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.040
 made my hairdresser that is 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 absolutely very good and does not know that 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 don't blush them to say that I 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.390
 however I had rather intense chestnut 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.490
 quite sure he simply has them 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.830
 he simply did three different ones 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.570
 past of color is made that a little 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.640
 went to identify them among other things 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.940
 as you can see I look at the sides 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.830
 at first they are not of a homogeneous blond 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.600
 also because it probably would have been 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.040
 bad with my colors or eyes 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.479
 brown and eyebrows 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.910
 although she has slightly 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.940
 however discolored are of color 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:07.020
 quite dark and therefore simply 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.640
 went to lighten up the passages 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.370
 my natural color 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.670
 if you care about mine to take away i 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.980
 tips i'm looking for the phone where 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.140
 if you are interested I took note of the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.880
 coloring or better coloring 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.220
 which should theoretically go to do 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.450
 step regrowth when 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.110
 just sea ​​will grow and I tell you 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.230
 immediately 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.410
 the color is an oxygen-blonde drawing 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.410
 20 and dye 9.1 if you are interested if there is 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.600
 like color and want to try it 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.160
 at home it seems to me to be slightly 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.920
 out of focus 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.160
 however if you want to do it at home you know 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.260
 that the coloring 9.1 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.540
 precisely of the classic tubes that yes 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.200
 found for sale and oxygen has me 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.850
 said to use that 20 volumes ve 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.920
 I do video right in this direct 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.190
 In case he wanted to do it I don't know if 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.900
 I will have the courage to regrow 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.270
 I have a little fear that you want 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.490
 note motorbikes because as you see not 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.860
 being homogeneous 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.170
 then the 16 own of the lines of 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.240
 different colors including cras 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.180
 card or fear that does not know how to do the line 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.220
 central and then blond see too 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.110
 so I don't know if I will regrow if 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.210
 lyrical rock lore very likely that the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.000
 re color rho with something new that 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.000
 there is a ride in the market in the latter 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.770
 period is because the cut also the 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.780
 cutting was something I was meditating 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.080
 play nice but I made a nice cut 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.910
 short to say I was behind i 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.000
 my hair so many years to make them 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.000
 to grow up 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.770
 however with the arrival of summer and for 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.340
 this desire for change I had 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.780
 in the end I decided to make them short not 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.430
 fear because there are a lot of 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.870
 hairstyles that can also be done 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.690
 with short hair 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.970
 I smooth it out maybe easier 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.980
 taming them is a little more difficult 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.990
 but they are really curling 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.510
 many points nature morning ne 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:12.600
 I want to do some to show you here 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.100
 on my videos so for those with hair 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.049
 courts for those with the desire to 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.840
 cut them maybe you can get 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.360
 on data shown in nice back to 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.879
 bomb a lot of things really happened 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.849
 in recent months among other things 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:31.080
 something was already in place before 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.650
 that I stop making videos and I have 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.560
 gone through a period enough 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.389
 heavy of crisis this video is not for 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.289
 getting bored is right to give you one 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.800
 explanation 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.360
 I had a period of depression in 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.060
 which I didn't know what to do where mine 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.690
 life was entirely devoted to 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:53.159
 work that took away time and energy 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.750
 in fact everything you can imagine 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:59.199
 initially or better until February 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.030
 March had an average of 12 hours 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.300
 daily especially Saturdays and holidays 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.569
 Sunday days when my sweet 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.550
 half 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.979
 he was at home so I really took off 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.669
 so much time to him so much time 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.810
 to the couple and this in the long run me 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.840
 has brought into crisis 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.060
 I complained I didn't say anything I have 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.110
 kept going on hoping that 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.539
 things got better 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.819
 unfortunately things have not improved 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.919
 at least for me maybe because I had them 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.599
 really had enough and so if 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.360
 they probably improved too 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.279
 the vision was already quite gray and 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.259
 I couldn't see anything 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:37.560
 positive and all that came later 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.270
 I continued to neglect 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.490
 my better half continued 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.690
 neglecting the water house there was a 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.000
 pizzino that you either 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.300
 imagine shoes everywhere shoes 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.169
 everywhere dust everywhere and it's just with 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.000
 the stalemate in which you do not 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:58.230
 he can go on where he is 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.100
 enter a circle and a depression 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.780
 that you can't from which anyway 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.590
 it cannot be said so easily 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.380
 having said that it is enough to depress me also because 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.570
 I decided to go back to making videos 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.760
 precisely because I want to start from 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.870
 which I loved doing the most 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.510
 to put me in front of the camera 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.190
 as a moron is talking a little with 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.720
 in the end I know I am not one 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.810
 deficient because on the other side there 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.970
 you are all there is very much there 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.880
 affection and I noticed this when 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:33.030
 precisely I had the drive and o 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.030
 published things on facebook and ho 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.770
 really got a big crossover response 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.990
 from your very affection 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.870
 so many of you who also come back to me 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.880
 so start making videos there then hands 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.800
 nothing at all from this one that is mine 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.289
 passion that what I like most 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.520
 that is to say to share my purchases 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:56.919
 my shopping my things with you 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.599
 if you have any requests, please do so 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.550
 you have requests peck everything 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.789
 what comes to mind in this in 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.810
 this period in these days and nothing 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.970
 let's start from here 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:11.069
 I send you a big kiss and see you 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.069
 in the next videos hello
