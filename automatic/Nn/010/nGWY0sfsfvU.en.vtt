00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 and people who are still going to the news today 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.370
 showing interesting week one of the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.990
 more in fact expected by me to be 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.970
 flame background - and how can you 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.160
 see in the video and what he does he leaves 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.929
 your multitested your real multitasking 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.190
 allowing you to take advantage of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.190
 multi-tech 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.720
 before showing you how 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.330
 institute works I have to explain 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.800
 how s multitasking works 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.650
 since apple launched the multitasking 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.780
 to west-northwest 4 she did a little 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.309
 different than on windows on mac that 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.470
 if for example you are seeing a 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.450
 video from youtube on windows or mac on 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.370
 google chrome in some browser and you 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.620
 minimize it the video will continue 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.510
 and as much audio as 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.400
 it is no longer a little different from 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.989
 multitasking when you minimize the 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.000
 application we will put here in mode 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.610
 Native that I'll show you 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.170
 when you minimize an application it 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.270
 save the last state that was 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.060
 minimized when you return the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.310
 application again it restores though 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.840
 he always paulo the application as another 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.740
 example I'm going to show you the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.880
 youtube 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.950
 let's open that youtube app 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.240
 expected or load put any video 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.850
 here for example this you can 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.830
 see now that your minimized here he 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.990
 completely close the video and not an hour 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.000
 We listen more, but now we 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.000
 enable forced mode 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.310
 Let's close here to make sure I 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.100
 I have and it's going to work. Let's go. 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.299
 reopened youtube 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.719
 Let's enter here for example in this 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.719
 video here 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.460
 now let's minimize it 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.759
 you can see that the audio continues 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.310
 as much as video for example I go back 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.049
 here you can see that the video 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.549
 continues rolling normal 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.009
 so this allows you for example 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.200
 listen to songs on youtube minimize and 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.000
 continue to listen to them and not just 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.160
 you can also, for example, call 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.710
 the camera we'll put here to 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.700
 reflect the screen and now let's put 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.980
 to record some video here 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.320
 I put here to record, it's already recording. 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.250
 If you can see here you can see my 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.900
 hand and now I'll minimize it I go 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.390
 put my hand back here now 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.000
 passing the front of the team behind 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.080
 too and now I'm going back here to the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.390
 app 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.740
 You can see, keep recording. Let's go. 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.870
 land 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.430
 Let's go back here now to my bookstore. 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.930
 Let's play 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.569
 Look here you can see I'm going now 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.359
 Leave, I 'll put it back now. 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.299
 my what's happening here 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.409
 behind also now the vote who to 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.620
 app 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:59.750
 you can continue recording 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.909
 So you saw there that continues 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.680
 recording even with the application closed 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.329
 that is, minimized in the case 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.340
 so I think this is pretty good on a 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.109
 also useful and legal. 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.000
 you are giving for example did team up 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.069
 skype is with the camera on and you 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.049
 minimize the application will continue 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.480
 turning the camera on because it does not pause 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.489
 application is that you also have other 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.139
 options you can disable multitests 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.790
 which is generally said to open to multi 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.709
 same tech 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.290
 you can enable forced or 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.269
 it will use the real multi tech to real 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.639
 that is found on windows on mac is that 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.709
 it does not paulo the application and the native one that 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.450
 in case it goes to use the application and 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.159
 it's practically that personal 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.079
 I hope you have enjoyed this video and 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.849
