00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
first of all I'm going to choose a wire

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.470 
first of all I'm going to choose a wire
that<00:00:37.230> has<00:00:37.380> some<00:00:37.590> some<00:00:38.309> stiffness<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.000> so

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that has some some stiffness to it so

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.240 
that has some some stiffness to it so
that<00:00:39.510> later<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.050> can<00:00:40.200> take<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> wire<00:00:40.980> in

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
that later on I can take the wire in

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
that later on I can take the wire in
display<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.969> out<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.480> give<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.660> some<00:00:42.840> energy

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
display it out and give it some energy

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.930 
display it out and give it some energy
so<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.129> want<00:00:44.250> something<00:00:44.579> that's<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> little

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
so you want something that's a little

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.330 
so you want something that's a little
bit<00:00:45.180> more<00:00:45.390> real<00:00:46.140> sturdy<00:00:46.379> yeah<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.190> clever

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
bit more real sturdy yeah it was clever

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.420 
bit more real sturdy yeah it was clever

cut<00:01:42.210> my<00:01:42.360> three<00:01:42.540> pieces<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> need<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
cut my three pieces now what I need to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.770 
cut my three pieces now what I need to
do<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.220> pick<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> crimp<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.270> pass<00:01:45.479> all

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
do is pick a crimp that I can pass all

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
do is pick a crimp that I can pass all
three<00:01:46.110> pieces<00:01:46.409> through<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.340> crimp<00:01:47.790> twice

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
three pieces through the crimp twice

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.240 
three pieces through the crimp twice
okay<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.399> little<00:01:50.610> bit<00:01:50.700> wider<00:01:50.939> right<00:01:52.250> and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
okay you a little bit wider right and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.030 
okay you a little bit wider right and
when<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> get<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> ends<00:01:54.590> all<00:01:55.590> stack<00:01:55.890> together

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
when you get the ends all stack together

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.690 
when you get the ends all stack together
at<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> end

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
at the end

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090 
at the end
mm-hmm<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.329> try<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.710> through<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
mm-hmm and try and get them through the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.050 
mm-hmm and try and get them through the
crap

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
crap

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.350 
crap
oh<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.680> press<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.040> once<00:02:03.939> you<00:02:04.000> get<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.240> about

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
oh and press it once you get it about

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.980 
oh and press it once you get it about
halfway<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:06.159> want<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.399> push<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.759> crimp<00:02:07.000> up<00:02:07.180> so

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
halfway you want to push the crimp up so

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.469 
halfway you want to push the crimp up so
that<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.170> have<00:02:08.200> room<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.819> get<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.060> other<00:02:10.209> in

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
that you have room to get the other in

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.820 
that you have room to get the other in
back<00:02:10.899> through<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.290> hole<00:02:11.410> okay<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:13.620> if<00:02:14.620> you're

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
back through the hole okay and if you're

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.030 
back through the hole okay and if you're
lucky<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.130> get<00:02:15.340> on<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.580> first<00:02:15.730> try<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.920> you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
lucky you get on the first try so you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.830 
lucky you get on the first try so you
into<00:02:18.220> something<00:02:18.489> like<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:18.790> once<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.690> get

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
into something like that once you get

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.470 
into something like that once you get
that<00:02:19.989> you're<00:02:20.980> going<00:02:21.099> to<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:22.120> want<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.330> pull

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
that you're going to you want to pull

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.479 
that you're going to you want to pull
the<00:02:22.569> ends<00:02:22.870> through<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.099> want<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.310> do<00:02:24.400> in

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
the ends through but you want to do in

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.490 
the ends through but you want to do in
an<00:02:24.610> uneven<00:02:25.000> way<00:02:25.330> okay<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.110> want<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.290> promote

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
an uneven way okay you want to promote

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.070 
an uneven way okay you want to promote
that<00:02:26.620> asymmetry<00:02:26.950> right<00:02:27.849> and<00:02:28.660> give<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
that asymmetry right and give it the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.780 
that asymmetry right and give it the
more<00:02:29.260> asymmetric<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.310> more<00:02:30.459> energy

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
more asymmetric it is the more energy

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.699 
more asymmetric it is the more energy
you'll<00:02:30.880> have<00:02:31.090> mm-hmm<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.260> once<00:02:32.410> we<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.680> that

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
you'll have mm-hmm so once we have that

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.309 
you'll have mm-hmm so once we have that
you<00:02:33.519> want<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.330> go<00:02:34.420> ahead<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.750> crimp<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.140> end

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
you want to go ahead and crimp the end

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.590 
you want to go ahead and crimp the end
and<00:02:36.100> since<00:02:36.489> I'm<00:02:36.580> gonna<00:02:36.730> put<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> bead<00:02:37.120> cover<00:02:37.360> on

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
and since I'm gonna put a bead cover on

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.300 
and since I'm gonna put a bead cover on
I'm<00:02:38.080> gonna<00:02:38.230> go<00:02:38.350> ahead<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.680> just<00:02:38.769> use<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.010> pair

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
I'm gonna go ahead and just use a pair

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.940 
I'm gonna go ahead and just use a pair
of<00:02:39.400> flat<00:02:39.580> nose<00:02:39.610> pliers<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.530> squish<00:02:41.530> them

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
of flat nose pliers and squish them

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.500 
of flat nose pliers and squish them
so<00:02:42.190> you're<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:42.400> crimping<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:43.090> different<00:02:43.420> way

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
so you're just crimping a different way

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.420 
so you're just crimping a different way
instead<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.810> using<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.230> right<00:02:44.650> okay<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> crimper

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
instead of using it right okay a crimper

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.339 
instead of using it right okay a crimper
yeah<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.209> these<00:02:46.299> are<00:02:46.360> gonna<00:02:46.510> be<00:02:46.660> covered<00:02:47.019> with

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
yeah and these are gonna be covered with

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.080 
yeah and these are gonna be covered with
the<00:02:47.470> crimp<00:02:47.709> cover<00:02:47.920> mm-hmm<00:02:48.610> so<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:48.910> doesn't

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
the crimp cover mm-hmm so it doesn't

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.920 
the crimp cover mm-hmm so it doesn't
really<00:02:49.330> matter

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
really matter

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.160 
really matter
doesn't<00:02:50.319> matter<00:02:50.620> mm-hmm<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:52.690> steps<00:02:52.930> done

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
doesn't matter mm-hmm that steps done

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.270 
doesn't matter mm-hmm that steps done
and<00:02:53.739> I'm<00:02:54.069> gonna<00:02:54.190> start<00:02:54.430> adding<00:02:54.549> beads<00:02:54.819> and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
and I'm gonna start adding beads and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.690 
and I'm gonna start adding beads and
since<00:02:57.280> there<00:02:57.400> are<00:02:58.769> essentially<00:02:59.769> six<00:03:00.069> ends<00:03:00.519> you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
since there are essentially six ends you

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.970 
since there are essentially six ends you
end<00:03:00.970> up<00:03:01.120> with<00:03:01.299> you<00:03:02.200> can<00:03:02.349> do<00:03:02.470> three<00:03:02.739> of<00:03:02.769> one

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
end up with you can do three of one

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.880 
end up with you can do three of one
color<00:03:03.250> or<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:04.569> can<00:03:04.720> do<00:03:04.840> one<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.410> can<00:03:05.560> do<00:03:05.650> six

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
color or you can do one you can do six

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.550 
color or you can do one you can do six
different<00:03:06.040> colors<00:03:06.989> yeah<00:03:07.989> with<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.350> tie-dye

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
different colors yeah with the tie-dye

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.800 
different colors yeah with the tie-dye
one<00:03:08.859> yeah<00:03:09.180> that's<00:03:10.180> gonna<00:03:10.390> be<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.660> next

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
one yeah that's gonna be the next

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.740 
one yeah that's gonna be the next
project<00:03:11.320> yeah<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:13.329> one<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.540> use<00:03:13.720> a

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
project yeah and for this one I use a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.949 
project yeah and for this one I use a
crimp<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:15.370> two<00:03:15.880> millimeter<00:03:16.150> crimp<00:03:16.540> okay

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
crimp that a two millimeter crimp okay

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.410 
crimp that a two millimeter crimp okay
yeah<00:03:19.959> I'm<00:03:20.049> gonna<00:03:20.170> just<00:03:20.290> squish<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.709> with<00:03:21.040> a

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
yeah I'm gonna just squish it with a

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.520 
yeah I'm gonna just squish it with a
flat<00:03:22.420> nose<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.840> reason<00:03:23.049> why<00:03:23.140> I'm<00:03:23.260> doing<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
flat nose the reason why I'm doing the

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.170 
flat nose the reason why I'm doing the
flat<00:03:23.709> nose<00:03:23.920> and<00:03:24.250> not<00:03:24.370> using<00:03:24.640> crimping<00:03:24.970> pliers

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
flat nose and not using crimping pliers

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.170 
flat nose and not using crimping pliers
as<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.930> want<00:03:26.140> that<00:03:26.290> flat<00:03:26.530> look<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.850> I'm<00:03:28.030> not

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
as I want that flat look and I'm not

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.879 
as I want that flat look and I'm not
gonna<00:03:28.329> cover<00:03:28.600> them<00:03:28.870> part<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.500> asymmetry

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
gonna cover them part of the asymmetry

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.110 
gonna cover them part of the asymmetry
right<00:03:30.400> mm-hmm

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
right mm-hmm

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.030 
right mm-hmm
and<00:03:31.510> there's<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.840> little<00:03:31.959> bit<00:03:32.139> of<00:03:32.200> wire<00:03:32.440> I've

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
and there's a little bit of wire I've

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.110 
and there's a little bit of wire I've
tried<00:03:33.220> there<00:03:33.400> at<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.579> end<00:03:33.730> I'm<00:03:33.880> just<00:03:33.910> gonna

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
tried there at the end I'm just gonna

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.640 
tried there at the end I'm just gonna
take<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.680> clean<00:03:36.609> it<00:03:36.730> off<00:03:36.850> okay<00:03:37.650> pick

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
take that and clean it off okay pick

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.470 
take that and clean it off okay pick
another<00:03:38.889> one<00:03:39.100> now<00:03:39.880> if<00:03:39.970> I'm<00:03:40.090> going<00:03:40.269> through

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
another one now if I'm going through

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.690 
another one now if I'm going through
this<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:40.930> find<00:03:41.200> that<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:41.739> know<00:03:41.889> they<00:03:42.549> all

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
this and I find that you know they all

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.720 
this and I find that you know they all
look<00:03:42.850> about<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.239> same<00:03:43.590> mm-hmm<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:45.310> want<00:03:45.639> to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
look about the same mm-hmm and I want to

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.910 
look about the same mm-hmm and I want to
adjust<00:03:46.000> it<00:03:46.480> I<00:03:46.630> can<00:03:46.780> take<00:03:46.989> one<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.500> go<00:03:47.769> ahead

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
adjust it I can take one and go ahead

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.860 
adjust it I can take one and go ahead
and<00:03:48.010> just<00:03:48.100> shorten<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.519> okay<00:03:49.329> and<00:03:49.569> play<00:03:49.720> with

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
and just shorten it okay and play with

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.150 
and just shorten it okay and play with
it<00:03:49.989> that<00:03:50.019> way<00:03:50.260> did<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.440> actually<00:03:50.620> want<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.130> to

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
it that way did you actually want it to

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.220 
it that way did you actually want it to
be<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> little<00:03:51.489> bit<00:03:51.639> staggered<00:03:51.910> exactly<00:03:52.750> gives

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
be a little bit staggered exactly gives

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.170 
be a little bit staggered exactly gives
it<00:03:53.319> more<00:03:53.410> energy<00:03:53.590> yeah<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.790> these<00:03:54.880> are<00:03:54.940> about

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
it more energy yeah and these are about

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.819 
it more energy yeah and these are about
fireworks<00:03:55.630> so<00:03:56.200> that's<00:03:56.440> right

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
fireworks so that's right

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.610 
fireworks so that's right
no<00:03:57.280> two<00:03:57.340> are<00:03:57.489> alike<00:03:58.859> which<00:03:59.859> is<00:04:00.010> good

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.030 

I<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.300> use<00:04:04.450> of<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.690> crystals<00:04:05.080> -<00:04:05.349> yeah

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
I like the use of the crystals - yeah

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.140 
I like the use of the crystals - yeah
they're<00:04:06.160> very<00:04:06.190> reflective

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
they're very reflective

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.699 
they're very reflective
I<00:04:07.209> like<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.730> aurora<00:04:09.730> borealis<00:04:10.319> coating<00:04:11.319> yeah

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
I like the aurora borealis coating yeah

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.870 
I like the aurora borealis coating yeah
they're<00:04:12.099> ones<00:04:12.310> a<00:04:14.190> little<00:04:15.190> more<00:04:15.310> like<00:04:15.580> an<00:04:15.730> ice

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
they're ones a little more like an ice

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:26.570 
they're ones a little more like an ice
crystal<00:04:16.120> right<00:04:21.000> see<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.150> trim<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.050> off<00:04:25.230> okay

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
crystal right see it trim it off okay

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.040 
crystal right see it trim it off okay
yeah<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:27.610> have<00:04:27.910> one<00:04:27.940> more<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:30.850> think<00:04:31.810> I'll<00:04:31.900> go

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
yeah I have one more and I think I'll go

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.140 
yeah I have one more and I think I'll go
with<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:32.200> red<00:04:32.410> one<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:33.430> that<00:04:33.639> would<00:04:33.760> promote

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
with the red one and that would promote

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.629 
with the red one and that would promote
the<00:04:34.450> more<00:04:34.630> asymmetric<00:04:35.500> yes<00:04:36.100> cuz<00:04:36.370> you<00:04:36.460> get

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
the more asymmetric yes cuz you get

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.270 
the more asymmetric yes cuz you get
three<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:36.970> three<00:04:37.180> or<00:04:37.570> right<00:04:38.010> we<00:04:39.010> don't<00:04:39.100> like

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
three and three or right we don't like

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:50.210 
three and three or right we don't like
that<00:04:39.430> yeah<00:04:40.180> it's<00:04:40.450> too<00:04:40.630> balanced<00:04:46.470> squish<00:04:48.570> clip

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
that yeah it's too balanced squish clip

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.770 
that yeah it's too balanced squish clip
we're<00:04:51.220> done<00:04:51.340> with<00:04:51.430> that<00:04:51.460> part<00:04:51.610> okay<00:04:52.210> and

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
we're done with that part okay and

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.360 
we're done with that part okay and
really<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.650> just<00:04:53.680> put<00:04:53.919> a<00:04:53.950> little<00:04:53.979> Frenchy

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
really you just put a little Frenchy

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.610 
really you just put a little Frenchy
wire<00:04:54.669> on<00:04:54.850> here<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:56.080> it's<00:04:56.260> just<00:04:56.380> like<00:04:56.470> opening

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
wire on here and it's just like opening

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.290 
wire on here and it's just like opening
a<00:04:56.860> jump<00:04:57.070> ring<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:57.550> can<00:04:57.700> see<00:04:57.910> that<00:04:58.060> it<00:04:58.150> has<00:04:58.270> a

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
a jump ring you can see that it has a

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.080 
a jump ring you can see that it has a
swirl<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.229> and<00:04:59.380> then<00:04:59.470> open-end<00:04:59.950> mm-hmm<00:05:00.700> all

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
swirl to it and then open-end mm-hmm all

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.930 
swirl to it and then open-end mm-hmm all
we<00:05:01.240> need<00:05:01.389> to<00:05:01.419> do<00:05:01.630> is<00:05:01.900> okay<00:05:02.590> take<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.370> and<00:05:03.580> with

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
we need to do is okay take it and with

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.060 
we need to do is okay take it and with
one<00:05:04.120> hand<00:05:04.510> you<00:05:04.570> want<00:05:04.750> to<00:05:04.840> twist<00:05:05.440> open<00:05:05.680> you

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
one hand you want to twist open you

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.710 
one hand you want to twist open you
never<00:05:06.250> want<00:05:06.430> to<00:05:06.460> pull<00:05:06.640> open<00:05:06.789> but<00:05:07.300> twist

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
never want to pull open but twist

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.260 
never want to pull open but twist
okay<00:05:08.229> now<00:05:08.530> what<00:05:08.860> kind<00:05:09.100> is<00:05:09.340> that<00:05:09.400> silver<00:05:09.970> this

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
okay now what kind is that silver this

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.090 
okay now what kind is that silver this
is<00:05:10.450> all<00:05:10.600> metal<00:05:10.840> it's<00:05:11.560> all<00:05:11.680> sterling<00:05:11.919> silver

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
is all metal it's all sterling silver

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.279 
is all metal it's all sterling silver
okay

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
okay

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.930 
okay
what's<00:05:14.289> nice<00:05:14.440> is<00:05:14.710> that<00:05:14.860> if<00:05:15.010> you<00:05:15.250> were<00:05:15.700> to<00:05:15.820> have

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
what's nice is that if you were to have

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.840 
what's nice is that if you were to have
gold<00:05:16.440> that<00:05:17.440> would<00:05:17.590> change<00:05:17.800> it<00:05:18.070> completely<00:05:18.760> as

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
gold that would change it completely as

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.460 
gold that would change it completely as
well<00:05:19.090> so<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.510> would<00:05:19.570> add<00:05:19.720> just<00:05:19.930> a<00:05:20.020> completely

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
well so that would add just a completely

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.890 
well so that would add just a completely
different<00:05:20.680> element<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.700> the<00:05:22.450> silver<00:05:22.750> and

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
different element and the silver and

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.390 
different element and the silver and
gold<00:05:22.930> can<00:05:23.260> be<00:05:23.440> combined<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:23.979> could<00:05:24.130> do<00:05:24.220> gold

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
gold can be combined you could do gold

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.120 
gold can be combined you could do gold
crimps<00:05:24.820> with<00:05:24.910> a<00:05:24.970> silver<00:05:25.570> ear<00:05:26.500> wire<00:05:26.740> or<00:05:26.979> vice

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
crimps with a silver ear wire or vice

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.820 
crimps with a silver ear wire or vice
versa<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.760> could<00:05:28.539> alternate<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:29.200> crimps<00:05:29.740> on

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
versa you could alternate the crimps on

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.260 
versa you could alternate the crimps on
the<00:05:29.950> end<00:05:30.070> with<00:05:30.190> gold<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.520> silver<00:05:30.580> didn't

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
the end with gold and silver didn't

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.940 
the end with gold and silver didn't
really<00:05:31.539> take<00:05:31.780> it<00:05:31.900> up<00:05:32.020> a<00:05:32.139> notch<00:05:32.169> that's<00:05:32.740> right

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
really take it up a notch that's right

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.590 
really take it up a notch that's right
and<00:05:33.280> then<00:05:33.580> you<00:05:33.700> can<00:05:33.729> even<00:05:33.940> you<00:05:34.270> know<00:05:34.300> like<00:05:34.360> how

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
and then you can even you know like how

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.820 
and then you can even you know like how
you<00:05:34.660> use<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:35.020> red<00:05:35.169> wire<00:05:35.380> if<00:05:35.620> you<00:05:35.710> use<00:05:35.800> a

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
you use the red wire if you use a

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.409 
you use the red wire if you use a
completely<00:05:36.370> different<00:05:36.520> color<00:05:36.850> line<00:05:37.090> you<00:05:37.240> deal

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
completely different color line you deal

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.120 
completely different color line you deal
with<00:05:37.450> it<00:05:37.750> exactly<00:05:38.650> different

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
with it exactly different

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.750 
with it exactly different
how<00:05:40.060> about<00:05:40.270> mixing<00:05:40.630> it<00:05:40.780> up<00:05:40.870> today<00:05:41.110> okay<00:05:41.919> it's

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
how about mixing it up today okay it's

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.310 
how about mixing it up today okay it's
all<00:05:42.910> about<00:05:43.090> any<00:05:43.270> symmetry<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:43.840> that's<00:05:44.050> what

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
all about any symmetry and that's what

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.529 
all about any symmetry and that's what
it's<00:05:44.470> all<00:05:44.590> about<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:45.490> here's<00:05:45.760> a<00:05:45.820> crimp<00:05:46.510> cover

it's all about and here's a crimp cover

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.379 
it's all about and here's a crimp cover
okay<00:05:47.320> and<00:05:47.680> I'm<00:05:48.669> gonna<00:05:48.789> start<00:05:49.030> this<00:05:49.150> off<00:05:49.360> by

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
okay and I'm gonna start this off by

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:55.980 
okay and I'm gonna start this off by
just<00:05:49.539> pinching<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:50.110> closed<00:05:50.430> mm-hmm<00:05:52.560> oh<00:05:54.990> so

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
just pinching it closed mm-hmm oh so

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.300 
just pinching it closed mm-hmm oh so
you're<00:05:56.110> not<00:05:56.200> even<00:05:56.440> using<00:05:56.530> a<00:05:56.800> tool<00:05:56.979> for<00:05:57.130> that

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
you're not even using a tool for that

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.629 
you're not even using a tool for that
not<00:05:58.000> yet<00:05:58.210> no<00:05:58.840> yeah<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.470> more<00:05:59.620> tool<00:05:59.889> I<00:06:00.130> use<00:06:00.400> the

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639

not yet no yeah the more tool I use the
more<00:06:00.820> it's<00:06:01.030> gonna<00:06:01.090> mark<00:06:01.419> the<00:06:01.810> silver

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
more it's gonna mark the silver

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.920 
more it's gonna mark the silver
oh<00:06:02.430> let's<00:06:03.430> talk<00:06:03.550> you<00:06:03.610> silvers<00:06:04.000> maybe<00:06:04.270> that's<00:06:04.840> a

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
oh let's talk you silvers maybe that's a

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.350 
oh let's talk you silvers maybe that's a
little<00:06:05.139> softer<00:06:05.530> yeah<00:06:05.919> and<00:06:06.550> if<00:06:06.760> your<00:06:06.880> tools<00:06:07.120> is

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
little softer yeah and if your tools is

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.180 
little softer yeah and if your tools is
if<00:06:07.510> there's<00:06:07.690> a<00:06:07.750> nick<00:06:07.960> in<00:06:08.080> your<00:06:08.169> tool<00:06:08.410> then

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
if there's a nick in your tool then

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.990 
if there's a nick in your tool then
that's<00:06:09.460> transferred<00:06:09.970> to<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.270> bead<00:06:10.830> tip

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
that's transferred to the bead tip

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.170 
that's transferred to the bead tip
mm-hmm

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
mm-hmm

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.730 
mm-hmm
and<00:06:13.420> so<00:06:14.350> I<00:06:14.380> just<00:06:14.560> very<00:06:14.770> gently<00:06:15.100> rotate<00:06:15.520> it<00:06:15.700> and

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
and so I just very gently rotate it and

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.100 
and so I just very gently rotate it and
bring<00:06:17.740> it<00:06:17.860> in<00:06:18.010> together<00:06:20.910> now<00:06:21.910> what<00:06:22.810> about<00:06:22.930> if

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
bring it in together now what about if

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.900 
bring it in together now what about if
you<00:06:23.200> use<00:06:23.380> maybe<00:06:23.800> pliers<00:06:24.160> with<00:06:24.430> a<00:06:24.460> plastic

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
you use maybe pliers with a plastic

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.700 
you use maybe pliers with a plastic
covered<00:06:25.270> that's<00:06:25.810> how<00:06:25.930> those<00:06:26.110> work<00:06:26.320> good<00:06:26.500> -

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
covered that's how those work good -

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.280 
covered that's how those work good -
yeah<00:06:27.100> yeah<00:06:27.460> that's<00:06:28.360> another<00:06:28.570> option<00:06:28.840> for<00:06:29.200> you

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:29.290 
yeah yeah that's another option for you

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.780 
yeah yeah that's another option for you
if<00:06:29.500> you're<00:06:29.620> not<00:06:29.740> strong<00:06:30.010> enough<00:06:32.610> now<00:06:33.610> one<00:06:33.760> of

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
if you're not strong enough now one of

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:34.710 
if you're not strong enough now one of
the<00:06:33.880> things<00:06:34.030> that<00:06:34.150> we<00:06:34.210> want<00:06:34.390> to<00:06:34.450> do<00:06:34.510> is<00:06:34.600> get

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
the things that we want to do is get

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.720 
the things that we want to do is get
some<00:06:34.930> more<00:06:35.050> energy<00:06:35.230> mm-hmm<00:06:35.950> and<00:06:36.040> that's<00:06:36.670> the

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
some more energy mm-hmm and that's the

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.210 
some more energy mm-hmm and that's the
reason<00:06:37.000> we<00:06:37.090> used<00:06:37.270> a<00:06:37.450> stiffer<00:06:37.990> wire<00:06:38.260> is<00:06:38.650> that<00:06:39.130> we

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
reason we used a stiffer wire is that we

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.770 
reason we used a stiffer wire is that we
can<00:06:39.310> kind<00:06:39.550> of<00:06:39.700> you<00:06:39.880> know<00:06:40.030> so<00:06:40.300> you<00:06:40.390> just<00:06:40.570> play

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
can kind of you know so you just play

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.920 
can kind of you know so you just play
with<00:06:40.810> it<00:06:41.110> play<00:06:41.350> with<00:06:41.380> it<00:06:41.560> and<00:06:42.570> get<00:06:43.570> him<00:06:43.660> to<00:06:43.750> kind

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
with it play with it and get him to kind

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.270 
with it play with it and get him to kind
of<00:06:43.990> spread<00:06:44.200> it<00:06:44.230> out<00:06:44.290> like<00:06:44.440> the<00:06:44.560> fireworks<00:06:44.980> with

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
of spread it out like the fireworks with

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.910 
of spread it out like the fireworks with
that's<00:06:45.940> perfect<00:06:46.360> so<00:06:46.750> let's<00:06:47.530> take<00:06:47.680> a<00:06:47.710> look

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
that's perfect so let's take a look

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.620 
that's perfect so let's take a look
again<00:06:48.160> at<00:06:48.310> the<00:06:48.460> pair<00:06:49.000> that<00:06:49.150> you<00:06:49.270> brought<00:06:49.450> us

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
again at the pair that you brought us

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.240 
again at the pair that you brought us
and<00:06:49.810> you<00:06:49.870> can<00:06:50.020> see<00:06:50.200> this<00:06:50.620> is<00:06:50.800> a<00:06:50.830> good<00:06:51.130> example

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
and you can see this is a good example

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.180 
and you can see this is a good example
of<00:06:51.700> asymmetry<00:06:52.420> and<00:06:52.900> be<00:06:53.140> creative<00:06:53.410> maybe<00:06:53.950> use

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
of asymmetry and be creative maybe use

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.210 
of asymmetry and be creative maybe use
you<00:06:54.430> know<00:06:54.550> gold<00:06:55.050> hooks<00:06:56.050> different<00:06:56.620> color<00:06:56.800> in

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
you know gold hooks different color in

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.520 
you know gold hooks different color in
there<00:06:57.460> and<00:06:57.490> wire<00:06:57.850> Oh<00:06:58.240> what<00:06:58.810> that<00:06:59.170> was<00:06:59.260> great
