00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
talking about June bearing strawberries

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.220 
talking about June bearing strawberries
so<00:00:25.000> those<00:00:25.239> are<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.509> kind<00:00:25.720> of<00:00:25.810> strawberries

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
so those are the kind of strawberries

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.710 
so those are the kind of strawberries
that<00:00:26.259> will<00:00:26.470> produce<00:00:26.619> once<00:00:27.189> put<00:00:28.119> on<00:00:28.270> fruit

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
that will produce once put on fruit

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.030 
that will produce once put on fruit
pretty<00:00:29.050> pretty<00:00:29.770> big<00:00:30.040> fruit<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.890> then<00:00:32.890> it

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
pretty pretty big fruit and then it

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.549 
pretty pretty big fruit and then it
doesn't<00:00:33.430> produce<00:00:34.390> like<00:00:34.899> other<00:00:35.140> strawberry

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
doesn't produce like other strawberry

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.170 
doesn't produce like other strawberry
plants<00:00:35.920> where<00:00:36.070> they'll<00:00:36.220> produce<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.700> little

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
plants where they'll produce a little

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.330 
plants where they'll produce a little
bit<00:00:37.329> throughout<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.530> season<00:00:38.980> so<00:00:39.010> you<00:00:39.250> usually

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
bit throughout the season so you usually

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.860 
bit throughout the season so you usually
get<00:00:39.610> those<00:00:39.760> little<00:00:40.000> berries<00:00:40.180> that<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.690> end<00:00:40.840> up

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
get those little berries that you end up

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.840 
get those little berries that you end up
eating<00:00:41.140> one<00:00:42.040> while<00:00:42.340> you're<00:00:42.460> out<00:00:42.640> in<00:00:42.790> the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
eating one while you're out in the

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.310 
eating one while you're out in the
garden<00:00:43.240> and<00:00:43.270> then<00:00:43.480> you'll<00:00:43.630> see<00:00:43.780> another<00:00:44.050> one

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
garden and then you'll see another one

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.170 
garden and then you'll see another one
rather<00:00:44.830> than<00:00:45.010> getting<00:00:45.340> like<00:00:45.580> a<00:00:45.610> really<00:00:46.000> big

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
rather than getting like a really big

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.260 
rather than getting like a really big
harvest<00:00:46.690> so<00:00:47.730> renovating<00:00:48.730> June<00:00:49.060> bearing

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
harvest so renovating June bearing

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.690 
harvest so renovating June bearing
strawberries<00:00:50.020> and<00:00:50.230> this<00:00:51.100> is<00:00:51.250> at<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.490> point

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
strawberries and this is at the point

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.960 
strawberries and this is at the point
once<00:00:52.000> they've<00:00:52.920> set<00:00:53.920> fruit<00:00:54.250> I've<00:00:54.550> harvested

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
once they've set fruit I've harvested

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.550 
once they've set fruit I've harvested
all<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.390> berries<00:00:55.780> I'm<00:00:55.930> going<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.170> get<00:00:56.290> out<00:00:56.440> of

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
all the berries I'm going to get out of

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.970 
all the berries I'm going to get out of
these<00:00:56.680> plants<00:00:57.160> so<00:00:57.310> it's<00:00:58.090> time<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.980> renovate

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
these plants so it's time to renovate

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.580 
these plants so it's time to renovate
this<00:01:00.160> bed<00:01:00.430> so<00:01:00.760> that<00:01:00.790> it's<00:01:01.120> ready<00:01:01.510> to<00:01:01.810> produce

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
this bed so that it's ready to produce

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.880 
this bed so that it's ready to produce
again<00:01:02.920> for<00:01:03.160> me<00:01:03.280> next<00:01:03.640> year<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.379> this<00:01:05.530> technique

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
again for me next year so this technique

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.039 
again for me next year so this technique
is<00:01:06.070> based<00:01:06.310> on<00:01:06.520> mowing<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.450> plants<00:01:07.869> down

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
is based on mowing the plants down

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.499 
is based on mowing the plants down
getting<00:01:08.680> rid<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:08.979> all<00:01:09.220> of<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.549> screen<00:01:09.850> foliage

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
getting rid of all of the screen foliage

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.520 
getting rid of all of the screen foliage
now<00:01:11.079> that<00:01:11.290> it's<00:01:11.439> done<00:01:11.590> producing<00:01:13.380> since<00:01:14.380> I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
now that it's done producing since I

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.830 
now that it's done producing since I
can't<00:01:14.770> mow<00:01:15.070> this<00:01:15.340> since<00:01:15.580> these<00:01:15.729> are<00:01:15.909> in<00:01:16.060> raised

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
can't mow this since these are in raised

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.140 
can't mow this since these are in raised
beds<00:01:17.020> I'm<00:01:17.740> going<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:17.979> mimic<00:01:18.280> that<00:01:18.670> by<00:01:18.909> using

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
beds I'm going to mimic that by using

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.950 
beds I'm going to mimic that by using
hedge<00:01:19.570> clippers<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.880> cheer<00:01:21.880> off<00:01:22.090> all<00:01:22.479> of<00:01:22.690> the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
hedge clippers to cheer off all of the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.130 
hedge clippers to cheer off all of the
foliage<00:01:23.710> I'm<00:01:24.040> doing<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:24.820> two<00:01:25.450> inches<00:01:25.930> above

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
foliage I'm doing this two inches above

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.320 
foliage I'm doing this two inches above
the<00:01:26.409> crown<00:01:26.740> so<00:01:27.400> you<00:01:27.460> want<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:27.909> be<00:01:28.000> really

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
the crown so you want to be really

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.100 
the crown so you want to be really
careful<00:01:28.600> that<00:01:28.870> you're<00:01:29.140> not<00:01:29.170> cutting<00:01:29.770> off<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
careful that you're not cutting off the

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.100 
careful that you're not cutting off the
crown<00:01:32.590> or<00:01:32.979> too<00:01:33.310> low<00:01:33.690> where<00:01:34.690> all<00:01:34.870> these<00:01:35.049> things

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
crown or too low where all these things

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.750 
crown or too low where all these things
are<00:01:36.720> reproducing<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:38.500> strawberries<00:01:39.430> produce

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
are reproducing so strawberries produce

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.180 
are reproducing so strawberries produce
runners<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.630> notice<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.290> as<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.500> start<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.890> gather

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
runners I notice it as I start to gather

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.630 
runners I notice it as I start to gather
the<00:01:43.119> leaves<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.600> one<00:01:43.780> plant<00:01:44.430> some<00:01:45.430> of<00:01:45.460> these

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
the leaves of one plant some of these

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.850 
the leaves of one plant some of these
have<00:01:45.880> already<00:01:46.030> rooted<00:01:46.810> I'm<00:01:47.229> going<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.619> leave

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
have already rooted I'm going to leave

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.510 
have already rooted I'm going to leave
those<00:01:48.159> I'll<00:01:48.490> cut<00:01:48.790> that<00:01:48.940> off<00:01:50.190> but<00:01:51.190> this<00:01:51.400> is

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
those I'll cut that off but this is

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.090 
those I'll cut that off but this is
another<00:01:51.790> new<00:01:52.420> plant<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.930> I<00:01:53.049> can<00:01:53.290> put<00:01:53.890> in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
another new plant that I can put in

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.480 
another new plant that I can put in
place<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.760> an<00:01:55.210> old<00:01:55.869> plant<00:01:56.200> that's<00:01:56.500> not<00:01:57.070> in<00:01:57.280> such

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
place of an old plant that's not in such

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.570 
place of an old plant that's not in such
good<00:01:57.670> shape<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:57.970> I'm<00:01:58.450> just<00:01:59.229> clipped<00:02:00.189> off<00:02:00.369> that

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
good shape so I'm just clipped off that

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.270 
good shape so I'm just clipped off that
runner<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:01.090> had<00:02:01.180> rooted<00:02:01.570> in<00:02:01.720> there<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:02.280> have

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
runner that had rooted in there I have

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.170 
runner that had rooted in there I have
another<00:02:04.380> couple<00:02:05.380> here<00:02:06.009> that<00:02:06.040> could<00:02:06.790> be<00:02:06.970> used

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
another couple here that could be used

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.109 
another couple here that could be used
to<00:02:07.390> replace<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:09.069> what<00:02:09.189> I'm<00:02:09.310> trying<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.729> do<00:02:09.879> is

to replace but what I'm trying to do is
gather<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.780> leaves<00:02:11.019> of<00:02:11.230> this<00:02:11.349> plant<00:02:13.860> mainly

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
gather the leaves of this plant mainly

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.979 
gather the leaves of this plant mainly
I'm<00:02:15.010> doing<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:16.060> see<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.840> that

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.309 
I'm doing this so that I can see so that
I<00:02:17.079> don't<00:02:17.139> cut<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:18.579> crown<00:02:18.909> but<00:02:19.659> about<00:02:20.019> two

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
I don't cut the crown but about two

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.809 
I don't cut the crown but about two
inches<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.799> I<00:02:20.859> can<00:02:21.040> see<00:02:21.249> this<00:02:21.400> new<00:02:21.639> little

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
inches and I can see this new little

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:22.410 
inches and I can see this new little
leaf<00:02:22.120> on

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
leaf on

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.720 
leaf on
emerging<00:02:22.750> from<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.110> Sun<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.160> Crown's<00:02:24.430> I'm

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
emerging from the Sun of the Crown's I'm

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.790 
emerging from the Sun of the Crown's I'm
looking<00:02:25.060> at<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.330> sort<00:02:25.599> of<00:02:25.720> my<00:02:25.900> gut<00:02:26.170> my<00:02:26.470> gauge

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
looking at that sort of my gut my gauge

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.580 
looking at that sort of my gut my gauge
and<00:02:27.130> going<00:02:27.310> above<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.360> then<00:02:29.349> I'm<00:02:29.530> going

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
and going above that and then I'm going

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.000 
and going above that and then I'm going
to<00:02:31.500> hack<00:02:32.500> off<00:02:33.959> through<00:02:34.959> all<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.200> these<00:02:35.560> stems

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
to hack off through all of these stems

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.510 
to hack off through all of these stems
the<00:02:36.280> stems<00:02:36.550> of<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.730> leaves<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.690> run<00:02:37.870> of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
the stems of the leaves and the run of

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.229 
the stems of the leaves and the run of
any<00:02:39.520> runners

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
any runners

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.380 
any runners
I<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:43.060> always<00:02:43.180> salvage<00:02:43.870> whatever<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:45.090> find<00:02:46.090> in

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
I can always salvage whatever I find in

getting rid of all this foliage

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.699 
getting rid of all this foliage
I<00:02:57.540> was<00:02:58.540> totally<00:02:58.900> worth<00:02:59.050> it<00:02:59.230> I've<00:02:59.410> done<00:02:59.590> this

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
I was totally worth it I've done this

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.759 
I was totally worth it I've done this
technique<00:02:59.950> every<00:03:00.489> year<00:03:00.760> since<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.959> first<00:03:02.500> put

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
technique every year since I first put

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.289 
technique every year since I first put
in<00:03:02.860> my<00:03:02.980> strawberry<00:03:03.400> bed<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:03.940> they've<00:03:04.090> been

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
in my strawberry bed and they've been

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:12.240 
in my strawberry bed and they've been
doing<00:03:04.510> amazing<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.970> see<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.120> benefits<00:03:11.250> we

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
doing amazing so I see the benefits we

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.860 
doing amazing so I see the benefits we
are<00:03:12.340> renovating<00:03:12.670> these<00:03:13.120> plants<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:13.630> that<00:03:13.660> they

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
are renovating these plants so that they

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.220 
are renovating these plants so that they
keep<00:03:14.080> going<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:14.739> this<00:03:14.920> is<00:03:15.069> a<00:03:15.100> time<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:16.140> kind<00:03:17.140> of

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
keep going so this is a time to kind of

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.320 
keep going so this is a time to kind of
clean<00:03:17.530> up<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.709> set<00:03:18.190> do<00:03:18.519> whatever<00:03:18.730> maintenance

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
clean up the set do whatever maintenance

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.350 
clean up the set do whatever maintenance
you<00:03:19.480> need<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.720> do<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.730> also<00:03:21.880> kind<00:03:22.299> of

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
you need to do and it also kind of

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.300 
you need to do and it also kind of
reveals<00:03:22.720> some<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:22.989> those<00:03:23.200> spaces<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:24.160> I've

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
reveals some of those spaces so I've

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.370 
reveals some of those spaces so I've
noticed<00:03:24.489> as<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.030> remove<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.540> foliage<00:03:25.989> there's

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
noticed as I remove this foliage there's

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.110 
noticed as I remove this foliage there's
a<00:03:26.440> nice<00:03:26.680> space<00:03:27.010> here<00:03:27.040> where<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.549> could<00:03:27.670> put

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
a nice space here where I could put

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.319 
a nice space here where I could put
another<00:03:28.959> plant<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.040> might<00:03:30.400> transplant<00:03:31.090> this

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
another plant so I might transplant this

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.170 
another plant so I might transplant this
runner<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.350> rooted<00:03:32.739> over<00:03:32.950> here<00:03:33.340> into<00:03:33.579> the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
runner that rooted over here into the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.949 
runner that rooted over here into the
space<00:03:34.480> closer<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.560> row<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:35.980> actually

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
space closer to the row that I actually

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.599 
space closer to the row that I actually
the<00:03:37.959> location<00:03:38.350> where<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.680> actually<00:03:38.829> want<00:03:39.400> these

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
the location where I actually want these

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.729 
the location where I actually want these
berries<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:41.410> be<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:43.079> I'm<00:03:44.079> going<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.350> keep<00:03:44.500> doing

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
berries to be so I'm going to keep doing

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.190 
berries to be so I'm going to keep doing
that<00:03:44.859> all<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.070> way<00:03:45.280> down<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.640> row<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.200> I'll

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
that all the way down the row and I'll

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.560 
that all the way down the row and I'll
check<00:03:47.560> back<00:03:47.739> in<00:03:47.799> so<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.220> can<00:03:48.489> see<00:03:48.570> the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
check back in so you can see the

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.819 
check back in so you can see the
finished<00:03:49.959> result<00:03:52.019> alright<00:03:53.019> so<00:03:53.290> as<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.680> can

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
finished result alright so as you can

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.949 
finished result alright so as you can
see<00:03:54.269> everything<00:03:55.269> has<00:03:55.420> been<00:03:55.709> mowed<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:57.959> now

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
see everything has been mowed and now

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.360 
see everything has been mowed and now
I'm<00:03:59.200> just<00:03:59.230> ready<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.680> do<00:03:59.859> a<00:03:59.890> little<00:04:00.010> bit<00:04:00.340> more

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
I'm just ready to do a little bit more

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.069 
I'm just ready to do a little bit more
thinning<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:03.130> my<00:04:04.000> plants<00:04:04.450> have<00:04:04.600> gotten<00:04:04.900> really

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
thinning so my plants have gotten really

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.610 
thinning so my plants have gotten really
dense<00:04:05.410> so<00:04:05.739> in<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.850> process<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.569> some<00:04:07.840> areas

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
dense so in the process and some areas

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.490 
dense so in the process and some areas
over<00:04:08.829> here<00:04:08.859> I've<00:04:09.370> just<00:04:09.750> decided<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.870> thin<00:04:11.170> out

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
over here I've just decided to thin out

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.590 
over here I've just decided to thin out
some<00:04:11.829> of<00:04:12.130> these<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.579> it's<00:04:13.060> kind<00:04:13.329> of<00:04:13.420> difficult

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
some of these and it's kind of difficult

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.159 
some of these and it's kind of difficult
process<00:04:14.500> because<00:04:15.370> they're<00:04:15.930> rooted<00:04:16.930> down

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
process because they're rooted down

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.260 
process because they're rooted down
pretty<00:04:17.530> well<00:04:19.799> but<00:04:20.799> I'm<00:04:21.010> just<00:04:21.160> pulling<00:04:21.880> these

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
pretty well but I'm just pulling these

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.510 
pretty well but I'm just pulling these
apart<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:23.800> give<00:04:23.919> them<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.160> little<00:04:24.280> bit<00:04:24.460> more

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
apart to give them a little bit more

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.550 
apart to give them a little bit more
room<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.150> don't<00:04:25.210> plan<00:04:25.539> on<00:04:25.780> planting<00:04:26.380> them

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
room and I don't plan on planting them

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.670 
room and I don't plan on planting them
again<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.520> guess<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.600> would<00:04:29.110> say<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.350> I'm

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
again so I guess you would say that I'm

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.110 
again so I guess you would say that I'm
sacrificing<00:04:30.640> a<00:04:31.320> few<00:04:32.320> of<00:04:32.470> these

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
sacrificing a few of these

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.730 
sacrificing a few of these
but<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.150> think<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.509> plants<00:04:35.900> are<00:04:36.110> ultimately

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
but I think the plants are ultimately

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.399 
but I think the plants are ultimately
healthier<00:04:37.569> if<00:04:38.569> you<00:04:38.719> can<00:04:38.840> give<00:04:39.020> them<00:04:39.139> a<00:04:39.199> little

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
healthier if you can give them a little

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:46.390 
healthier if you can give them a little
bit<00:04:39.620> more<00:04:39.680> room<00:04:40.629> see<00:04:43.330> Nick<00:04:44.439> whoa<00:04:45.439> show<00:04:46.340> you

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
bit more room see Nick whoa show you

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.499 
bit more room see Nick whoa show you
like<00:04:47.240> how<00:04:47.389> difficult<00:04:47.840> this<00:04:48.020> is<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:49.330> get<00:04:50.330> them

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
like how difficult this is to get them

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.270 
like how difficult this is to get them
out<00:04:50.659> there<00:04:52.599> but<00:04:53.599> it'll<00:04:53.840> be<00:04:53.990> worth<00:04:54.169> it<00:04:54.349> and<00:04:54.620> then

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
out there but it'll be worth it and then

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.640 
out there but it'll be worth it and then
also<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:55.729> wanted<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.150> show<00:04:56.240> you<00:04:56.419> how<00:04:56.810> this<00:04:57.439> was

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
also I wanted to show you how this was

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.999 
also I wanted to show you how this was
one<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:57.830> those<00:04:57.979> runners<00:04:58.460> that<00:04:58.789> had<00:04:59.090> rooted<00:05:00.020> in

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
one of those runners that had rooted in

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.760 
one of those runners that had rooted in
another<00:05:01.370> place<00:05:01.759> and<00:05:02.090> so<00:05:02.330> I<00:05:02.360> cut<00:05:03.349> that<00:05:03.530> long

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
another place and so I cut that long

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.249 
another place and so I cut that long
strip<00:05:04.280> that<00:05:04.639> was<00:05:04.879> connected<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.629> original

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
strip that was connected to original

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.519 
strip that was connected to original
mother<00:05:06.830> plant<00:05:07.159> and<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:08.389> carefully<00:05:08.990> got<00:05:09.409> the

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:09.529 
mother plant and I carefully got the

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:12.399 
mother plant and I carefully got the
roots<00:05:09.789> kind<00:05:10.789> of<00:05:10.909> pulled<00:05:11.180> this<00:05:11.360> runner<00:05:12.020> out<00:05:12.259> of

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
roots kind of pulled this runner out of

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.110 
roots kind of pulled this runner out of
the<00:05:12.469> ground<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:13.069> I'm<00:05:13.520> just<00:05:13.729> going<00:05:13.849> to<00:05:13.879> make<00:05:14.090> a
