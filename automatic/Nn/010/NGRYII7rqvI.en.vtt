let's check it out so here's a close-up
here<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.280> device<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.180> know<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.360> is

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
here of the device and you know this is

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.560 
here of the device and you know this is
an<00:00:39.750> RF<00:00:40.200> device<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.190> uses<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.000> 2.4

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
an RF device so it uses the 2.4

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.930 
an RF device so it uses the 2.4
gigahertz<00:00:42.649> you<00:00:43.649> know<00:00:43.800> spectrum<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.430> this

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
gigahertz you know spectrum and this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.000 
gigahertz you know spectrum and this

it's stylish it's very lightweight but

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.900 
it's stylish it's very lightweight but
it<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.230> infrared<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.370> what<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.579> means<00:00:56.789> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it is infrared and what that means it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.849 
it is infrared and what that means it
has<00:00:57.030> limited<00:00:57.420> range<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.050> also<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.680> kind<00:00:58.829> of

has limited range and also you kind of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.380 
has limited range and also you kind of
need<00:00:59.010> line-of-sight<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.059> might<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.300> to

works when this is plugged into a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.730 
works when this is plugged into a
computer<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.350> kind<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.620> nice

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
device is going to be kind of a quick

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.940 
device is going to be kind of a quick
review<00:04:18.840> here<00:04:18.900> because<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.590> just<00:04:19.709> basically

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
review here because it just basically

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.440 
review here because it just basically
does<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> couple<00:04:20.609> functions<00:04:20.790> but<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.299> does

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
does a couple functions but it does

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.570 
does a couple functions but it does
those<00:04:21.600> functions<00:04:21.989> really<00:04:22.229> well<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.520> know

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
those functions really well and you know

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.250 
those functions really well and you know
those<00:04:23.640> kind<00:04:23.910> of<00:04:23.940> those<00:04:24.090> things<00:04:24.300> where<00:04:24.599> you

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
those kind of those things where you

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.360 
those kind of those things where you
know<00:04:25.289> when<00:04:25.500> you<00:04:25.560> got<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.740> get<00:04:25.919> in<00:04:26.039> front<00:04:26.220> of<00:04:26.280> a

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
know when you got to get in front of a

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
multi function pointers do they have all

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.480 
multi function pointers do they have all
these<00:04:36.270> different<00:04:36.600> functions<00:04:36.750> on<00:04:37.169> it<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.500> you

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
these different functions on it and you

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.950 
these different functions on it and you
know<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.669> push<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.030> wrong<00:04:39.150> button<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.840> it
