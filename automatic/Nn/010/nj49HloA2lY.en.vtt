00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.920
 welcome to a new video analysis in 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.080
 zone networks this time we have with 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:14.440
 us the last router of asus the 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:16.059
 asus rt ago 3200 a tri-band team that 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.910
 works in three bands in a way 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.270
 simultaneous that is to say we have available 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.710
 a band of 2.4 ghz a band of 5 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.740
 gigahertz that use the channels 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.210
 low and another 5 gigahertz band that 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.220
 uses high channels 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.679
 this is this second band of 5 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.659
 gigahertz can only connect the 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:37.089
 devices with wifi that is not 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.559
 compatible with wi-fi devices n that 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.559
 they could also work in the band 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.260
 5 gigahertz the antennas are 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.539
 classified by bands 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.030
 these two antennas on the left and this 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.519
 from the right I work in the 2.4 band 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.280
 gigahertz in the 5 gigahertz band 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.740
 they are dual antennas however these two 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.630
 antennas 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.880
 and this one on the left works 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.980
 only in the 5 gigahertz band 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.960
 of high channels all the quarries 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.090
 there are the dual so that the user 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.330
 do not have to be selecting what 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.200
 antennas are dual but 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.720
 Other features of this equipment is 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.810
 that incorporates a switch with 4 ports 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.210
 gigabit ethernet for alan and a port 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.970
 gigabit ethernet for water likewise 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.430
 you can also see that in the part 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.970
 we incorporate a USB 2.0 port 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.850
 a wps button and the reset button 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.320
 if you can see the case is this is 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.600
 exactly as the asus rt does 87 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.500
 but nevertheless we have realized 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 that this router weighs much more 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.920
 87 ago it weighs more than one 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.810
 kilo of weight this equipment also 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.140
 incorporates a power button and 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.670
 off to avoid having to enter the 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.970
 firmware and turn off the device or 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.010
 directly remove the light cable 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.780
 the buttons are exactly the same 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.310
 that what we have available in the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.750
 87 ago 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.759
 and from which you already have a complete analysis 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.890
 on the left we can see a button 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.920
 led that will make them go out 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.900
 absolutely all the leds and also 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.030
 we will have a wifi button where 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.650
 we can directly turn off the network 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.800
 wireless without the need to get into 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.440
 the animal likewise in the front 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.270
 we also found the usb 3.0 port 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.210
 which is exactly in the same 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.550
 position that he does 87 and that already 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.800
 we discussed the previous analysis that we 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.959
 It seemed that the location was not the most 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.850
 correct because if we are going to connect a 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.100
 always a hard drive we will connect 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.240
 always to the fastest port and not to the usb 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.240
 2.0 that is behind 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.250
 this team uses the same the same 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.430
 broadcom processor that double 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.890
 core to a gigahertz however both 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.470
 the band as 2.4 gigahertz as 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.540
 the two 5 gigahertz bands use 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.800
 a new broadcom chipset that is the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:11.150
 43 62 that is to say is the evolution of 43 60 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.980
 that many routers use and good 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.250
 first we can find you this 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.340
 router is that we are not included in the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.380
 LEDs the status of the second band of 5 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.000
 ghz there is simply a led of 5 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.940
 gigahertz without indicating to which band 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.700
 belongs and then we also find the 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.550
 2.4 gigahertz band all 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.730
 external ports and the internet and the 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.410
 status of the wps as well as the button 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.390
 switched on 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.750
 and good about the hardware then 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.810
 incorporates 256 megabytes of ram ddr3 memory 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.150
 and 128 megabytes of flash memory for 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.630
 store the content of the firmware and 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.050
 also other other programs because 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.930
 example if we update to other firmware 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.940
 we will be able to host files on our own 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.000
 flash memory without losing the 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.940
 restart and well this is all we hope 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.280
 that you like the in- depth analysis that 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.350
 We will make the team where we will check 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.230
 if the performance really is from a 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.590
 high-end or stays at the doors a 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.590
 greeting
