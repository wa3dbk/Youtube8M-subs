00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.930
 what expression can be used to show 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.540
 the division of 18 boxes into two piles 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.980
 same type the expression using 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.929
 different ways of writing the 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.300
 division finds the value of the 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.470
 expression 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.650
 we have to divide 18 between 2 18 boxes 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.619
 in two piles we have 18 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.930
 between two this is a way of expressing 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.700
 the 18 between 2 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:34.590
 another way is 18 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:37.950
 between 2 and a third way of expressing 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.770
 it is 18 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.970
 between 2 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.680
 before finding the value of the 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.860
 expression let's think about what this 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.300
 means I will do the best I can 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:01:04.699
 to draw my 18 boxes 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:14.330
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 call by 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:17.000
 minus 13 14 15 16 17 and 18 here they are and 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.950
 what they ask us is that these 18 boxes 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.190
 you have to divide them into two piles or two 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.090
 equal groups if I do so like who 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.320
 he says to the eye so I can take let's say 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.330
 these boxes here 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:36.110
 here are 3 too 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.630
 and my other group will be 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.250
 and this here of each of these two 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.920
 groups has the same number of boxes and 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.840
 let's see how many are 123456789 so 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.540
 we have two equal groups with nine 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.050
 boxes each one what gives us that this 18 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.840
 between 2 equals 9 equal this 10 and 82 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.800
 also equals 9 and this division of 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.900
 down here also 9 for 2 18 18 minus 18 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.240
 is 0 with which we have solved the 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.240
 problem see you in the next video
