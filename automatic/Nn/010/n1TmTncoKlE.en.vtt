what<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:25.950> chose<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:27.930> into<00:01:28.200> our

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
what I chose that so we got into our

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.469 
what I chose that so we got into our
first<00:01:28.530> game<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:28.920> our<00:01:29.040> new<00:01:29.220> team<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:30.329> have

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
first game with our new team and I have

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
first game with our new team and I have
to<00:01:30.630> say<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.860> was<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.100> thinking

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to say now that what was I thinking

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.640 
to say now that what was I thinking
there<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.180> literally<00:01:33.509> like<00:01:33.840> there's<00:01:34.320> hardly

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
there is literally like there's hardly

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.679 
there is literally like there's hardly
any<00:01:34.890> bronze<00:01:35.369> Scandinavian<00:01:36.119> players<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.600> are

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
any bronze Scandinavian players that are

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.960 
any bronze Scandinavian players that are
any<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:38.280> ones<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:38.820> are

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
any good and the ones that there are

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.859 
any good and the ones that there are
they're<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.360> different<00:01:39.570> obviously

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
they're all different obviously

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.300 
they're all different obviously
different<00:01:40.229> nationalities<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.159> get

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
different nationalities so that we get

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.649 
different nationalities so that we get
links<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.790> because<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.030> Scandinavian

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
links just because the Scandinavian

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.850 
links just because the Scandinavian
doesn't<00:01:42.930> mean<00:01:43.020> they<00:01:43.229> get<00:01:43.409> links<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.799> each

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
doesn't mean they get links to each

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.370 
doesn't mean they get links to each
other<00:01:44.070> sober<00:01:44.540> which<00:01:45.540> I'm<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.930> bit<00:01:46.079> I'm<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.350> a

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
the left mid position so maybe we'll

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.190

and because we didn't win that and in

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.440 
and because we didn't win that and in
fact<00:03:26.310> we<00:03:26.579> didn't<00:03:26.760> even<00:03:26.910> attempt<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.269> in<00:03:27.359> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
fact we didn't even attempt it in the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.319 
fact we didn't even attempt it in the
first<00:03:27.660> team<00:03:27.959> are<00:03:28.560> Bundesliga<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.579> team<00:03:29.880> which

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
first team are Bundesliga to team which

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.610 
first team are Bundesliga to team which

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
was absolutely amazing we should have

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.690 
was absolutely amazing we should have
tried<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.010> probably<00:03:32.130> would've<00:03:32.400> won<00:03:32.519> it

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
tried it and probably would've won it

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.060 
tried it and probably would've won it
say<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:34.290> can<00:03:34.410> see<00:03:34.590> here<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.799> didn't

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
say and you can see here I didn't

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.770

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
actually edit any of the video off the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.099 
actually edit any of the video off the
start<00:03:37.079> just<00:03:37.859> because<00:03:38.359> the<00:03:39.359> guy<00:03:39.570> didn't<00:03:39.930> stick

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
start just because the guy didn't stick

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.509 
start just because the guy didn't stick
around<00:03:40.140> for<00:03:40.560> all<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.769> long<00:03:40.950> so<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.280> didn't

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
around for all that long so I didn't

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.770 
around for all that long so I didn't
really<00:03:41.549> think<00:03:41.850> there<00:03:42.000> was<00:03:42.090> any<00:03:42.209> point<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.690> can

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
really think there was any point you can

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.920 
really think there was any point you can
see<00:03:43.049> here<00:03:43.350> go<00:03:44.310> from<00:03:44.609> goal<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.150> get<00:03:45.570> bit<00:03:45.690> unlucky

yet<00:04:32.610> because<00:04:32.760> he's<00:04:32.880> actually<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:33.360> sobe<00:04:33.840> so

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
yet because he's actually in sobe so

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.420 
yet because he's actually in sobe so
it's<00:04:34.139> just<00:04:34.230> sarah<00:04:34.530> b<00:04:34.680> Blair<00:04:34.919> but<00:04:35.130> we're<00:04:35.310> going

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
it's just sarah b Blair but we're going

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.820 
it's just sarah b Blair but we're going
to<00:04:35.520> use<00:04:35.669> him<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:36.080> link<00:04:37.080> us<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.500> some<00:04:37.710> other

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
to use him to link us to some other

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.650 
to use him to link us to some other
players<00:04:38.130> later<00:04:38.370> in<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.820> series<00:04:39.060> or<00:04:39.389> in<00:04:39.419> this

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
players later in the series or in this

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.140 
players later in the series or in this
team<00:04:40.110> you<00:04:41.010> can<00:04:41.160> see<00:04:41.250> I<00:04:41.280> just<00:04:41.550> pop<00:04:41.730> him<00:04:41.850> into<00:04:42.060> the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
team you can see I just pop him into the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.520 
team you can see I just pop him into the
other<00:04:42.270> center<00:04:42.570> back<00:04:42.720> position<00:04:43.139> just<00:04:43.320> because

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
other center back position just because

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.330 
other center back position just because
I<00:04:43.620> thought<00:04:43.770> that<00:04:43.830> I<00:04:43.950> could<00:04:44.040> get<00:04:44.220> more

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
I thought that I could get more

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.040 
I thought that I could get more
chemistry<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:45.060> don't<00:04:45.480> think<00:04:45.510> actually<00:04:45.750> makes

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
chemistry I don't think actually makes

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.620 
chemistry I don't think actually makes
any<00:04:46.230> different<00:04:46.560> but<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:46.740> can't<00:04:47.010> remember<00:04:47.630> yeah

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
any different but I can't remember yeah

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.909 
any different but I can't remember yeah
actually<00:04:48.780> makes<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.169> one<00:04:49.320> chemistry<00:04:49.740> better

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
actually makes it one chemistry better

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.770 
actually makes it one chemistry better
so<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.580> know<00:04:50.700> shuffling<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.360> players<00:04:51.540> Bart

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
so you know shuffling the players Bart

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.760 
so you know shuffling the players Bart
can<00:04:51.930> actually<00:04:52.169> gain<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.500> couple<00:04:52.740> of

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
can actually gain you a couple of

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.930 
can actually gain you a couple of
chemistry<00:04:53.070> points<00:04:53.370> if<00:04:53.460> you<00:04:53.550> know<00:04:53.669> what<00:04:53.820> me

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
chemistry points if you know what me

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.300 
chemistry points if you know what me
anyway<00:04:54.840> we<00:04:54.960> go<00:04:55.080> into<00:04:55.230> our<00:04:55.350> final<00:04:55.889> game<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.040> the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
anyway we go into our final game of the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.740 
anyway we go into our final game of the
episode<00:04:56.700> and<00:04:56.880> we<00:04:57.000> come<00:04:57.120> up<00:04:57.240> against<00:04:57.630> another

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
episode and we come up against another

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.230 
episode and we come up against another
bronze<00:04:58.320> team<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.980> looks<00:04:59.850> like<00:05:00.000> he's<00:05:00.120> actually

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
bronze team and looks like he's actually

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.000 
bronze team and looks like he's actually
starting<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.600> build<00:05:00.780> it<00:05:00.960> up<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.140> bit<00:05:01.169> I<00:05:01.500> see<00:05:01.890> the

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
starting to build it up a bit I see the

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.370 
starting to build it up a bit I see the
links<00:05:02.280> going<00:05:02.490> between<00:05:02.640> his<00:05:03.090> enemies<00:05:03.780> strikers

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
links going between his enemies strikers

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.650 
links going between his enemies strikers
send<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:04.800> back<00:05:04.919> goalkeeper<00:05:05.340> so<00:05:05.820> looks<00:05:06.419> like<00:05:06.480> he

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
send it back goalkeeper so looks like he

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.240 
send it back goalkeeper so looks like he
might<00:05:06.750> actually<00:05:06.930> be<00:05:07.140> doing<00:05:07.290> starting<00:05:08.160> off

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
might actually be doing starting off

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.100 
might actually be doing starting off
he's<00:05:08.669> too<00:05:08.790> in<00:05:08.910> fact<00:05:09.060> I<00:05:09.270> remember<00:05:09.330> this<00:05:09.660> guy<00:05:09.840> and

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
he's too in fact I remember this guy and

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.780 
he's too in fact I remember this guy and
he<00:05:10.710> was<00:05:10.830> actually<00:05:11.100> doing<00:05:11.220> a<00:05:11.370> road<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.669> glory

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
he was actually doing a road to glory

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.300 
he was actually doing a road to glory
himself<00:05:12.390> and<00:05:12.660> he<00:05:13.470> messaged<00:05:13.770> me<00:05:13.919> he<00:05:14.040> must<00:05:14.160> have

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
himself and he messaged me he must have

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.159 
himself and he messaged me he must have
known<00:05:14.370> who<00:05:15.060> I<00:05:15.090> was<00:05:15.180> before<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.720> started<00:05:15.810> playing

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
known who I was before I started playing

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.390 
known who I was before I started playing
but<00:05:17.270> he<00:05:18.270> unfortunately<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:19.350> he<00:05:20.220> actually

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
but he unfortunately and he actually

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.030 
but he unfortunately and he actually
paid<00:05:20.700> very<00:05:20.880> well<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.419> I<00:05:21.690> went<00:05:22.110> to<00:05:22.470> three<00:05:22.800> no

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
paid very well and I went to three no

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.980 
paid very well and I went to three no
off<00:05:23.220> or<00:05:23.400> something<00:05:23.700> like<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:23.880> quite<00:05:24.389> quickly

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
off or something like that quite quickly

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.440 
off or something like that quite quickly
but<00:05:25.860> after<00:05:26.190> ice<00:05:26.310> he's<00:05:26.760> tightened<00:05:27.210> up<00:05:27.270> his

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
but after ice he's tightened up his

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.300 
but after ice he's tightened up his
defense<00:05:27.600> he<00:05:28.050> was<00:05:28.110> playing<00:05:28.380> a<00:05:28.530> lot<00:05:28.680> better<00:05:28.860> I

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
defense he was playing a lot better I

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.409 
defense he was playing a lot better I
