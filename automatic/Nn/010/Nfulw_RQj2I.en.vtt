00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
got the spare kit what I like about it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.899 
got the spare kit what I like about it
is<00:02:04.320> there's<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.710> much<00:02:04.860> they<00:02:05.040> fit<00:02:05.250> into<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.550> small

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
is there's so much they fit into a small

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.149 
is there's so much they fit into a small
space<00:02:06.120> so<00:02:06.450> here<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.500> something<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.950> say

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
space so here we have something to say

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
again we like how they've compacted

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.899 
again we like how they've compacted
everything<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.799> here<00:02:34.040> these<00:02:34.340> which<00:02:34.670> look<00:02:34.879> like

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
everything in here these which look like

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.780 
everything in here these which look like
just<00:02:35.900> little<00:02:36.109> flat<00:02:36.319> blocks<00:02:36.680> or<00:02:37.220> actually<00:02:37.549> our

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
just little flat blocks or actually our

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.240 
just little flat blocks or actually our
chalk<00:02:38.090> blocks<00:02:38.420> are<00:02:38.719> going<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.019> open<00:02:39.139> up<00:02:39.439> and

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
chalk blocks are going to open up and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.050 
chalk blocks are going to open up and
you're<00:02:40.400> going<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:40.579> put<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:40.790> at<00:02:40.939> the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
you're going to put this at the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.240 
you're going to put this at the
diagonals<00:02:42.049> higher<00:02:42.230> across<00:02:42.650> from<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.040> tire

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
diagonals higher across from the tire

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.030 
diagonals higher across from the tire
you<00:02:43.430> are<00:02:43.549> changing<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.269> we'll<00:02:44.420> show<00:02:44.599> you<00:02:44.629> that

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040

you are changing so we'll show you that
all<00:02:46.040> right<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:46.250> these<00:02:46.489> are<00:02:46.639> just<00:02:46.760> going<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.060> go

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
all right so these are just going to go

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.879 
all right so these are just going to go
together<00:02:47.450> like<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.230> I'm<00:02:48.349> going<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.500> put<00:02:48.650> one<00:02:48.799> of

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
together like so I'm going to put one of

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.890 
together like so I'm going to put one of
them<00:02:48.980> together<00:02:49.340> just<00:02:49.879> snaps<00:02:50.150> together<00:02:50.419> and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
them together just snaps together and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.720 
them together just snaps together and
we'll<00:02:51.530> show<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.709> if<00:02:51.919> we're<00:02:52.159> doing<00:02:52.280> this<00:02:52.459> tire

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
we'll show you if we're doing this tire

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.360 
we'll show you if we're doing this tire
here<00:02:55.239> there<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.359> go<00:02:56.389> and<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.829> to<00:02:57.980> secure

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
here there you go and that is to secure

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.830 
here there you go and that is to secure
it<00:02:58.489> when<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:58.879> jack<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.329> up<00:02:59.389> you<00:02:59.569> don't<00:02:59.720> want

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
it when you jack it up you don't want

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.809 
it when you jack it up you don't want
the<00:02:59.930> car<00:03:00.109> moving<00:03:00.439> and<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:01.099> put<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.430> second

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
the car moving and you put the second

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.820 
the car moving and you put the second
one<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.269> other<00:03:02.569> side

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
one on the other side

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.010 
one on the other side
all<00:03:04.820> right<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.210> we<00:03:05.270> have<00:03:05.390> unfolded<00:03:05.900> our

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
all right and we have unfolded our

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.750 
all right and we have unfolded our
second<00:03:06.440> chalk<00:03:06.650> block<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.280> we'll<00:03:07.460> put<00:03:07.640> that

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
second chalk block and we'll put that

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.750 
second chalk block and we'll put that
under<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.150> tire<00:03:08.360> like<00:03:08.690> south<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:09.740> in<00:03:10.640> the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
under the tire like south and in the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.310 
under the tire like south and in the
scenario<00:03:11.150> like<00:03:11.330> this<00:03:11.390> where<00:03:11.630> we've<00:03:11.930> done<00:03:11.960> this

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
scenario like this where we've done this

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.470 
scenario like this where we've done this
to<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.650> front<00:03:12.920> tire<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.730> means<00:03:13.970> we<00:03:14.120> would<00:03:14.300> be

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
to the front tire that means we would be

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.650 
to the front tire that means we would be
changing<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.320> diagonal<00:03:15.920> back<00:03:16.160> tire<00:03:16.660> all

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
changing the diagonal back tire all

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.180 
changing the diagonal back tire all
right<00:03:17.840> if<00:03:18.050> you<00:03:18.110> need<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.380> pull<00:03:18.530> some<00:03:18.560> hubcaps

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
right if you need to pull some hubcaps

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.710 
right if you need to pull some hubcaps
off<00:03:19.430> they<00:03:19.610> even<00:03:19.850> give<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.120> tool<00:03:20.330> for<00:03:20.540> that

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
off they even give you a tool for that

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.930 
off they even give you a tool for that
it's<00:03:21.290> slanted<00:03:21.770> makes<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.130> very<00:03:22.250> easy<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.670> go<00:03:22.790> in

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
it's slanted makes it very easy to go in

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.820 
it's slanted makes it very easy to go in
there<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.360> again<00:03:24.080> we<00:03:24.200> want<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.380> be<00:03:24.500> changing

there and again we want to be changing

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.590 
there and again we want to be changing
this<00:03:24.980> tire<00:03:25.220> but<00:03:25.550> just<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.790> show<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.030> go<00:03:26.510> in
