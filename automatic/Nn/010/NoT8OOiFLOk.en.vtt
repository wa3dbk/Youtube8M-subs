00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 good morning everyone and welcome to video 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.870
 tom repetitions point we see a bit of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.719
 binary numbers of binary conversions 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.920
 decimals and decimal numbers to numbers 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.679
 tracks 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.350
 how well you all know we are joking 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.420
 from scratch and the binary system is composed 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.119
 from two number one numbers 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.070
 let's see how ours works 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.519
 take the number zero tablet 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.949
 around if i write bad ok it's actually is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.230
 much, much simpler than the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.719
 light the decimal numbering because 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.579
 because as you see at number one the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.850
 number zero instead is the numbering 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.090
 decimal to the number zero number 1 e 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.200
 number 2 until you reach number 9 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 then to ten numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.199
 7 8 9 or because everyone is afraid of 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.180
 binary numbering because in reality we 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.289
 we are used to using the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.870
 decimal numbering we turn on the whole 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:04.049
 so now we will practice with the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.580
 binary help numbering 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.360
 first let's try to make a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.740
 exercise also via our 1 then 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.020
 we write 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:22.799
 let's start to convert then we do 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:25.830
 a conversion with a version from a 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.689
 binary to one decimal 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.360
 let's see how it works let's see 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.590
 acquire our method then from 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:38.369
 match to decimate suppose of 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:44.220
 convert the number 10 11 10 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.689
 ok or don't read 101 thousand 110 why 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.520
 otherwise if it does as you know 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.880
 an oral question for the red one 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.470
 ugly emptiness the track reads 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.299
 figure for digit then 10 11 10 this is 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.899
 our binary number to convert 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.760
 in decimating let us remember that the secret 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.530
 for conversion from decimal binary 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:10.680
 is by a very basic method 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.100
 to number the positions of ours 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.690
 figures 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.370
 this will therefore be our position 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.750
 number zero our position number 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.980
 123 position of the digit number 4 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.890
 position of the digit number 5 la 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.700
 numbering should be done from right to 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.990
 left 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.990
 so let's first number them 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:48.450
 position positions from right to left 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.310
 must look like a mural and here it is 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.030
 take the first thing we do not aim at 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.709
 positions 0 1 2 3 4 5 very well 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.230
 since we are acting as a track 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.510
 so two numbers you remember number 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.220
 one the number zero to decimate we should 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.170
 use the powers of 2 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:14.060
 therefore as a second rule we could 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:14.060
 write use use powers 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.840
 of 2 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.269
 skype then how we will do 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.900
 we will first write the two always two 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.700
 because we are on the high track to the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.010
 position then to the number of the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.800
 position in this case we will not have 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.330
 other than two elevated the position 0 yes 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.910
 always starts from zero from right to 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:45.019
 left 2 raised from zero 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:47.430
 x the digit the binary for 0 plus we add 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.220
 let's start a second digit must be a 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.350
 left the position at 1 then 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.989
 we will have the power we use the powers 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:00.330
 of your reported more then two for 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.360
 one that to our binary figures that 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:08.930
 raised to a high position 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.930
 at 1 ok we go on longer 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:18.459
 2 always for our binary digit one 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.049
 in this case raised to what we will say 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:26.440
 jobs came the 2nd to the position 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:31.270
 just more always two we use the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:34.260
 2 armor we said 2 for that 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:38.590
 what is our binary number which is a 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.210
 elevated the position he has three since 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.389
 we have little space we need 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.310
 write all digits with zero on 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:50.020
 binary no because in fact two high 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.539
 to zero which is always one x 0 eliminate 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.320
 we are not interested in our sum 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:05:00.490
 so we can do more zero because 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:04.780
 because two raised to 4 for 0 2 levada 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.310
 4 2 4 8 16 for 0 is zero so not 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.870
 we are interested 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.530
 let's go under accato we 'll have use 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.010
 the violence 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.560
 remember the 2 x our city 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:22.450
 ordinary that is one arrived at 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.220
 position 5 so let's go gorge 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.500
 same type 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.990
 let's start 2 raised to one ago two for 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.860
 one always remains two then we write 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:39.789
 two plus two and elevated from two and 4 per 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:44.560
 one always 44 is ugly torino piÃ¹ 2 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:47.199
 elevated a 38 x 18 x 1 and always 8 more 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.820
 the last bit you see here would be 2 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:54.460
 leverage from 416 for zero because we talk 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.830
 of the fourth digit of the fourth 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.740
 position and excuse me starting from zero a 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.199
 zero then we go directly to two 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:07.750
 high by five which is three is not thick 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:12.990
 of 32 cm that for one is 32 we add up 32 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:17.620
 plus 8 44 44 plus 2 46 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:20.590
 here is our result 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.080
 valentino rossi 46 we can see 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:29.620
 so that instead bad 40 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:32.110
 it is nothing but 10 11 10 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.240
 see we were able to convert the 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.400
 our number from binary to decimal 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.009
 then in the next video repetition 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.569
 in the next video lesson in 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.430
 we write our simple rules 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:44.680
 let's try doing other exercises then 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.900
 we begin to schematize the conversion 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.699
 from binary to decimal we see then 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.080
 in the next video repetition thanks 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.080
 listening and good day hello
