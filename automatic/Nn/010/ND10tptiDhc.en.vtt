00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.370 
doesn't come off that does a good amount
though<00:04:41.040> he's<00:04:41.520> like<00:04:41.820> more<00:04:42.480> defensive<00:04:43.020> than<00:04:43.050> the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
though he's like more defensive than the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.170 
though he's like more defensive than the
average<00:04:43.710> star<00:04:44.160> me<00:04:44.310> but<00:04:44.550> what<00:04:44.700> is<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.060> average

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
average star me but what is the average

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.990 
average star me but what is the average
star<00:04:45.660> me<00:04:45.810> what<00:04:45.990> is<00:04:46.140> normal<00:04:46.610> so<00:04:47.610> now<00:04:47.700> he's<00:04:47.940> just

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
star me what is normal so now he's just

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.360 
star me what is normal so now he's just
gonna<00:04:48.270> recover<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:49.080> that's<00:04:49.740> unpleasant<00:04:50.070> for

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
gonna recover and that's unpleasant for

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.610 
gonna recover and that's unpleasant for
me<00:04:50.550> I<00:04:50.730> should<00:04:51.210> just<00:04:51.390> stayed<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:51.930> went<00:04:52.380> for<00:04:52.500> more

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
me I should just stayed in went for more

me I should just stayed in went for more
gig<00:04:52.830> drains<00:04:53.160> but<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:53.430> guess<00:04:53.640> I<00:04:53.790> predicted<00:04:54.450> like

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
gig drains but I guess I predicted like

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.240 
gig drains but I guess I predicted like
the<00:04:54.870> metagross<00:04:55.320> or<00:04:55.530> something<00:04:55.920> and<00:04:56.070> I<00:04:56.190> you

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
the metagross or something and I you

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.190 
the metagross or something and I you
turn<00:04:56.610> so<00:04:57.150> that<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.300> could<00:04:57.420> go<00:04:57.630> into<00:04:57.810> something

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
turn so that I could go into something

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.690 
turn so that I could go into something
that<00:04:58.350> could<00:04:58.470> hit<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.710> magic<00:04:58.860> rose<00:04:59.100> so<00:04:59.490> now<00:04:59.610> i'm

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
sad life Jim lives it's now I'm gonna go

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.170 
sad life Jim lives it's now I'm gonna go
into<00:05:31.380> landris<00:05:31.920> and<00:05:32.220> I'm<00:05:32.400> just<00:05:32.670> gonna<00:05:32.850> threaten

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
into landris and I'm just gonna threaten

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.910 
into landris and I'm just gonna threaten
with<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.720> earthquake<00:05:34.170> at<00:05:34.350> this<00:05:34.500> point<00:05:34.770> he

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
with the earthquake at this point he

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.040 
with the earthquake at this point he
only<00:05:35.070> has<00:05:35.280> tyranitar<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.030> maduros<00:05:36.450> left<00:05:36.810> so<00:05:37.020> I

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
only has tyranitar and maduros left so I

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.560 
only has tyranitar and maduros left so I
went<00:05:37.380> basically<00:05:37.860> by<00:05:38.130> earth-quaking

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
went basically by earth-quaking

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.810 
went basically by earth-quaking
everything<00:05:39.570> so<00:05:40.140> I<00:05:40.500> don't<00:05:40.890> know<00:05:40.980> that<00:05:41.460> wasn't

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
everything so I don't know that wasn't

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.970 
everything so I don't know that wasn't
exactly<00:05:41.940> like<00:05:42.450> the<00:05:42.930> best<00:05:43.170> battle<00:05:43.740> in<00:05:43.830> the

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
exactly like the best battle in the
