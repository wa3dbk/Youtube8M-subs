00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 because all boys and well I say they are 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.819
 video there are vincenzo of splash gaming 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.200
 or let's say the second part in 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.420
 mounting in our computer 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.420
 I saw how to assemble how to assemble 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.519
 the parent company of the christ said fact 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.460
 recommend in crisis this way 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.390
 let's put the square 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.550
 we accept this this different way 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.320
 with the toffanin and we put the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.429
 squares but let's review arms what it is 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.990
 success 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.870
 first you have to pull down that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.690
 allows a more comfortable position more 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.690
 accessible while in this position 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.250
 in this at this point will be the dips 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 in the middle you have to remove them 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.840
 what space there will be in this area 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.660
 this cable here in particular that is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 the one who kept the mysterious box 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.550
 to the debt of boxing that will be from 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.770
 keep because in the future when we will have 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.710
 seemed to all the members this one 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.629
 cut it into small pieces it will be useful for 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 connect hold the various cables for 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.390
 group files and not to do so much 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.220
 casino said this and proceed with 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.010
 the first phase of this second video 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.820
 or from the mysterious box they pull 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.650
 out of the hooks and I'll show you to 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.740
 what are they for? 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.490
 here there are cable structures 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.900
 ladders intended as hooks for screws and things 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.050
 various 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.260
 let's look for the ones we need 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.590
 in this case we need to see some 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.830
 these screws here or 21 pieces for the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.190
 mv sun motherboard motherboard of 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.840
 admit them here and then we need these 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.410
 here 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.860
 or 9 lost if his mother but 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.760
 we're going to see how to position them 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.170
 first and foremost professor giuliano why 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.010
 this pool here 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.010
 putting in this verse then with the 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.170
 thorns let's say in and if it sells here 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.210
 maybe doing some pressure to 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.580
 make sure that you know that you are well 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.040
 inserted once well done that la 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.530
 what I had to do if it was to 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.140
 put the motherboard inside ours 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.870
 cash to identify what the holes are 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.060
 to use this case in particular is 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.550
 arranged for the use of multiple types 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.100
 of motherboards anyway I think everyone 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.980
 that it is done in this way and puts on 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.330
 the motherboard to locate 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.290
 what holes circus the mass parts like 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.580
 in this case they are to be used then 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.459
 are to be lived as spacers ad 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.519
 example let's take this as an example 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.519
 here that there is a born extreme 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.440
 ok and let's get the card out badly 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.410
 just to see what hole we're at 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.250
 speaking taken colors as an example 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.630
 because it is the only one to choose therefore not 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.180
 there are possibilities of choice 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.720
 so we set ourselves this accessory 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.280
 nice that is given in the supply and 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.040
 go to screw this screw this 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:22.650
 spacer in this way the fingers will 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:28.049
 it is known and later understood 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:31.739
 straight we go to live with this one 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:37.730
 and live here and with these two accessories 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:40.800
 then a screwdriver and the quarry 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.180
 here we must take this point 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:49.220
 the motherboard and place it on the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:53.540
 spacers bringing it closer to the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:04:02.760
 gazette hiding it by making it fit together 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:08.390
 with spacers we do so see 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:11.910
 here are the part in mind from 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.510
 We must be careful to naught all 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:21.959
 he removes all the exits without doing them 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:23.700
 coat from the metal plate 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.920
 at this point they should be 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.840
 aligned in fact in addition to the exits e 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:38.220
 at the gates should be 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:40.530
 aligned the holes you have also here 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:46.430
 exactly what is needed at this point 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.430
 do you have to take these these screws 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:55.980
 here you see the writing well 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:59.760
 open them avoid the point where there is the 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.940
 let's say let's make you one 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.940
 demonstration 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:15.230
 let's go for example this we put there the 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:21.560
 screw then we take a screwdriver 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.560
 we screw in perfect 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.820
 now that all I saw are mounted 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.900
 we put away the excess pieces as in 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.310
 this case 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.979
 we thank this one for her 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.979
 utility and let's move on to the next part
