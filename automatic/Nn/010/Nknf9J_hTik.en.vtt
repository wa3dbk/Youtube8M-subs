00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
this is the first video demonstration of

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.560 
this is the first video demonstration of
the<00:00:04.970> automatic<00:00:05.970> cat<00:00:06.690> food<00:00:07.140> dispenser<00:00:08.570> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
the automatic cat food dispenser the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.020 
the automatic cat food dispenser the
cylinder<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.019> set<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.860> right<00:00:11.040> place<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
cylinder is set in the right place the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.730 
cylinder is set in the right place the
laser<00:00:12.240> pointer<00:00:12.750> as<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.009> see<00:00:14.250> here<00:00:14.759> is

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
laser pointer as you can see here is

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.920 
laser pointer as you can see here is
being<00:00:16.740> blocked<00:00:17.039> by<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.580> little<00:00:18.060> piece<00:00:18.779> of

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
being blocked by the little piece of

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.870 
being blocked by the little piece of
wood<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.970> on<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.029> cylinders<00:00:21.660> lid<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.880> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
wood on the on the cylinders lid and the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.779 
wood on the on the cylinders lid and the
motor<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.359> are<00:00:25.230> doing<00:00:25.529> no<00:00:25.769> control<00:00:26.250> or<00:00:26.279> set

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
motor and are doing no control or set

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.740 
motor and are doing no control or set
and<00:00:28.369> right<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.699> we're<00:00:29.939> ready<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.269> go<00:00:30.660> with

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
and right here we're ready to go with

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.459 
and right here we're ready to go with
with<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> code<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:36.210> debugging<00:00:37.020> window

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
with the code and the debugging window

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.660 
with the code and the debugging window
is<00:00:37.590> ready<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.100> I'm<00:00:38.190> going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> go<00:00:38.489> ahead<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
is ready so I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.729 
is ready so I'm going to go ahead and
set<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:41.460> serial<00:00:41.879> monitor<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.739> we'll

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
set the the serial monitor on and we'll

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.470 
set the the serial monitor on and we'll
watch<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.280> start<00:00:44.930> providing<00:00:45.930> some<00:00:46.350> feedback

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.430 

so<00:00:51.480> what's<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.410> here<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
so what's going on here is that the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.510 
so what's going on here is that the
cylinders<00:00:56.000> spinning<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:58.520> theoretically

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
cylinders spinning and theoretically

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.389 
cylinders spinning and theoretically
will<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.879> putting<00:01:00.840> dropping<00:01:01.829> fluid<00:01:02.129> into<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
will be putting dropping fluid into the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.520 
will be putting dropping fluid into the
containers<00:01:03.000> at<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> bottom<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:04.080> part<00:01:04.409> is

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
containers at the bottom that part is

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.859 
containers at the bottom that part is
not<00:01:04.680> done<00:01:04.920> yet<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
not done yet and as you can see the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.770 
not done yet and as you can see the
laser<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.710> being<00:01:08.700> blocked<00:01:08.970> every<00:01:09.330> once<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
laser is being blocked every once in a

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.469 
laser is being blocked every once in a
while<00:01:09.960> by<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> piece<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> wood<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.270> wood

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
while by the piece of wood and the wood

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.450 
while by the piece of wood and the wood
is<00:01:12.689> actually<00:01:13.680> acting<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.229> signal

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
is actually acting as the signal

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.490 
is actually acting as the signal
indicating<00:01:17.460> where<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> opening<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> this

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
indicating where the opening is so this

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.469 
indicating where the opening is so this
is<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> perfect<00:01:19.979> example<00:01:20.040> we're<00:01:20.820> waiting<00:01:21.119> we're

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
is a perfect example we're waiting we're

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.149 
is a perfect example we're waiting we're
giving<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.930> five<00:01:22.170> seconds<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:24.740> what<00:01:25.740> happened

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
giving it five seconds and what happened

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.399 
giving it five seconds and what happened
was<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.270> stopped<00:01:27.570> spinning<00:01:27.750> was

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
was that when it stopped spinning was

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.609 
was that when it stopped spinning was
when<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.520> container<00:01:30.000> actually<00:01:30.600> ended<00:01:31.020> finish

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
when the container actually ended finish

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.670 
when the container actually ended finish
or<00:01:31.860> finished<00:01:32.460> giving<00:01:33.060> food<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> did

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
or finished giving food then what I did

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.490 
or finished giving food then what I did
is<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.950> wrote<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.369> code<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:36.570> gave<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> delay

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
is I wrote on the code I gave it a delay

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.230 
is I wrote on the code I gave it a delay
of<00:01:37.530> five<00:01:37.829> seconds<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> could<00:01:38.850> tell<00:01:39.090> the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
of five seconds so you could tell the

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.789 
of five seconds so you could tell the
difference<00:01:39.829> and<00:01:40.829> then<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:43.140> code<00:01:43.350> started

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
difference and then the the code started

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.010 
difference and then the the code started
determining<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.970> disel<00:01:45.509> endures<00:01:45.720> not<00:01:45.930> in

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
determining that it disel endures not in

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.590 
determining that it disel endures not in
the<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.259> place<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.090> started<00:01:48.090> turning<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the right place and started turning the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.789 
the right place and started turning the
cylinder<00:01:49.049> until<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.520> laser<00:01:51.420> blocked<00:01:52.020> or

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
cylinder until the laser blocked or

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.920 
cylinder until the laser blocked or
excuse<00:01:53.579> me<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> piece<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> wood<00:01:54.119> block<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
excuse me the piece of wood block the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.340 
excuse me the piece of wood block the
laser<00:01:55.170> light<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.149> basically<00:01:57.689> that's<00:01:57.899> it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
laser light so basically that's it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.319 
laser light so basically that's it
that's<00:01:58.920> what<00:01:59.130> happened<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.700> if<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.149> now<00:02:00.299> look

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
that's what happened and if you now look

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.300 
that's what happened and if you now look
at<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> code<00:02:00.979> you're<00:02:01.979> seeing<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
at the code you're seeing the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.300 
at the code you're seeing the
we<00:02:04.060> see<00:02:04.270> if<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.570> can<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:05.110> don't<00:02:05.409> know<00:02:05.500> if<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:06.159> can

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
we see if I can I don't know if you can

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.029 
we see if I can I don't know if you can
really<00:02:06.520> look<00:02:07.420> at<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:07.750> but<00:02:08.020> basically<00:02:08.830> it's

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
really look at this but basically it's

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.430 
really look at this but basically it's
indicating<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.869> in<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.140> right<00:02:11.260> place

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
indicating that it is in the right place

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.850 
indicating that it is in the right place
and<00:02:11.860> it's<00:02:12.489> giving<00:02:12.760> me<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.880> light<00:02:13.180> measurement

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and it's giving me a light measurement

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.220 
and it's giving me a light measurement
indicating<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.630> in<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.959> right<00:02:17.110> place

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
indicating that it is in the right place

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.660 
indicating that it is in the right place
because<00:02:17.440> light<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:17.980> not<00:02:18.010> getting<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.550> the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
because light is not getting to the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.140 
because light is not getting to the
title<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:20.860> resistor<00:02:21.459> excuse<00:02:21.760> me<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
title to that resistor excuse me to the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.610 
title to that resistor excuse me to the
sensor<00:02:22.540> resistor<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.830> right<00:02:23.980> place<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:25.620> if

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
sensor resistor in the right place so if

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.390 
sensor resistor in the right place so if
I<00:02:26.830> try<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.250> move<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:28.239> cylinder<00:02:29.230> and<00:02:29.410> make<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
I try to move the cylinder and make the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.809 
I try to move the cylinder and make the
light<00:02:31.800> hit<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.950> sensor<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.550> going<00:02:33.760> to

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
light hit the sensor it's going to

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:46.090 
light hit the sensor it's going to
readjust<00:02:38.370> see<00:02:39.370> if<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.910> try<00:02:40.209> it<00:02:40.269> again

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.680 

it's<00:02:47.100> just<00:02:47.220> going<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.400> keep<00:02:47.580> drawing<00:02:47.850> Rhea<00:02:48.120> can

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
it's just going to keep drawing Rhea can

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.540 
it's just going to keep drawing Rhea can
I<00:02:48.780> keep<00:02:48.930> trying<00:02:49.170> until<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.590> readjusts<00:02:49.860> so

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
I keep trying until it readjusts so

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.330 
I keep trying until it readjusts so
that's<00:02:51.360> what<00:02:51.630> does<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.650> current<00:02:52.920> status<00:02:53.100> of

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
that's what does the current status of

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.140 
that's what does the current status of
it<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:54.380> I'm<00:02:55.380> close<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.890> finishing<00:02:56.370> hopefully

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
it and I'm close to finishing hopefully

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.900 
it and I'm close to finishing hopefully
so<00:02:57.870> will<00:02:58.230> provide<00:02:58.800> more<00:02:59.010> feedback<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.760> more

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
so will provide more feedback and more

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.450 
so will provide more feedback and more
videos<00:03:00.240> later
