00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.790
 to choose a high performance team 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:07.280
 three points must be taken into account 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.530
 important the first is the use that is 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.570
 is going to give you second determine the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.340
 speed capacity and the power that is 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.790
 requires last and the most important 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.440
 budget 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.510
 based on the use that is given to 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.130
 computer we should keep in mind the 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.680
 concrete specifications of each 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.360
 application or game this depends on 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.130
 the graphic requirements are more 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.480
 high because the use of resources from 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.939
 machine are older 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.710
 determines the speed the power and the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.809
 capacity that we really need is 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.820
 somewhat complex due to the large volume of 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.100
 information that exists the different 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.829
 technologies and the variety of components 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.690
 that can influence these factors 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.489
 first of all we must choose the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.019
 these processor offer 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.120
 specifications like the number of 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.370
 nuclei working frequencies between 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.289
 other features what truly 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.659
 important is that the chosen one has 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.640
 harnessed to the maximum based on our 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.229
 experience we can say that at the time 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.030
 to choose we must take into account the 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.100
 amount of instructions that is capable 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.500
 to run the processor for each cycle 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.509
 from clock to major minor or major 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.939
 processor performance in games or 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.179
 3d applications this translates into 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.619
 frames per second more stable 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:18.020
 we recommend processors 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.460
 four cores or more since they are capable 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.409
 to handle several subprocesses 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.210
 simultaneously 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.189
 The next thing we have to choose is 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.170
 our motherboard this is a 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.090
 fundamental component since of her 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.280
 all other parts depend for 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.840
 operate and communicate with each other 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.459
 same way we must determine the level 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.829
 of performance required by our 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.270
 activities is not only important that 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.369
 our chosen processor be 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.280
 compatible but also the ability to 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.079
 memory and expansion ports at the time 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.390
 to evaluate our performance we must 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.649
 keep in mind the type of chipset fits 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.299
 highlight that the plate that we choose 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.039
 will have higher or lower performance 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.469
 according to the type of chipset that includes 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.360
 since it handles various functions 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.009
 such as controlling the speed and 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.719
 RAM depending on the 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.179
 administration of various types of 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.069
 buses monitor the hard drives and their 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:07.190
 manage bandwidth throttle 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.080
 graphic and manage the audio quality 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.940
 and choosing memory is something that results 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.670
 simple although there are many 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.140
 features that offer higher 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.970
 capacity and frequency and a lower 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.430
 Latency better performance and performance 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.620
 it is important to manage two modules of 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.960
 memory so we will make the most of the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.360
 double channel technology 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.130
 regarding graphics cards its 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.750
 Advanced technology not only allows 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.550
 play games fluently for 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.080
 most modern computer but that 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.430
 It also increases the performance of 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.920
 numerous programs that require 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.720
 great graphic resources 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.670
 Application developers are usually 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.230
 give basic requirements the 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.760
 which are usually fulfilled by the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.890
 Most graphic cards 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.900
 average but if what you want is a 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.020
 extreme graphic performance we will need 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.580
 cards with high characteristics 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.770
 the factors to take into account when 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.110
 of choosing are the clock frequency 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.750
 internal this is the speed at which 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.890
 works the clock of the graphic processor 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.870
 this greatly influences the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.290
 system performance to higher 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.090
 speed better performance capacity and 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.680
 Graphics memory speed are 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.230
 decisive values â€‹â€‹for a good 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.090
 performance and bandwidth 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.210
 memory interface represent the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.610
 bus capacity to transmit data 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.380
 when choosing the hard drive we determine the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.510
 storage capacity of which 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.310
 we will have apart from having in 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.410
 account this factor is important the 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.030
 transfer speed with this 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.560
 we get that the ignition time or 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.210
 equipment shutdown and availability 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.830
 of information and the beginning of 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.510
 applications are much smaller 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.890
 already knowing previously the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.100
 configuration that the team will have 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.090
 you must choose the power supply 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.860
 we must choose the one that we 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.020
 supply the necessary warriors to 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.520
 properly feed the system is 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.740
 important to choose a certified source 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.450
 since it will guarantee us a performance 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.180
 adequate to the demands of our 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.250
 machine 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.900
 finally we select a chassis 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.150
 suitable to house the components 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.549
 chosen we must take into account the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.890
 size of the video card board and 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.900
 source of power in turn should have 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.879
 a good system airflow and 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.230
 you should think about the possibilities of 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.360
 expansion into the future 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.860
 as we mentioned initially the 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.810
 budget is a very important factor 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.699
 and depending on the money to invest 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.190
 they will also be the components that 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.229
 we can acquire we must have clear 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.180
 from the beginning of how much we have and 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.830
 so in this way we can take the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.169
 better decisions when choosing 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.850
 our configuration remember that in 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.860
 active store we are willing to 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.630
 provide the best advice and we put 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.490
 your disposition our experience in the 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.790
 assembly and configuration of equipment 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.750
 High performance store activates your store 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.750
 of trust in the internet
