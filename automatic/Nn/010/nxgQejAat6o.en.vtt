curved patterning so we're going to cut

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.980 
curved patterning so we're going to cut
out<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.970> center<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.510> we're<00:02:36.630> going<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.780> draw<00:02:36.960> a

line there and then I'm gonna add little

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:58.020 
line there and then I'm gonna add little
spikes<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.210> edges

of CDs on one of the easiest projects to

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.690 
of CDs on one of the easiest projects to
make<00:04:15.590> metal<00:04:16.590> not<00:04:16.889> so<00:04:17.070> much<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.370> might<00:04:17.519> need<00:04:17.639> a

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.390 

I<00:04:29.630> was<00:04:30.200> so<00:04:30.350> excited<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.800> first<00:04:30.830> time<00:04:31.130> I<00:04:31.250> made

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
I was so excited the first time I made

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.810 
I was so excited the first time I made
my<00:04:31.550> own<00:04:32.590> battering<00:04:33.590> had<00:04:33.860> OCD<00:04:34.040> because<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.730> was

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
my own battering had OCD because I was

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.390 
my own battering had OCD because I was
like<00:04:34.970> no<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.180> can<00:04:35.390> work<00:04:35.480> with<00:04:35.660> plastic<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:37.340> I

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
like no I can work with plastic and I

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.040 
like no I can work with plastic and I
realized<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:37.910> couldn't<00:04:38.120> mold<00:04:38.390> it<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:38.900> stuff

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
realized I couldn't mold it and stuff

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.170 
realized I couldn't mold it and stuff
like<00:04:39.170> that<00:04:39.380> because<00:04:39.890> I<00:04:40.130> was<00:04:40.250> a<00:04:40.280> little<00:04:40.400> i<00:04:40.850> made

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
like that because I was a little i made

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.830 
like that because I was a little i made
my<00:04:41.330> first<00:04:41.360> Batarang<00:04:42.020> out<00:04:42.110> of<00:04:42.230> a<00:04:42.290> CD

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.910 

now<00:04:48.440> warning<00:04:49.130> this<00:04:49.520> truck<00:04:50.120> will<00:04:50.450> be<00:04:50.480> sharp

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
now warning this truck will be sharp

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.040 
now warning this truck will be sharp
that's<00:04:51.920> why<00:04:52.130> I<00:04:52.160> use<00:04:52.370> duct<00:04:52.580> tape<00:04:52.760> and<00:04:53.270> I'd<00:04:53.810> trim

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
that's why I use duct tape and I'd trim

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.520 
that's why I use duct tape and I'd trim
down<00:04:54.230> the<00:04:54.380> edges<00:04:55.990> if<00:04:56.990> you<00:04:57.110> cut<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.470> right

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
down the edges if you cut it the right

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.800 
down the edges if you cut it the right
way<00:04:57.710> it<00:04:57.950> will<00:04:58.070> cut<00:04:58.310> anybody<00:04:59.060> if<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.450> hits<00:04:59.630> it<00:04:59.750> on

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
way it will cut anybody if it hits it on

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:08.689 
way it will cut anybody if it hits it on
the<00:04:59.870> wrong<00:05:00.050> side

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.790 

so<00:05:09.270> like<00:05:09.419> I<00:05:09.569> said<00:05:09.629> this<00:05:10.199> project<00:05:10.409> is<00:05:10.710> probably

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
so like I said this project is probably

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.989 
so like I said this project is probably
rated<00:05:11.460> for<00:05:11.669> no.1<00:05:12.030> three<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.110> under<00:05:13.759> you<00:05:14.759> can

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:14.999 
rated for no.1 three and under you can

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.689 
rated for no.1 three and under you can
make<00:05:15.659> a<00:05:15.930> battering<00:05:16.530> fine<00:05:16.800> that<00:05:17.039> won't<00:05:17.279> cut

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
make a battering fine that won't cut

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:25.239 
make a battering fine that won't cut
them<00:05:18.680> at<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:20.009> young<00:05:20.219> age<00:05:21.620> because<00:05:22.620> that<00:05:22.889> sucks

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:25.249 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:27.170 

doing<00:05:26.249> the<00:05:26.310> projects<00:05:26.759> that<00:05:26.789> you're<00:05:26.939> gonna<00:05:27.090> use

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
doing the projects that you're gonna use

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.980 
doing the projects that you're gonna use
this<00:05:27.840> for<00:05:27.900> fun<00:05:28.349> and<00:05:28.680> then<00:05:28.889> getting<00:05:29.159> cut<00:05:29.990> that

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
this for fun and then getting cut that

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.640 
this for fun and then getting cut that
is<00:05:31.110> no<00:05:31.469> good<00:05:33.020> and<00:05:34.020> so<00:05:34.139> as<00:05:34.229> you<00:05:34.319> can<00:05:34.379> see<00:05:34.529> I'm

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
is no good and so as you can see I'm

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.989 
is no good and so as you can see I'm
doing<00:05:34.680> this<00:05:34.949> like<00:05:35.159> sparkly<00:05:35.639> stuff<00:05:35.819> all<00:05:35.969> over

00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:35.999 
doing this like sparkly stuff all over

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.839 
doing this like sparkly stuff all over
and<00:05:36.569> there's<00:05:37.439> like<00:05:37.650> chunks<00:05:38.189> of<00:05:38.279> plastic<00:05:38.580> and

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
and there's like chunks of plastic and

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.850 
and there's like chunks of plastic and
that<00:05:39.029> chunks<00:05:39.449> of<00:05:39.539> plastic<00:05:39.840> of<00:05:39.990> white<00:05:40.139> glass<00:05:40.409> so

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
that chunks of plastic of white glass so

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.740 
that chunks of plastic of white glass so
I<00:05:40.919> would<00:05:41.159> suggest<00:05:41.370> keeping<00:05:41.789> your<00:05:42.120> area<00:05:42.449> free

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
I would suggest keeping your area free

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.080 
I would suggest keeping your area free
of<00:05:42.779> that<00:05:43.050> because<00:05:43.590> if<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.800> were<00:05:43.949> to<00:05:44.009> like<00:05:44.219> do

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
of that because if I were to like do

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:54.850 
of that because if I were to like do
that<00:05:45.240> like<00:05:45.449> I<00:05:45.629> sometimes<00:05:45.990> do<00:05:48.169> cut<00:05:49.169> myself<00:05:53.539> I

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
that like I sometimes do cut myself I

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.930 

seedy<00:06:50.740> sometimes<00:06:51.130> I<00:06:51.250> repairing<00:06:51.580> the<00:06:51.670> but<00:06:51.820> I

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
seedy sometimes I repairing the but I

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.030 
seedy sometimes I repairing the but I

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040 
will admit it they fly pretty well

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.620 
will admit it they fly pretty well
depending<00:06:57.040> upon<00:06:57.130> the<00:06:57.310> design<00:06:57.580> you<00:06:57.670> make<00:06:57.790> they

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.630 
depending upon the design you make they

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.280 
depending upon the design you make they
