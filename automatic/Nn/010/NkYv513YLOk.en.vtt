so<00:00:34.250> without<00:00:34.520> further<00:00:34.820> ado<00:00:35.329> here's<00:00:36.230> DeLeo<00:00:37.039> I

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
so without further ado here's DeLeo I

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.880 
so without further ado here's DeLeo I
just<00:00:38.449> basically<00:00:38.600> put<00:00:39.079> some<00:00:39.230> tape<00:00:39.440> on<00:00:39.620> there

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
just basically put some tape on there

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.279 
just basically put some tape on there
looked<00:00:40.579> about<00:00:40.819> where<00:00:41.030> I<00:00:41.059> wanted<00:00:41.449> it<00:00:41.569> to<00:00:41.659> go<00:00:41.690> try

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
looked about where I wanted it to go try

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.290 
looked about where I wanted it to go try
to<00:00:42.319> eyeball<00:00:42.679> it<00:00:42.949> level<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:43.579> I'm<00:00:43.879> just<00:00:44.089> putting

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
to eyeball it level and I'm just putting

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.630 
to eyeball it level and I'm just putting
it<00:00:44.479> up<00:00:44.569> there<00:00:44.600> just<00:00:45.140> to<00:00:45.260> get<00:00:45.379> it<00:00:45.499> up<00:00:45.620> there<00:00:45.800> once

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
it up there just to get it up there once

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.880 
it up there just to get it up there once
I've<00:00:46.850> got<00:00:47.089> it<00:00:47.120> relatively<00:00:48.079> where<00:00:48.409> I<00:00:48.440> want<00:00:48.800> it

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
I've got it relatively where I want it

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.099 
I've got it relatively where I want it
that's<00:00:49.519> when<00:00:49.699> I<00:00:49.760> go<00:00:49.940> ahead<00:00:50.030> and<00:00:50.210> take<00:00:50.329> my<00:00:50.359> tape

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
that's when I go ahead and take my tape

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.919 
that's when I go ahead and take my tape
measure<00:00:51.139> and<00:00:51.979> pull<00:00:52.219> measurements<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.780> the

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
measure and pull measurements to the

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.959 
measure and pull measurements to the
flats<00:00:54.319> of<00:00:54.589> each<00:00:54.739> letter<00:00:55.010> at<00:00:55.309> least<00:00:55.339> wherever

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
flats of each letter at least wherever

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.969 
flats of each letter at least wherever
it's<00:00:56.239> flat<00:00:56.569> at<00:00:56.780> least<00:00:56.960> on<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:57.199> same<00:00:57.409> line<00:00:57.710> so

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
it's flat at least on the same line so

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.189 
it's flat at least on the same line so
that<00:00:58.010> way<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:58.339> ensure<00:00:58.609> your<00:00:59.449> graphic<00:00:59.960> being

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
that way you ensure your graphic being

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.629 
that way you ensure your graphic being
level<00:01:00.530> it's<00:01:00.859> going<00:01:00.979> to<00:01:01.069> go<00:01:01.190> over<00:01:01.399> here<00:01:01.579> and

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:01.639 
level it's going to go over here and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:03.759 
level it's going to go over here and
make<00:01:01.819> sure<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:02.299> the<00:01:02.420> other<00:01:02.600> side<00:01:02.929> is<00:01:03.559> the

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
make sure that the other side is the

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.920 
make sure that the other side is the
same<00:01:03.979> and<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:04.729> is<00:01:04.879> now<00:01:05.210> that<00:01:05.269> I've<00:01:05.479> got<00:01:05.690> this

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
same and it is now that I've got this

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.830 
same and it is now that I've got this
where<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:06.140> want<00:01:06.440> it<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:06.740> hinge<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:07.540> on<00:01:08.540> a<00:01:08.570> bigger

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
where I want it I hinge it on a bigger

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.630 
where I want it I hinge it on a bigger
graphic<00:01:09.320> like<00:01:09.470> this<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.860> would<00:01:10.009> use<00:01:10.399> just

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
graphic like this I would use just

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.270 
graphic like this I would use just
regular<00:01:10.700> two-inch<00:01:11.479> masks<00:01:11.950> run<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:12.979> strip

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
regular two-inch masks run a strip

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.300 
regular two-inch masks run a strip
across<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.820> top<00:01:14.170> half<00:01:15.170> on<00:01:15.789> half<00:01:16.789> off<00:01:18.219> get<00:01:19.219> it

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
across the top half on half off get it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.920 
across the top half on half off get it
right<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:19.579> the<00:01:19.700> edge<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.060> graphic<00:01:20.539> and

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
right to the edge of the graphic and

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.660 
right to the edge of the graphic and
stop<00:01:21.259> it<00:01:21.439> right<00:01:21.469> there<00:01:21.649> so<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.399> when<00:01:22.549> you

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
stop it right there so that when you

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.310 
stop it right there so that when you
hinge<00:01:22.939> it<00:01:23.119> up<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:23.570> don't<00:01:23.719> have<00:01:23.899> that<00:01:24.049> excess

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
hinge it up you don't have that excess

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.709 
hinge it up you don't have that excess
tape<00:01:24.560> on<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.859> side<00:01:25.070> now<00:01:25.609> my<00:01:25.759> next<00:01:26.000> step<00:01:26.270> go

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
tape on the side now my next step go

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.910 
tape on the side now my next step go
ahead<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.200> precut<00:01:27.789> everywhere<00:01:29.920> there's

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
ahead and precut everywhere there's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.209 
ahead and precut everywhere there's
going<00:01:31.070> to<00:01:31.130> be<00:01:31.219> rivets<00:01:31.670> behind<00:01:32.030> there<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:34.070> my

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
going to be rivets behind there so my

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.889 
going to be rivets behind there so my
job<00:01:34.460> now<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:35.200> just<00:01:36.200> feel<00:01:36.469> along<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.009> line

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
job now is to just feel along the line

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.560 
job now is to just feel along the line
making<00:01:38.899> tensions<00:01:39.590> in<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.880> paper<00:01:41.149> so<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.450> you

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
making tensions in the paper so that you

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.800 
making tensions in the paper so that you
can<00:01:41.810> actually<00:01:42.109> see<00:01:42.350> them<00:01:43.390> that<00:01:44.390> way<00:01:44.450> it's

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
can actually see them that way it's

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.109 
can actually see them that way it's
easier<00:01:45.140> for<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.469> cut<00:01:45.770> them<00:01:45.950> out<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.909> ones

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
easier for you to cut them out the ones

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.389 
easier for you to cut them out the ones
you<00:01:47.270> can<00:01:47.479> cut<00:01:47.750> out<00:01:48.100> doesn't<00:01:49.100> have<00:01:49.189> to<00:01:49.310> be

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
you can cut out doesn't have to be

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.539 
you can cut out doesn't have to be
pretty<00:01:50.350> just<00:01:51.350> visible<00:01:51.829> enough<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:52.310> when<00:01:52.460> you

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
pretty just visible enough so when you

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.330 
pretty just visible enough so when you
set<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.969> vinyl<00:01:53.299> back<00:01:53.450> down<00:01:53.890> your<00:01:54.890> rivet<00:01:55.130> is

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
set the vinyl back down your rivet is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.060 
set the vinyl back down your rivet is
exposed<00:01:55.729> just<00:01:56.119> repeat<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.420> process

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
exposed just repeat that process

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.410 
exposed just repeat that process
everywhere<00:01:58.070> where<00:01:58.520> there's<00:01:58.670> not<00:01:58.939> going<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.299> be

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
everywhere where there's not going to be

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.880 
everywhere where there's not going to be
vinyl<00:01:59.929> you<00:02:00.200> do<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
vinyl you do the
