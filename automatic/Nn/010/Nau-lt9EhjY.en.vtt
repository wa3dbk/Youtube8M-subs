00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 I have a button in my ear that is 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:09.059
 but no boring headset what it 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.620
 Exactly, we'll explain you hello now 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.660
 here is often the beginning i am in munich 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.240
 on the wave technologies conference 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.940
 together nicolai of draghi is the one 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.130
 company brings out the laundry that is 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.230
 this little button in my ear and that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.600
 is much more than a small one 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.240
 a little more music from the clock is not playing 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.460
 You are the inventor or founder 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.679
 the company has something to do with cash 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.219
 what is the little button all it is 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.600
 a smart and smart headphones 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.730
 that does not necessarily mean that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.640
 Schleuser is you or me because it is under 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.950
 no circumstances work headphones 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.989
 He has a lot of sensors in it 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.649
 measures and understands what I do and how 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.230
 I do it 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.180
 okay that's really in it now so he 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.460
 can play music from mine 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 smartphone but also for the first time 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.579
 is a headphone for both ears without 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.559
 Cable and he can with or without mobile phone 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.690
 play there is space for 1000 liters in the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.510
 head in the little knot what you do 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.450
 there in the ear and it can be synonymous 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.880
 Play via bluetooth of the phone 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.650
 In addition, what I measure is what I measure 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 measures how I move so how 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.939
 swim or cyclist or run 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.040
 then it's how fast how far and how 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.170
 for a long time I did and will 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.909
 He can also measure what my pulse 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.729
 is what my oxygen saturation is 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.409
 my respects advise everything that makes 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.079
 not only to reproduce it 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.790
 but also unable to understand in 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.259
 which situation I am that is one 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.250
 ongoing process where we are more we 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.049
 can add 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.610
 we have an operating system that 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.180
 this headphone runs like this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.670
 computer and this is the head 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.070
 just as fast as a laptop from before 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.009
 15 years everything in the smallest space 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.939
 with 15 sensors okay that's it 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.990
 probably a motion sensor 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.250
 inside has the gps or how one is 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.630
 while cycling or while running 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.700
 those ideas are just the ones 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.799
 the driver is stuck with the movement 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.350
 Princes heavier when the head is the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.000
 relatively quiet around the way forward 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.590
 the gps trainer or how did you do 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.989
 the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.239
 there is no gps 3g s you do not need 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.640
 to see how fast what is doing there 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.030
 is an extra meter so one 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.209
 acceleration sensor 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.190
 there is a sensor there is a magnet so 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.760
 a compass in it and everything in three 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.620
 axes 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.330
 so it can measure if I'm up 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.760
 watch him right and left but also 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.049
 in which direction looked 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.379
 beyond that, I also measure 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:33.620
 outside sounds i measure the language 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.030
 through the nasal cavity and the original way 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.629
 that we do not hear the sounds from the outside 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.160
 take up 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.540
 so i can also use it as a headset 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:45.190
 use and that is not swiss 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.780
 pocketknife but it is a smaller one 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.459
 computer sitting higher in my head 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.950
 sounds good is it intended 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.790
 that he is applicable to many different 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.670
 One of the first things we do 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.079
 show is called macros that is 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.840
 the accelerator is not just for that 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.360
 We measure how I walk but also 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.000
 if I can get a call to eg 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.299
 I just nod and with that I start 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.010
 my call or I can wait three seconds 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.660
 look the sky and it says with all 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.160
 how the weather is what to look for myself 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.069
 usually like the weather today 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.900
 is you have four different ones 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.870
 sizes that you can adapt to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.670
 and there is not much room there, how is that ? 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.959
 with the battery life than the ever hold 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.970
 after how i use it 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.040
 Definitions I have between three 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.389
 and four hours 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.609
 and if I only measure up to twelve 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.290
 So when I hear music ever 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.919
 after how much and how exactly I 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.450
 wants to measure 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.060
 three to four hours but it will be for 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.040
 I decided if I did not like that 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.989
 I am fast for marathon then I leave 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.459
 that just four and a half hours run 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.709
 instead of three hours I would now 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.660
 declining to say four hours of the 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.380
 alcohol is here then I take that part 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.359
 puts the headphones in and inside 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.829
 In this part is a battery pack and 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.359
 experiences my headphones up to five times 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.190
 without going to a power outlet 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.680
 we have to worry about new juice 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.829
 skier with the break I purely and 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.349
 I have just recharged the 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.049
 comes after the break beautifully in silk 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.819
 her last year at kickstarter 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.140
 have come out big somehow 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.630
 successfully collected money 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.910
 finance the whole now 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.240
 January on the ces was or even sinks 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.560
 they receive the award from the fair 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.450
 the colleague family was also at that time 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.280
 kickstarter you gefahndet with 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.170
 the waiting desperate as the 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.570
 when did you get so far when? 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.560
 finally comes for the first time without the 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.600
 christoph becker would not have it 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.650
 So , thanks for the first time 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.900
 kik stadtberger outside 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.410
 We assume that in April 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.090
 and may deliver the equipment if we 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.040
 do not get unforeseen problems 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.080
 can always happen but like ours 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.250
 current schedule is april times i am 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.110
 I'm really looking forward to it 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.270
 really longer time to arrive too 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.290
 try it and I enjoy it too 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.570
 to make because it's always a bit 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.460
 as he is now always stuck in fear 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.620
 field goes out with it floating or 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.660
 so on we keep that through there 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:06.940
 I'm really looking forward to it and 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:09.340
 wish you all the best and if 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.360
 you want to know more about lever up 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.680
 level until new technologies look 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.870
 subscribed to power over again 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.870
 our channel was still intact
