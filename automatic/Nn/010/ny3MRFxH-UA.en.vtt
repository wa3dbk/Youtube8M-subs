00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
it's fun it's complete nonsense and if

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.330 
it's fun it's complete nonsense and if
you're<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> bumblebee<00:02:09.720> or<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> dinosaur<00:02:10.860> fan

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
you're a bumblebee or a dinosaur fan

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.270 
you're a bumblebee or a dinosaur fan
then<00:02:11.610> sure<00:02:12.239> why<00:02:12.720> not<00:02:12.930> pick<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.170> up<00:02:13.439> so<00:02:14.189> you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
then sure why not pick it up so you

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.399 
then sure why not pick it up so you
transform<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.879> let's<00:02:15.060> flip<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.629> tile<00:02:15.959> up<00:02:16.230> out

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
transform and let's flip the tile up out

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.729 
transform and let's flip the tile up out
of<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> way<00:02:16.769> these<00:02:17.730> shoulders<00:02:18.269> are<00:02:18.510> on<00:02:18.689> a<00:02:19.019> bull

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739

hinge<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:21.330> pivot<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:21.659> you<00:02:21.989> can<00:02:22.260> see<00:02:22.379> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
hinge and a pivot so you can see the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.130 
hinge and a pivot so you can see the
ball<00:02:22.709> hinge<00:02:23.250> there<00:02:23.549> so<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.299> swing<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.020> around

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.800 
with the other side to swing it and
pull<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.510> forward<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:32.550> can<00:02:32.820> keep<00:02:33.180> these<00:02:33.360> arms

going a Thor head thing which I suppose
you<00:03:01.860> could<00:03:02.010> do<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:03.120> pop<00:03:03.270> his<00:03:03.450> tail<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.340> a

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
you could do just pop his tail this is a

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.950 
you could do just pop his tail this is a
tailpipe<00:03:05.850> any<00:03:06.120> further<00:03:06.360> than<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:06.930> is

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
tailpipe any further than that that is

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.630 
tailpipe any further than that that is
as<00:03:07.170> far<00:03:07.440> as<00:03:07.620> his<00:03:07.800> tail<00:03:08.010> comes<00:03:08.250> out<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.460> he<00:03:08.520> has

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
as far as his tail comes out so he has

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.040 
as far as his tail comes out so he has
got<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.850> little<00:03:08.970> bit<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.240> tail<00:03:09.450> kibble<00:03:09.900> there

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
got a little bit of tail kibble there

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.470 
got a little bit of tail kibble there
and<00:03:10.710> he<00:03:10.920> does<00:03:11.190> come<00:03:11.670> with<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.210> pretty<00:03:13.200> hefty

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
and he does come with a pretty hefty

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.700 
and he does come with a pretty hefty
launcher<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.540> I've<00:03:15.690> seen<00:03:16.020> this<00:03:16.350> somewhere

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
launcher and I've seen this somewhere

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.430 
launcher and I've seen this somewhere
before<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.130> think<00:03:17.580> it's<00:03:17.880> one<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.780> Mick<00:03:19.110> tech

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
before I think it's one of the Mick tech

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.610 
before I think it's one of the Mick tech
guns<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:20.730> they've<00:03:20.850> kind<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.380> cast<00:03:22.380> a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
guns that they've kind of just cast a

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.280 
guns that they've kind of just cast a
mold<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.930> painted<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.020> yellow

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
mold of and painted it yellow

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.050 
mold of and painted it yellow
if<00:03:25.740> anybody<00:03:26.040> knows<00:03:26.190> which<00:03:26.430> one<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:26.670> was<00:03:26.700> from

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
if anybody knows which one it was from

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.290 
if anybody knows which one it was from
let<00:03:27.480> me<00:03:27.600> know<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.780> think<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.560> was<00:03:29.120> possibly<00:03:30.120> one

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
let me know I think it was possibly one

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.570 
let me know I think it was possibly one
of<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.420> Optimus<00:03:30.780> Prime's<00:03:31.050> but<00:03:31.430> don't<00:03:32.430> quote

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
me on that and we can pop that in dyno

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.590 
me on that and we can pop that in dyno
B's<00:03:37.460> and<00:03:38.460> just<00:03:38.820> pop<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:41.070> there<00:03:41.250> we<00:03:41.340> go

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
B's and just pop that in and there we go

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.130 
B's and just pop that in and there we go
one<00:03:42.890> dinosaur<00:03:43.890> age<00:03:44.520> of<00:03:44.760> extinction<00:03:45.210> possibly

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
one dinosaur age of extinction possibly

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.040 
one dinosaur age of extinction possibly
he<00:03:46.290> inspired<00:03:46.910> bumblebee<00:03:47.910> let's<00:03:48.150> just<00:03:48.360> see<00:03:48.630> how

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
he inspired bumblebee let's just see how

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.580 
he inspired bumblebee let's just see how
he<00:03:49.280> scales<00:03:50.280> up<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:51.450> real<00:03:52.400> figure<00:03:53.400> let's<00:03:53.670> take

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
he scales up to a real figure let's take

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.240 
he scales up to a real figure let's take
Voyager<00:03:56.390> spring<00:03:57.390> up<00:03:57.540> yes<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:58.710> he's<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:58.950> good

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
Voyager spring up yes so he's a good

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.930 
Voyager spring up yes so he's a good
size

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
size

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.820 
size
yes<00:04:00.300> he's<00:04:00.600> somewhat<00:04:01.170> limited<00:04:01.680> in

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
yes he's somewhat limited in

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.960 
yes he's somewhat limited in
articulation<00:04:02.930> but<00:04:03.930> it's<00:04:04.530> still<00:04:04.980> obviously<00:04:05.670> a

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
articulation but it's still obviously a

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.910 
articulation but it's still obviously a
bumblebee<00:04:06.750> there<00:04:06.990> there's<00:04:07.200> no<00:04:07.470> doubt<00:04:07.770> about

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
bumblebee there there's no doubt about

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.570 
bumblebee there there's no doubt about
that<00:04:08.450> would<00:04:09.450> have<00:04:09.570> liked<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:10.230> little<00:04:10.800> bit<00:04:11.190> more

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
that would have liked a little bit more

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.570 
that would have liked a little bit more
from<00:04:11.880> him<00:04:12.710> it's<00:04:13.710> just<00:04:13.770> a<00:04:13.950> shame<00:04:14.220> he<00:04:14.520> is

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
from him it's just a shame he is

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.610 
from him it's just a shame he is
hollowed<00:04:15.330> out<00:04:15.480> as<00:04:15.690> much<00:04:15.870> as<00:04:16.020> he<00:04:16.140> is<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.560> you

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
hollowed out as much as he is and you

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.180 
hollowed out as much as he is and you
can't<00:04:17.299> completely<00:04:18.299> flip<00:04:19.140> this<00:04:19.440> tail<00:04:19.830> I<00:04:20.040> mean

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
oh I think I'm gonna wreck it's probably

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.340 
oh I think I'm gonna wreck it's probably
gonna<00:04:23.820> break<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.420> plastic<00:04:24.870> they<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.110> know<00:04:25.290> he

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350

gonna break the plastic they you know he
said<00:04:25.560> I've<00:04:25.650> tried<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.950> force<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.250> up<00:04:26.310> and<00:04:26.490> start

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
said I've tried to force it up and start

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.900 
said I've tried to force it up and start
to<00:04:26.850> stress<00:04:27.150> there<00:04:27.390> so<00:04:27.540> it<00:04:27.840> definitely<00:04:28.020> doesn't

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
to stress there so it definitely doesn't

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.080 
to stress there so it definitely doesn't
push<00:04:29.910> up<00:04:30.120> but<00:04:30.660> he's<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:30.990> nice<00:04:31.290> figure<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.090> if

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
push up but he's a nice figure and if

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.910 
push up but he's a nice figure and if
you're<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.420> bumblebee<00:04:33.810> collector<00:04:34.230> I<00:04:34.380> think<00:04:34.710> he

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
you're a bumblebee collector I think he

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.250 
you're a bumblebee collector I think he
could<00:04:35.280> even<00:04:35.670> be<00:04:35.850> a<00:04:35.880> must<00:04:36.090> it's<00:04:36.510> quite<00:04:36.810> clearly

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.730 
could even be a must it's quite clearly
