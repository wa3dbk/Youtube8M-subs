minor D B minor 7 C major 7 and we're

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:54.010 
minor D B minor 7 C major 7 and we're
going<00:01:40.679> to<00:01:40.740> strum<00:01:41.069> them<00:01:41.219> in<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.459> way

now we can strum these chords in a
couple<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.789> ways<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.810> go<00:01:58.020> straight<00:01:58.710> down

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
couple of ways we can go straight down

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:12.010 
couple of ways we can go straight down
on<00:01:59.340> all<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.520> them<00:01:59.729> all<00:01:59.969> down<00:02:00.359> strums<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:01.020> this

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:26.610 

or<00:02:12.560> we<00:02:12.800> can<00:02:12.950> strum<00:02:13.310> up<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:13.610> down<00:02:13.790> like<00:02:14.120> this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.220 

now<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.710> trick<00:02:28.130> about<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.960> particular<00:02:29.960> song

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
now the trick about this particular song

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.110 
now the trick about this particular song
is<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.860> way<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:32.830> notes<00:02:33.830> are<00:02:34.070> struck<00:02:34.460> and<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
is the way the notes are struck and the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.570 
is the way the notes are struck and the
timing<00:02:35.660> that<00:02:35.690> they're<00:02:35.960> struck<00:02:36.350> on<00:02:36.560> okay<00:02:37.370> we've

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
timing that they're struck on okay we've

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.200 
timing that they're struck on okay we've
got<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.820> strum<00:02:38.380> after<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.950> one<00:02:40.160> beat<00:02:40.460> okay<00:02:41.150> so

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
got a strum after the one beat okay so

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.810 
got a strum after the one beat okay so
it's<00:02:41.690> one<00:02:42.230> then<00:02:42.710> you<00:02:42.830> do<00:02:43.010> an<00:02:43.100> upstroke<00:02:43.580> if

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
it's one then you do an upstroke if

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.790 
it's one then you do an upstroke if
you're<00:02:43.940> doing<00:02:44.120> up<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:44.900> down<00:02:45.080> stroke<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:45.710> you

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
you're doing up and down stroke so you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:56.210 
you're doing up and down stroke so you
got<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.130> go<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:51.130> like<00:02:52.130> that<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.730> we've<00:02:52.910> got<00:02:53.180> one

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.289 

one

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
one

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.640 
one
why

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.190 

now<00:03:04.250> I've<00:03:04.370> got<00:03:04.549> my<00:03:04.580> metronome<00:03:05.120> handy<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.080> I'm

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
now I've got my metronome handy so I'm

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.020 
now I've got my metronome handy so I'm
going<00:03:06.379> to<00:03:06.409> try<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.680> show<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.370> how<00:03:07.640> this<00:03:07.790> works

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
going to try to show you how this works

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.690 
going to try to show you how this works
with<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.360> metronome<00:03:08.750> now<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.530> bell<00:03:09.920> is<00:03:10.280> going

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
with the metronome now the bell is going

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.259 
with the metronome now the bell is going
to<00:03:10.819> be<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.060> one<00:03:11.269> beat<00:03:11.540> two<00:03:12.290> three<00:03:13.040> four<00:03:13.670> one

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
to be the one beat two three four one

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.039 
to be the one beat two three four one
two<00:03:14.840> three<00:03:15.200> four<00:03:16.129> one<00:03:16.700> your<00:03:17.330> strumming<00:03:17.629> up<00:03:17.870> and

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
two three four one your strumming up and

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.839 
two three four one your strumming up and
now<00:03:18.200> like<00:03:18.470> this<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.950> you've<00:03:19.069> got<00:03:19.159> to<00:03:19.250> start<00:03:19.640> on

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
now like this and you've got to start on

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:44.170 
now like this and you've got to start on
the<00:03:20.120> upstroke<00:03:20.720> one<00:03:21.530> two<00:03:22.159> three<00:03:22.819> four<00:03:23.390> one<00:03:23.930> one

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:53.240 

and<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.890> pattern<00:03:47.190> was<00:03:51.590> like<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.890> so<00:03:53.160> if

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
and that pattern was like that so if

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.449 
and that pattern was like that so if
you're<00:03:53.370> strumming<00:03:53.730> like<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.379> you<00:03:55.379> go<00:03:55.709> one

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
you're strumming like this you go one

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.670 
you're strumming like this you go one
and<00:03:56.790> you're<00:03:56.970> going<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.120> go<00:03:57.239> down<00:03:57.510> on<00:03:57.540> one<00:03:58.019> so

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
and you're going to go down on one so

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.339 
and you're going to go down on one so
it's<00:03:58.860> one<00:04:00.890> down<00:04:02.390> just<00:04:03.390> like<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.140> we're

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
it's one down just like that so we're

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.910 
it's one down just like that so we're
gonna<00:04:04.440> start<00:04:05.099> with<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:06.120> down<00:04:06.450> strum<00:04:06.959> on<00:04:07.230> one

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
gonna start with the down strum on one

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.680 
gonna start with the down strum on one
but<00:04:08.310> we're<00:04:08.430> not<00:04:08.610> gonna<00:04:08.790> strike<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.300> guitar

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
but we're not gonna strike the guitar

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:29.360
