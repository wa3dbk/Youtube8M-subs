00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.020
 make super easy and super recipes 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.220
 nutritious 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.810
 What will they do basically your 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.689
 as I 'm always doing things 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.640
 I have thought about doing something 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.480
 make it a little more natural and more 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.850
 let's say without so much fat 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.410
 and nothing I hope you like 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.950
 the first idea is very simple only 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:51.150
 we need rye bread and fruit salad 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.150
 that we have made at home 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.780
 we spread everything well and we can add 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.370
 sugar if we want 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.370
 we will also throw cinnamon 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.869
 the second idea is very easy only 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.770
 we need a banana natural marmalade 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.490

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.490
 and rye bread 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.770
 we sliced ​​our banana 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.140
 and we are going to spread a layer of jam 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.140
 and another yogurt on top 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.250
 next we add the pieces of 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.060
 cheese and on top the slices of 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.460
 this day is my favorite without a doubt 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.079
 for our last idea we are going to 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.500
 need some moldy bread strawberries 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.500
 leveled homemade 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.580
 we put our slices in the toaster 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.990
 let's cut the green part of the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.130
 strawberry and cut it lengthwise 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.130
 sliced 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.930
 when we toast them 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.210
 we will leave a layer of jam and good 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.540

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.540
 ready
