00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 do it 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.059
 hi i am andre and this is the archos 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.059
 101 xs 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.179
 mega life at the archos 10 is one 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.580
 of course the archos themselves docking 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.599
 station with keyboard and adapter and a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.599
 micro usb cable 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.240
 we see the argus closer now 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.160
 we find natural here in the middle 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.130
 10.1 inch screen with a resolution of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.199
 1280 by 800 pixels on the left 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.690
 find the front facing camera and one 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.489
 microphone from to the right there 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 find and speaker grill with a monoski 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.220
 mono speaker and go to the bottom 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.199
 there we find the cap connector then go 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.549
 we find the right side there we find 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.909
 volume keys and 

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:49.229
 charge lamp and the on and off button go to 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.510
 the top there finds nothing at all 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.850
 we find to the left side 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.619
 micro sd card slot a mini usb 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.900
 connection here also finds another 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.949
 headset port and a mini hdmi 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.110
 connection 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.659
 we go to the back we find one 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.280
 metal finish and dream one is that 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:09.030
 simply finished from the same plastic 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.100
 if the front you go see how this 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.030
 archos tablet works exactly for that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.040
 him for a moment 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 we a lok him well we see that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.210
 runs on android 4 point 1 he has 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.620
 namely received an update so was allowed 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.330
 you still get in without 4 being one 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.100
 you can update it right away 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.880
 well we see that it is reasonable commercials 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.920
 is going 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 we don't have much white or anything here 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.570
 such pre-installed from arkels 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.000
 somewhere it delivers him fairly bald with it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.170
 are some applications included 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.580
 after the smooth turning is done by the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.440
 another or a giga the duo core 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.180
 processor we see it in combination 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.020
 with android free point a just fine 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.890
 is going 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.140
 we see some included 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.810
 applications such as archel three 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.030
 mozart as video with which you can make videos 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.280
 See, in a nicer environment 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.290
 also HDMI out so you can also HDMI via 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.670
 HDMI of course connect the tablet to 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.280
 for example one 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.800
 and television then we continue to watch 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.330
 we have another photo frame application and one 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.220
 number of extra 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.799
 yes mapping settings so you 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.770
 also, for example, games 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.110
 controls can connect to it so you can 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.450
 connect control to use 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.790
 in combination with this tablet 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.569
 Well, let's go back and have a look 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.609
 to the quality of 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.680
 yes the image and also how fast it is 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.760
 is to do by means of a benchmark gl 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.639
 benchmark 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.499
 so give the base in la the resolution 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.629
 1280 by 800 pixels 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:30.069
 And yes that is basically for this 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.200
 price range not wrong 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.030
 only the screen does come a bit 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.790
 we will be right about that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:43.709
 see the benchmark 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.709
 runs without too much trouble 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.870
 but the colors don't come in full 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.609
 sparkling to their right so it is one 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.659
 somewhat faded the screen also what 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.400
 brighter 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.900
 it is fairly dark 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.150
 calls its full clarity and yet 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.590
 does the fund appear dark so if 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.659
 you will not be in direct sunlight 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.859
 so very nice 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.780
 well we see that for the rest reasonable 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.760
 running smoothly, he sometimes thrusts a bit 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.739
 but therefore a very tough benchmark 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.530
 and in itself this is a good result then 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.519
 we look back a moment to 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.780
 the browser 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.730
 the interesting thing about the browser is 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.349
 of course that we can type here and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.419
 the fun of this tablet is of course 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.329
 that we have supplied round the block 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:25.000
 well we see here also is very simple 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.949
 you click the tablet actually 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.989
 just do it up because if 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.459
 if you don't do that, he will fall on his seat 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.590
 continue with magnets fixed 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.810
 well they grab the tablet and we 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.430
 stop in wall 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.439
 then we see that the tablet is firmly fixed 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.939
 he is so clicked with those magnets too 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.549
 a bit firmer that he is not alone 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.709
 but rest on that foot and yes everything works 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.819
 right so you can start typing right and 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.949
 In this case we want to go to the webshop 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.319
 website to see how fast it is 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:52.870
 tablet drives exactly 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.819
 See that the browser goes very fast that 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.639
 we really noticed and the browser 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.259
 loading websites et cetera really works 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.629
 without problems can also be very fast 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.590
 zoom in and that's pretty nice so it 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.629
 is an ideal 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.979
 yes ideal tablet to also enjoy on the 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.930
 bench to sit and just enjoy it too 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.909
 browser to my keyboard that 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.829
 yes that is a bit smaller than normal 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.750
 but once you get it you can 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.370
 also great on being productive 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.380
 take a look at the camera sitting alone 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.239
 a front facing camera so no beak 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.400
 facing camera then see the quality 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.139
 the camera is not really very super 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.090
 He is a fun mission party 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.409
 we see it as my face 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.729
 she grabs focal point 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.200
 well photo can easily make by 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.600
 pressing this button 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.790
 and we see that it is so in succession 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.500
 you can find neither the top right nor the 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.880
 I can also go directly to the gallery 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.470
 possibly zoom in 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.510
 that is not really useful because 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.620
 yes it is all digital 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.150
 just make a movie 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.200
 I don't really think anyone will be 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.940
 those movies would go on making 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.950
 front-facing camera or a panorama 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.060
 but the possibilities are there and there 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.920
 of course you just find the standard 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.890
 android settings for the camera 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.200
 see that the camera is 1.3 megapixel too 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.700
 the maximum resolution is also the same and 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.380
 yes this is actually how the 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.660
 this archos tablet is missing and working 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.230
 back party in camera and next to it is 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.090
 screen 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.450
 reasonable flats and always a bit brighter 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.450
 liked 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.310
 the 101 xs is very competitively priced he 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.660
 gives a dock as standard 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.400
 and finally I update him to 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.400
 latest android version 4 point one 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.030
 the archos 101 xs combines a number 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.760
 useful features such as a buck 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.870
 and a HDMI output with a very sharp 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.600
 price 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.970
 do you want to order this archos 101 xs 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.730

 review and see you next time
