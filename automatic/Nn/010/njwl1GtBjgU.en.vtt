like<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:51.359> lines<00:02:52.459> will<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.670> lot

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
like that the lines will be a lot

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.000 
like that the lines will be a lot
smoother<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.780> circles<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.560> there<00:02:55.799> won't<00:02:55.890> be

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
smoother the circles and there won't be

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.380 
smoother the circles and there won't be
ridges<00:02:56.579> or<00:02:57.260> pixelation<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.500> paint<00:02:59.299> if<00:03:00.299> you

more<00:03:54.090> frames<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.810> use<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.410> better<00:03:55.680> your

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
more frames you use the better your

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.360 
more frames you use the better your

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
animation will be this is only two

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.360 
animation will be this is only two
frames<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.900> just<00:04:01.200> imagine<00:04:01.680> if<00:04:01.799> you<00:04:01.890> did<00:04:02.160> like

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
frames so just imagine if you did like

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.440 
frames so just imagine if you did like
seven<00:04:04.099> here's<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.190> different<00:04:05.519> one<00:04:05.790> with<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.180> neck

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
seven here's a different one with a neck

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.630 
seven here's a different one with a neck
restraint<00:04:06.930> at<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.319> where<00:04:07.530> his<00:04:07.650> fists<00:04:08.129> are<00:04:08.340> at

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
restraint at it where his fists are at

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.240 
restraint at it where his fists are at
the<00:04:08.819> midpoint<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.599> raising<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.950> can<00:04:11.099> see

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
the midpoint of raising and you can see

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.240 
the midpoint of raising and you can see
that<00:04:11.489> only<00:04:11.609> just<00:04:12.390> adding<00:04:12.750> one<00:04:13.019> more<00:04:13.890> frame

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
that only just adding one more frame

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.789 
that only just adding one more frame
makes<00:04:14.609> two<00:04:14.819> smoother<00:04:15.780> just<00:04:16.019> imagine<00:04:16.680> if<00:04:16.769> you

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
makes two smoother just imagine if you

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.920 
makes two smoother just imagine if you
put<00:04:16.889> like<00:04:17.160> seven<00:04:17.669> all<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.299> way<00:04:18.419> up<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.810> all

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
put like seven all the way up and all

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.069 
put like seven all the way up and all
the<00:04:18.989> way<00:04:19.169> down<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:21.120> will<00:04:21.239> look<00:04:21.389> more<00:04:21.570> like<00:04:21.630> you

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
the way down it will look more like you

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.570 
the way down it will look more like you
know<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.320> regular<00:04:22.620> cartoons<00:04:23.100> that's<00:04:23.430> you

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
know the regular cartoons that's you

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.120 
know the regular cartoons that's you
that<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.330> see<00:04:24.570> more<00:04:25.110> frames<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.770> better

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
that you see more frames the better

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.469 
that you see more frames the better
so<00:04:26.599> whatever<00:04:28.370> after<00:04:29.370> you've<00:04:29.610> drawn<00:04:30.240> your
