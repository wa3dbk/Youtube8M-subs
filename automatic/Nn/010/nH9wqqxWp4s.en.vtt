call<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.110> duty<00:01:25.140> ghosts<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> really<00:01:26.070> solid

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
call of duty ghosts is a really solid

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.880 
call of duty ghosts is a really solid
game<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.360> kem<00:01:27.840> strike<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.560> good<00:01:28.740> one

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
game but this kem strike it's a good one

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.830 
game but this kem strike it's a good one
in<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:29.130> opinion<00:01:29.430> oh<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.060> too<00:01:30.270> slow<00:01:30.600> it's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
in my opinion oh it's not too slow it's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.480 
in my opinion oh it's not too slow it's
not<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.380> really<00:01:31.560> insanely<00:01:31.920> fast<00:01:32.220> or

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
not really really insanely fast or

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.609 
not really really insanely fast or
anything<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.259> also<00:01:34.380> did

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
anything but I do think that I also did

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.899 
anything but I do think that I also did
play<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.890> objective<00:01:35.280> pretty<00:01:35.460> well<00:01:35.640> we<00:01:35.759> found

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
play the objective pretty well we found

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.700 
play the objective pretty well we found
sort<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.479> way<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.409> can<00:01:37.530> actually

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
sort of a way that we can actually

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 
sort of a way that we can actually
extend<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.340> game<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.729> bit<00:01:38.850> longer<00:01:39.060> in

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
extend the game a little bit longer in

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.969 
extend the game a little bit longer in
domination<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.290> actually<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
domination is you can actually make the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.160 
domination is you can actually make the
Flies<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.850> flags<00:01:42.119> neutral<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.810> nobody<00:01:43.140> else

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
Flies the flags neutral so nobody else

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.080 
Flies the flags neutral so nobody else
can<00:01:43.439> get<00:01:43.649> points<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.189> don't<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> enemy

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
can get points you don't and the enemy

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.060 
can get points you don't and the enemy
team<00:01:45.420> doesn't<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.560> gotta<00:01:46.710> make<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
team doesn't so it can gotta make the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.010 
team doesn't so it can gotta make the
game<00:01:47.280> go<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> lot<00:01:48.270> longer<00:01:48.600> really

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
game go on for a lot longer really

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.020 
game go on for a lot longer really
Langston's<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> game<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.460> makes<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
Langston's the game it really makes it a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.240 
Langston's the game it really makes it a
lot<00:01:51.180> easier<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.869> multiple<00:01:52.079> kmo<00:01:52.890> abs<00:01:53.070> in

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
lot easier to get multiple kmo abs in

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.679 
lot easier to get multiple kmo abs in
one<00:01:53.430> game<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.880> i<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.119> think<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.450> that

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
one game so i really think that that

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.389 
one game so i really think that that
that's<00:01:55.110> gonna<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.530> really<00:01:55.740> often<00:01:56.009> new

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that's gonna be really often new

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.490 
that's gonna be really often new
strategic<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.390> trying<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:57.930> more<00:01:58.079> mobs

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
strategic way of trying to get more mobs

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.679 
strategic way of trying to get more mobs
in<00:01:58.649> one<00:01:58.860> game<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.369> i'm<00:01:59.850> not<00:02:00.060> necessarily

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
in one game you know i'm not necessarily

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.630 
in one game you know i'm not necessarily
fully<00:02:00.840> supporting<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:01.890> i<00:02:01.920> don't<00:02:02.549> know<00:02:02.610> i

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
fully supporting it but i don't know i

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.370 
fully supporting it but i don't know i
used<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.390> game<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.780> wasn't<00:02:03.990> really<00:02:04.079> i

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
used in this game it wasn't really i

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.230 
used in this game it wasn't really i
mean<00:02:04.560> i<00:02:04.829> didn't<00:02:05.310> i<00:02:05.369> don't<00:02:05.549> think<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.820> gave<00:02:06.090> me

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
mean i didn't i don't think it gave me

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.609

that<00:02:06.360> big<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.630> an<00:02:06.719> advantage<00:02:07.020> even<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.500> we

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
that big of an advantage even if we

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.960 
that big of an advantage even if we
didn't<00:02:07.920> use<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.190> still<00:02:08.459> would've<00:02:08.610> been<00:02:08.729> able<00:02:08.849> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
didn't use I still would've been able to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.820 
didn't use I still would've been able to

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
three to four minutes somewhere

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470 
three to four minutes somewhere
around<00:02:13.950> there<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.700> beginning<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:15.150> took<00:02:15.330> me

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
around there in the beginning it took me

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.940 
around there in the beginning it took me
a<00:02:15.510> little<00:02:15.840> bit<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.140> time<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:16.830> started

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
a little bit of time just to get started

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.190 
a little bit of time just to get started
off<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.520> my<00:02:17.610> specialist<00:02:18.180> streak<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:18.570> towards

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
off on my specialist streak but towards

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.420 
off on my specialist streak but towards
the<00:02:19.290> end<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.680> middle<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:19.980> gameplay<00:02:20.400> I

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
the end in the middle of the gameplay I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.830 
the end in the middle of the gameplay I
started<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.850> really<00:02:21.000> speed<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.480> up<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.720> get<00:02:21.810> a

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
started to really speed it up and get a

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.570 
started to really speed it up and get a
lot<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:22.020> singles<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:22.980> doubles<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.460> now<00:02:23.550> I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
lot of singles and doubles and now I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.280 
lot of singles and doubles and now I
