motion video because this was an element
of<00:00:39.530> game<00:00:40.530> design<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.270> we<00:00:42.270> abandoned<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
of game design that we abandoned in the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.130 
of game design that we abandoned in the
80's<00:00:43.920> 90's<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.980> okay<00:00:46.980> probably<00:00:47.280> early<00:00:48.210> 2000s

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
80's 90's and okay probably early 2000s

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.779 
80's 90's and okay probably early 2000s
there<00:00:49.320> were<00:00:49.379> still<00:00:49.680> some<00:00:49.829> coming<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.640> they

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
there were still some coming up and they

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.220 
there were still some coming up and they
were<00:00:50.850> pretty<00:00:51.000> terrible<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:51.960> really

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
were pretty terrible but was really

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.479 
were pretty terrible but was really
interesting<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:52.739> we<00:00:52.829> originally<00:00:53.039> used

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
interesting so when we originally used

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.950 
interesting so when we originally used
them<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:53.940> only<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.149> big-budget<00:00:54.600> games

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
them this was only for big-budget games

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.069 
them this was only for big-budget games
right<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:56.059> idea<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.360> having<00:00:57.629> video

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
right the idea of having video

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.950 
right the idea of having video
production<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.309> video<00:00:59.579> game<00:00:59.690> was<00:01:00.690> something

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
production in a video game was something

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.590 
production in a video game was something
that<00:01:00.989> was<00:01:01.170> really<00:01:01.350> expensive<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.600> what

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
that was really expensive and what

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.800 
that was really expensive and what
fascinated<00:01:04.530> me<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.949> video<00:01:05.760> cost<00:01:06.270> has<00:01:06.630> come

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
fascinated me is video cost has come

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.130 
fascinated me is video cost has come
down<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.530> much<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.390> last<00:01:09.570> few<00:01:09.780> years

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
down so much that in the last few years

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
down so much that in the last few years
a<00:01:10.320> lot<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.799> independent<00:01:11.400> developers<00:01:11.909> have

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
a lot of independent developers have

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.120 
a lot of independent developers have
come<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.659> realize<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.920> they<00:01:14.070> can

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
come to realize that actually they can

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.130 
come to realize that actually they can
cut<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.820> great<00:01:15.299> deal<00:01:15.509> costs<00:01:16.020> by<00:01:16.650> using<00:01:18.140> actual

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
cut a great deal costs by using actual

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.170 
cut a great deal costs by using actual
live<00:01:19.290> actors<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:20.369> their<00:01:20.640> video<00:01:20.909> games<00:01:21.470> so

interesting definitely a new thought so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.660 
interesting definitely a new thought so
they<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.770> creators<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.460> have

transcribed all of the script this
clearly<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.060> mean<00:01:57.299> they<00:01:57.570> already<00:01:57.689> had<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.140> right

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
clearly I mean they already had it right

clearly I mean they already had it right
they<00:01:58.500> had<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.710> write<00:01:58.829> at<00:01:58.950> some<00:01:59.130> point<00:01:59.310> anyway

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
they had to write at some point anyway

together<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:49.120> isn't<00:02:49.630> enough<00:02:49.900> by<00:02:50.650> itself

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
together but it isn't enough by itself

because like 90% of clips are gonna
include<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.230> word<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.709> well<00:03:15.579> in<00:03:15.820> this<00:03:15.970> game

they<00:03:16.299> chose<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.570> limit<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:18.579> number<00:03:18.610> of<00:03:19.030> search

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
they chose to limit the number of search

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.199 
they chose to limit the number of search
results<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.720> get<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.959> see<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:21.430> small<00:03:21.970> number

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
results you get to see to a small number

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.750 
results you get to see to a small number
it<00:03:22.750> varies<00:03:23.470> but<00:03:23.620> I<00:03:23.829> think<00:03:23.980> it's<00:03:24.100> like<00:03:24.160> five

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
it varies but I think it's like five

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.960 
it varies but I think it's like five
seven<00:03:25.420> something<00:03:25.630> like<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.989> anyway<00:03:26.890> it's<00:03:27.820> a

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
seven something like that anyway it's a

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.150 
seven something like that anyway it's a
small<00:03:28.209> number<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.780> it's<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.799> chronological

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
small number and it's in chronological

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.500 
small number and it's in chronological
order<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.890> typing<00:03:32.890> though<00:03:33.070> will<00:03:33.400> get<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
order so typing though will get you the

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.590 
order so typing though will get you the
very<00:03:34.720> first<00:03:34.810> seven<00:03:35.650> Clips<00:03:35.950> right<00:03:36.519> but<00:03:37.299> after

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
very first seven Clips right but after

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.900 
very first seven Clips right but after
that<00:03:37.829> it's<00:03:38.829> it's<00:03:39.400> not<00:03:39.579> going<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.820> show

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
that it's it's not going to show

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.479 
that it's it's not going to show
anything<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:41.230> as<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.859> did<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.250> have<00:03:42.370> to

anything and so as you did you have to

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.310 
anything and so as you did you have to
dig<00:03:42.609> deeper<00:03:42.970> and<00:03:43.000> deeper<00:03:43.359> and<00:03:43.570> think<00:03:44.019> about

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
dig deeper and deeper and think about

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.349 
dig deeper and deeper and think about
start<00:03:45.220> putting<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.609> pieces<00:03:45.820> together<00:03:46.150> in

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
start putting the pieces together in

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.759 
start putting the pieces together in
your<00:03:46.540> head<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.930> what<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.200> think's<00:03:47.560> gonna

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
your head and what you think's gonna

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.300 
your head and what you think's gonna
come<00:03:47.980> up<00:03:48.130> in<00:03:48.459> order<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:49.780> sort<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.140> suss<00:03:50.799> out<00:03:51.010> and

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
come up in order to sort of suss out and

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.349 
come up in order to sort of suss out and
dig<00:03:51.730> out<00:03:52.000> some<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.079> later<00:03:53.290> clips<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:55.180> this

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
dig out some of the later clips so this

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.030 
dig out some of the later clips so this
has<00:03:55.510> two<00:03:55.750> interesting<00:03:56.140> elements<00:03:56.470> right<00:03:56.590> the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
has two interesting elements right the

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.380 
has two interesting elements right the
interactivity<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.640> forcing<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.150> player<00:03:58.269> to

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
interactivity of forcing the player to

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.289 
interactivity of forcing the player to
think<00:03:58.540> about<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.109> story<00:03:59.410> by<00:04:00.070> making<00:04:00.579> them<00:04:00.760> get

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
think about the story by making them get

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.410 
think about the story by making them get
pieces<00:04:01.720> of<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.870> story<00:04:02.170> through<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:03.220> search<00:04:04.120> bar

a Google s search bar and then on top of

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.660 
a Google s search bar and then on top of

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
they sort of had to think very carefully

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.680 
they sort of had to think very carefully
about<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:39.580> script<00:04:39.970> as<00:04:40.120> they<00:04:40.240> were<00:04:40.300> building

about the script as they were building

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.480 
about the script as they were building
it<00:04:40.780> right<00:04:40.990> because<00:04:41.139> writing<00:04:41.530> writing<00:04:42.280> an

it right because writing writing an

interesting mystery script is difficult

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.950 
interesting mystery script is difficult
enough<00:04:44.889> in<00:04:45.070> itself<00:04:45.400> but<00:04:46.360> now<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.600> have<00:04:46.810> to

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
enough in itself but now you have to

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.920 
enough in itself but now you have to
think<00:04:47.139> Oh<00:04:47.820> have<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:48.940> used<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.419> word<00:04:49.600> murder

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
think Oh have I used the word murder

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.310 
think Oh have I used the word murder
five<00:04:50.380> times<00:04:50.740> before<00:04:51.220> this<00:04:51.400> if<00:04:52.150> so<00:04:52.599> I<00:04:52.990> have<00:04:53.050> to

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
five times before this if so I have to

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.020 
five times before this if so I have to
know<00:04:53.410> that<00:04:53.560> murder<00:04:53.860> is<00:04:54.039> not<00:04:54.220> gonna<00:04:54.520> bring<00:04:54.789> this

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030

that<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.729> player<00:04:57.970> can<00:04:58.150> sort<00:04:58.360> of<00:04:58.449> get<00:04:59.229> in<00:04:59.380> their

design choice for me I don't necessarily
agree<00:06:10.720> with<00:06:10.990> it<00:06:11.139> because<00:06:11.409> it<00:06:11.860> feels<00:06:12.190> to<00:06:12.669> the

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
agree with it because it feels to the

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.730 
agree with it because it feels to the

the mystery that becomes very

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.089 
the mystery that becomes very
frustrating<00:06:20.080> when<00:06:21.690> you<00:06:22.690> simply<00:06:23.590> can't<00:06:23.770> access

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
frustrating when you simply can't access

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.060 
frustrating when you simply can't access
part<00:06:24.550> of<00:06:24.639> the<00:06:24.699> mystery<00:06:25.090> and<00:06:25.440> you're<00:06:26.440> told<00:06:26.770> that

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
part of the mystery and you're told that

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.110 
part of the mystery and you're told that
the<00:06:27.310> reason<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:27.580> you<00:06:27.700> can't<00:06:27.880> access<00:06:28.090> it

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
the reason that you can't access it

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.430 
the reason that you can't access it
because<00:06:29.479> you<00:06:29.660> haven't<00:06:29.960> thought<00:06:30.080> about<00:06:30.229> it

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
because you haven't thought about it

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.300 
because you haven't thought about it
enough<00:06:30.680> and<00:06:30.949> then<00:06:31.790> you<00:06:31.820> find<00:06:32.270> out<00:06:32.419> that<00:06:32.630> no

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
enough and then you find out that no

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.710 
enough and then you find out that no
actually<00:06:34.310> the<00:06:35.150> designer<00:06:35.419> was<00:06:35.570> just

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
actually the designer was just

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.070 
actually the designer was just
arbitrarily<00:06:37.449> throwing<00:06:38.449> that<00:06:38.540> in<00:06:38.750> there<00:06:38.900> I

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
arbitrarily throwing that in there I

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.189 
arbitrarily throwing that in there I
guess<00:06:39.350> as<00:06:39.560> a<00:06:39.590> red<00:06:39.860> herring<00:06:40.190> right<00:06:40.880> but<00:06:41.810> in<00:06:42.080> an

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 
guess as a red herring right but in an

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:43.990 
guess as a red herring right but in an
interactive<00:06:42.620> environment<00:06:42.710> it<00:06:43.250> simply<00:06:43.760> didn't

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
interactive environment it simply didn't

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.450 
interactive environment it simply didn't
work<00:06:44.090> for<00:06:44.150> me<00:06:44.419> uh<00:06:44.570> I<00:06:45.260> we<00:06:46.100> may<00:06:46.220> all<00:06:46.340> have

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
work for me uh I we may all have

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.770 
work for me uh I we may all have
different<00:06:46.790> opinions<00:06:47.120> on<00:06:47.210> that<00:06:47.360> but<00:06:47.510> with<00:06:47.630> that

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
different opinions on that but with that
