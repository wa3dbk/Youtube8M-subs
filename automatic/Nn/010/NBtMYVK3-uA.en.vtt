is an investigation that not only has to

is an investigation that not only has to
look<00:05:57.650> at<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:57.889> possibility<00:05:58.580> for<00:05:58.820> domestic

look at the possibility for domestic

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.930 
look at the possibility for domestic
terrorism<00:06:00.440> but<00:06:00.620> international<00:06:01.520> or<00:06:01.639> foreign

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.120 
terrorism but international or foreign
terrorism<00:06:02.330> as<00:06:02.630> well<00:06:03.229> and<00:06:03.500> it's<00:06:03.620> it's<00:06:04.039> a

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
terrorism as well and it's it's a

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.070 
terrorism as well and it's it's a
complex<00:06:04.340> environment<00:06:05.330> but<00:06:05.449> aided

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
complex environment but aided

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.800 
complex environment but aided
dramatically<00:06:06.770> by<00:06:07.220> all<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.610> video<00:06:08.120> that<00:06:08.660> has

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
dramatically by all the video that has

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.170 
dramatically by all the video that has
been<00:06:08.840> made<00:06:09.169> available<00:06:09.199> I<00:06:09.919> think<00:06:10.789> that's<00:06:10.970> right

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
been made available I think that's right

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.700 
been made available I think that's right
I<00:06:11.240> think<00:06:11.330> this<00:06:11.630> is<00:06:11.690> gonna<00:06:11.930> raise<00:06:12.229> a<00:06:12.259> debate

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
I think this is gonna raise a debate

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.560 
I think this is gonna raise a debate
long-term<00:06:13.280> in<00:06:13.370> America<00:06:13.729> like<00:06:13.940> the<00:06:14.090> debates<00:06:14.389> we

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
long-term in America like the debates we

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.540 
long-term in America like the debates we
had<00:06:14.780> on<00:06:14.930> gun<00:06:15.139> control<00:06:15.620> in<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:15.800> wake<00:06:16.009> of<00:06:16.070> events

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
had on gun control in the wake of events

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.180 
had on gun control in the wake of events
that<00:06:17.180> were<00:06:17.300> so<00:06:17.510> tragic<00:06:18.050> in<00:06:18.260> the<00:06:18.650> past<00:06:18.860> year<00:06:19.160> or

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
that were so tragic in the past year or

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.279 
that were so tragic in the past year or
so<00:06:19.280> people<00:06:20.000> are<00:06:20.270> initially<00:06:20.660> going<00:06:20.900> to<00:06:20.960> say<00:06:21.139> hey

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289 
so people are initially going to say hey

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:22.839 
so people are initially going to say hey

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
look at the advantage you get in this

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.580 
look at the advantage you get in this
21st<00:06:23.389> century<00:06:23.780> environment<00:06:23.870> where<00:06:24.410> you<00:06:24.560> have

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
21st century environment where you have

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.920 
21st century environment where you have
surveillance<00:06:25.280> cameras<00:06:25.639> everywhere<00:06:25.930> an

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
surveillance cameras everywhere an

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.570 
surveillance cameras everywhere an
environment<00:06:27.560> that<00:06:27.590> the<00:06:27.770> Europeans<00:06:28.340> by<00:06:28.520> the

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
environment that the Europeans by the

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.980 
environment that the Europeans by the
way<00:06:28.760> are<00:06:28.909> way<00:06:29.120> ahead<00:06:29.270> of<00:06:29.419> us<00:06:29.539> on<00:06:29.720> a<00:06:29.750> lot<00:06:29.930> more

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
way are way ahead of us on a lot more

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.390 
way are way ahead of us on a lot more
surveillance<00:06:30.530> in<00:06:30.830> Europe<00:06:31.099> than<00:06:31.220> there<00:06:31.370> is

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
surveillance in Europe than there is

surveillance in Europe than there is
here<00:06:31.669> but<00:06:31.789> I<00:06:31.849> suspect<00:06:32.229> over<00:06:33.229> the<00:06:33.320> course<00:06:33.560> of<00:06:33.680> a

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
here but I suspect over the course of a

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.320 
here but I suspect over the course of a
month<00:06:33.919> or<00:06:34.159> two<00:06:34.280> or<00:06:34.310> three<00:06:34.430> months<00:06:34.909> Americans

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
month or two or three months Americans

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.879 
month or two or three months Americans
will<00:06:35.479> step<00:06:35.750> back<00:06:35.960> and<00:06:36.169> say<00:06:36.320> hey<00:06:36.500> that<00:06:36.680> might

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:36.889 
will step back and say hey that might

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:38.950 
will step back and say hey that might
have<00:06:37.039> aided<00:06:37.190> that<00:06:37.400> investigation<00:06:37.940> but<00:06:38.659> we're

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
have aided that investigation but we're

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.510 
have aided that investigation but we're
not<00:06:39.169> sure<00:06:39.199> we<00:06:39.650> want<00:06:39.830> to<00:06:39.919> live<00:06:40.039> in<00:06:40.159> that<00:06:40.190> kind<00:06:40.280> of

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
not sure we want to live in that kind of

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.589 
not sure we want to live in that kind of
security<00:06:40.760> culture<00:06:42.430> and<00:06:43.430> we<00:06:43.610> can't<00:06:43.909> draw<00:06:44.210> fill

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
security culture and we can't draw fill

obviously available very easily you
can't<00:06:54.830> draw<00:06:55.099> any<00:06:55.280> conclusions<00:06:55.940> whether

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
can't draw any conclusions whether

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.480 
can't draw any conclusions whether
that's<00:06:56.449> a<00:06:56.599> signature<00:06:56.990> of<00:06:57.560> a<00:06:57.770> domestic<00:06:58.130> or<00:06:58.460> a

foreign terrorists actually I would draw

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.430 
foreign terrorists actually I would draw
conclusions<00:07:02.060> but<00:07:02.210> more<00:07:02.449> about<00:07:02.539> what<00:07:02.930> it's<00:07:03.110> not

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
conclusions but more about what it's not

conclusions but more about what it's not
than<00:07:03.740> what<00:07:03.949> it<00:07:04.070> is<00:07:04.220> when<00:07:04.580> you<00:07:04.610> look<00:07:04.940> at<00:07:05.120> the

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
than what it is when you look at the

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.270 
than what it is when you look at the
people<00:07:05.419> I<00:07:05.659> face<00:07:05.990> for<00:07:06.320> a<00:07:06.349> couple<00:07:06.620> decades<00:07:06.770> that

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
people I face for a couple decades that

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.330 
people I face for a couple decades that
is<00:07:07.430> terrorist<00:07:08.330> inspired<00:07:08.810> by<00:07:09.050> al<00:07:09.229> Qaeda<00:07:09.530> they

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
is terrorist inspired by al Qaeda they

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.909 
is terrorist inspired by al Qaeda they
after<00:07:10.970> 9/11<00:07:11.690> went<00:07:11.840> to<00:07:11.930> backpack<00:07:12.349> bombs<00:07:12.680> that

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:12.919 
after 9/11 went to backpack bombs that

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:14.529 
after 9/11 went to backpack bombs that
were<00:07:13.039> much<00:07:13.280> more<00:07:13.490> sophisticated<00:07:13.699> than<00:07:14.389> this

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
were much more sophisticated than this

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.330 
were much more sophisticated than this
the<00:07:14.750> explosives<00:07:15.380> were<00:07:15.500> more<00:07:15.650> sophisticated

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
the explosives were more sophisticated

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.100 
the explosives were more sophisticated
they<00:07:16.610> received<00:07:17.030> training<00:07:17.240> operational

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
they received training operational

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.719 
they received training operational
training<00:07:18.530> that<00:07:18.680> was<00:07:18.800> pretty<00:07:19.039> advanced<00:07:19.580> and

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:19.729 
training that was pretty advanced and

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.089 
training that was pretty advanced and
remember<00:07:20.630> they<00:07:20.750> selected<00:07:21.380> targets<00:07:21.800> that<00:07:21.950> were

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:22.099 
remember they selected targets that were

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.250 
remember they selected targets that were
harder<00:07:22.460> this<00:07:22.580> than<00:07:22.880> this<00:07:23.060> target<00:07:23.510> and<00:07:23.599> I<00:07:24.080> would

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:24.260 
harder this than this target and I would

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.350 
harder this than this target and I would
argue<00:07:24.620> more<00:07:24.770> iconic<00:07:25.340> that<00:07:25.460> is<00:07:25.520> transportation

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 
argue more iconic that is transportation

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.020 
argue more iconic that is transportation
