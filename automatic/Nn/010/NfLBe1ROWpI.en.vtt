is<00:04:47.370> that<00:04:47.580> this<00:04:48.570> was<00:04:49.050> about<00:04:49.170> fifteen<00:04:49.680> dollars

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
is that this was about fifteen dollars

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.060 
is that this was about fifteen dollars
this<00:04:50.880> little<00:04:51.270> thing<00:04:51.510> fifteen<00:04:52.110> dollars<00:04:52.440> yeah

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
this little thing fifteen dollars yeah

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.310 
this little thing fifteen dollars yeah
so<00:04:53.730> at<00:04:54.060> first<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.480> was<00:04:54.600> like<00:04:54.630> well<00:04:54.930> maybe<00:04:55.169> I

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
so at first I was like well maybe I

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.430 
so at first I was like well maybe I
don't<00:04:55.590> need<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:55.919> and<00:04:56.060> I've<00:04:57.060> got<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.720> clean<00:04:58.260> and

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
don't need it and I've got a clean and

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.670 
don't need it and I've got a clean and
clear<00:04:59.360> moisturizer<00:05:00.360> it<00:05:00.810> was<00:05:00.960> morning<00:05:01.260> glow

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
clear moisturizer it was morning glow
