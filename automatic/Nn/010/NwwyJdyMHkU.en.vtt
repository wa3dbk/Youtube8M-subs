00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.789 
another thing about the live clips
obviously<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.599> order<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.900> hit<00:02:25.080> or<00:02:25.349> to<00:02:25.530> fail

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
obviously is in order to hit or to fail

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.890 
obviously is in order to hit or to fail
for<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.549> highlights<00:02:26.970> itself<00:02:27.390> need<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.750> play

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
for the highlights itself need to play

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.000 
for the highlights itself need to play
more<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.349> that's<00:02:28.500> not<00:02:28.709> really<00:02:28.890> something

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
more and that's not really something

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.619 
more and that's not really something
that<00:02:29.190> I've<00:02:29.430> been<00:02:29.459> doing<00:02:29.760> too<00:02:29.879> much<00:02:30.000> lately<00:02:30.330> so

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
that I've been doing too much lately so

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.229 
that I've been doing too much lately so
that's<00:02:30.840> another<00:02:31.410> huge<00:02:31.709> issue<00:02:32.129> as<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.459> why<00:02:32.790> I

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
that's another huge issue as to why I

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.729 
that's another huge issue as to why I
don't<00:02:33.660> want<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:33.959> those<00:02:34.140> every<00:02:34.349> day<00:02:34.379> that's

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
don't want to do those every day that's

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.830 
don't want to do those every day that's
what<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.340> all<00:02:35.489> comes<00:02:35.519> down<00:02:35.849> to<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.269> probably

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
what it all comes down to it probably

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.210 
what it all comes down to it probably
the<00:02:36.959> number<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.260> reason<00:02:37.560> at<00:02:37.829> this<00:02:37.920> very

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the number one reason at this very

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.830 
the number one reason at this very
moment<00:02:38.549> why<00:02:38.849> I've<00:02:39.030> not<00:02:39.299> been<00:02:39.480> making<00:02:39.810> videos

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
moment why I've not been making videos

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.140 
moment why I've not been making videos
is<00:02:40.319> because<00:02:40.470> I've<00:02:40.739> been<00:02:40.860> playing<00:02:41.069> way<00:02:41.370> way<00:02:42.120> too

that<00:03:19.829> yesterday<00:03:20.040> with<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.579> few<00:03:20.760> people<00:03:21.120> just

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
that yesterday with a few people just

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.879 
that yesterday with a few people just
you<00:03:21.660> know<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> fuck<00:03:22.079> around<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:22.739> was

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
you know the fuck around it really was

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.800 
you know the fuck around it really was
fun<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.579> understand<00:03:24.000> why<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.239> competitive

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
fun so I understand why the competitive

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.349 
fun so I understand why the competitive
level<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.349> counter-strike<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.329> quite<00:03:27.329> a

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
level of counter-strike is quite a

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.759 
level of counter-strike is quite a
different<00:03:27.810> format<00:03:28.169> so<00:03:28.349> what<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.530> was<00:03:28.680> thinking

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
different format so what I was thinking

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.800 
different format so what I was thinking
of<00:03:29.040> doing<00:03:29.160> is<00:03:29.489> making<00:03:29.880> videos<00:03:30.419> on<00:03:30.540> counter

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
of doing is making videos on counter

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.330 
of doing is making videos on counter
strike<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.260> obviously<00:03:31.500> with<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.709> new<00:03:31.889> pc<00:03:32.310> i

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
strike and obviously with the new pc i

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.819 
strike and obviously with the new pc i

wasn't<00:03:51.000> really<00:03:51.150> sure<00:03:51.180> if<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.510> was<00:03:51.569> gonna<00:03:51.660> do

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
wasn't really sure if that was gonna do

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.270 
wasn't really sure if that was gonna do
well<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.260> for<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.560> most<00:03:52.709> part<00:03:52.829> because<00:03:53.130> it's

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
well and for the most part because it's

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.159 
well and for the most part because it's
advanced<00:03:53.579> warfare<00:03:54.419> i<00:03:54.480> thought<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:54.989> was<00:03:55.049> just

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
advanced warfare i thought that was just

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.990 
advanced warfare i thought that was just
gonna<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.919> video<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.400> totally<00:03:56.819> going<00:03:56.970> to

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
gonna the video is just totally going to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.819 
gonna the video is just totally going to
drop<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.599> was<00:03:57.900> going<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.079> be<00:03:58.139> terrible<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.680> the

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
drop it was going to be terrible and the

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.409 
drop it was going to be terrible and the
reins<00:03:59.010> rest<00:03:59.340> pretty<00:03:59.579> fucking<00:03:59.940> good<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.269> I've

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
reins rest pretty fucking good and I've

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:01.550 
reins rest pretty fucking good and I've
got<00:04:00.599> a<00:04:00.629> lot<00:04:00.959> of<00:04:00.989> people<00:04:01.230> who<00:04:01.440> have<00:04:01.530> been

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
got a lot of people who have been

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.080 
got a lot of people who have been
messaging<00:04:02.069> me<00:04:02.190> since<00:04:02.430> I<00:04:02.579> uploaded<00:04:02.730> that

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
messaging me since I uploaded that

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.000 
messaging me since I uploaded that
saying<00:04:03.389> to<00:04:03.480> keep<00:04:03.690> doing<00:04:04.019> them<00:04:04.139> so<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.769> was

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
saying to keep doing them so I was

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.470 
saying to keep doing them so I was
thinking<00:04:05.190> of<00:04:05.579> trying<00:04:05.849> this<00:04:06.000> counter<00:04:06.329> strike

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
thinking of trying this counter strike

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.809 
thinking of trying this counter strike
video<00:04:06.780> now<00:04:07.169> I<00:04:07.199> understand<00:04:07.859> that<00:04:08.099> my<00:04:08.489> channel

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
video now I understand that my channel

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.400 
video now I understand that my channel
is<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:08.970> cold<00:04:09.209> duty<00:04:09.510> based<00:04:09.720> channel<00:04:10.169> so<00:04:10.290> they

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
is a cold duty based channel so they

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
is a cold duty based channel so they
probably<00:04:10.620> will<00:04:10.829> not<00:04:10.949> be<00:04:11.129> a<00:04:11.160> huge

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
probably will not be a huge

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.800 
probably will not be a huge
counter-strike<00:04:11.879> audience<00:04:12.299> but<00:04:12.389> I<00:04:12.449> was

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
counter-strike audience but I was

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.869 
counter-strike audience but I was
thinking<00:04:13.049> of<00:04:13.139> doing<00:04:13.199> it<00:04:13.470> as<00:04:13.650> once<00:04:14.459> again<00:04:14.669> like

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
thinking of doing it as once again like

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.740 
thinking of doing it as once again like
the<00:04:15.030> Wraith<00:04:15.209> Gabe
