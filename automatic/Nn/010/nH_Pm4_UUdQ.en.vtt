00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.040

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 participate with us 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:31.079
 jorge lanata 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:33.400
 as now calmer he was 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.820
 it really was fun 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.030
 and pretty good even though there was 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.720
 some products also seemed as if 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.720
 your answer martÃ­n 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.620
 I would say jorge lanata did not get us 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.050
 the prawn 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.140
 do not move away I say what killed Kennedy were 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.060
 63 in texas but sometimes I ended myself 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.090
 unsure also in some answer and 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.710
 very well gerardo really by apart not 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.660
 it's not just about responding to I see 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.520
 sense of how to look for a story 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.620
 around vice to serve you also 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.260
 to people who are watching and nothing 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.240
 it was fun against who 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.060
 plays 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.790
 against gerardo against gerardo 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.100
 options are florida california arizona 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.490
 or nevada california 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.829
 grade 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.540
 they have easy questions today without 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.790
 no doubt california did not expect 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.100
 generate reality pk if you expected had 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.830
 It was very difficult to beat Gerardo 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.509
 it seems to me that you do not have to see a 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.460
 bit more nervous when I lost the 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.780
 first time in the eighth step and as 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.149
 that wine debated it as an effect 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.640
 dominated and I lost and ask them so in a row 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.020
 whose good state although it could a 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.789
 little bit of character was something but 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.850
 It was fun osaka-2007 Pocket 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.229
 and not even see a bit what was there in 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.470
 the reverse of the five peso bill 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.110
 what image is represented in the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.440
 reverse of the five peso bill 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.440
 Argentines 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.690
 but you know the correct answer 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.330
 hill of glory and expenses 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.030
 with nobody lucas to see if we can use it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.240
 to travel and get to know a little bit 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.240
 other places 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.310
 I'm glad that the participants that 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.530
 the car portal and have a chance 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.300
 to earn 50 thousand pesos but 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.190
 unfortunately I have an obligation to 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.290
 but be executioner 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.460
 I hope some come better 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.550
 Hugs 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.100
 what is the masculine of the mermaid in the 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.660
 game with the triton that exists well 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.080
 in discarding nests because there's no 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.490
 male mermaid written inside the 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.450
 very difficult mythology about 50 thousand but 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.540
 happy to have gotten so 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.530
 less the 10 min and I think that although there 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.079
 lost at least 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.030
 I was a little bit of everything 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:13.370
 very hard to beat him at least 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.370
 He could hold some some questions 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:21.450
 who was john's first wife 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.659
 Sunday Peron previous to avoid the truth 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.659
 not 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:31.720
 we go with the one of elena fashion atom and 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:37.170
 line faggionato he likes very much all 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.170
 these programs that can compete 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.070
 if they see people who have high 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.140
 possibilities and we're going to get into a 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.740
 house that enters the page of navarra 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.900
 of the program and that the correct answer 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.900
 is aurelia you are the taste is our 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.900
 Congratulations
