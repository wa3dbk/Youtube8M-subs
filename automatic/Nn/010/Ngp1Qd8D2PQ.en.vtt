00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.820
 Philosophers have questioned over the years 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.160
 How do you judge your behavior as good behavior? 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.060
 Suppose you are trying to save the Earth from spacemen seeking to enslave human beings 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.620
 But you - by mistake - blew the ground 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.980
 Behavior is never good! 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.940
 Or, for example, I saw a child fall into a pond 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.640
 And jumped to save him 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.660
 But before him a crocodile. 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.480
 After the event, can we consider your behavior to be good? 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.040
 Well, it depends on who you ask. 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.040
 (Emmanuel Kant) will say that your sense of duty or not 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.100
 It determines the moral value of your behavior 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.140
 The English philosopher John Stuart Mill will tell you the moral value of your behavior 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.500
 Be according to the amount of happiness resulting from your behavior 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.160
 And also by the number of people who brought them your happiness behavior 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.440
 The duty is defined as: 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.820
 "The necessity to act on the principle of respect for the code of ethical conduct" 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.220
 So if you think you should save the dying child, but you fail, your behavior will be ethical 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.680
 The results of that attempt have nothing to do with ethics 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.600
 Without a doubt, it's normal to feel happy when you do your homework 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.000
 But (she) thinks it does not matter. 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.700
 For him morality is not about what makes you happy 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.900
 But logic 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.240
 In order to determine the moral value of any action, 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.760
 You should know the intention of the person who is doing this act 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.960
 Good faith drives us to do our duties 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.620
 Which corresponds to what he called (was) absolute commitment 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.100
 Absolute commitment is believed to be a subjective law, which is what our logic dictates 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.080
 As a result, when we act out of duty, we intend to do the right thing 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.220
 From the principle of our respect for ourselves as logical and rational beings 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.120
 In contrast, Mill believes that happiness, not rationality, is the essence of ethics 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.120
 Happiness at mile means pleasure, absence of pain 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.060
 He sees (mile) that pleasure 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.800
 Is the only thing that has value in the original 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.460
 However, it must be noted that pleasure has several types and levels 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.880
 Provided that the act that generates happiness is a moral act 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.480
 As long as it does not generate happiness, it is wrong 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.480
 But, what if they were both wrong? 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.980
 What if morality is just an illusion 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.920
 Just a complicated way to support one's actions? 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.560
 What if everything was relative? 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:03:10.360
