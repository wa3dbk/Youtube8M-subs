00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.290 

my<00:00:01.620> family<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.129> still<00:00:02.370> Roman<00:00:02.730> Catholic<00:00:03.120> and

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
my family is still Roman Catholic and

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.410 
my family is still Roman Catholic and
they<00:00:03.389> still<00:00:03.689> pray<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.959> Mary<00:00:04.350> and<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:05.190> Saints

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:05.420 
they still pray to Mary and the Saints

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.660 
they still pray to Mary and the Saints
will<00:00:06.420> this<00:00:06.569> cause<00:00:06.930> them<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.890> be<00:00:08.040> kept<00:00:08.370> out<00:00:08.639> of

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
will this cause them to be kept out of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.790 
will this cause them to be kept out of
heaven<00:00:09.090> even<00:00:09.420> though<00:00:09.750> they<00:00:09.929> claim<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.290> trust

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
heaven even though they claim to trust

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.340 
heaven even though they claim to trust
Christ<00:00:11.120> for<00:00:12.120> their<00:00:12.269> salvation

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.410 

maybe<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.619> mean<00:00:17.369> it's<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.609> gross<00:00:17.880> act<00:00:18.210> of

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
maybe I mean it's a gross act of

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.689 
maybe I mean it's a gross act of
idolatry<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.260> be<00:00:19.410> praying<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> Mary<00:00:20.160> into<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
idolatry to be praying to Mary into the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.230 
idolatry to be praying to Mary into the
Saints<00:00:21.060> that's<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.390> very<00:00:21.810> serious<00:00:22.170> matter<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
Saints that's a very serious matter and

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.880 
Saints that's a very serious matter and
I<00:00:24.240> think<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.689> there<00:00:24.900> are<00:00:24.930> thousands<00:00:25.680> perhaps

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
I think that there are thousands perhaps

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.980 
I think that there are thousands perhaps
millions<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.760> people<00:00:27.240> within<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.660> Roman

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
millions of people within the Roman

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.189 
millions of people within the Roman
Catholic<00:00:28.439> Church<00:00:28.820> who<00:00:29.820> really<00:00:30.449> are<00:00:30.660> trusting

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
Catholic Church who really are trusting

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.190 
Catholic Church who really are trusting
in<00:00:31.289> Christ<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.980> Christ<00:00:32.040> alone<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:33.420> their

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
in Christ and Christ alone for their

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.170 
in Christ and Christ alone for their
salvation<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:35.160> trusting<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.820> way<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
salvation not trusting the way of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.389 
salvation not trusting the way of
salvation<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:37.020> their<00:00:37.230> own<00:00:37.350> Church<00:00:37.739> teaches

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
salvation that their own Church teaches

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.360 
salvation that their own Church teaches
just<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.510> there<00:00:39.719> are<00:00:40.070> multitudes<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.100> people

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
just like there are multitudes of people

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.430 
just like there are multitudes of people
in<00:00:41.820> Presbyterian<00:00:42.629> churches<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.260> don't

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.729 
believe in the reformed doctrines so
that's<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:48.000> happy<00:00:48.390> inconsistency<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.559> our

that's the happy inconsistency of our

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.029

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
reaffirmed as recently as the Catholic

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.090 
reaffirmed as recently as the Catholic
catechism<00:01:21.290> disqualifies<00:01:22.290> Rome<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.920> my

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
catechism disqualifies Rome in my

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.630 
catechism disqualifies Rome in my
opinion<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:24.150> valid<00:01:24.630> church<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.400> I<00:01:26.400> think

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
opinion as a valid church and I think

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.870 
opinion as a valid church and I think
it's<00:01:26.729> an<00:01:26.850> apostate<00:01:27.390> body<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:29.040> with<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it's an apostate body and so with that

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.670 
it's an apostate body and so with that
in<00:01:30.180> mind<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.750> believe<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.140> every<00:01:31.409> true

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
in mind I believe that every true

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.620 
in mind I believe that every true
Christian<00:01:32.189> who<00:01:32.460> really<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.000> trusting<00:01:33.509> in

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
Christian who really is trusting in

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.980 
Christian who really is trusting in
Christ<00:01:33.680> has<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> moral<00:01:35.189> obligation<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.990> leave

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
Christ has a moral obligation to leave

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.109 
Christ has a moral obligation to leave
that<00:01:37.259> communion<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.939> identify

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that communion and to identify

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.510 
that communion and to identify
themselves<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> church<00:01:40.650> not<00:01:40.890> spirt<00:01:41.310> not

that God is compassionate and marked by

the same would be true of Christ but the

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.510 
the same would be true of Christ but the
idea<00:05:07.320> is<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.500> don't<00:05:07.680> want<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:07.980> go<00:05:08.040> directly<00:05:08.280> to

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.450 
idea is you don't want to go directly to
God<00:05:08.700> because<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.270> know<00:05:09.630> he's<00:05:10.460> preoccupied

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
God because you know he's preoccupied

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.610 
God because you know he's preoccupied
and<00:05:12.060> he's<00:05:12.360> somewhat<00:05:12.840> indifferent<00:05:13.020> and

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
and he's somewhat indifferent and

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.860 
and he's somewhat indifferent and
transcended<00:05:14.220> and<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:15.300> don't<00:05:15.480> really<00:05:15.600> want<00:05:15.840> to

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
transcended and you don't really want to

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.300 
transcended and you don't really want to
go<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.050> Jesus<00:05:16.470> because<00:05:16.800> he<00:05:16.919> can<00:05:17.040> be<00:05:17.070> pretty

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
go to Jesus because he can be pretty

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.760 
go to Jesus because he can be pretty
tough<00:05:17.610> as<00:05:17.850> well<00:05:18.090> but<00:05:18.570> but<00:05:18.840> Jesus<00:05:19.290> can't<00:05:19.500> resist

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
tough as well but but Jesus can't resist

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.590 
tough as well but but Jesus can't resist
his<00:05:19.980> mother<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.490> God<00:05:20.669> can't<00:05:20.940> resist<00:05:21.240> mirror

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
his mother and God can't resist mirror

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.900 
his mother and God can't resist mirror
God<00:05:22.470> can't<00:05:22.740> resist<00:05:22.979> Jesus<00:05:23.430> so<00:05:23.550> that's<00:05:23.760> the

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
God can't resist Jesus so that's the

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.230 
God can't resist Jesus so that's the
chain<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:25.380> go<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.590> Mary<00:05:25.919> because<00:05:26.520> you<00:05:27.120> know

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
chain you go to Mary because you know

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.420 
chain you go to Mary because you know
Mary<00:05:27.510> can<00:05:27.720> soften<00:05:28.020> up<00:05:28.320> Jesus<00:05:28.770> and<00:05:28.950> then<00:05:29.040> Jesus

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
Mary can soften up Jesus and then Jesus

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.700 
Mary can soften up Jesus and then Jesus
can<00:05:29.610> take<00:05:29.640> it<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.150> Father<00:05:30.390> the<00:05:30.960> assault

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710
