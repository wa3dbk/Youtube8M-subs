the hello everyone this is after the

the hello everyone this is after the
Cambre<00:00:04.210> kyun<00:00:04.509> I<00:00:04.919> did<00:00:05.919> the<00:00:07.710> cambrian<00:00:08.710> at<00:00:08.920> 2,000

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
Cambre kyun I did the cambrian at 2,000

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.220 
Cambre kyun I did the cambrian at 2,000
rpm<00:00:09.850> for<00:00:10.390> 20<00:00:10.690> minutes<00:00:11.220> and<00:00:12.220> it's<00:00:12.990> did<00:00:13.990> just

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
rpm for 20 minutes and it's did just

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.859 
rpm for 20 minutes and it's did just
find<00:00:14.440> my<00:00:14.769> old<00:00:15.070> pressure<00:00:15.400> stayed<00:00:15.850> between<00:00:16.329> 75

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
find my old pressure stayed between 75

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.819 
find my old pressure stayed between 75
and<00:00:16.900> 80<00:00:17.169> and<00:00:17.849> my<00:00:18.849> coolant<00:00:19.509> temperature<00:00:20.470> once

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:20.829 
and 80 and my coolant temperature once

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.159 
and 80 and my coolant temperature once
it<00:00:21.400> once<00:00:21.759> all<00:00:22.060> the<00:00:22.269> air<00:00:22.480> got<00:00:22.900> out<00:00:23.050> of<00:00:23.109> the

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
it once all the air got out of the

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.140 
it once all the air got out of the
system<00:00:23.589> stayed<00:00:23.890> about<00:00:24.189> 200<00:00:24.909> to<00:00:24.999> 210<00:00:26.819> so<00:00:27.819> it's

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
system stayed about 200 to 210 so it's

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.660 
system stayed about 200 to 210 so it's
good<00:00:28.390> I<00:00:28.689> me<00:00:29.369> still<00:00:30.369> got<00:00:30.550> my<00:00:32.190> remote<00:00:33.190> start

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
good I me still got my remote start

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.430 
good I me still got my remote start
hooked<00:00:33.940> up<00:00:34.120> so<00:00:34.150> let<00:00:34.480> me<00:00:34.570> crank<00:00:35.050> it<00:00:35.170> up<00:00:35.290> here

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
hooked up so let me crank it up here

00:00:35.440 --> 00:01:28.600 
hooked up so let me crank it up here
earlier<00:00:35.740> for<00:00:35.950> you

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.440 

I<00:01:30.040> obviously<00:01:31.040> can't<00:01:31.310> fine-tune<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.240> yet

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
I obviously can't fine-tune it yet

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.710 
I obviously can't fine-tune it yet
because<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:33.320> exhaust<00:01:33.710> is<00:01:33.970> obviously<00:01:34.970> not

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
because the exhaust is obviously not

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.440 
because the exhaust is obviously not
hooked<00:01:35.960> up<00:01:36.110> I<00:01:36.730> cannot<00:01:37.730> get<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.090> hooked<00:01:38.240> up

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
hooked up I cannot get it hooked up

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.680 
hooked up I cannot get it hooked up
because<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.470> since<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.370> 440<00:01:40.940> is<00:01:41.030> taller<00:01:41.360> and

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
because the since the 440 is taller and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.940 
because the since the 440 is taller and
wider<00:01:41.900> than<00:01:42.230> the<00:01:42.350> 3d3

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
wider than the 3d3

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.330 
wider than the 3d3
I<00:01:43.300> was<00:01:44.300> had<00:01:45.050> hopes<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.770> would<00:01:45.950> that<00:01:46.310> I

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
I was had hopes that I would that I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.620 
I was had hopes that I would that I
would<00:01:46.550> be<00:01:46.640> able<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:46.850> make<00:01:46.940> it<00:01:47.090> work<00:01:47.300> but<00:01:47.570> I

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
would be able to make it work but I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.650 
would be able to make it work but I
can't<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:49.100> pipe<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:49.880> had<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.240> pipe<00:01:50.450> that

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
can't the pipe that had the pipe that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.710 
can't the pipe that had the pipe that
runs<00:01:50.960> from<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.410> manifolds<00:01:52.220> down<00:01:52.940> front<00:01:53.479> down

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
runs from the manifolds down front down

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.600 
runs from the manifolds down front down
to<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.020> first<00:01:54.260> Bend<00:01:54.590> going<00:01:55.100> under<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.430> car

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
to the first Bend going under the car

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.690 
to the first Bend going under the car
has<00:01:55.910> to<00:01:55.940> be<00:01:56.150> remade<00:01:56.600> on<00:01:56.750> both<00:01:56.930> sides<00:01:57.670> but<00:01:58.670> I

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
has to be remade on both sides but I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.180 
has to be remade on both sides but I
hope<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.570> have<00:01:59.690> that<00:01:59.750> done<00:01:59.930> soon<00:02:00.440> so<00:02:00.800> I<00:02:00.830> can

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
hope to have that done soon so I can

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.420 
hope to have that done soon so I can
drive<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.270> once<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.720> get<00:02:02.900> that<00:02:03.200> done<00:02:03.530> I'll

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
drive it and once I get that done I'll

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.890 
drive it and once I get that done I'll
actually<00:02:04.700> do<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:04.850> driving<00:02:05.240> video<00:02:05.509> because<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.840> do

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
actually do a driving video because I do

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.320 
actually do a driving video because I do
not<00:02:06.140> want<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.410> drive<00:02:06.619> it<00:02:06.800> too<00:02:06.920> much<00:02:07.130> or<00:02:07.520> at<00:02:08.209> all

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
not want to drive it too much or at all

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.680 
not want to drive it too much or at all
like<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.489> and<00:02:10.489> I<00:02:10.610> would<00:02:10.670> only<00:02:11.000> drive<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.540> to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
like it is and I would only drive it to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.290 
like it is and I would only drive it to
the<00:02:11.870> exhaust<00:02:12.200> shop<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.730> done<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:13.970> I'm

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
the exhaust shop to have it done and I'm

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.690 
the exhaust shop to have it done and I'm
not<00:02:14.480> going<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.720> drive<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.140> fast<00:02:15.290> at<00:02:15.590> all<00:02:15.700> from

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
not going to drive it fast at all from

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.990 
not going to drive it fast at all from
there<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.410> once<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.530> get<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.980> exhaust<00:02:19.670> hooked

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
there so once I get the exhaust hooked

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.260 
there so once I get the exhaust hooked
up<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:21.050> motor<00:02:21.230> fine-tuned<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.190> will<00:02:23.030> do<00:02:23.239> a

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
up and the motor fine-tuned I will do a

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.850 
up and the motor fine-tuned I will do a
driving<00:02:23.750> video<00:02:23.989> though<00:02:24.920> see<00:02:25.580> how<00:02:25.640> later
