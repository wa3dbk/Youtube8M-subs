00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
it forward over the design like let's

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.710 
it forward over the design like let's
say<00:00:02.100> let's<00:00:02.580> say<00:00:02.730> that's<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.240> good<00:00:03.389> question

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
say let's say that's a good question

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.289 
say let's say that's a good question
let's<00:00:03.899> say<00:00:03.959> for<00:00:04.230> example<00:00:04.259> you<00:00:05.120> you<00:00:06.120> know<00:00:06.240> you

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
let's say for example you you know you

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.540 
let's say for example you you know you
have<00:00:06.450> an<00:00:06.750> embroidery<00:00:07.740> design<00:00:08.280> right<00:00:08.519> here

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
have an embroidery design right here

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.930 
have an embroidery design right here
okay<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.860> you<00:00:10.860> you're<00:00:11.250> going<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.400> stitch<00:00:11.700> this

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
okay and you you're going to stitch this

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.270 
okay and you you're going to stitch this
design<00:00:12.330> edge<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.840> edge<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.410> it's<00:00:13.860> stitching

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
design edge to edge and it's stitching

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.770 
design edge to edge and it's stitching
out<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> get<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> embroidery<00:00:15.330> design

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
out and you get to the embroidery design

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.189 
out and you get to the embroidery design
and<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.049> want<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.350> stop<00:00:16.699> you<00:00:17.699> can<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.570> then

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
and you want to stop you can and then

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.800 
and you want to stop you can and then
you<00:00:19.380> could<00:00:19.680> hit<00:00:19.920> forward<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.119> will<00:00:21.359> it

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
you could hit forward so that it will it

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.380 
you could hit forward so that it will it
will<00:00:21.990> stitch<00:00:22.320> it'll<00:00:22.830> air<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.240> they

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
will stitch it'll air so is what they

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.480 
will stitch it'll air so is what they
refer<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.230> where<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.890> needle<00:00:26.250> isn't

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
refer to it as where the needle isn't

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.509 
refer to it as where the needle isn't
moving<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.599> there's<00:00:27.779> no<00:00:27.960> thread<00:00:28.349> going<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.920> but

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
moving so there's no thread going in but

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.759 
moving so there's no thread going in but
the<00:00:29.640> machine<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.330> moving<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:31.080> around<00:00:31.140> that

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the machine is moving all around that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.670 
the machine is moving all around that
pattern<00:00:32.570> until<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.630> come<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> other

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
pattern until you come out to the other

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.889 
pattern until you come out to the other
side<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> pattern<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:36.000> finish<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.719> rest

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
side of the pattern to finish the rest

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.010 
side of the pattern to finish the rest
of<00:00:37.110> your<00:00:37.230> quilt<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:38.190> makes<00:00:38.370> okay<00:00:38.820> okay<00:00:39.600> yes

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
of your quilt that makes okay okay yes

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.110 
of your quilt that makes okay okay yes
now<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.890> could<00:00:41.160> go<00:00:41.309> into<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.579> little<00:00:41.730> bit<00:00:41.879> more

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
now I could go into a little bit more

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.139 
now I could go into a little bit more
detail<00:00:42.480> about<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.200> say<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.730> pro

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
detail about that and say this the pro

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.850 
detail about that and say this the pro
cubic<00:00:45.600> minor<00:00:45.809> program<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.530> talked<00:00:46.770> about

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
cubic minor program that I talked about

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.680 
cubic minor program that I talked about
for<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> leg<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.910> laying<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
for the leg the laying out of the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930 
for the leg the laying out of the
patterns<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.770> forth<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.670> have

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
patterns and so on and so forth you have

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.430 
patterns and so on and so forth you have
an<00:00:51.180> option<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:52.399> in<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:54.000> program<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:55.590> actually

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
an option in in that program to actually

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.340 
an option in in that program to actually
kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> mask<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.370> those<00:01:00.239> areas<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.079> you

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
kind of mask out those areas that you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.689 
kind of mask out those areas that you
wouldn't<00:01:01.590> even<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> stop<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.460> forward

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
wouldn't even have to stop it in forward

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.399 
wouldn't even have to stop it in forward
space<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.359> would<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.690> automatically<00:01:04.140> skip

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
space it would just automatically skip

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.719 
space it would just automatically skip
over<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:04.949> start<00:01:05.159> stitching<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
over it and start stitching in a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.390 
over it and start stitching in a
difference<00:01:06.000> arrow<00:01:06.180> okay<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.159> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
difference arrow okay but that that is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.160 
difference arrow okay but that that is
that<00:01:08.580> particular<00:01:09.060> program<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.600> does<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.990> but

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that particular program that does it but

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.660 
that particular program that does it but
if<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.500> don't<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.010> program<00:01:11.250> or<00:01:11.549> it's

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
if you don't have that program or it's

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.010 
if you don't have that program or it's
not<00:01:11.760> something<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.510> invest<00:01:12.869> in

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
not something that you can invest in

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.630 
not something that you can invest in
right<00:01:13.260> away<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.770> you're<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:13.979> interested<00:01:14.549> in

you can come to a point stop the PC
quilter<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.130> forward<00:01:20.490> space<00:01:20.790> over<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
quilter have it forward space over the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
quilter have it forward space over the
area<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.600> don't<00:01:21.900> want<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:23.490> have

to love that dog right have it air so
over<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> base<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.680> want<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
over the base that you don't want it

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.760 
over the base that you don't want it
quilted<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:30.450> pick<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.170> pick<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.619> the

pattern when you want your building that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.649 
pattern when you want your building that
makes<00:01:34.650> sense<00:01:34.950> mm-hmm<00:01:35.340> okay<00:01:35.759> very<00:01:36.390> good

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
makes sense mm-hmm okay very good

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.950 
makes sense mm-hmm okay very good
that<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> good<00:01:37.290> question<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:38.750> okay<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:39.780> I'm

this particular path about our and and
houses<00:02:18.470> without<00:02:19.960> very<00:02:20.960> sensible<00:02:21.650> design<00:02:21.950> but

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
houses without very sensible design but

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.450 
houses without very sensible design but
even<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.660> have<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.530> net<00:02:28.450> now<00:02:29.890> as<00:02:30.890> long<00:02:31.160> as<00:02:31.310> is

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
even so you have a net now as long as is

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.700 
even so you have a net now as long as is
user-friendly<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:32.600> like<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.530> is

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
user-friendly I like it it is

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.250 
user-friendly I like it it is
user-friendly<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:35.600> know<00:02:35.690> like<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.020> said

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
user-friendly and you know like I said

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.140 
user-friendly and you know like I said
the<00:02:36.770> classroom<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.510> one<00:02:38.510> thing<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.380> get

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the classroom is one thing to get

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.690 
the classroom is one thing to get
because<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.660> that<00:02:42.110> helped<00:02:42.500> me<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.040> much<00:02:43.340> as

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
because that that helped me so much as

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.060 
because that that helped me so much as
far<00:02:44.000> as<00:02:44.030> like<00:02:44.360> why<00:02:45.020> was<00:02:45.320> having<00:02:45.650> some<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:45.980> the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
far as like why was having some of the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.430 
far as like why was having some of the
issues<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.580> was<00:02:46.760> having<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:47.360> mean<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:48.110> took

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
issues that I was having I mean it took

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.490 
issues that I was having I mean it took
my<00:02:48.650> learning<00:02:49.070> curve<00:02:49.300> way<00:02:50.300> down<00:02:50.660> as<00:02:51.080> far<00:02:51.350> as

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
my learning curve way down as far as

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.920 
my learning curve way down as far as
getting<00:02:51.710> on<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.490> off<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.820> brain<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.780> if

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
getting on and off the brain so if

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.230 
getting on and off the brain so if
somebody<00:02:54.470> got<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.950> PC<00:02:55.310> closer<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.880> was<00:02:56.000> not

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
somebody got the PC closer and was not

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.190 
somebody got the PC closer and was not
familiar<00:02:56.510> with<00:02:56.990> it<00:02:57.170> at<00:02:57.320> all<00:02:57.820> between<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:59.630> and

familiar with it at all between that and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.890 
familiar with it at all between that and
the<00:03:00.290> regular<00:03:01.130> instructions<00:03:01.880> they<00:03:02.390> could<00:03:02.630> wind

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
the regular instructions they could wind

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.860 
the regular instructions they could wind
up<00:03:03.110> stroking<00:03:03.650> something<00:03:04.130> within<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:04.640> day<00:03:04.940> or<00:03:05.330> ta

no<00:03:33.720> place<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.260> first<00:03:34.470> time<00:03:34.740> I<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.130> thought

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
no place the first time I just thought

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.210 
no place the first time I just thought
that<00:03:35.340> was<00:03:35.610> great<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.300> they<00:03:36.930> come<00:03:37.530> with<00:03:37.560> some

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
that was great but they come with some

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.910 
that was great but they come with some
very<00:03:38.430> basic<00:03:38.670> little<00:03:39.240> designs<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.320> boxes

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
very basic little designs that the boxes

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.610 
very basic little designs that the boxes
that<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.360> can<00:03:42.360> check<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:42.930> make<00:03:43.170> sure<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.500> or

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
that you can check to make sure it or

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.320 
that you can check to make sure it or
filter<00:03:44.100> works<00:03:44.310> out<00:03:44.640> correctly<00:03:44.910> and

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
filter works out correctly and

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.720 
filter works out correctly and
everything<00:03:45.930> lining<00:03:46.260> up<00:03:47.510> have<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:49.580> forget<00:03:50.580> those

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
everything lining up have I forget those

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.090 
everything lining up have I forget those
like<00:03:50.970> some<00:03:51.210> scores<00:03:51.660> maybe<00:03:52.110> on<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:53.070> I

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
like some scores maybe on it that I

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.400 
like some scores maybe on it that I
think<00:03:53.460> came<00:03:53.670> with<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.090> just<00:03:54.510> on<00:03:54.660> basic<00:03:55.080> little

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
think came with it just on basic little

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.430 
think came with it just on basic little
program<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:56.750> patterns<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:58.020> came<00:03:58.290> with

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
program that patterns that came with

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.670 
program that patterns that came with
mine<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.640> kind<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.290> separate<00:04:01.290> in<00:04:01.440> there<00:04:01.650> I

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
mine that I kind of separate in there I

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.370 
mine that I kind of separate in there I
just<00:04:01.980> put<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.520> up<00:04:02.640> with<00:04:02.850> some<00:04:04.430> wood<00:04:05.430> stuff

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380
