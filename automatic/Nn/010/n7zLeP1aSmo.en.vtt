buck 69 at the regular grocery store you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.869 
buck 69 at the regular grocery store you
see<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.710> reason<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> good

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
see the the reason that this is a good

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.479 
see the the reason that this is a good
quality<00:00:51.570> meat<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.140> feed<00:00:52.379> them<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.309> even

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
quality meat to feed them or to even

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.510 
quality meat to feed them or to even
consume<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.649> wild<00:00:56.190> caught

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
consume is because it's a wild caught

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.510 
consume is because it's a wild caught
fish<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.660> ocean<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.039> small

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
fish out of the ocean and it's a small

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.090 
fish out of the ocean and it's a small
fish<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> has<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.870> very<00:01:01.260> very<00:01:01.680> little

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
fish so it has a very very little

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.800 
fish so it has a very very little
mercury<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:05.610> chicken<00:01:06.270> here

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
mercury in it and and this chicken here

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.179 
mercury in it and and this chicken here
I<00:01:06.960> thought<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.780> this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.990> great<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.590> which

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
I thought it out this is great for which

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.000 
I thought it out this is great for which
means<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.640> its<00:01:11.850> range<00:01:12.270> free<00:01:12.869> there's<00:01:13.830> only

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
means that its range free there's only

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.030 
means that its range free there's only
one<00:01:14.159> grade<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:15.119> better<00:01:15.450> than<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.259> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
one grade that's better than it and that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.249 
one grade that's better than it and that
is<00:01:17.250> grade<00:01:17.520> 5<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.750> difference<00:01:19.140> between

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
is grade 5 and the difference between

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.460 
is grade 5 and the difference between
grade<00:01:19.710> 4<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.159> grade<00:01:20.340> 5<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.840> animal

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
grade 4 and grade 5 is that the animal

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
grade 4 and grade 5 is that the animal
has<00:01:22.560> actually<00:01:23.070> been<00:01:23.220> processed<00:01:23.970> slaughtered

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
