takes place a year after Arkham City so

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.650 
takes place a year after Arkham City so
you<00:00:41.160> know<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> developers<00:00:41.969> said<00:00:42.180> he's<00:00:42.390> dead

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
happening but it's kind of odd because

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
happening but it's kind of odd because
you<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> last<00:00:48.329> arkham<00:00:48.809> game<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
you know it's the last arkham game the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.770 
you know it's the last arkham game the
last<00:00:49.620> arkham<00:00:50.460> game<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:51.300> i<00:00:51.390> said<00:00:51.570> they<00:00:51.660> could

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
last arkham game like i said they could

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
last arkham game like i said they could
still<00:00:51.899> make<00:00:52.050> prequels<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:53.250> yeah<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
still make prequels but yeah it's the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.610 
still make prequels but yeah it's the
last<00:00:53.789> arkham<00:00:54.180> game<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.230> no<00:00:55.320> Joker

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
last arkham game and we have no Joker

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.130 
last arkham game and we have no Joker
which<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.670> really<00:00:56.910> weird<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:57.480> even<00:00:58.020> in

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
which is really weird because even in

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.599 
which is really weird because even in
games<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:58.980> really<00:00:59.190> didn't<00:00:59.520> need

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
games that you know really didn't need

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.029 
games that you know really didn't need
the<00:00:59.760> joker<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.149> Arkham<00:01:00.480> origins<00:01:00.739> we<00:01:01.739> got<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the joker like Arkham origins we got the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.960 
the joker like Arkham origins we got the
Joker<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.290> my<00:01:04.290> thoughts<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:05.010> basically

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
Joker so my thoughts on it are basically

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.810 
Joker so my thoughts on it are basically
i<00:01:06.299> think<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.080> i'm<00:01:07.740> pretty<00:01:08.490> sure<00:01:08.610> we're

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
i think if we i'm pretty sure we're

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.160 
i think if we i'm pretty sure we're
gonna<00:01:08.880> see<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> Joker<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.600> some<00:01:09.780> way<00:01:09.900> shape<00:01:10.049> or

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
gonna see the Joker in some way shape or

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.630 
gonna see the Joker in some way shape or
form<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> happen

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
form and i think it's going to happen

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.899 
form and i think it's going to happen
due<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> fear<00:01:13.049> toxins<00:01:13.560> now<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.850> thing

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
due to the fear toxins now one thing

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
due to the fear toxins now one thing
about<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> fear<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> toxins<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.200> varies<00:01:16.530> by

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
about the fear of toxins it varies by

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.350 
about the fear of toxins it varies by
you<00:01:16.799> know<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.189> type<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.060> one's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you know what type it is but this one's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.780 
you know what type it is but this one's
like<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> new<00:01:18.930> fear<00:01:19.229> toxin<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.400> i'm<00:01:20.580> guessing

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
like a new fear toxin so i'm guessing

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.460 
like a new fear toxin so i'm guessing
it's<00:01:21.150> probably<00:01:21.299> gonna<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.720> loose<00:01:22.170> like

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
it's probably gonna have loose like

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.080 
it's probably gonna have loose like
hallucinations<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.820> involved

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hallucinations are going to be involved

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.730 
hallucinations are going to be involved
in<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.810> side<00:01:24.960> effects<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.439> like

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
in like the side effects of like

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980 
in like the side effects of like
exposure<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.670> maybe<00:01:27.420> since<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.900> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
exposure to it and maybe since it's a

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.200 
exposure to it and maybe since it's a
new<00:01:28.229> type<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.530> fear<00:01:28.890> toxin<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:30.000> even

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
new type of fear toxin it will even

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.179 
new type of fear toxin it will even
include<00:01:30.450> such<00:01:30.960> psychologically<00:01:31.829> like

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
include such psychologically like

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.569 
include such psychologically like
manipulative<00:01:33.229> contents<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.770> feel<00:01:35.220> like

manipulative contents that you feel like

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.760 
manipulative contents that you feel like
you're<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.630> when<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.380> someone<00:01:37.650> like

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
you're like when you see someone like

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.319 
you're like when you see someone like

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
you feel like you can interact with them

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.459 
a hallucination of the Joker or maybe
like<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.850> said<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> might<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.329> really<00:02:03.689> stronger

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
like I said it might be really stronger

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.910 
like I said it might be really stronger
really<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.159> new<00:02:05.759> type<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.390> fear<00:02:06.990> toxin<00:02:07.229> to

really like a new type of fear toxin to

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
really like a new type of fear toxin to
the<00:02:08.009> point<00:02:08.220> where<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.789> actually

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the point where you can actually

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.180 
the point where you can actually
interact<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.869> Joker<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.349> maybe<00:02:11.039> we

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
interact with the Joker like maybe we

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.530 
interact with the Joker like maybe we
have<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> kind<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.760> fight<00:02:11.940> scene<00:02:12.239> or<00:02:12.420> something

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
have a kind of fight scene or something

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.700 
have a kind of fight scene or something
like<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.840> but

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
like that but

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.100 
like that but
obviously<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.400> Batman's<00:02:15.210> mind<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:15.960> know

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
obviously in Batman's mind but you know

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.350 
obviously in Batman's mind but you know
to<00:02:16.770> him<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> fear<00:02:17.430> toxin<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.940> might<00:02:18.060> seem

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
to him with the fear toxin it might seem

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.830 
to him with the fear toxin it might seem
real<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:19.440> that's<00:02:19.980> all<00:02:20.220> um<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> only

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
real so that's all um like the only

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.870 
real so that's all um like the only
theory<00:02:22.230> i<00:02:22.320> have<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:23.490> they<00:02:23.580> said<00:02:23.790> they're

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
theory i have because they said they're

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.910 
theory i have because they said they're
not<00:02:23.910> bringing<00:02:24.180> back<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.600> life<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.680> without

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
not bringing back to life so without

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.170 
not bringing back to life so without
bringing<00:02:26.250> him<00:02:26.400> back<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.550> life<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.970> only<00:02:27.000> way

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
bringing him back to life the only way

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.520 
bringing him back to life the only way
you<00:02:27.270> could<00:02:27.360> have<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.600> joker<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.320> by

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
opinion I wouldn't feel like that's

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.090 
opinion I wouldn't feel like that's
being<00:02:33.360> just<00:02:33.840> forced<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.350> there<00:02:34.560> because
