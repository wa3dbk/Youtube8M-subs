00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
this is like a nice wee hacking thing

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.039 
this is like a nice wee hacking thing
also<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:37.190> more<00:01:38.420> when<00:01:39.420> you're<00:01:39.540> having<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
also because more when you're having the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.690 
also because more when you're having the
way<00:01:40.400> SDHC<00:01:41.400> cards<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:41.940> not<00:01:42.090> supported<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
way SDHC cards are not supported so that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.280 
way SDHC cards are not supported so that
means<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:46.100> one<00:01:47.100> two<00:01:48.000> gigabytes<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.930> only

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
means like one two gigabytes are only

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.539 
means like one two gigabytes are only
supported<00:01:50.990> okay<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.770> don't<00:01:53.100> try<00:01:53.250> but

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
supported okay so like don't try but

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.710 
supported okay so like don't try but
even<00:01:53.580> like<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:55.220> 4<00:01:56.220> gigabyte<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:57.000> drive<00:01:57.510> that

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
even like a 4 gigabyte and drive that

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.500 
even like a 4 gigabyte and drive that
works<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.290> doesn't<00:01:58.500> work<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:59.400> hack<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.939> get<00:02:00.330> it

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
works it doesn't work to hack we get it

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.810 
works it doesn't work to hack we get it
like<00:02:00.720> water<00:02:00.990> 2<00:02:01.229> megabytes<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.280> then<00:02:02.729> you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
like water 2 megabytes and then you

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.240 
like water 2 megabytes and then you
could<00:02:03.030> transfer<00:02:03.479> your<00:02:04.080> hacks<00:02:04.380> after<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.070> have

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
could transfer your hacks after you have

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.969 
could transfer your hacks after you have
to<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.900> transfer<00:02:07.320> your<00:02:07.350> homebrew

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
to you can transfer your homebrew

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.919 
to you can transfer your homebrew
channel<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.519> everything<00:02:08.610> 205<00:02:09.479> every<00:02:09.720> part

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
channel and everything 205 every part

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.680 
channel and everything 205 every part
done<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:10.769> work<00:02:10.970> say<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.510> 8

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
done that would work say if you have 8

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.030 
done that would work say if you have 8
gigabyte<00:02:13.340> SDHC<00:02:14.340> card<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:16.230> want<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.500> hack<00:02:16.709> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
gigabyte SDHC card you want to hack the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.100 
gigabyte SDHC card you want to hack the
Wii<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.880> can't<00:02:18.150> do<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.750> right<00:02:18.810> way

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
Wii you can't do it like that right way

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.930 
Wii you can't do it like that right way
so<00:02:19.350> but<00:02:19.709> after<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.160> hacked<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.760> could

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
so but after you hacked it you could

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.470 
so but after you hacked it you could
transfer<00:02:21.239> all<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.690> apps<00:02:21.930> or<00:02:22.290> all<00:02:22.590> your
