think<00:02:34.549> I<00:02:35.170> had<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.350> thought<00:02:36.560> well<00:02:36.739> we'll<00:02:36.950> be

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
think I had it I thought well we'll be

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.090 
think I had it I thought well we'll be
patient<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.790> know<00:02:37.970> well<00:02:38.560> he<00:02:39.560> gets<00:02:39.739> his<00:02:39.950> day

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
patient you know well he gets his day

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.880 
patient you know well he gets his day
off<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.840> next<00:02:41.840> thing<00:02:42.080> I<00:02:42.260> know<00:02:42.500> he's<00:02:42.739> are

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
off and next thing I know he's are

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.090 
off and next thing I know he's are
rolling<00:02:43.220> in<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.519> babbling<00:02:44.560> way<00:02:45.560> outside

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
rolling in the babbling way outside

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.640 
rolling in the babbling way outside
coming<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.180> I'll<00:02:47.900> go<00:02:48.049> out<00:02:48.200> there<00:02:48.410> and<00:02:48.560> I'll

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
coming in I'll go out there and I'll

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.050 
coming in I'll go out there and I'll
look<00:02:48.680> over<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.160> edge<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.489> truck<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.910> this

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
look over the edge of the truck and this

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.930 
look over the edge of the truck and this
thing<00:02:50.330> was<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> sitting<00:02:50.930> there<00:02:51.519> yeah<00:02:52.519> Peter

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
thing was a sitting there yeah Peter

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.849 
thing was a sitting there yeah Peter
runs<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.420> go<00:02:54.070> 300<00:02:55.070> hours<00:02:56.140> that's<00:02:57.140> true

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
runs and go 300 hours that's true

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.250 
runs and go 300 hours that's true
it<00:02:58.010> shouldn't<00:02:58.340> be<00:02:58.400> hurt<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.850> bit<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.019> don't

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
it shouldn't be hurt a bit and I don't

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.039 
it shouldn't be hurt a bit and I don't
think<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.890> don't<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.160> hold<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.609> it

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
think it is I don't have a hold of it

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.650 
think it is I don't have a hold of it
next<00:03:03.049> thing<00:03:03.200> we'll<00:03:03.410> ask<00:03:03.560> ya

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
next thing we'll ask ya

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.449 
next thing we'll ask ya
get<00:03:06.660> in<00:03:06.810> with<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.110> Kohler<00:03:07.349> wiring<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.160> see

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
get in with the Kohler wiring and see

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.660 
get in with the Kohler wiring and see
what<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.670> can<00:03:08.910> do<00:03:09.560> about<00:03:10.560> may<00:03:10.830> just<00:03:11.160> wiring<00:03:11.580> a

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
what I can do about may just wiring a

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.360 
what I can do about may just wiring a
plug<00:03:11.940> into<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:12.450> dude<00:03:12.810> that'd<00:03:13.110> be<00:03:13.370> pretty

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
plug into this dude that'd be pretty

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.130 
plug into this dude that'd be pretty
nice<00:03:14.640> and<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.270> just<00:03:15.450> hook<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.720> up<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.080> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
nice and we can just hook it up to the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.030 
nice and we can just hook it up to the
wiring<00:03:16.410> harness<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:17.870> think<00:03:18.870> kind<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.140> work<00:03:19.349> I've

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
wiring harness I think kind of work I've

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.910 
wiring harness I think kind of work I've
seen<00:03:20.099> the<00:03:20.400> pressure<00:03:20.640> switch<00:03:21.060> on<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.769> so<00:03:22.769> our

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
seen the pressure switch on it so our

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.680 
seen the pressure switch on it so our
oil<00:03:22.950> temperature<00:03:23.700> should<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.090> all<00:03:24.269> right

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.949 

what's<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.810> our<00:03:27.989> meter<00:03:28.380> got<00:03:28.590> on<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:29.569> yeah<00:03:30.569> you

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
what's that our meter got on it yeah you

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.400 
what's that our meter got on it yeah you
probably<00:03:31.230> can't<00:03:31.470> see<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.680> but<00:03:31.769> it's<00:03:32.010> 1104<00:03:33.410> so

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
probably can't see it but it's 1104 so

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.380 
probably can't see it but it's 1104 so
really<00:03:34.769> that's<00:03:34.920> not<00:03:35.190> too<00:03:35.430> bad<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.700> don't<00:03:36.000> reckon

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
really that's not too bad I don't reckon

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.350 
really that's not too bad I don't reckon
for<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.630> 74<00:03:37.230> model<00:03:38.420> engine<00:03:39.420> oil<00:03:39.660> pressure

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
for a 74 model engine oil pressure

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.979 
for a 74 model engine oil pressure
transmission<00:03:42.360> oil<00:03:42.540> temperature<00:03:44.600> so<00:03:45.600> anyway<00:03:45.959> I

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
transmission oil temperature so anyway I

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.590 
transmission oil temperature so anyway I
think<00:03:46.260> it'll<00:03:46.560> go<00:03:47.459> up<00:03:47.489> got<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.000> pending<00:03:48.390> years

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
think it'll go up got the pending years

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.229 
think it'll go up got the pending years
and<00:03:48.840> everything<00:03:49.310> all<00:03:50.310> right<00:03:50.489> guys<00:03:50.819> we'll<00:03:51.060> all
