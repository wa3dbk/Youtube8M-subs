00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 feel like vegetable milk you know guys 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.120
 I discovered that the extraction of liquids 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.280
 from cereals dry fruits and vegetables is 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.800
 really simple and fast and the liquid 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.210
 that you get a healthy drink 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.340
 nutritious and today and I decided to 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.859
 make an alternative vegetable milk 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.300
 based on spelled the nutritional values ​​of 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.310
 this cereal is almost 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.039
 similar to those of common wheat 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.050
 and durum wheat and today we will see so 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.260
 as its own Roma in the home to prepare 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.380
 we need 100 spelled milk 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.130
 grams of spelled hulled a liter of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.890
 water a piece of kombu seaweed a pinch 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.600
 of salt 2 tablespoons of syrup from gaber 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.440
 then let's start with the preparation 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.899
 but first two words to understand that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.809
 kind of get it used I recommend 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.480
 to choose the hulled lighthouse that it is 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.559
 equipped with pericarp which is rich in fiber 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 and mineral salts 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.270
 there is also another version one 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.949
 variant of the lighthouse than the lighthouse on the side 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.559
 however this undergoes a process 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.840
 particular which is called perlatura where 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.610
 the pericarp is removed and it is really 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.439
 also for this reason that the stopped 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.689
 it does not require the so it can be 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.030
 cooked immediately in 30 minutes we say it is 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.830
 ready while the lighthouse peeled off that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.439
 that point that I suggest you 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.869
 requires at least six hours 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.430
 after which it should be rinsed well though 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.950
 to remove all invited guests 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.840
 commonly anti-nutritional after that 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.610
 can be boiled 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.210
 I have already carried on obviously 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.180
 to speed up the times I warmed up a 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.579
 liter of water already put a little bit of 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.520
 salt a little and I also put lay 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.650
 with holes source of monosodium glutamate 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.720
 known flavor enhancer 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.060
 then I poured the spelled 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.700
 shelled I closed with the lid e 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.619
 I let it cook for about an hour 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 at this point we can proceed with the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.259
 construction of the lot 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.090
 at this point I poured the lighthouse 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.770
 inside a blender 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.869
 It is fine the immersion blender is 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.700
 the one obtained by a little water 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.350
 of negro cooking we are a bit doses 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.539
 they depend on your tastes so if you do 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.009
 like a creamier milk add 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.900
 less water if you like to put instead 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.989
 more liquid clearly add one 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.850
 more sweeten with a couple of 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.530
 about spoons of flower apodaca where it goes 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.930
 good also maple syrup sugar of 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.390
 wholemeal cane preferably or 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.390
 also one or two pitted dates 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.410
 we clean everything once blended 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.299
 we all have to separate the fiber or 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.819
 better locara what remains after 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.830
 having shot all the juice from the liquid 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.950
 from milk so I prepared one 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.030
 bowl I put a colander on top 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.799
 cover a sieve with a cloth 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.299
 with a smell of detergent I will 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.510
 I recommend washing it with baking soda 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.250
 and then to bring it back into boiling water 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.769
 to facilitate separation 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.940
 we can also make a bundle e 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:02.700
 crush slowly or we are 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.859
 in the salons way of drips alone me 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.680
 I repeat if you like the most liquid 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.630
 reach more cooking water or 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.400
 even even more water 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.700
 if instead you like it quite thick 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.239
 I prefer precisely creamy used 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.350
 of cooking water only or one 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.450
 part 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.730
 here we are in a flash we have 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.000
 kept our delicious milk from 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.210
 I'll spell out what's left here 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.540
 trapped inside the cloth 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:37.180
 local to do it and with that we could 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.070
 maybe make meatballs then 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.990
 we can delight our palate with 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.720
 a nice glass of spelled milk 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.180
 maybe even more sweetened if you 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.550
 like sweeter or warmed me 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.660
 I prefer nice warm maybe together with 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.030
 other cereals 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.010
 you can also keep it longer 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.560
 so it keeps in the fridge two days 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.360
 but as I told you you can keep 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.820
 also in freezer or 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.010
 sterilize it better pasteurized as 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.930
 maybe a jam and this is it 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.340
 the example what I did 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.840
 then or boiled the glass container 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.700
 in the water then filled it with the 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.790
 paul milk closed with the cap a 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.220
 screw and then I put it to pasteurize 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.920
 another time I covered it with water and 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.270
 I brought it to the boil though about 10 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.070
 minutes after that I did n't leave it 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.170
 completely cool in the alleys of 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.570
 pasteurization so our dates of 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.170
 do it if it was also good for a 4 or 5 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.540
 months 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.570
 but always remember to mix it with 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.430
 shake it a little before tasting it for 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.230
 the richness of complex carbohydrates the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.760
 Fairly energetic fairy milk 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.500
 while the amount of thanks 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.930
 almost zero a note of merit 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.460
 it is up to the quantity of fibers 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.560
 mineral salts in fact here 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.190
 we can find a lot of magnesium 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.190
 potassium and phosphorus
