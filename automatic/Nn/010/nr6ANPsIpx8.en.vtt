and HD display device which is not an
IPS<00:00:46.410> display<00:00:46.829> since<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.489> go<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:47.879> bit

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
IPS display since if you go a little bit

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.119 
IPS display since if you go a little bit
here<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> top<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
here to the top you can see here the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.650 
here to the top you can see here the
color<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.520> getting<00:00:50.789> dark<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.210> from<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> side

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
color is getting dark but from the side

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.930 
color is getting dark but from the side
it's<00:00:52.170> looking<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.340> right<00:00:53.579> from<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
it's looking actually all right from the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's looking actually all right from the
bottom<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.390> getting<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> little<00:00:54.780> bit<00:00:54.930> lighter

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
bottom it's getting a little bit lighter

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.979 
bottom it's getting a little bit lighter
so<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.949> shouldn't<00:00:56.340> look<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.210> too<00:00:57.750> far

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
so just shouldn't look at it and too far

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.900 
so just shouldn't look at it and too far
from<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> top<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.129> unlock<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.760> can

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
from the top so if you unlock it you can

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.849 
from the top so if you unlock it you can
see<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.539> reacting<00:01:01.079> quite<00:01:01.289> quickly<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
see it's reacting quite quickly have a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.189 
see it's reacting quite quickly have a
1.6<00:01:02.730> yards<00:01:03.120> well<00:01:03.300> core<00:01:03.539> processor<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> think

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
1.6 yards well core processor I think

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.649 
1.6 yards well core processor I think
inside<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:05.040> 1<00:01:05.280> gig<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.580> ram<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.060> only<00:01:06.420> four

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
inside have 1 gig of ram and only four

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.149 
inside have 1 gig of ram and only four
gigs<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.049> internal<00:01:07.140> memory<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:08.130> is

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
gigs of internal memory which is

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.090 
gigs of internal memory which is
actually<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.200> horrible<00:01:10.200> since<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.920> have

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
actually not that horrible since we have

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.980 
actually not that horrible since we have
a<00:01:11.130> micro<00:01:11.610> SD<00:01:11.670> card<00:01:12.060> reader<00:01:12.150> right<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.900> you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
a micro SD card reader right here so you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080 
a micro SD card reader right here so you
can<00:01:13.170> expand<00:01:13.920> your<00:01:14.010> space<00:01:14.490> inside<00:01:14.880> otherwise

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
can expand your space inside otherwise

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.050 
can expand your space inside otherwise
and<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.500> sim<00:01:16.799> card<00:01:16.830> slot<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.850> and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
and we have the sim card slot here and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
and we have the sim card slot here and
it<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.420> second<00:01:18.840> sim<00:01:19.500> also<00:01:19.920> right

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it would be a second sim also right

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.070 
it would be a second sim also right
there<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.820> would<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:21.630> white<00:01:21.840> one

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
there if I would have two white one

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
there if I would have two white one
right<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.530> my<00:01:22.560> hand<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.580> put<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
right now in my hand but to put in the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.760 
right now in my hand but to put in the
sim<00:01:24.330> card<00:01:24.360> actually<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> open<00:01:25.439> this

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
sim card actually just have to open this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.679 
sim card actually just have to open this
up<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.520> slide<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:27.270> you're

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
up and then you can slide in here you're

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.230 
up and then you can slide in here you're
one<00:01:27.960> or<00:01:28.170> two<00:01:28.380> sim<00:01:28.650> cards<00:01:28.680> depending<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.759> them

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
one or two sim cards depending on them

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.420 
one or two sim cards depending on them
yeah<00:01:30.479> how<00:01:30.750> many<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.439> which<00:01:31.770> device<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.400> bought

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
yeah how many or which device you bought

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
yeah how many or which device you bought

what's also quite nice about this phone

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.710 
what's also quite nice about this phone
is<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.530> speaker<00:02:04.799> and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
is that we have one speaker and

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.150 
is that we have one speaker and
on<00:02:05.780> bottom<00:02:06.620> and<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.950> top<00:02:11.200> well<00:02:12.200> at<00:02:12.260> least<00:02:12.410> it

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
on bottom and the top well at least it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.250 
on bottom and the top well at least it
seems<00:02:13.550> like<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.210> I<00:02:14.540> was<00:02:14.780> just<00:02:14.930> listening

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
seems like it and I was just listening

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.750 
seems like it and I was just listening
to<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:15.620> comes<00:02:16.070> out<00:02:16.190> on<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.400> bottom

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
to it it just comes out on the bottom

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.010 
to it it just comes out on the bottom
but<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:16.940> guess<00:02:17.210> when<00:02:17.390> you're<00:02:17.510> taking<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.810> phone

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
but I guess when you're taking a phone

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.810 
but I guess when you're taking a phone
for<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.200> will<00:02:18.410> be<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.680> top<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.700> does

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
for the will be on the top and so does

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.460 
for the will be on the top and so does
not<00:02:20.060> like<00:02:20.300> boom<00:02:20.540> sound<00:02:20.810> we<00:02:21.020> have<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.320> on<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
not like boom sound we have you on the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.010 
not like boom sound we have you on the
bottom<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.920> android<00:02:22.310> buttons<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.020> available

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
bottom the android buttons and available

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.350 
bottom the android buttons and available
