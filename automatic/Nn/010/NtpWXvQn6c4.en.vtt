change<00:04:54.219> down<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:54.520> couple<00:04:54.819> of<00:04:54.939> gears<00:04:55.150> but<00:04:55.900> if<00:04:55.990> you

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
change down a couple of gears but if you

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.809 
change down a couple of gears but if you
get<00:04:56.289> the<00:04:56.439> wrong<00:04:56.680> one<00:04:56.710> because<00:04:57.639> you<00:04:57.699> haven't

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
get the wrong one because you haven't

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.450 
get the wrong one because you haven't
