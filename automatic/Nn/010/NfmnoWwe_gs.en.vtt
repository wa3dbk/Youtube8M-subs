00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
just actually broke up already even how

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.640 
just actually broke up already even how
can<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.120> even<00:02:28.240> turn<00:02:28.510> into<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.990> solver<00:02:29.650> corner

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
can you even turn into the solver corner

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.040 
can you even turn into the solver corner
the<00:02:32.650> corner<00:02:32.800> another<00:02:33.330> break<00:02:36.150> yeah<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.630> dad

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
the corner another break yeah it's dad

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the corner another break yeah it's dad
step<00:02:39.010> up<00:02:39.190> like<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.970> even<00:02:40.690> weaker<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:41.890> is

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
step up like this is even weaker this is

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.720 
step up like this is even weaker this is
probably<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.970> burner<00:02:46.230> all<00:02:47.230> right<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.640> can

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
probably the burner all right so you can

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.330 
probably the burner all right so you can
see<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.000> counter<00:02:49.420> hopefully<00:02:49.780> moving<00:02:50.340> yeah

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
see the counter hopefully moving yeah

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.680 
see the counter hopefully moving yeah
it's<00:02:51.730> small<00:02:51.820> but<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.210> can<00:02:52.450> see<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.690> move<00:02:54.690> okay

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
it's small but I can see it move okay

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.720 
it's small but I can see it move okay
it's<00:02:55.810> probably<00:02:56.160> connection<00:02:57.160> disconnected

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
it's probably connection disconnected
