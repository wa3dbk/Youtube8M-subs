 The fact that I want to Tokujin development team s pilot Abure from the sky appeared 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.040
 This time, it was six died in Well all I Is video 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.700
 Well that's about the completion of the seventh high 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.930
 We were made separately in each ne Well, a little theme 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:36.489
 Iku' of one table of contents 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.879
 Yes trying to draw it not a bonding with an adhesive 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:44.600
 It is a post-Saddle processing if you get it No. 2 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:48.560
 Yes to allow the rear Saddle by to activities Shinji 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.780
 Then have your talking about the addition of masking tape 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.950
 I 'm listening to more and more sa sa tame board 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.270
 It says easy to use the Well 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.380
 There is a place 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.940
 It is referred to the mast of the empty-handed a pointing color 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.260
 It was thin masking 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.110
 By doing so 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.510
 Black color attached 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.100
 I think the degree of completion will be 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:20.430
 It is the fourth that uses mass keel higher material 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:25.040
 # Beneath the straight using the Ruskin coating agent at 4 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:28.170
 It is after 9 I introduce drying It is a tableware dryer of Yamazen 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.230
 Is cheap and very easy to handle 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.700
 Well transport early to paint and dry 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.290
 Or 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.590
 Papione early 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.610
 dry 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.030
 College It is with such Fu say so meant to be processed Tsu 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.220
 I think it will be necessary to some extent 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.990
 # I this 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:52.210
 Thinning liquid cleaning solution airbrush I was cleaning the mouse very much 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.670
 It is now accounted for it an important point to know the important point 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.810
 There is a mouse position 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.280
 Outside is using high-class one, until then there 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.640
 It is the place to wash 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.760
 It is good to use it in high-class eyes. Tacos performance is bad. 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.240
 Oh what use cleaning solution was Well it is as much as possible cheap Oh star performer 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.020
 You have to talk, such Fu say 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.020
 then 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:23.430
 I of Tamaa photo painted on it the base is uneven color 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:26.260
 As color unevenness appears, we talk about Ginza Ayumi as a method of painting to hide it 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:32.800
 I think that Bailly send not not you good to another 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.969
 Well then, with Kuroda I talked about it when I painted it right away. 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.100
 When 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.510
 It is said that these are likely to lose 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.650
 The 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.110
 It is close to white 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.750
 If you want to study language 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.940
 After all Mu 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.660
 I think the limit is the limit 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.930
 then 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.040

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:14.050
 I thought that it was a story only with painting in the middle east color 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.710
 It is not attached also to 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.330

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.000

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.909

 In the process of making a strategy 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.340
