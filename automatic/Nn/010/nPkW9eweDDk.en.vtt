rap whole wheat with chicken there so

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.100 
rap whole wheat with chicken there so
this<00:04:19.609> would<00:04:19.760> be<00:04:20.410> about<00:04:21.970> about<00:04:22.970> 40<00:04:23.660> grams<00:04:23.900> of

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
this would be about about 40 grams of

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.140 
this would be about about 40 grams of
protein<00:04:24.880> about<00:04:25.880> eight<00:04:26.510> grams<00:04:26.990> net<00:04:27.350> carbs<00:04:27.770> so

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
protein about eight grams net carbs so

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.659 
protein about eight grams net carbs so
