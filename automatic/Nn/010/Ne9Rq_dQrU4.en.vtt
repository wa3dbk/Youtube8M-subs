00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.049
 hello how are you already know what minor is 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.009
 believe and today I bring you a video 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.440
 succulent today I'm going to talk about 10 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.360
 things that men want but do not know 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.920
 they ask women number 1 that the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.240
 woman takes initiative I think the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.980
 men like the woman to take 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.719
 initiative either in a talk when 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.670
 they are known either in a dive or in a 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.590
 park or at school that the whole woman 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.630
 the initiative in the talk since 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.130
 always leave it or most 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.810
 Sometimes they always leave it to men 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.310
 they are talking and talking and talk 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.570
 better men good to them 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.039
 like that the woman also takes 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.369
 initiative for that part number two 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.170
 feel admired whether we 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.630
 we like men to admire us 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.129
 I think that everyone does not do your girlfriend 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.559
 that he had to be handsome or that you're 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.120
 attractive that you dress well because to 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.620
 women also like them then 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.329
 we like us too 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.480
 not always but not always 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.210
 we like that they do not know us 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 we see handsome number three that make us 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.329
 laugh I think all or less like 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.559
 that women make us laugh at 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.390
 our we like to make us 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.340
 laugh because it makes us feel comfortable in 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.469
 the talk in a man interaction 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.180
 or woman makes us feel more safer 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.339
 more fun with the other person 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.030
 number four that do not make us change 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.650
 I believe that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.080
 to all men good in my case to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.580
 it happened to me that the woman wants to change 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.290
 to the man whether for example if he 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.960
 you wear with a hat maybe you do not like it 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.759
 that he takes off his cap or because he does not 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 like that they look bad then it can be 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.600
 that man does not feel comfortable that what 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.430
 change for example when you want to 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.390
 her friends maybe she does not give 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.390
 permission then 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.050
 then friends if you do not give permission already 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.190
 whether they are going to watch football or something 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.990
 Well, if it 's wrong then number 5 that 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.640
 it is arranged touch we like that 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.900
 to be fixed either why 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.760
 and have an appointment either not to leave 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.680
 to do on the street for some other 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.780
 thing we like you will be friends do not know 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.790
 we ask because we feel sorry sometimes 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.750
 but we all like it to be 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.060
 King number 6 number 6 atom talks about 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.009
 we like a woman to be daring but 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.280
 not to the excess of who is teaching 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:14.130
 also just be sexy or I do not know 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.830
 yes no no if not sexy since to us or to 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.600
 I personally like to be with a 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.430
 person who is well groomed and who 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.470
 you saw well and that maybe other 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.840
 men would like to be with her number 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.610
 7 that is more independent I think that 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.350
 all women like to have 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.730
 a gentlemanly man but I think that a 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.739
 we like them to be more 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.390
 Independent invites us to open them 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.920
 the door although it is gentlemanly but 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.660
 in some other way we like that is 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.130
 so independent number 8 that the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.989
 surprise, I think we all like it 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.120
 that a woman surprises us either by 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.250
 a letter or how good it is going to 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.040
 visit your house I think all the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.900
 men like that a song a 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.060
 gift or something 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.129
 that is more to make it more corny number 9 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.620
 that does not use so much makeup at all 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.220
 men like the woman to be what 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.900
 natural 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.970
 I personally like it to be more 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.950
 It's natural that they do not put on makeup because 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.549
 they appear there bread emptied all we 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.980
 they throw so many things in the face 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.769
 so do not end the talks or the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.530
 or not that it's fights that you reveal 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:21.610
 talks or discussions with an ok or 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:25.200
 with one but it would be a fight no it's not going to 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.200
 to do is like very short 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.330
