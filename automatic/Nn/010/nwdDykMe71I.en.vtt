give my online because I know they tell
them<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.269> probably<00:00:24.630> just<00:00:25.050> apply<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:26.039> there's

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
them and probably just apply but there's

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.269 
them and probably just apply but there's
not<00:00:26.519> one<00:00:26.580> close<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.180> me<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.230> got<00:00:28.769> mine<00:00:29.010> online

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
not one close to me so I got mine online

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.730 
not one close to me so I got mine online
for<00:00:30.240> about<00:00:30.330> ninety<00:00:30.840> nine<00:00:30.990> plus<00:00:31.289> shipping<00:00:31.529> and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220 
for about ninety nine plus shipping and
handling<00:00:31.880> which<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.000> about<00:00:33.210> fifteen<00:00:33.840> dollars

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
handling which is about fifteen dollars

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.530
