if you'd won I think right around 6800
would<00:03:40.700> be<00:03:40.850> for<00:03:41.350> maximum<00:03:42.820> engine<00:03:43.820> output<00:03:43.970> as

would be for maximum engine output as

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.940 
would be for maximum engine output as
far<00:03:44.540> as<00:03:44.690> horsepower<00:03:45.620> but<00:03:46.579> anyway<00:03:47.650> very<00:03:48.650> very

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
far as horsepower but anyway very very

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:49.360 
far as horsepower but anyway very very
cool

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370

a lot of different vehicles this one

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.790 
a lot of different vehicles this one
obviously<00:04:50.600> is<00:04:50.690> tuned<00:04:51.370> much<00:04:52.370> differently<00:04:53.800> this

is<00:04:54.920> actually<00:04:55.220> what<00:04:55.340> they<00:04:55.430> call<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.820> front

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
is actually what they call that front

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.810 
is actually what they call that front
midship<00:04:56.840> design<00:04:57.230> they<00:04:57.740> put<00:04:58.040> that<00:04:58.190> motor<00:04:58.520> a

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
midship design they put that motor a

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.490 
midship design they put that motor a
little<00:04:59.450> bit<00:04:59.540> further<00:04:59.780> back<00:04:59.960> in<00:05:00.200> the<00:05:00.230> car

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
little bit further back in the car
