the main thing you have to remember
about<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.649> scenario<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:09.150> are<00:00:09.360> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
about this scenario is that you are the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.070 
about this scenario is that you are the
Mongols<00:00:11.150> that<00:00:12.150> means<00:00:12.420> your<00:00:12.799> ranged<00:00:13.799> units<00:00:14.250> are

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
Mongols that means your ranged units are

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.340 
Mongols that means your ranged units are
really<00:00:16.080> overpowered<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.420> you<00:00:18.420> can<00:00:18.570> move<00:00:18.750> vast

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
really overpowered and you can move vast

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.880 
really overpowered and you can move vast
distances<00:00:20.130> at<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> time<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.560> key

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
distances at a time and this is key

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.509 
distances at a time and this is key
because<00:00:23.840> they<00:00:24.840> provide<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.500> with<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.039> lot<00:00:26.369> of

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
because they provide you with a lot of

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.939 
because they provide you with a lot of
roads<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.090> go<00:00:27.269> from<00:00:27.630> civilization<00:00:28.590> to

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
roads that go from civilization to

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.279 
roads that go from civilization to
civilization<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.480> easy<00:00:30.630> for<00:00:30.929> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
civilization so it's really easy for you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.889 
civilization so it's really easy for you
to<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.500> from<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.430> next<00:00:32.630> which<00:00:33.630> means

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to get from one to the next which means

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.720 
to get from one to the next which means
you<00:00:34.050> really<00:00:34.079> only<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.770> concentrate<00:00:35.190> on

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
you really only have to concentrate on

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.270 
you really only have to concentrate on
not<00:00:35.969> losing<00:00:36.270> units<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.140> killing<00:00:39.559> towns<00:00:40.559> as

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
not losing units and killing towns as

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.580 
not losing units and killing towns as
fast<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:41.760> possible<00:00:42.300> without<00:00:42.450> losing<00:00:43.260> units

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
fast as possible without losing units

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.850 
fast as possible without losing units
the<00:00:44.579> beginning<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.510> scenario<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the beginning of this scenario is the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.580 
the beginning of this scenario is the
hardest<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.610> opinion<00:00:48.030> because<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:49.050> kicks

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
hardest in my opinion because your kicks

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.340 
hardest in my opinion because your kicks
do<00:00:49.920> not<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.309> logistics<00:00:51.030> yet<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.510> logistics

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
do not have logistics yet and logistics

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.290 
do not have logistics yet and logistics
allows<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.039> attack<00:00:53.430> twice<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.270> single

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
allows you to attack twice in a single

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.010 
allows you to attack twice in a single
turn<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.890> makes<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.460> ridiculously<00:00:57.420> easy<00:00:57.570> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
turn this makes it ridiculously easy to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.209 
turn this makes it ridiculously easy to
kill<00:00:58.770> units<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.579> take<00:00:59.910> over<00:01:00.300> cities<00:01:01.219> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
kill units and take over cities the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.530 
kill units and take over cities the
fastest<00:01:02.699> way<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.270> logistics<00:01:04.080> would<00:01:04.409> be<00:01:04.680> to

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
fastest way to get logistics would be to

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.109 
fastest way to get logistics would be to
whether<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.780> pick<00:01:07.020> open<00:01:07.590> ground<00:01:07.890> or<00:01:08.280> rough

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
whether you pick open ground or rough

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.780 
whether you pick open ground or rough
terrain<00:01:09.570> bonus<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.890> want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.159> pick<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.340> same

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
terrain bonus you want to pick that same

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.929 
terrain bonus you want to pick that same
bonus<00:01:12.270> three<00:01:12.990> times<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.650> row<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.130> then

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
bonus three times in a row and then

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
after the fourth level up you get to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.859 
after the fourth level up you get to

the capital cities that I take since you

to just straight up by the courthouse to

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.810 
to just straight up by the courthouse to
reduce<00:01:30.360> unhappiness<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.310> sent<00:01:32.310> these<00:01:32.430> units

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
reduce unhappiness I sent these units

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
reduce unhappiness I sent these units
out<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.150> explore<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> next<00:01:33.930> civilization<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
out to explore the next civilization to

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.580 
out to explore the next civilization to
be<00:01:34.799> conquered<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.970> would<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.270> Persia

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
be conquered and that would be Persia

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.660 
be conquered and that would be Persia
I<00:01:38.299> end<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.899> line<00:01:40.469> Amity<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:43.159> kind<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.250> get

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
I end up a line Amity to kind of get

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.990 
I end up a line Amity to kind of get
Persia<00:01:45.179> and<00:01:45.630> them<00:01:46.189> battling<00:01:47.189> before<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.880> my

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
Persia and them battling before I get my

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.389 
Persia and them battling before I get my
units<00:01:48.299> over<00:01:48.569> there<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:49.920> less

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
units over there so that I have less

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.309 
units over there so that I have less
units<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.000> kill<00:01:51.210> when<00:01:51.509> my<00:01:51.659> army<00:01:51.899> gets<00:01:52.079> there

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
units to kill when my army gets there

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.679 
units to kill when my army gets there
I'll<00:01:53.039> show<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.429> the<00:01:53.579> basic<00:01:53.969> strategy<00:01:54.479> for

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
I'll show you the basic strategy for

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.859 
I'll show you the basic strategy for
attacking<00:01:54.929> with<00:01:55.289> Kasich's<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.479> go<00:01:57.479> forward

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
attacking with Kasich's you go forward

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.190 
attacking with Kasich's you go forward
one<00:01:58.049> space<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:59.100> attack<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.600> go<00:02:00.780> back<00:02:00.959> one

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
one space you attack and you go back one

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.880 
one space you attack and you go back one
space<00:02:01.319> this<00:02:03.140> obviously<00:02:04.140> puts<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.560> out<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
space this obviously puts you out of

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.859 
space this obviously puts you out of
range<00:02:05.069> of<00:02:05.219> any<00:02:05.369> attackers<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.600> said

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
range of any attackers and like I said

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:14.960 
range of any attackers and like I said
pretty<00:02:07.229> basic<00:02:11.780> if<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.900> turn<00:02:13.290> thirty<00:02:13.620> one<00:02:13.970> Siam

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
pretty basic if I turn thirty one Siam

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.270 
pretty basic if I turn thirty one Siam
should<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.569> completely<00:02:16.290> conquered<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:17.130> you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
should be completely conquered and you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.860 
should be completely conquered and you
should<00:02:17.459> be<00:02:17.579> on<00:02:17.760> your<00:02:17.790> way<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:19.970> Persia<00:02:20.970> alright

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
should be on your way to Persia alright

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.670 
should be on your way to Persia alright
I<00:02:21.900> turned<00:02:22.349> 41<00:02:23.329> you<00:02:24.329> have<00:02:24.599> already<00:02:24.959> been<00:02:25.260> at<00:02:25.470> war

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
I turned 41 you have already been at war

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.119 
I turned 41 you have already been at war
with<00:02:26.069> Persia<00:02:26.790> for<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> little<00:02:27.660> bit<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.230> you've

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
with Persia for a little bit and you've
