00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:06.030
 very well now that the pre-salt layer has been taken care of as the first 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.819
 so now you already learn to solve second home here 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:13.609
 leaving two-thirds of the complete cobo missing not only this active layer 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:15.279
 anticipates rain 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.869
 I do not know if you're going to learn two lines, one that does this way coming here 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.130
 scoreboard 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.130
 what does this mean 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.779
 not from here to here 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.279
 trainees that he direct form 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.710
 starting with a little 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.770
 if you have to look at the top layer with stick 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.840
 a medium that does not have clt and yellow area it is part of this layer of 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 top 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.660
 this team is red and green 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.700
 he has to come here to put is that if it is going to take that the line cuts phase with the 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.610
 medium 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.320
 concentrate right 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.480
 now if it is going to have to see which formation will use to make left there was injury 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.930
 right 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.000
 he thinks he's more of an elect because I know cement comes here 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.870
 such right 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.870
 Prates he here has to do the following 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.120
 the line 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.080
 emily 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.540
 the line 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.540
 f row 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.630
 the stocker comes here this year another one 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.570
 This means you have to come here. 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.670
 then it is the left version 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.770
 people who fall ill will do the following leaving and in the fourth quarter 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.350
 the line 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.350
 it's the line 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.210
 this line is not right 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.690
 with line 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.180
 I come here it's just missing them 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.710
 that the controversial left 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.200
 the line 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.200
 he cleans 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.270
 Perfect 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.870
 or line 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.580
 it's the feeling 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.010
 and ready which of the horses and can complete their delay of 12 30 rock is the 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.910
 second layer 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.530
 one hour you can pick up a similar case you know well here in the house if 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.669
 not looking for a medium that did not take long 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.089
 if you do not have 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:17.769
 then clearly on horseback weeds the first two layers so resolved but 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.929
 you see the 15 that is not resolved then giving place to the pasture 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:22.829
 and livestock 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.119
 What crack will you do to fix this? 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.829
 if one of the formulas is to be manufactured, for example in order that 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.009
 This means you have to come here. 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.459
 then make the right formula of the photo the right formula 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.829
 line the line 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.619
 is to follow with your feet 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.190
 first to the team 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.190
 so if you follow that the other side also left 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.870
 so you do the same thing the line again makes the formula 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.029
 yes it's the line r the line 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:55.189
 I preferred 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.199
 kf 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.679
 and ready 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.619
 You have peace, take a case like this. 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.429
 Henry these two are not solved. 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:06.569
 and has no soul and in the top layer 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.759
 that you have not checked per week 

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:13.609
 only that it has not exaggerated these two to which they changed of position 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.209
 This red and green medium has to come here. 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.079
 That's not even red and blue. I've come here. 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.419
 how does it repair in the same way as the previous case 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.419
 You pretend to get in here and apply formulas. 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:31.369
 so I thought about coming here and the one she left 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.419
 if he positions himself he makes the right formula 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.929
 came to stop here 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:42.179
 put or else the call that the market left there 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:45.179
 Position the right phone 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.039
 and complete the first two layers 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.569
 now she has to learn to do next time you will have to learn 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.629
 to do crocodile tide 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.429
 does she stay like this? 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.189
 so until then, what happy 2010 for all
