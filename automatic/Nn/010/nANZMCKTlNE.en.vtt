00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
going so I always say the real work

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.740 
going so I always say the real work
starts<00:00:34.380> when<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.490> drafted<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.420> what

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
starts when you be drafted it's not what

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.390 
starts when you be drafted it's not what
got<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.260> how<00:00:37.560> you<00:00:37.620> want<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.250> the

got you as how you want you know the

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:50.709 
got you as how you want you know the
effective

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.930 

they<00:00:51.260> would<00:00:51.440> go<00:00:51.620> with<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.219> teams<00:00:52.489> you<00:00:52.730> don't

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
they would go with the teams you don't

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.240 
they would go with the teams you don't
there's<00:00:53.420> only<00:00:53.570> short<00:00:54.500> amount<00:00:54.710> of<00:00:54.739> time<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:54.980> you

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
there's only short amount of time so you

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.279 
there's only short amount of time so you
thought<00:00:55.399> this<00:00:55.670> can't<00:00:55.910> show<00:00:56.239> your<00:00:56.780> athleticism

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
thought this can't show your athleticism

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.360 
thought this can't show your athleticism
as<00:00:57.739> much<00:00:57.980> but<00:00:58.609> I<00:00:58.910> definitely<00:00:59.420> feel<00:00:59.780> like<00:01:00.370> I'm

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
as much but I definitely feel like I'm

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.999 
as much but I definitely feel like I'm
good<00:01:01.670> in<00:01:01.789> that<00:01:01.969> area<00:01:02.329> I<00:01:02.530> can<00:01:03.530> still<00:01:03.680> be<00:01:03.829> better

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
good in that area I can still be better

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.680 
good in that area I can still be better
than<00:01:04.190> that<00:01:04.220> soon<00:01:04.549> that's<00:01:05.299> something<00:01:05.600> you

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
than that soon that's something you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.960 
than that soon that's something you
really<00:01:05.720> don't<00:01:06.170> need<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.680> show<00:01:06.890> as<00:01:07.070> much<00:01:07.280> they

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
really don't need to show as much they

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.550 
really don't need to show as much they
really<00:01:08.240> want<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.479> see<00:01:08.840> how<00:01:08.990> things<00:01:09.170> fit<00:01:09.409> into
