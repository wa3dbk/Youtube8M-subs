00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.320
 taste and good sense our guest 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.929

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.539
 the most important national and international 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.670
 so commercial residential projects 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.930
 hospital hoteliers like royal 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.820
 palm plaza hotel 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.460
 Let's talk to the architect today. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.710
 urbanist and interior designer 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.130
 this sympathy sérgio de oliveira all 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.680
 well very good sérgio here in our 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:40.079
 program in the series of your 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.690
 hotel and hospital projects 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.219
 require of you a constant search for 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.309
 right products that meet the needs 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.289
 such as metals 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.199
 how do you rate the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.960
 The advance of this market is actually the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.989
 when the project has a series 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.780
 conditioning a serious and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.969
 elements that give us the project 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.100
 was to get us the whole question of 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.220
 materials the whole question of modernism 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.260
 functionality and all new 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.720
 product trends that appear on the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.580
 every day at our disposal 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.610
 so we always need to be 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.950
 attentive and alert with 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.150
 products that comes to the surface each month 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.490
 that office 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.189
 so in fact today we have a 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.680
 conditioning is more about the issue of a 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.259
 body interfere with projects that are 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.490
 this subject alone is the subject 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.500
 sustainability that is already 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.770
 because I know it 's an item to 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.619
 more than the professional designer 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.170
 need to as a 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.840
 work he has to pay attention to what 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.490
 the world opened them for that I 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.310
 I would not say it 's a trend in the market 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.619
 a new mindset is a necessity 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.020
 we survive the country that people 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.970
 You know but not only does water have 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.250
 sustained is not 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.720
 in principle I was going to say this to you as 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.770
 I have a very big concern. 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.080
 with the question is right then economy 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.540
 treatment the way you collect the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.850
 water as the Hindus by the whole project 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.520
 everything you prepare the project for 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.350
 be suitable for you to spend less 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.050
 water because it has a treatment 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.600
 water only better then only 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.910
 in hotels and hospitals but hotels 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.870
 that much more than the hotel spending military 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.910
 now it's exists with this for me 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.820
 save water I have to get the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.000
 I have how much the product that 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.010
 provides not only the two 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.920
 are the records are the taps are 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.820
 equipment that is designed with 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.220
 today we have a functionality 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.310
 good with a production of comfort 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.350
 excellent and a reduction in consumption 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.750
 excellent I still do not understand 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.120
 now sure as you said it is not 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.790
 just water concern 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.670
 we are concerned about the economy of 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.860
 the economy of temperature or 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.790
 consume less air conditioning then we 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.519
 we have to adjust our project 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.640
 remembering the cross or white relations 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.269
 shadows very well located the building 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.030
 in relation to the insolation it has to be 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.130
 very unhealthy but it can not be 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.300
 super heated because you spend so much 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.580
 air conditioning 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.340
 you spend more energy then we have 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.860
 to take care of is that the energy 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.350
 is sustainability that there are 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.720
 various items that we have concern 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.120
 in the hotel 's deployment because they are 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.350
 personal papers if you are thinking like 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.900
 Are you going to solve the coverages? 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.690
 buildings because you have to have 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.310
 a lot a year for you to receive the 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.790
 plates and conditional 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.700
 you will have to have a system of 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.310
 great for mada senna jens for you 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.160
 have a system of 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.590
 considers that it is effective that 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.930
 very economical so we will have a 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.690
 bath with a quality of a volume of 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.310
 very bad water when in fact you do not 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.620
 it's falling out of that 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.299
 you and you have this result with the 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.700
 modern equipment that business 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:24.520
 decide and provide 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:26.710
 technology is then in residence until z 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.600
 750 meters you have to have the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.460
 sustainability concern 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.440
 now imagine in projects of high 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.620
 that you consume many 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.270
 products that you consume a volume of 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.250
 very large water keeps itself as 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.140
 exactly needed an energy 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.690
 very high power all this you have 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.050
 that reduce the more you reduce 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.510
 these primary items of comfort but 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.210
 being sustainable guess where the 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.940
 people do the emphasis is well as a 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.940
 our project and with things need 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.530
 be applied to you to have a good 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.540
 result 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.090
 what product the architect sérgio oliveira 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.750
 specific and mental 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.530
 The question is true, I must know the 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.960
 delta 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.860
 I have only specified the products of 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.770
 Delta is what led me to conclude all 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.010
 this issue more rapidly on the 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.900
 saving of water on the results and 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.980
 comfortable that the material can 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.410
 provide 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.510
 were the products of the inside knowledgeable 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.790

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.460
 seeing what their proposal is in relation to 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.610
 the first news show all that 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.290
 It also happens if Sergio thank you very much
