00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.529
 hello how are you welcome back to me 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.329
 I'm already here and you know I've 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.520
 been without recording again I have not 

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:12.220
 had time between practices and we have 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.590
 taken a little bit for I'm with other 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.710
 practices but good today I have taken 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.509
 time between when I was eating and I'm going to 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.310
 go then took a little bit and I'm going to make you 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.310
 the summer favorites video 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.420
 The first thing they teach you is 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.420
 moisturizer of bioderma is the night series 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.420
 for oily skin with acne tendency 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.390
 or like mine - pretty good 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.820
 I did not get any pimples on the 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.190
 I had quite a bit not new 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.840
 is the moisturizer of my life always 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.989
 I say that not yet against mira dante 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.489
 and trying this one I also tell you that it has 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.080
 found but the truth is that it's going 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.170
 very well and that's why I used it is the 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.540
 first that I actually spend like this from a 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.100
 pull because I alternate creams or 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.600
 beckham if I'm a month so this one 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.170
 he liked it a lot 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.500
 is also using my base of 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.659
 favorite makeup bam and this 17th 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.820
 that is worn out when all this 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.860
 you will see they are finished but he has been 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.909
 using then to cover me when 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.530
 I needed a little more coverage 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.600
 especially when I was going to work a 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.580
 Saturday or when he even left on a Saturday 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.760
 because he did not work that he had something used 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.220
 I have not worked 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.770
 good and for when I worked mostly 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.070
 daily they used the studies fix 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.350
 mac powder that is the same as the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.200
 sejov including a foundation 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.070
 but in this case there is beige polo 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.090
 the tone 13 the c4 has changed the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.360
 mac numbering because that c4 I gave myself 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.250
 account now and nothing comes with your typical 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.140
 good sponge you already know her and the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.800
 used for that because it gave me good 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.030
 coverage and also I did not weigh so much in 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.700
 the skin as the liquid base does not 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.580
 melted so I like it too I've 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.790
 been using the powders 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.860
 tanning lagoons of nash that are 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.530
 these here and good already knows them and is 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.210
 so that to outline me especially 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.570
 the face especially in the area of 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:16.110
 cheeks and also the uad in ars like 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.630
 Blusher is using mostly the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.620
 master of nash that for me is a rouge 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:25.290
 fetish in fact has come to see me at 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.610
 time a subscriber and here is the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.050
 greeting is called pink 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.200
 and I have recommended it because it is very 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.190
 more fetish then we go little things 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.290
 corrector has been used otherwise 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.750
 has spent is that this has been a 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.360
 spending but not to be but from 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.170
 phoenix studio products with if you 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.490
 mack nrc 30 well I was not there 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.890
 I know with a signal but it is a proofreader 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.590
 creamy that covers very well and I am 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.060
 using mostly for granites 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.709
 marquitas granitos etcetera that go the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:03.209
 mascara black elixir de jean 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.890
 is a little bit poor because I do not know very 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.330
 deteriorated because he was wearing it in 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.860
 bag and I used it a lot I liked it 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.340
 a lot because he has a knife 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.780
 silicone as you see almost almost in the form of 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.080
 and they have a formula that has a 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.450
 texture very very easy to work that 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.750
 more little things been using then another 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.459
 thing for the eyes the prebase 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.810
 it's called line crime the evidence of the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.150
 line that I did not get the name of the 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.480
 mark how good is this aspect of 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.959
 here is a creampie now it is no longer like that and 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.980
 intimidated her and nothing I love is the one 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.560
 better I can stand the shadows 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.920
 then shadows being of them the naked 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.569
 2 above all is the palette that most 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.280
 solitude or indeed in the palette as it 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.710
 I usually give my life I love it if you have 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.170
 the opportunity to buy them 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.370
 is augmented with the basic naked 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.700
 exact visitors something to take it 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.190
