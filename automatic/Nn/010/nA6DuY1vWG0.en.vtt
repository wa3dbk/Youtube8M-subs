00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.920
 m 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.570
 in fact i'm neither in egypt 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.680
 French Reverend I was ten years old 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.990
 I had difficulties in French 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.360
 so i went back to cfaa because 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.189
 afterwards it's hard for me to be in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.270
 lice main residence of the college for 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.729
 what I wanted to do was called 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.000
 early childhood and so I did the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.039
 steps for us from gd to internship and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.520
 then look hard enough to alternate 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:32.679
 schools and internships geneva tuesday 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.119
 colleges where there was a lot of 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.039
 battles and other gambling halls 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.950
 favorite come try to learn to 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.780
 rework the professor of the year 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.939
 last they advised me to go 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.710
 directly your professional facts 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.090
 I already had my project I am 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.179
 worries at school I was doing myself in 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.459
 send back schools I was doing myself I 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.530
 was doing stupid things I insulted 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.740
 times teachers what is not the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.740
 case here 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.950
 it's not not like school because 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.490
 that already beyond not the impression of being 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.430
 to be locked in a college of those 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.550
 tall buildings and then if it's a 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.980
 small building and 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.470
 a modest modesty and a garden like him 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.290
 it's just like a house the class 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.540
 did not do everything alone and even project it does 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.130
 so that actually makes us meet 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.410
 full of people who live in the same 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.390
 place we feel a little better people 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.950
 as in college there is less material 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.940
 it's easier to learn because 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.680
 that we are less numerous in 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.390
 low classes here it's better 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.040
 already we learn quickly there is less 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.170
 titled world but I had good 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.760
 notes so I 'm alive cookies 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.830
 but I think it's easier a 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.690
 little my courses I understand better 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.520
 we have good teachers so that's why 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.940
 the teachers they have more implicitly 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.610
 many and profit and to embarrass us 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.440
 Kuriles are they are more suitable 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.880
 to us they are more animated than at 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.340
 college is not at all the same 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.630
 atmosphere that in colleges there are 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.550
 less teachers 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.260
 on the other hand the atmosphere with the teachers and 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.570
 the best and I play sports every 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.180
 days sports that allows us to 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.570
 decompress late for ol and sport that 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.060
 important to be fair with 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.150
 other teams and our team 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.410
 baseball is what we need 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.410
 to be in team and solidarity 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.340
 I choose plumbing what I have a 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.980
 missing the plumbers of my life that you have 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.459

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.250
 debate that offend with children 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.970
 for now I would like to be 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.330

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.500
 better for me I do not like the too much 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.710

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.460
