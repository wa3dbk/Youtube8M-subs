00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.490
 Hello everyone Hello, I have introduced the iPhone 6 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:13.050
 I was jailed. 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:17.400
 I'm going to find out briefly about Fang 9 Eve installed with cd. 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:22.140
 The harbor is marked with a blue icon in the middle , touch the app 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.520
 When you enter, the first main screen shows the version and release date 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.530
 And I can communicate with the developers who made the announcements and advertisements provided by Fang 9 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.099
 There is a feedback section 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:36.420
 Actually, I do not have much to see on the first screen. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.560
 What you need to look at is the utility located at the bottom center 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.520
 Part of it. 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:47.280
 If you go to the utility section, when you use the icon silently, 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.100
 I'm not there to capture the sound jp Chile sikhaehyeong on the top Yano Seto 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.190
 Activate the sound part 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.190
 You can touch Reboot of System Princess at the bottom. 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.380
 Ah 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:11.040
 After getting lost can be sure that the camera negative reboot am 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.810
 When you take a picture, do not let people know when you take a picture. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.810
 I like the fact that 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:30.740
 Of course, I would never do that, but I never act illegally with my camera. 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.740
 I hope you do not 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:40.430
 The next thing to check is the camera shopper on the bottom of the open ssh 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.860
 For the first part of indeyo go put that part that says change 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.190
 You need to change the number. 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.200
 You can change it to a number that the sender can remember . 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.660
 The reason I need to set an open shl number is that iOS 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.310
 This could create a security hole in your device 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:02.330
 For example , when you connect to a public WiFi that uses free from outside 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:06.860
 The secret of knowing the open ssh's car is 10 because it can extract information 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:11.330
 I think we can change the number to prevent a bit of information leakage. 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:15.500
 The system hangs below it, such as re-spring size reboot to choose 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.510
 I am using this spring as a refresh rate for your computer. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.260
 I think you can look at it. 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.190
 In other words, the reboot is literally kicking down the reboot 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.270
 If such a review in the fourth one the list of locations when you touch 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.990
 Only an alarm called a list of rebuilds is displayed , and no change of machine occurs 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:37.370
 It 's hard to tell exactly what this is. 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:42.260
 And the bottom part is that if you're using an iOS device, 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.459
 Data on features similar to diagnostics stored in the machine when an error occurs 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.480
 I'll let you. 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:52.120
 Certificate data, such as you just talk about it. I erased cause problems on machines 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.120
 No, I do not think so.
