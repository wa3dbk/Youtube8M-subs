00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:28.599
 hello everyone 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.250
 in the rocket video just in case 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.300
 you did not see it and well without more 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.610
 nothing to say 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.300
 let's start this analysis of Bergeois weapons 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.239
 gamer 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.059
 let's start with the famous assault rifle 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.890
 human has 32 bullets per charger 256 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.870
 bullet in total and has a rifle without 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.930
 skill is to tell anyone what 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.850
 can easily use or manipulate now 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.920
 very good guys sensor to analyze the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.219
 advantages and disadvantages of this beautiful 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.870
 weapon and this human weapon signs anything 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.280
 to say as I said earlier to be 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.710
 very easy to manipulate 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.079
 you can use it easily as you want 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.030
 do anything you need me 16 bullets to 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.860
 to be able to kill his opponent and give him the 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.560
 shield and firing on the body the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.179
 Recharge lasts between 1 points 92 points 10 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.820
 seconds approximately in the recharge 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:15.820
 it is divided in half with dexterity if 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.770
 for 9.35 paras per second and per 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.080
 supposedly nothing else calculating needs 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.909
 as 12 points 67 seconds 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.070
 approximately to be able to keep alive 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.820
 this weapon like the other submachine gun has 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.740
 assistant 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.270
 the aim is you do not have to aim 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.580
 precisely to be able to kill his 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.290
 opponent a curious fact with this weapon 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.210
 especially after killing two 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.820
 people with a charger without any 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.460
 problem now very 22 something to be 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.100
 flaw is in the distance and good 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.590
 it's time to use this weapon called rifle 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.170
 storm nothing else has 150 bullets in 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.210
 total is perfect for campaign for is 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.310
 part in apps and honestly I do not care 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.380
 being really does not tell them much this 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.119
 weapon because it is not very special compared 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.950
 with the other two now is to analyze the 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.440
 Advantage and sale of this beautiful weapon 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.450
 9 ticos nothing way these 16 bullets for 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.850
 kill your opponent the same as he gets 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.350
 assault human being is perfect for 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.509
 shields is to say if you are attacking 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.759
 fences I can easily use it to give 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.140
 hit and kill your opponent now very 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.060
 well as the others do not crash is 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.190
 this weapon has assistance in the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.110
 aim is not exactly you have 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.269
 to aim well to be able to send others 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.459
 with them now very well guys are 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.230
 this weapon especially has a 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.180
 expansion of two vehicles that do not 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.530
 negatively affect the weapon or 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.840
 differentials 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.360
 it can be is firing like crazy 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.080
 and even then it does not affect you more negatively 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.550
 as you want to see this weapon is very 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.490
 fast compared to the assault rifle 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.730
 but it cools down very quickly 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.709
 cooling is hard as between 293 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.120
 points 20 seconds approximately that 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.239
 it's enough for your opponent to 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.730
 can kill quickly now very well 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.800
 guys really this weapon is more or 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.010
 less effective in the distance if 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.640
 you aim more or less but even if it's a 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.830
 little cash 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.230
 now very well guys it's time to be 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.630
 our last gun suppressor rifle has 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.490
 48 bullets per creator has 192 bullets in 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.390
 total approximately and incredibly 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.430
 fast in my opinion is excellent 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.620
 perfect for trolling people online for 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.660
 your website now it's time to release the 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.730
 advantages and disadvantages of this weapon nothing 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.160
 more you need oil bullets to kill or 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.080
 to destroy your opponent is really 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.050
 very fast and a little difficult to handle 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.790
 in my opinion the reticle expands 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.190
 Too much is to say you have to have 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.560
 care where they shoot you have little or 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.630
 long distance competition in the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.220
 mentalization is so fast that it can 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.620
 kill our enemies really fast 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.239
 if you have a very good aim now 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.800
 very good boy is armed like the 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.570
 other machine guns have the existence 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.980
 in pointing that is to say you do not need 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.360
 precisely shoot well to be able 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.610
 kill your opponent 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.350
 Recharge lasts between two points 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.970
 set approximately 50 seconds and 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.550
 when you are in the recharge it is divided by 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.530
 half you have to be is like it is 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.100
 practically super powerful but a 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.170
 little weak and in my opinion this weapon 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.850
 ethics in distance is really a 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.500
 shit in the distance and if it was 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.960
 pointing from afar as if it were a 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.300
 of m &amp; r you're bullshit thinking this 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.730
 smart now very good guys is 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.980
 time of the new section versus we are going to 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.970
 compare the three weapons at the same time 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.250
 first of all the assault rifle 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.380
 can kill a person in 1.64 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.330
 seconds approximately the reflector 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.760
 Mind can kill someone in a 1.67 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.190
 seconds approximately and finally 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.830
 suppressor you can kill here in 1.31 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.630
 seconds approximately is to say that the 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.790
 suppressor rifle channel 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.770
