notice now I don't read music as I said
so<00:02:38.180> I've<00:02:38.510> constructed<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.560> little<00:02:39.860> little<00:02:40.220> kind

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
so I've constructed a little little kind

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.600 
so I've constructed a little little kind
of<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:40.970> childish<00:02:41.630> thing<00:02:41.770> or<00:02:42.770> I'll<00:02:42.890> put<00:02:43.130> numbers

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
of a childish thing or I'll put numbers

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.150 
of a childish thing or I'll put numbers
so<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:43.910> I'll<00:02:44.210> remember<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.080> one<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.860> five

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
so that I'll remember it so one and five

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.330 
so that I'll remember it so one and five
is<00:02:46.520> an<00:02:46.670> example<00:02:47.090> at<00:02:47.360> C<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.810> G<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.860> when<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.040> see<00:02:49.310> a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
is an example at C and G so when I see a

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.270 
is an example at C and G so when I see a
one<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.640> know<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:50.030> hit<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.690> cenote<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.440> when<00:02:52.250> I

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
one I know I hit the cenote and when I

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.820 
one I know I hit the cenote and when I
hit<00:02:52.460> the<00:02:52.520> five<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:53.300> know<00:02:53.540> that's<00:02:53.960> that's<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.560> G

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
hit the five I I know that's that's a G

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.190 
hit the five I I know that's that's a G
as<00:02:55.100> I<00:02:55.490> say<00:02:55.700> it's<00:02:55.880> kind<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.150> childish<00:02:56.600> but<00:02:57.110> it

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
as I say it's kind of childish but it

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.280 
as I say it's kind of childish but it
works<00:02:57.410> because<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:58.790> way<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:58.970> remember<00:02:59.120> at<00:03:00.080> any

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
works because that way I remember at any

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.080 
works because that way I remember at any
rate<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.710> song<00:03:01.040> that<00:03:01.070> I've<00:03:01.490> written<00:03:01.670> for
