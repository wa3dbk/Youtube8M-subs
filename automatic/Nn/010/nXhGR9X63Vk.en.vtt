 Hi, I came here today to show you 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.869
 How do you make a simple bread pudding? 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.939
 I'm not going to show because I just 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.619
 wake up and I'm not in suits 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.290
 appropriate is good 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.270
 and if you see any car noise 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.829

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:36.969

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.020

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.610
 I already put the eggs, new lines to 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:34.140
 condensed milk boy 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:59.090

00:01:47.240 --> 00:02:00.979
 milk and sugar 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.189

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.759
 We're the last to dissolve and nuns 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.759

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.040
 now let's hit everything 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.000
 So people in my mix of mine 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.370
 blender was very 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.010
 so what I did I separated a little 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.320
 a liquid is not 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:54.959
 Now I'll mix some bread for 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:58.530

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.709
 bread right 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.050
 now you see inside that I 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.640
 I put the grated coconut but I'm going to hit only 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.640
 a little bit so he can not undo 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:35.380
 now I'm going to start the fire for me 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:42.210
 I hate sugar right here. 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.210
 Fire did not move 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.260
