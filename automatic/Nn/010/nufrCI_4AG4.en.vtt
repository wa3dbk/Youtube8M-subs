00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.690
 passing by garbage cans saw suddenly 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.170

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.320

 the owner of the channel with the instruction itself 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.560
 see flotation that's why 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.220
 demonstrate such interesting 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.619
 characteristic means for those years things like 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.110
 Here is the translation of Norman as a pencil 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.020
 handwritten translation functional 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.340
 assignment of key key organs 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.380
 radio control 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.159
 solid such a detailed book 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.810
 beautifully written goodly 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.110
 everything is in English and some more 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.560
 other languages in principle the most detailed 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.689
 manual 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.299
 it can not but rejoice says 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.610
 about the seriousness of the Japanese production 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.360
 not even the most 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.710
 important household appliances and so 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.399
 cassette deck 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.719
 sony silent 5 years of release you are 970 my 984 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.369
 as you see the release period is enough 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.079
 big accordingly 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.200
 what can be said then what was k 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.100
 claimed here but the Japanese were allowed 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.780
 awesome just 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.930
 grand number of tape decks in 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.710
 including their own equipment 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.680
 5 episodes kay 5 further there I looked at 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.780
 catalogs there nemer just 5 drops 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.390
 from 1 to 50 to fifty five five hundred 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.820
 fifty five five hundred some 5000 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.120
 very much here they are principle like 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.890
 here is their allegiance successful that what 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.890
 Nastya represents once again technically 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.670
 this is single-engine means single-engine 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.980
 a device that has two heads 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.460
 pass-through channel no universal and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.820
 erasing it accordingly 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.310
 one movement speed 4 track record 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.800
 2 in one direction 2 in another that is 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.850
 stereo stereo 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.580
 cassette deck equipped system 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.290
 noise reduction dolby 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.600
 two-level for those times very 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.610
 let's say such a progressive step on 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.200
 I remember in those days in the Soviet Union fell 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.480
 arel cassette deck 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.620
 black such a coffin healthy and rue 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.450
 pretty good let's say deque with 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.460
 horizontal position on the table 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.730
 table plan cassette there was also 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.430
 horizontally and vertically not here 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.870
 But sony is already up to how beautiful 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.610
 aluminum case very neat 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.690
 brilliant things defiantly unchanged 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.410
 delight in our consumers look 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.360
 happy owners 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.970
 please see these tarts 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.780
 brilliant as they are neat after all 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.250
 and in general is presentable even now 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.170
 have not lost their say so 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.300
 aesthetic values ​​she will you agree 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.840
 though not the control pedal here is 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.030
 there are no sensors that is what keys 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.920
 pressed by hand which so to speak 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.770
 drive all mode tape broach 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.230
 it all works soft and pleasant to create 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.120
 how to open the lid characteristic 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.610
 sound smoothly opens cathine cover 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.510
 receivers later than so many years 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.910
 operation thrown in the trash keys 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.290
 of course commemorated like keys in 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.799
 of our fatherland tape recorder 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.680
 radio engineering for the technician from there them so 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.260
 say and received an inheritance 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.960
 all work all before your radio 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.200
 found it happens comrades were not 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.060
 quite regularly of course as it turned out 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.430
 showed hide and just need 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.910
 it was throw not even broke just 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.740
 hopping down flat main apiary 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.090
 rather scarce such plastic he 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.470
 several times the body but nonetheless 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.410
 what works now what you can 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.480
 make sure that the sound does not pull beautiful 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.150
 engine speed adjustment 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.610
 but also this one was not broken 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.200
 key key 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.940
 records rather not the shank itself you 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.710
 keys located inside the magnet 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.479
 had to completely disassembled on 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.340
 Stretching to the more mannitol was not 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.490
 with all the screws was semi-assembled a 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.400
 this broach dangled then fastened 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.340
 here and accordingly fix this 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.220
 glue key and shank superglue 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.410
 they are all kinds of perverted there with 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.960
 drank about him supporting details for 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.320
 this shank here we were still broken 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.210
 this cap is not an interesting system 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.150
 the cassette compartment is cramming this lid we 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.850
 get access to parts nodes 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.500
 tape mechanism right now 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.500
 sorry for the sharpness somehow
