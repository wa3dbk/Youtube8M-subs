00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.170
 tutorial of California wicks 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.990
 l'oréal are three tonalities that I'm going 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.720
 to show next 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.289
 and well the idea is that you open 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.849
 different effects can be done from a 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.300
 Very subtle flow and very high summit dates 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.460
 subtle contrasts or degraded in 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.860
 Here I'll do what has 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.570
 indicated me as I already told you in 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.390

 hair dye is that I have 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.390
 brought thousands of internal tones gives me 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.550
 afraid to experiment and Cuba with the hair 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.320
 then this product is highly anticipated 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.049
 also for me because I want to give 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.809

 very important the Californians of 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.670
 l'oréal is not a dye as such it is a 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.090
 Hair bleaching is exactly what 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.400

 and I'm going to apply the product in 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.200
 brush directly on the arm 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.200
 making sure it looks good 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.900
 saturated 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.400
 well saturated does not prompt to use the 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.209
 product cut but also camera 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.209
 according to your home 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:32.230
 and in the middle this is very important 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.530
 live it right in the middle so that I 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:40.270
 they have for daughters at the same level all 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.190
 my facts already after some some 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.030
 especially because they can do but at 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.840
 final and I'll start to take my hair 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.840
 from the bottom 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:57.090
 and it will never be 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.090
 very good but with bow with this part 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.900
 I'm going from the jaw area 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.900
 down 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.270
 you simply owe it to pass the ctv 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.310
 making sure it is well covered 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.530
 and so 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:51.360
 it was then until time is 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:56.270
 important is that it is not super intense 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.270
 the extreme discoloration to the maximum 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:08.230
 and I will then wait time 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.200
 pits and then I will wash everything 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.920
 my hair and I will apply in the areas 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.920
 of red 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.490
 Well this is the final result after 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.850
 of the Californian's indication of 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.850
 strawberries 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.750
 little was not left the father feels express 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.979
 It is important to emphasize that each of 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.229
 you to get a result 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:37.830

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.000
 natural growth what from here to means 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:54.210

 very dramatic it was very noticeable in the 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.529
 difference 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.859
 of the dark 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:20.740
 going down to the tone more than those 

00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:22.720
