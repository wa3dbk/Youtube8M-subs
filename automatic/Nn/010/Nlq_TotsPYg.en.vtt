00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
frame is a honey frame so they're gonna

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.840 
frame is a honey frame so they're gonna
continue<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.979> down<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.580> they're<00:01:05.729> gonna

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
continue this down and they're gonna

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.690 
continue this down and they're gonna
make<00:01:06.060> honey<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.860> also<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.520> any

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
make honey in here also you have any

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.310 
make honey in here also you have any
closed<00:01:09.030> area<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.810> where<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.170> put

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
closed area here where you can put

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260 
closed area here where you can put
thymol<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.430> put<00:01:11.640> menthol

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
thymol you can put menthol

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.300 
thymol you can put menthol
you<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.720> treat<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> small<00:01:13.350> cell<00:01:13.650> bees<00:01:13.860> for

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
you can treat the small cell bees for

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.880 
you can treat the small cell bees for
you<00:01:15.090> could<00:01:15.270> probably<00:01:15.479> put<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.320> crystals<00:01:16.770> eat

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
you could probably put the crystals eat

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.920 
you could probably put the crystals eat
here<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> run<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.490> high<00:01:17.670> beetles<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.240> all

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
of menthol crystals close it up you'll

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830 
of menthol crystals close it up you'll
never<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.799> trachea<00:01:26.220> Mike<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> want<00:01:27.750> to

there's been studies done that that
people<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.460> had<00:01:35.670> bee<00:01:35.939> hives<00:01:36.240> over<00:01:36.840> climb<00:01:37.170> off

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
people that had bee hives over climb off

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.039 
people that had bee hives over climb off
plants<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.250> was<00:01:38.369> gone<00:01:38.520> fine<00:01:38.909> plants<00:01:39.420> had<00:01:39.810> no

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
plants that was gone fine plants had no

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
plants that was gone fine plants had no
mites<00:01:40.350> that's<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> reasons<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
vapors you got the heat it's also

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.690 
vapors you got the heat it's also
activating<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> crystals<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:47.159> outside
