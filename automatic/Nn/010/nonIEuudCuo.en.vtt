all right and nice and easy

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.330 
all right and nice and easy
so<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.050> you're<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> do<00:01:07.560> on<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.190> other

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
so what you're going to do on the other

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.899 
so what you're going to do on the other
end<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:10.110> strip<00:01:10.800> it

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
end is strip it

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.550 
end is strip it
and<00:01:13.030> then<00:01:13.450> you'll<00:01:13.600> have<00:01:13.750> four<00:01:14.049> different

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
and then you'll have four different

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.870 
and then you'll have four different
wires<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:16.119> one<00:01:17.110> is<00:01:17.290> for<00:01:17.530> one<00:01:18.040> part<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.580> one<00:01:18.759> is

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
wires now one is for one part and one is

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.120 
wires now one is for one part and one is
for<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.180> other<00:01:19.420> which<00:01:20.229> corresponds<00:01:21.100> to

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
for the other which corresponds to

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.340 
for the other which corresponds to
either<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.909> middle<00:01:22.509> of<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.840> jack

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
either the middle of the jack

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.590 
either the middle of the jack
or<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.890> top<00:01:24.130> end<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.430> jack<00:01:24.670> and<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.479> other

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
or the top end of the jack and the other

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.389 
or the top end of the jack and the other
part<00:01:25.899> is<00:01:26.020> just<00:01:26.049> a<00:01:26.350> ground<00:01:26.619> I'm<00:01:27.040> not<00:01:27.100> sure

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
part is just a ground I'm not sure

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.190 
part is just a ground I'm not sure
exactly<00:01:27.640> what<00:01:28.000> order<00:01:28.330> it<00:01:28.450> is<00:01:28.540> but<00:01:28.840> that's

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
exactly what order it is but that's

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.830 
exactly what order it is but that's
really<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:30.820> anybody's<00:01:31.149> concern<00:01:31.540> at<00:01:31.750> the

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
really not anybody's concern at the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.740 
really not anybody's concern at the
moment<00:01:32.280> what<00:01:33.280> you're<00:01:33.430> going<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.640> do<00:01:33.789> is<00:01:34.000> turn

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
moment what you're going to do is turn

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.960 
moment what you're going to do is turn
on<00:01:34.810> your<00:01:35.049> camera

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.440 

and<00:01:38.390> have<00:01:38.570> it<00:01:38.690> plugged<00:01:39.230> in<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:40.300> then<00:01:41.300> you're

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
and have it plugged in and then you're

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.800 
and have it plugged in and then you're
going<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.840> touch<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:43.130> two<00:01:43.310> wires<00:01:43.520> together

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
going to touch the two wires together

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.910 
going to touch the two wires together
you<00:01:44.810> don't<00:01:44.960> get<00:01:45.020> any<00:01:45.170> shocks<00:01:45.410> or<00:01:45.560> anything<00:01:45.680> so

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
you don't get any shocks or anything so

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.100 
you don't get any shocks or anything so
don't<00:01:46.070> worry<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:47.540> you're<00:01:47.660> going<00:01:47.870> to<00:01:47.900> see

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
don't worry and you're going to see

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.350 
don't worry and you're going to see
which<00:01:48.320> one<00:01:48.350> does<00:01:48.560> what<00:01:48.950> one<00:01:48.980> of<00:01:49.670> them<00:01:49.880> will<00:01:50.180> be

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
which one does what one of them will be

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.110 
which one does what one of them will be
a<00:01:50.770> autofocus<00:01:51.770> and<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.640> other<00:01:52.760> one<00:01:52.910> will<00:01:53.090> be

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
a autofocus and the other one will be

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.090 
a autofocus and the other one will be
the<00:01:53.330> shutter<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.230> it's<00:01:54.380> kind<00:01:54.590> of<00:01:54.650> important<00:01:55.070> to

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
the shutter so it's kind of important to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.760 
the shutter so it's kind of important to
figure<00:01:55.490> out<00:01:55.580> which<00:01:55.790> one<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.470> just<00:01:57.620> simply

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
figure out which one so you just simply

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.429 
figure out which one so you just simply
touch<00:01:58.070> them<00:01:58.220> together

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.319 

so<00:02:02.979> it<00:02:03.070> seems<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.759> white<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.210> the

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
so it seems that the white is the

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.630 
so it seems that the white is the
autofocus<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:07.149> red<00:02:08.340> will<00:02:09.340> be<00:02:09.369> the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
autofocus and the red will be the

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.470 
autofocus and the red will be the
shutter<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:12.640> write<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.940> down<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.390> you

know and what you're going to do is I've
purchased<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:17.200> small<00:02:17.769> just<00:02:18.400> plastic<00:02:19.120> box

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
purchased a small just plastic box

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.059 
purchased a small just plastic box
something<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.500> can<00:02:20.620> hold<00:02:20.739> in<00:02:20.920> your<00:02:20.950> hand

something that you can hold in your hand
nice<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.150> easy<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:23.849> two<00:02:24.900> simple<00:02:25.900> switches<00:02:26.140> I

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
nice and easy and two simple switches I

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.210 
nice and easy and two simple switches I
got<00:02:27.790> one<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:29.170> has<00:02:29.319> a<00:02:29.349> bit<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.680> click<00:02:29.920> and

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
got one that has a bit of a click and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.759 
got one that has a bit of a click and
the<00:02:30.280> other<00:02:30.519> one<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.030> has<00:02:31.150> more<00:02:31.569> nice<00:02:32.230> push

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
the other one that has more nice push

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.089 
the other one that has more nice push
feel<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.250> button<00:02:34.680> what<00:02:35.680> I'm<00:02:35.769> going<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:35.950> do

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
feel on the button what I'm going to do

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.220 
feel on the button what I'm going to do
is<00:02:36.250> I'm<00:02:36.370> going<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.549> drill<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.819> hole<00:02:36.880> in<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.989> top

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
is I'm going to drill a hole in the top

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.000 
is I'm going to drill a hole in the top
so<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.680> can<00:02:38.769> have<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.340> on<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:40.269> top<00:02:40.510> here<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
so I can have one on the top here and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.339 
so I can have one on the top here and
then<00:02:42.010> cut<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:42.970> little<00:02:43.150> rectangular<00:02:43.840> piece<00:02:44.080> out

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
then cut a little rectangular piece out

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.500 
then cut a little rectangular piece out
on<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.709> side<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.790> basically<00:02:45.910> what<00:02:46.299> I'll<00:02:46.390> be

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
on the side so basically what I'll be

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.680 
on the side so basically what I'll be
able<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.720> do<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.200> go<00:02:47.739> auto<00:02:48.280> focus<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.030> then

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
able to do is go auto focus and then

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.380 
able to do is go auto focus and then
shutter<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:51.700> would<00:02:51.819> be<00:02:51.910> very<00:02:52.030> simple

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
shutter and that would be very simple

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.970 
shutter and that would be very simple
I'll<00:02:53.170> be<00:02:53.290> right<00:02:53.410> back<00:02:53.590> with<00:02:53.799> that

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
I'll be right back with that

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.210 
I'll be right back with that
so<00:02:54.940> basically<00:02:55.329> I've<00:02:55.959> completed<00:02:56.410> my<00:02:56.500> remote

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
so basically I've completed my remote

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.670 
so basically I've completed my remote
device<00:02:57.519> here<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.630> how<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.049> went<00:02:59.260> about<00:02:59.349> that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
device here and how I went about that

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.830 
device here and how I went about that
was<00:02:59.890> I<00:03:00.099> drilled<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.579> hole<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:00.970> top<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.630> fit

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
was I drilled the hole in the top to fit

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.350 
was I drilled the hole in the top to fit
the<00:03:02.049> button<00:03:02.319> on<00:03:02.410> there

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the button on there

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.630 
the button on there
I<00:03:03.540> took<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:04.200> butter<00:03:04.560> knife<00:03:04.650> put<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.430> hot

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
I took a butter knife put it on a hot

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.570 
I took a butter knife put it on a hot
element<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:07.290> sort<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.590> melted<00:03:07.980> away<00:03:08.070> a

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
element and just sort of melted away a

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.460 
element and just sort of melted away a
little<00:03:09.210> rectangle<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.200> switch

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
little rectangle so that that switch

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.160 
little rectangle so that that switch
there<00:03:10.680> would<00:03:10.860> fit<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.190> then<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.540> drilled

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
there would fit in then I drilled

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.900 
there would fit in then I drilled
another<00:03:13.410> little<00:03:13.680> hole<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.190> bottom<00:03:14.520> so

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
another little hole in the bottom so

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.690 
another little hole in the bottom so
that<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.390> wire<00:03:15.570> can<00:03:15.810> go<00:03:15.960> through<00:03:16.460> and<00:03:17.460> because

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
that the wire can go through and because

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.880 
that the wire can go through and because
it<00:03:17.820> can<00:03:17.910> open<00:03:18.060> up<00:03:18.270> I<00:03:18.450> was<00:03:18.570> able<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.870> wire<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.290> all

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
it can open up I was able to wire it all

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.370 
it can open up I was able to wire it all
nice<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.220> neat<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:22.520> now<00:03:23.520> it's<00:03:23.790> complete

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
nice and neat and now it's complete

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
and just to show you that it works so

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.420 
and just to show you that it works so
once<00:03:29.400> again<00:03:29.520> I<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:30.060> fitted<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:31.680> trigger<00:03:31.980> here

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
once again I I fitted the trigger here

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.820 
once again I I fitted the trigger here
with<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.480> autofocus

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
with the autofocus

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.310 
with the autofocus
and<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.400> do<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.120> shutter<00:03:37.390> it's<00:03:37.810> just<00:03:37.990> a<00:03:38.050> button

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320
