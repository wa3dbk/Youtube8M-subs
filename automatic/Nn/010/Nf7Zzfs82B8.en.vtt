00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.380 
so give that a couple of seconds to dry
and<00:03:29.010> be<00:03:29.130> sure<00:03:29.280> not<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.490> open<00:03:29.880> your<00:03:29.970> eye<00:03:30.000> until

and be sure not to open your eye until

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
it's totally dry because it will

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.980 
it's totally dry because it will
transfer<00:03:32.580> even<00:03:32.820> if<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.000> have<00:03:33.180> Gigantor<00:03:33.810> eyes

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
going to line my bottom lashes and this

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.310 
going to line my bottom lashes and this
doesn't<00:03:42.480> have<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.780> be<00:03:42.870> in<00:03:42.959> any<00:03:43.110> particular

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
doesn't have to be in any particular

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.790 
doesn't have to be in any particular
shape<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.250> be<00:03:44.430> sure<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:44.790> line<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.240> whole

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
shape just be sure you line the whole

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.370 
shape just be sure you line the whole
bottom<00:03:46.800> line<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.240> if<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.750> want<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:49.050> can<00:03:49.200> fill

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380

your waterline in with an actual pencil

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.360 
your waterline in with an actual pencil
because<00:03:52.440> if<00:03:52.650> you<00:03:52.740> try<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:52.980> do<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.190> with<00:03:53.280> the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
because if you try and do it with the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.120 
because if you try and do it with the
liquid<00:03:53.760> it's<00:03:53.970> just<00:03:54.209> gonna<00:03:54.360> smear<00:03:54.840> then<00:03:55.470> I'm

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
liquid it's just gonna smear then I'm

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.400 
liquid it's just gonna smear then I'm
gonna<00:03:56.310> give<00:03:56.459> my<00:03:56.550> lashes<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:57.300> nice<00:03:57.570> coat<00:03:58.170> of

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
gonna give my lashes a nice coat of

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.830 
gonna give my lashes a nice coat of
mascara<00:03:58.730> I'm<00:03:59.730> not<00:04:00.030> gonna<00:04:00.150> do<00:04:00.330> fake<00:04:00.570> lashes

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
mascara I'm not gonna do fake lashes

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.449 
mascara I'm not gonna do fake lashes
with<00:04:01.170> this<00:04:01.320> look<00:04:01.530> because<00:04:01.709> she's<00:04:02.100> not<00:04:02.250> wearing

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
with this look because she's not wearing

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.010 
with this look because she's not wearing
fake<00:04:02.790> lashes<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.330> I<00:04:03.390> think<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.690> just<00:04:03.810> takes

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
fake lashes and I think it just takes

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.710 
fake lashes and I think it just takes
away<00:04:04.260> from<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:05.160> blackness<00:04:05.550> of<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.330> eyeliner

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
away from the blackness of the eyeliner

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.170 
away from the blackness of the eyeliner
and<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.170> think<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:07.500> that's<00:04:07.590> really<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.340> focus

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
and I think that that's really the focus

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.910 
and I think that that's really the focus
of<00:04:09.360> this<00:04:09.630> look<00:04:09.900> now<00:04:10.320> I'm<00:04:10.380> gonna<00:04:10.470> take<00:04:10.620> my<00:04:10.680> red
