00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello dear friends of curiosity 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.640
 next wednesday i will show you how 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.220
 we are embarrassed and we are your friends 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.570
 but can impress for tournaments 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.500
 we need something exactly two poor 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 but we still need something else 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.990
 juggling balls like you guys already 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:33.149
 making dragonfly yourself can show that 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:35.250
 I you today let's go to the balls 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.809
 We need scissors to make things 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.879
 funnels different balloons and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.070
 You can also use flour or 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.379
 milk rice is the first to take that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.489
 we blow the balance to something like this 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.440
 the bucket on so then the balloon comes 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.620
 on the funnel and above the filming the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.180
 sand rows the balloon is natural 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.489
 So fast we push the sand 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.430
 something after getting further up the ball 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.690
 desired size has judges and then 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.420
 cut the ones with the scissors 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.979
 schnitzel from then we take one 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 second balloon cut there too 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.939
 and then set them 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.259
 Be careful about our forest that you 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.259
 no air included 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.030
 and an additional location for more 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.659
 stability 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:38.190
 that's how the whole thing looks like 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.190
 balls are very stable and malleable 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.130
 if now just do it 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.130
 different colored flow 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.230
 Overall, you make at least three 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.850
 piece and then we can at the next 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.400
 start juggling with it 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.960
