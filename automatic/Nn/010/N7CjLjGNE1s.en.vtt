I<00:00:14.730> never<00:00:15.730> looked<00:00:16.120> at<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.390> facilities<00:00:17.080> in<00:00:17.320> an

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
I never looked at the facilities in an

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.859 
I never looked at the facilities in an
in-depth<00:00:18.369> manner<00:00:18.640> and<00:00:19.060> with<00:00:19.090> the<00:00:19.390> same<00:00:19.570> sort

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
in-depth manner and with the same sort

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.260 
in-depth manner and with the same sort
of<00:00:19.990> I<00:00:20.230> that<00:00:20.800> was<00:00:20.830> brought<00:00:21.369> forth<00:00:21.730> by<00:00:21.970> being

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
of I that was brought forth by being

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.830 
of I that was brought forth by being
involved<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:23.710> the<00:00:24.160> committee<00:00:24.580> so<00:00:24.880> much<00:00:25.630> of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
involved with the committee so much of

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.290 
involved with the committee so much of
it<00:00:25.990> was<00:00:26.200> was<00:00:26.710> eye-opening<00:00:26.920> and<00:00:27.580> we<00:00:27.790> received<00:00:28.180> a

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
it was was eye-opening and we received a

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.499 
it was was eye-opening and we received a
lot<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.510> really<00:00:28.990> really<00:00:29.290> good<00:00:29.500> information

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
lot of really really good information

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.780 
lot of really really good information
that<00:00:31.509> had<00:00:31.720> never<00:00:31.930> had<00:00:32.200> access<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.860> or<00:00:33.160> really

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
that had never had access to or really

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.600 
that had never had access to or really
never<00:00:33.970> looked<00:00:34.210> at<00:00:34.329> before<00:00:34.510> either<00:00:35.050> so<00:00:35.590> it<00:00:36.250> was

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
never looked at before either so it was

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.030 
never looked at before either so it was
a<00:00:36.670> great<00:00:36.910> process<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:41.230> became<00:00:41.649> very<00:00:41.680> clear

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
a great process it became very clear

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.680 
a great process it became very clear
that<00:00:42.399> our<00:00:43.030> facilities<00:00:44.430> enable<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:46.240> learning

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
that our facilities enable the learning

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.430 
that our facilities enable the learning
process<00:00:47.160> without<00:00:48.210> really<00:00:49.210> good<00:00:49.480> facilities

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
process without really good facilities

challenges to all of that data but yet
within<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:03.369> many<00:02:03.579> opportunities<00:02:04.329> to<00:02:04.359> make

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
done while on the surface it seems like

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.210 
done while on the surface it seems like
kind<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.340> lot<00:03:03.550> it's<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.330> long-term<00:03:04.800> plan<00:03:05.800> and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
kind of a lot it's a long-term plan and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.880 
kind of a lot it's a long-term plan and
so<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.820> have<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.180> keep<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.600> in<00:03:07.660> mind<00:03:07.990> this

so you have to keep that in mind this

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.840 
so you have to keep that in mind this
investment<00:03:09.520> is<00:03:09.900> absolutely<00:03:10.900> critical<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.980> if

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
we miss this opportunity it won't come
