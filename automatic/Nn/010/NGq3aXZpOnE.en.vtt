00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
in the United States so in actuality it

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.680 
in the United States so in actuality it
sounds<00:03:05.340> crazy<00:03:05.489> but<00:03:05.700> they're<00:03:06.090> promoting

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.820 
falling arches be
as<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.400> cannot<00:03:10.820> have<00:03:11.210> arches<00:03:12.140> after<00:03:12.800> a

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
as you cannot have arches after a

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.850 
as you cannot have arches after a
certain<00:03:13.100> degree<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.550> heights<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:15.440> think

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
certain degree of heights so I think

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.140 
certain degree of heights so I think
