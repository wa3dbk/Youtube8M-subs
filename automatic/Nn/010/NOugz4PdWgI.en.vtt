00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 installation of blinds primarily to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.589
 install iron 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.139
 we need to order since plastic 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.540
 windows and is inserted as individual as 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.210
 the rule size is i.e. blinds need 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.240
 will also be ordered by size 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.240
 plastic window or rather shtapikom 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.750
 of a double-glazed window we take here we see to punish 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.180
 shtapika precisely this we will have width and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.699
 on the edge of this glass because 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.059
 adjoining the frame this we will have 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.610
 height here we ordered our lives she 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.030
 it came to us in this case we see that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.860
 a window of 1000 kcal package and naturally 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.829
 we will need to install 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.710
 three blinds the only thing that will need 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.469
 here pay attention see what 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.949
 these are ours and mounting angles 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.680
 during installation should fall so 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.600
 called matine emptiness and do not interfere 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.600
 blind mechanism 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.199
 so measure out these edge sizes 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.229
 there is a tape measure and everything and you can attach 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.159
 these mounting corners corners are mounted on 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.100
 one tapped internal pre 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.920
 Of course the size is held here so that 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.340
 this corner didn't bother us 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.590
 the mechanism of the blinds and everything happened reduced 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.770
 well, usually there are two and a half there 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.140
 three millimeters and here's a little departing from 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.509
 shtapika set our blinds 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.610
 just screwing the slats and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.280
 we install on one screw of it 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.680
 quite enough rigidity 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.310
 top slat blinds 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.000
 after that to these our top bar 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.270
 catching on first 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.619
 see this far us hook that is to 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.189
 her cyto im the far hook of one corner 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.880
 2 corners 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.820
 and for whom is daddy pulling that side of ours 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.170
 same visit she is flexible and so it springs 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.990
 and closed on this one 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.200
 Neighbor us a parable on the corner here we see 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.500
 we deliver we present yes 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.920
 such a moment and let's say when here 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.260
 see us 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.770
 plastic decorative cap is she 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.590
 interferes we remove snaps and then 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.099
 again and dress truth bothers us with 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.170
 spring up the iron bar to 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.980
 snap this hook here you are 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.230
 they took me off and snapped it all 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.360
 snapped the top bar of the department 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.300
 dissolve our gland and install 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.180
 bottom plastic corners and 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.470
 fact up see we set them up here 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.290
 also below 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.180
 for the beadings on the frame itself on the screw 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.790
 who comes under that 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.700
 blind plugs on the bottom rail 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.890
 done because that's how they are 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.230
 here we see just near lies 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.739
 I have a plastic house free here 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.900
 enters or snaps easy 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.340
 pushing and here's our set 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.519
 blinds all this and iron 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.239
 because here the window was at 3 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.769
 double glazing and it opens 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.650
 naturally on one of 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.260
 double glazing when pay attention 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.500
 window naturally resting 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.829
 ramada rests on the lower bar 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.989
 in this case, and the top if that's all 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.720
 effortlessly as they say as 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.390
 the rule is this is all fine this 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.329
 if you have a window for 3 glass packs you 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.209
 cost the same visa but if you have a window for 2 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.660
 double glazing and sash windows you 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.600
 opens on one of the slopes then 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.090
 I advise you to set the limiter in 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.120
 In this case, I came across such an accident 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.950
 I can put as they say if u 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.609
 there are aces in your household 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.950
 put and see everything here this edge 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.980
 gland and see the bottom bar does not reach 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.489
 until the escarpment thereby without damaging it 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.290
 or here you can put 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.480
 limiter here I took a limiter for 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.220
 2 but he also went well and 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.329
 embarrassed them in this case 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.910
 bottom bracket 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.910
 lower strap iron and almost touches 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:19.220
 slopes thereby not spoiling our slopes 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.280
 see nothing complicated installing iron 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.350
 no this video is recorded to you in order to 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.020
 save your time if you do this 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.680
 never did not see it all 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.680
 goodbye
