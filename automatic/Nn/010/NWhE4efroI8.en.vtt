00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.030 
hey guys mop up here and I want to talk
to<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.830> about<00:00:11.090> stats<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.420> mists<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:12.630> pandaria

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
to you about stats in mists of pandaria

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.609 
to you about stats in mists of pandaria
because<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.309> got<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.820> small<00:00:15.509> insight<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.410> some

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
because I got the small insight and some

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.920 
because I got the small insight and some
stuff<00:00:16.920> like<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.640> checking<00:00:18.270> around<00:00:18.510> on

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
stuff like I was checking around on

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.230 
stuff like I was checking around on
worries<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.640> pages<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.670> stuff<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.180> that

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
worries and pages and stuff like that

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.370 
worries and pages and stuff like that
and<00:00:21.710> I<00:00:22.710> found<00:00:23.160> something<00:00:24.000> interesting<00:00:24.570> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and I found something interesting I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
and I found something interesting I
checked<00:00:25.949> out<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.340> guy<00:00:26.730> who<00:00:27.660> had<00:00:27.869> like

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
checked out this guy who had like

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.040 
checked out this guy who had like
41-percent<00:00:29.400> PV<00:00:30.029> power<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.510> I'm<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.750> how<00:00:30.990> is

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
41-percent PV power and I'm like how is

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.790 
41-percent PV power and I'm like how is
this<00:00:31.199> possible<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.540> I<00:00:33.540> realized<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.500> he's

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
this possible and I realized that he's

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.229 
this possible and I realized that he's
jamming<00:00:35.219> full<00:00:35.460> pv<00:00:35.880> power<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.450> then<00:00:36.719> I'm<00:00:36.960> like

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
jamming full pv power and then I'm like

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.830 
jamming full pv power and then I'm like
why<00:00:39.239> not<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:41.390> you're<00:00:42.390> going<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
why not do that like you're going to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.650 
why not do that like you're going to
lose<00:00:42.989> some<00:00:43.230> strength<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.270> maybe<00:00:45.270> some

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
lose some strength and maybe some

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
lose some strength and maybe some
resilience<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.800> end<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> day<00:00:47.370> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
resilience but at the end of the day you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
resilience but at the end of the day you
the<00:00:48.059> guy<00:00:48.329> has<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.690> ten<00:00:49.500> percent<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.280> or<00:00:51.379> even

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the guy has like ten percent of or even

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.590 
the guy has like ten percent of or even
more<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> think<00:00:52.860> twelve<00:00:53.219> percent<00:00:53.670> more<00:00:54.270> pvp

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
more I think twelve percent more pvp

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.350 
more I think twelve percent more pvp
power<00:00:54.840> than<00:00:55.320> anyone<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.070> means<00:00:56.370> twelve

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
power than anyone this means twelve

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.750 
power than anyone this means twelve
percent<00:00:57.690> more<00:00:57.989> damage<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.739> twelve<00:00:59.399> percent

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
percent more damage and twelve percent

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.280 
percent more damage and twelve percent
more<00:01:00.149> healing<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:01.670> ad<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:03.090> PvP<00:01:03.629> situations

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
more healing on ad on PvP situations

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.160 
more healing on ad on PvP situations
that's<00:01:05.010> even<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.939> lose<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.420> ten<00:01:06.750> percent

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that's even if you lose like ten percent

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.370 
that's even if you lose like ten percent
strength<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.460> still<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> game<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.240> PvP<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
strength that is still a game in PvP so

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.250 
strength that is still a game in PvP so
you<00:01:10.439> don't<00:01:10.740> really<00:01:11.010> care<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.659> if<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.869> lost<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you don't really care if if you lost a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.870 
you don't really care if if you lost a
ten<00:01:13.439> percent<00:01:13.590> saying<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.159> you're<00:01:14.640> not

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
ten percent saying which you're not

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.370 
ten percent saying which you're not
going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.330> lose<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.509> much<00:01:15.869> you're<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
going to lose that much you're going to

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.640 
going to lose that much you're going to
lose<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.710> three<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.250> four<00:01:17.310> percent<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.000> even

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
lose like three or four percent not even

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.690 
lose like three or four percent not even
so<00:01:19.650> yeah<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.820> thinking<00:01:22.159> what<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.490> could

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so yeah was thinking what if you could

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.050 
so yeah was thinking what if you could
maximize<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.630> even<00:01:25.080> more<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> thought<00:01:26.909> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
maximize that even more so I thought of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.499 
maximize that even more so I thought of
a<00:01:27.150> way<00:01:27.360> which<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.920> blacksmith<00:01:29.460> like<00:01:30.329> as

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
a way which is going blacksmith like as

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.710 
a way which is going blacksmith like as
you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:32.659> I<00:01:34.009> throughout

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
you can see here I I throughout

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.539 
you can see here I I throughout
jewelcrafting<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.549> engineering

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
jewelcrafting and engineering

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.020 
jewelcrafting and engineering
engineering<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:40.220> weird<00:01:41.220> thing<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.820> not

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
engineering is a weird thing it's not

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.940 
engineering is a weird thing it's not
that<00:01:42.240> good<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.509> our<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.869> any<00:01:43.049> more<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.439> more<00:01:43.770> of

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that good in our in any more is more of

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
that good in our in any more is more of
a<00:01:44.040> BG<00:01:44.490> thing<00:01:44.759> i<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.180> been<00:01:45.360> using<00:01:45.630> engineering

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
a BG thing i have been using engineering

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.359 
a BG thing i have been using engineering
in<00:01:46.590> bg's<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:48.509> an<00:01:48.829> expansion<00:01:49.829> because<00:01:50.070> i

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
in bg's for like an expansion because i

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.789 
in bg's for like an expansion because i
don't<00:01:50.610> find<00:01:51.470> engineering<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:54.380> skilled<00:01:55.380> kind<00:01:55.680> of

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
don't find engineering a skilled kind of

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.459 
don't find engineering a skilled kind of
thing<00:01:56.100> i<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.420> i<00:01:57.450> watch<00:01:57.719> people<00:01:57.990> movies

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
thing i like when i watch people movies

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.770 
thing i like when i watch people movies
with<00:01:58.649> engineering<00:01:59.130> I'm<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.490> ah<00:01:59.700> why<00:02:00.570> did<00:02:00.750> you

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
with engineering I'm like ah why did you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.170 
with engineering I'm like ah why did you
use<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.500> didn't<00:02:01.950> have<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:03.000> also

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
use that you didn't have to and it also

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.420 
use that you didn't have to and it also
shows<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.500> have<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.829> play<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.310> in

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
shows that you have to play with this in

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.330 
shows that you have to play with this in
order<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.820> win<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.270> no<00:02:06.750> um

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
order to win so no um

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.750 
order to win so no um
also<00:02:10.209> if<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.390> go<00:02:10.599> blacksmithing<00:02:11.400> well<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.430> get

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
also if you go blacksmithing well I get

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.990 
also if you go blacksmithing well I get
mining<00:02:13.209> because<00:02:13.629> I<00:02:14.050> I'm<00:02:15.010> kind<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.580> poor<00:02:15.819> guy

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
mining because I I'm kind of a poor guy

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.479 
mining because I I'm kind of a poor guy
and<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.269> have<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.629> back<00:02:16.930> myself<00:02:17.170> up<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:17.860> farm

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
and I have to back myself up like farm

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.449 
and I have to back myself up like farm
and<00:02:18.790> crafts<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.590> go<00:02:20.709> blacksmithing<00:02:21.310> you

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
and crafts if you go blacksmithing you

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.880 
and crafts if you go blacksmithing you
get<00:02:21.640> one<00:02:21.940> extra<00:02:22.120> circuit<00:02:22.569> on<00:02:22.780> your<00:02:23.019> wrists<00:02:23.739> and

people which makes sense also i notice

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.800

we're<00:03:57.290> going<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.590> talk<00:03:57.770> about<00:03:57.950> secondary

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
we're going to talk about secondary

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.170 
we're going to talk about secondary
stats<00:03:58.970> it's<00:03:59.660> a<00:04:01.420> haste<00:04:02.420> mastery<00:04:02.840> in<00:04:03.200> crete<00:04:03.560> and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
stats it's a haste mastery in crete and

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.630 
stats it's a haste mastery in crete and
i'm<00:04:05.180> really<00:04:07.240> thinking<00:04:08.980> which<00:04:09.980> is<00:04:10.250> better

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
i'm really thinking which is better

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.020 
i'm really thinking which is better
because<00:04:11.470> at<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.650> moment<00:04:12.680> people<00:04:13.130> say<00:04:13.520> haste

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
because at the moment people say haste

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.350 
because at the moment people say haste
is<00:04:14.300> slightly<00:04:14.600> better<00:04:14.990> than<00:04:15.140> mastery<00:04:15.740> for<00:04:16.360> PvE

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
is slightly better than mastery for PvE

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.040 
is slightly better than mastery for PvE
and<00:04:18.640> for<00:04:19.640> PvP<00:04:20.180> but<00:04:21.460> the<00:04:22.460> thing<00:04:22.700> is<00:04:22.730> are<00:04:23.720> those

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
and for PvP but the thing is are those

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.560 
and for PvP but the thing is are those
people<00:04:24.440> talking<00:04:25.070> about<00:04:25.160> pvp<00:04:26.150> like<00:04:28.060> double<00:04:29.060> DPS

sometimes<00:05:11.450> like<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:11.930> feel<00:05:12.230> like<00:05:12.260> a<00:05:12.740> haste<00:05:13.400> is

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
sometimes like I feel like a haste is

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.040 
sometimes like I feel like a haste is
actually<00:05:14.000> working<00:05:14.740> because<00:05:16.600> let's<00:05:17.600> say<00:05:17.720> we

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
actually working because let's say we

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.140 
actually working because let's say we
don't<00:05:18.260> manage<00:05:18.410> to<00:05:18.560> kill<00:05:18.919> someone<00:05:19.220> in<00:05:19.580> cool

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
don't manage to kill someone in cool

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.450 
don't manage to kill someone in cool
down<00:05:20.360> and<00:05:20.570> then<00:05:20.660> we<00:05:21.260> have<00:05:21.410> to<00:05:21.440> be<00:05:21.890> conservative

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
down and then we have to be conservative

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.540 
down and then we have to be conservative
in<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.940> way<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:23.780> if<00:05:24.200> my<00:05:24.710> skills<00:05:25.040> come<00:05:25.340> back

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
in a way so if my skills come back

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.240 
in a way so if my skills come back
faster<00:05:26.120> I<00:05:26.330> get<00:05:26.630> more<00:05:27.140> whole<00:05:27.380> power<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:28.010> I

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
faster I get more whole power and I

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.850 
faster I get more whole power and I
managed<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:28.729> keep<00:05:28.880> us<00:05:29.090> up<00:05:29.270> better

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
managed to keep us up better

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.800 
managed to keep us up better
so<00:05:31.610> hast<00:05:31.879> works<00:05:32.360> better<00:05:33.159> at<00:05:34.159> at<00:05:34.400> case<00:05:34.780> but<00:05:35.780> I

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
so hast works better at at case but I

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.209
