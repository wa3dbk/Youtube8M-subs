four inches away from the hilt so

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.550 
four inches away from the hilt so
probably<00:03:02.170> about<00:03:02.349> right<00:03:02.560> there<00:03:02.910> very<00:03:03.910> very

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
probably about right there very very

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
they don't really make them sharp

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.490 
they don't really make them sharp
because<00:04:28.420> they<00:04:28.540> don't<00:04:28.720> want<00:04:28.840> people<00:04:28.990> sword

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
because they don't want people sword

don't find anyone to get hurt

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.750 
don't find anyone to get hurt
however<00:04:34.300> if<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.780> were<00:04:34.990> just<00:04:35.500> to<00:04:36.010> sharpen<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.550> I

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.870 
would probably need a belt sander which
I<00:04:38.500> do<00:04:38.560> not<00:04:38.890> possess<00:04:39.100> quite<00:04:39.490> yet
