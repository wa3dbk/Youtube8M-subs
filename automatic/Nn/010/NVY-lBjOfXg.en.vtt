sharpen one of these you don't you throw

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.439 
sharpen one of these you don't you throw
them<00:00:22.439> away<00:00:22.590> when<00:00:22.890> they<00:00:23.010> get<00:00:23.160> dull<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:24.150> always

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
them away when they get dull it's always

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.259 
them away when they get dull it's always
important<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.050> move<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:26.220> buy<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.760> seam

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269

ripper<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.720> works<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.769> bit<00:00:28.980> better

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
ripper that works a little bit better

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.460 
ripper that works a little bit better
because<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.970> actually<00:00:30.179> ruin<00:00:30.869> your

because you can actually ruin your

because you can actually ruin your
product<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.880> seam<00:00:33.090> ripper<00:00:33.390> isn't<00:00:33.719> strong

product if the seam ripper isn't strong

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.479 
product if the seam ripper isn't strong
enough<00:00:33.960> you'll<00:00:34.320> end<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.980> through<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> lot

enough you'll end up going through a lot

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.990 
enough you'll end up going through a lot

now this seam ripper happens to be very
sharp<00:00:41.640> yet<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.020> wanted<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> show<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
couple different seam rippers and ways

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160 
couple different seam rippers and ways
to<00:00:46.649> use<00:00:46.829> them<00:00:47.239> this<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> seam<00:00:48.750> ripper<00:00:48.870> this

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
to use them this is a seam ripper this

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.100 
to use them this is a seam ripper this
isn't<00:00:49.530> actually<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:50.100> seam<00:00:50.430> ripper<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.809> an

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
isn't actually a seam ripper this is an

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.840 
isn't actually a seam ripper this is an
eyebrow<00:00:52.770> razor<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.539> great<00:00:54.960> tool<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.850> just

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
eyebrow razor it's a great tool for just

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.209 
eyebrow razor it's a great tool for just
working<00:00:57.629> along<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:59.719> cutting<00:01:00.719> those<00:01:01.710> those

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
working along and cutting those those

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.080 
working along and cutting those those
stitches<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.910> need<00:01:03.180> cut<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:05.670> doesn't

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
stitches that you need cut it doesn't

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.840 
stitches that you need cut it doesn't
rip<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.659> fabric<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.580> quite

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
rip your fabric and you can go quite

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.820 
rip your fabric and you can go quite
quickly<00:01:09.180> actually<00:01:10.909> because<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.060> cuts<00:01:12.930> away<00:01:13.110> at

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
quickly actually because it cuts away at

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.520 
quickly actually because it cuts away at
those<00:01:14.040> threads<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.700> rapidly<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.380> is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
those threads really rapidly now this is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.910 
those threads really rapidly now this is
another<00:01:16.920> type<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.970> seam<00:01:18.869> ripper<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.350> it's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
another type of a seam ripper and it's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.429 
another type of a seam ripper and it's
kind<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.400> scalpel<00:01:20.909> form<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.450> tend<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> have

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
kind of in a scalpel form I tend to have

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.570 
kind of in a scalpel form I tend to have
a<00:01:22.500> little<00:01:22.740> bit<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> problem<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.520> I

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a little bit of a problem with that I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
a little bit of a problem with that I
tend<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.240> replace<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.840> blade<00:01:25.080> quite

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
tend to have to replace this blade quite

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.830 
tend to have to replace this blade quite
often<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.330> it's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.600> bit<00:01:27.689> more

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
often and it's a little bit more

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.600 
often and it's a little bit more
dangerous<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.439> feel<00:01:30.650> because<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.579> a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
dangerous I feel because you do have a

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.190 
dangerous I feel because you do have a
little<00:01:32.790> bit<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.090> risk<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.020> things

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
little bit of a risk one of the things

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.719 
little bit of a risk one of the things
that<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.409> would<00:01:34.470> do<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:35.009> using<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.520> seam

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that I would do if I was using this seam

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.210 
that I would do if I was using this seam
ripper<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.750> would<00:01:36.900> probably<00:01:37.140> decide<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.100> use

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
ripper is I would probably decide to use

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.499 
ripper is I would probably decide to use
it<00:01:38.250> in<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> different<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.909> than<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> would<00:01:39.360> use

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
it in a different way than I would use

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.300 
it in a different way than I would use
other<00:01:39.720> seam<00:01:40.110> rippers<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.009> way<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
other seam rippers and the way that I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.130 
other seam rippers and the way that I
would<00:01:41.490> use<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.090> would<00:01:42.270> probably<00:01:42.509> go<00:01:42.899> in

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
would use it is I would probably go in

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.520 
would use it is I would probably go in
and<00:01:43.380> hook<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.340> under<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.880> stitch<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:46.259> every

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and hook it under a stitch for every

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
and hook it under a stitch for every
three<00:01:46.770> stitches<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:49.549> make<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> break<00:01:50.880> in

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
three stitches and and make a break in

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.420 
three stitches and and make a break in
that<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.600> thread<00:01:51.960> because<00:01:52.799> if<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.159> that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that that thread because if you do that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.149 
that that thread because if you do that
what<00:01:54.180> you'll<00:01:54.329> find<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.740> much

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
what you'll find is that it's much

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.670 
what you'll find is that it's much
easier<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.329> able<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.290> rip<00:01:58.649> it

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
easier for you to be able to just rip it

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.670 
easier for you to be able to just rip it
away<00:01:59.119> because<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.329> all<00:02:00.570> comes<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.290> comes

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
away because it all comes it just comes

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.429 
away because it all comes it just comes
apart<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.130> nicely<00:02:02.630> now<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> lot<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.869> people<00:02:04.229> they

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
apart so nicely now a lot of people they

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.020 
apart so nicely now a lot of people they
don't<00:02:04.560> understand<00:02:05.159> what<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.520> little<00:02:05.700> red

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
don't understand what that little red

don't understand what that little red
ball<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.229> our<00:02:07.380> seam<00:02:07.680> rippers<00:02:08.069> they<00:02:09.030> use

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
ball is for in our seam rippers they use

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.119 
ball is for in our seam rippers they use
usually<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.200> use<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.590> they<00:02:10.679> think<00:02:10.739> it's<00:02:11.009> a

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
usually they use it they think it's a

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.280 
usually they use it they think it's a
visual<00:02:11.730> thing<00:02:11.760> where<00:02:12.510> they<00:02:12.629> want<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.930> use<00:02:13.110> it

up

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.740 
up
and<00:02:14.250> they<00:02:14.700> want<00:02:14.880> their<00:02:15.060> seam<00:02:15.270> ripper<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.660> be

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and they want their seam ripper to be

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.710 
and they want their seam ripper to be
down<00:02:15.930> below<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.940> now<00:02:17.940> if<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.300> do<00:02:18.510> this

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
down below like this now if you do this

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.330 
down below like this now if you do this
the<00:02:18.960> chances<00:02:19.380> are<00:02:19.530> you're<00:02:19.710> gonna<00:02:19.800> end<00:02:20.130> up

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
the chances are you're gonna end up

cutting through your fabric as so we

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.730 
cutting through your fabric as so we

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
don't want to do this what we want to do

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.700 
don't want to do this what we want to do
is<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.460> want<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.820> take<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.240> ball<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.540> we<00:02:31.530> want

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
to put the ball down below and we use it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.900 
to put the ball down below and we use it
as<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.580> guide<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.830> see<00:02:37.830> how<00:02:37.980> nice<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.580> nifty

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
as a guide and see how nice and nifty

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.760 
as a guide and see how nice and nifty
that<00:02:39.090> go<00:02:39.270> works<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.110> we're<00:02:40.320> not<00:02:40.440> going<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.650> be

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
that go works and we're not going to be

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:48.020 
that go works and we're not going to be
ripping<00:02:40.950> away<00:02:41.220> at<00:02:41.340> fabrics<00:02:46.700> because<00:02:47.700> we've

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
ripping away at fabrics because we've

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.240 
ripping away at fabrics because we've
got<00:02:48.240> that<00:02:48.450> it's<00:02:48.930> up<00:02:49.140> here<00:02:49.320> at<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.620> edge<00:02:49.770> we're

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
got that it's up here at the edge we're

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.630 
got that it's up here at the edge we're
able<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.670> watch<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.150> point<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.430> cuts

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
able to watch the point and it just cuts

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.490 
able to watch the point and it just cuts
away<00:02:53.790> very<00:02:54.450> nicely<00:02:56.960> I'm<00:02:57.960> going<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.200> move<00:02:58.320> this

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
away very nicely I'm going to move this

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.890 
away very nicely I'm going to move this
to<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.710> side<00:02:58.830> it's<00:02:59.760> also<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.090> nice<00:03:00.330> product<00:03:00.660> to

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
to the side it's also a nice product to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.170 
to the side it's also a nice product to
use<00:03:01.080> when<00:03:01.350> you're<00:03:01.470> using<00:03:01.650> minky<00:03:02.160> minke<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.150> a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
use when you're using minky minke is a

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.200 
use when you're using minky minke is a
fabric<00:03:03.570> that's<00:03:03.720> very<00:03:04.050> easily<00:03:04.350> ripped<00:03:04.860> or<00:03:05.070> torn

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
fabric that's very easily ripped or torn

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.330 
fabric that's very easily ripped or torn
because<00:03:06.210> you<00:03:06.870> can't<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.680> can't<00:03:08.040> really

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
because you can't you can't really

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.650 
because you can't you can't really
decipher<00:03:08.670> when<00:03:09.030> you're<00:03:09.180> going<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.360> get<00:03:09.510> down

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
decipher when you're going to get down

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.900 
decipher when you're going to get down
to<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:09.900> bottom<00:03:10.440> part<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.890> where<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.580> held

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
to that bottom part of where it's held

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.350 
to that bottom part of where it's held
together<00:03:12.060> there's<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.140> much<00:03:13.260> plushness<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:14.130> it

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
together there's so much plushness in it

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.170 
together there's so much plushness in it
so<00:03:15.470> all<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.620> do<00:03:16.770> is<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.250> open<00:03:17.640> up<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.760> seem

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
so all you do is you open up that seem

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.690 
so all you do is you open up that seem
like<00:03:18.390> such<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.800> might<00:03:19.980> want<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.280> release<00:03:20.670> a

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
like such you might want to release a

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.700 
like such you might want to release a
couple<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.240> the<00:03:21.330> first<00:03:21.570> stitches<00:03:21.840> because

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
couple of the first stitches because

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.010 
couple of the first stitches because
like<00:03:22.950> most<00:03:23.130> of<00:03:23.370> us<00:03:23.490> we<00:03:23.730> always<00:03:23.940> have<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.720> sew

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
like most of us we always have that sew

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.990 
like most of us we always have that sew
off<00:03:25.230> where<00:03:25.560> we<00:03:25.770> try<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.100> lock<00:03:26.340> our<00:03:26.550> stitch<00:03:26.820> in

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
off where we try to lock our stitch in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.210 
off where we try to lock our stitch in
place<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:28.020> you<00:03:28.110> might<00:03:28.140> want<00:03:28.440> to<00:03:28.500> start<00:03:28.770> from

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
place and you might want to start from

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.910 
place and you might want to start from
the<00:03:29.280> side<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.240> fabric<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.900> not<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.680> side

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
the side of the fabric and not the side

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.120 
the side of the fabric and not the side
of<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.460> minke<00:03:32.820> because<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:34.080> threads<00:03:34.830> just

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
of the minke because the threads just

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.490 
of the minke because the threads just
kind<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.520> fall<00:03:36.150> right<00:03:36.360> in<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.810> melt<00:03:36.990> into<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
kind of fall right in and melt into the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.680 
kind of fall right in and melt into the
minke<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.810> now<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:42.990> just<00:03:43.290> open<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.680> up<00:03:44.690> and

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
minke so now we just open that up and

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.820 
minke so now we just open that up and
we've<00:03:45.960> got<00:03:45.990> our<00:03:46.970> our<00:03:47.970> seam<00:03:48.300> here<00:03:48.720> we<00:03:49.410> put<00:03:49.680> that

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
we've got our our seam here we put that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.050 
we've got our our seam here we put that
ball<00:03:50.040> down<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:51.390> we<00:03:51.600> just<00:03:51.810> let<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.050> guide<00:03:52.200> along

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
ball down and we just let it guide along

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.170 
ball down and we just let it guide along
and<00:03:54.060> you'll<00:03:54.840> see<00:03:55.110> how<00:03:55.290> quickly<00:03:55.620> we<00:03:55.800> can<00:03:56.180> rip

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
and you'll see how quickly we can rip

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:12.179 
and you'll see how quickly we can rip
away<00:03:58.460> if<00:03:59.460> we<00:03:59.580> get<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.760> good<00:04:00.000> grasp<00:04:00.390> on<00:04:00.690> it

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.090 

see<00:04:13.659> so<00:04:14.659> it's<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.870> much<00:04:15.049> easier<00:04:15.079> way<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.739> use

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
see so it's a much easier way to use

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.349 
see so it's a much easier way to use
your<00:04:16.280> seam<00:04:16.459> ripper<00:04:16.489> it's<00:04:16.970> much<00:04:17.180> more

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
your seam ripper it's much more

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.110 
your seam ripper it's much more
efficient<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.620> key<00:04:18.829> is<00:04:19.009> always<00:04:19.639> have<00:04:19.850> a

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
efficient and the key is always have a

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.170 
efficient and the key is always have a
sharp<00:04:20.419> seam<00:04:20.810> ripper<00:04:21.109> on<00:04:21.259> hand<00:04:21.729> so<00:04:22.729> that's<00:04:22.940> our

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
sharp seam ripper on hand so that's our
