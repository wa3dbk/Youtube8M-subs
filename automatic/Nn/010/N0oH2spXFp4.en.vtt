00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.984
- He's Vila Belmiro's Lahm!
- That's right!

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.812
- Is he?
- Of course he is!

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:24.516
He pretends he's going to the left
and then he turns around!

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.882
He's awesome!

00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:48.474
He was wearing a bandanna...

00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:51.459
- While disputing the Copa Libertadores.
- What?

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.235
- While disputing the Copa Libertadores.
- No, it's an old video of him.

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.042
Isn't that right?

00:00:56.613 --> 00:00:59.133
He was wearing a big necklace
and a bandanna.

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:10.292
We focused on their physical
condition during the first week,

00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:16.983
we aimed to achieve
a better physical condition.

00:01:17.197 --> 00:01:19.016
During the second week...

00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:24.069
our goal is to improve
and enhance...

00:01:24.252 --> 00:01:27.172
their technical and tactical skills,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.436
using little games,
correcting their movements,

00:01:31.437 --> 00:01:32.930
and soccer fundamentals.

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:37.436
Beginning today, we'll start...

00:01:37.437 --> 00:01:39.833
working on their tactical skills,

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:41.672
and we'll develop this work
up to the next week,

00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:44.925
aiming to maintain all those things.
