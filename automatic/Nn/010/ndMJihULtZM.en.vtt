00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.040
 hello that such friends we give them the 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.450
 welcome to mixed world zone les 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.590
 greets crystal valencia in the company of 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.320
 I say I think with the match preview 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.460
 between mexico and croatia the tricolor 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.950
 mexican classification is played 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.040
 eighth finals against a great 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.419
 Croatian team that also fights its pass 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.160
 to the next round after having 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:25.220
 thrashed 4 for 0 to Cameroon and have them 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.169
 eliminated from the competition gentlemen the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.779
 fight for the classification is hard now 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.730
 that both Mexico and Brazil have 4 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.280
 points and Croatia follows him with 3 units 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.230
 and this is the game that will decide one 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.150
 of those definitely classified to the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.490
 next phase the Mexican national team 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.650
 had a great game against Brazil in the 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.990
 draw to zero goals where guillermo the 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.880
 memo ochoa was the great figure but 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.550
 I definitely diego this game is going to 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.920
 define what this really is made of 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.020
 Mexican team that must make the tri 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.329
 to beat croatia there is something very clear 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.980
 and is that guillermo ochoa will not be 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.290
 always to save Mexico and that's what 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.329
 you have to be very clear about the louse 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.399
 Herrera in the last play of the match 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.299
 where ochoa took a header from thiago 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.300
 silva that we are going to analyze 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.130
 quickly with technology we see here 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.380
 the free kick that claimed neymar to close 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.270
 from minute 86 man to man the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.460
 Mexican marking there is superiority 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.590
 number of Mexicans there is only 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.630
 four Brazilians inside the area against 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.430
 several Mexicans and where is thiago 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.619
 silva who was the one who nodded there what 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.090
 we see in the red circle but we're going to 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.369
 see that now david lewis that is in 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.289
 this corner is going to drag its mark its 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.390
 marker is going to stay planted 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.890
 and it's going to be absolutely nothing and who 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.960
 is dialing thiago silva is going to have 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.179
 to deal now with the two central 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.490
 brazilians here collects neymar the shot 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.229
 free we see david luiz going to where 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.740
 was thiago silva and thiago silva 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.630
 the center of the area then there we see it 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.399
 santiago silva that then remains in everything 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.709
 the center of the area nobody is 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.289
 marking this Brazilian player if we 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.299
 it was wrong is Fred is holding two 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.640
 Mexican defenders who do not reach 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.020
 get to cover thiago silva and this 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.909
 another has not even known that 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.530
 has a Brazilian behind him then 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.659
 comes of course there we see again to 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.399
 thiago silva and comes the header from 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.259
 thiago silva to the first stick remember 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.840
 that thiago silva started on this side 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.829
 from the area and arrived here 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.989
 Fortunately for Mexico Memo Eight 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.640
 He was well standing and thiago silva 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.080
 shot directly towards your body 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.840
 we were talking about a story 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.730
 very different from how the match ended 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.920
 If it happened to me , it has been anticipated that 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.780
 will face the same alignment 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.160
 this match that you have already used in the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.319
 two previous matches played by the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.930
 Mexican team you think is ideal 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.100
 repeat an alignment for the latter 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.220
 party we know that mexico is 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.900
 playing all the classification but 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.209
 it's really worth using the same 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.980
 alignment I think the old man is 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.260
 thinking of course to take the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.850
 victory against Croatia but with a draw 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.440
 he is enough to Mexico to advance 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.390
 eighth finals and I think these 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.340
 players have to rest too 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.830
 a little bit for what is going to be a second 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.540
 clear round that if Mexico does not get the 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.000
 victory or the tie because there will be no 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.769
 no fourth match for mexico but 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.660
 remember the alignment anyway 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.750
 As you see it on the screen, 8 will appear on the 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.430
 arco more to rafa marquez and moreno like 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.580
 centrals aguilar and layún by the lateral 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.080
 Vázquez Herrera in the Andresian contention 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.180
 saved will be on the left side 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.030
 giovani dos saints who will be accompanied 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.190
 also in front of oribe peralta but 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.200
 you have to rest some and also the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.000
 large figure as a two-year-old 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.720
 saints has to appear in this 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.320
 match 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.070
 against Brazil it was practically null 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.690
 definitely one of the things that I 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.190
 it attracted a lot of attention from the 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.290
 comments by jose mourinho that is 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.790
 commenting for yahoo sport is that the 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.550
 teams must change strategies 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.170
 match to match hopefully to mexico 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.300
 this do not play them against the fact of 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.350
 play with the same lineup gentlemen 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.830
 remember that this game is going to 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.810
 play on Monday June 23 from 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.780
 of 4 pm ET on 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.130
 arena pernambuco stadium recife well 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.200
 that we will see here without the selection of 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.420
 Mexico will be able to classify or not 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.890
 eighth finals thank you very much for 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.450
 the tune many thanks 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.260
 because analysis with you until the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.260
