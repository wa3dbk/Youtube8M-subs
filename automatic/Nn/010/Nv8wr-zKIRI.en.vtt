00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 heilloh I'll show you one today 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.259
 very cool variation like your photo 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.870
 present stylishly in your apartment 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 You can do that by putting it on wood 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.190
 applying this looks at the end like this 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.199
 and of course that's great for 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.390
 eg instagram pictures also in yours 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.449
 hang up the apartment as the whole goes 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.449
 I show you now mature 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.970
 for that you need a mirrored 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.130
 printed picture simply with the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.930
 inkjet printer then you need 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.820
 You can do that in the woods 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.520
 to cut Baumarkt let that iris 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.739
 pine and of course that has to picture 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.110
 then you need such a transfer 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.140
 medium here is the photo patch finds 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:49.520
 her in the infobox also everything one 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.190
 shell or 22 strains and moreover 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.420
 a scissors 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.790
 Here then begins by taking the photo 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.379
 prepared in the size he has 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.600
 I want ten times ten in my case 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.010
 centimeter 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.190
 and if you have that then you have it 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.770
 then it lights up once you reflect 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.210
 so it's just around the corner 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.210
 is transmitted to the medium 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.929
 The photo print animal then quite normal 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.020
 the tip of the jet printer on the 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:28.310
 best as an optimal photo or even as 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.299
 photo so that it has a good quality 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.259
 which you take from it does however 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:40.349
 no difference and then if everything 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.959
 that's right print animal if yours 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:52.819
 printers have finished cutting their cuts 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:55.890
 the picture and now you take 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.420
 your wood underground and looks like that 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.579
 would look the best if the picture 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:06.479
 then after that , take it now 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:09.119
 your photo patch and brings that on the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.510
 so it's best to just do it with the wood 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.010
 Swim on it a few times and 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.780
 if you do not leave the container 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.310
 then you can just do it in me 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.590
 a cup-pure and sweeps the so 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.209
 two to three times on it there such a 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.819
 beautiful layer on it is beautiful 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:31.470
 evenly and then next 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.560
 you take a little bit more step 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:39.380
 them and that goes also again very 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.380
 thin on the photo itself 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.910
 You then put that on your wood 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.300
 and squeeze that nicely by hand 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.250
 so that there are no more bubbles or you 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.100
 then it looks really nice 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.180
 Press firmly 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.180
 Everything looks neat afterwards 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.520
 yes, and now you are waiting about one and a half 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.260
 hours is also longer 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.850
 That does not do anything nice 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.410
 dry is that you see now that 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.410
 The grain of the properly dried 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.450
 is and take one again now 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.970
 bowl with water quite simply water 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.060
 out of the line 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.490
 but no matter how warm or how cold that is 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.440
 take your other sponge and 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.530
 dabbed water on it so you give way 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.380
 almost the paper because of the color 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.690
 has through this medium the the 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.390
 has just solved color on the wood 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.770
 transfer 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:58.320
 And now you just give way to the paper 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:59.880
 and uvek cheered that goes too 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.380
 But you have to be very easy 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.310
 Be a little bit careful with it 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.310
 take nothing away from the wood 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:28.270
 That's what you do until the whole 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:29.230
 paper from the picture is down the whole 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.960
 it has to be a bit too 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.450
 Dry and finally you take 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.010
 Now once again your first 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.740
 sponge at hand and again 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:44.950
 so the photo patch just this transfer 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:47.830
 medium and that there again and gives 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:54.370
 the normal as before on the 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:55.600
 picture out and the whole seals that 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.169
 now again you really need 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.490
 only one thing and then the picture 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:06.940
 Transfer and your super beautiful 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:10.240
 then art after then the last 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.580
 I finished painting here 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.060
 a little poster glue on it 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.410
 and I will bring the whole thing now 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.410
 just with on my wall 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.440
 that's great, and then you have 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.050
 really a nice variation like her 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.960
 photos and stuff just to a 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.420
 I find somehow new creative art 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.950
 I could hope for a flat 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.820
 that you liked that you can 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.860
 Of course, other variants 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.240
 how to make things bigger, for example 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.090
 this is the one here 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.410
 piccadilly circus in london and you can 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.650
 simply photos of course in one 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.840
 so apply possible sizes to wood 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.670
 However, 20 times 20 is now with me 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.200
 the square wanted to have that one 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.790
 had been the master I could do 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.530
 Simply because of the printer 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.360
 only a4 expression because you have to turn it off 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.980
 but otherwise I wish you 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.950
 Have fun trying it out 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.940
 you can find this product with what 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.010
 I did that 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.810
 in the infobox linked as well as otherwise 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.880
 you know, and down here you see 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.470
 now a few other deco videos 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.970
 if you still live in your flat 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.830
 want to do something or in yours 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.820
 I wanted to change the room 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.250
 Have fun trying it out 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.290
 and remember if you try it 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.840
 I show a picture of it under the 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.200
 hashtag afx the fdp so much fun 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.200
 there
