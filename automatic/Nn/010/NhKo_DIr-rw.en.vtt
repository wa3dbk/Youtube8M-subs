00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 good day dear community here is yours 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.919
 litespeed as you surely know 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.300
 the eu since a week in 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.519
 Germany outside today is the moment 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.640
 eight seats 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.340
 December about a week ago 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.380
 console appeared and I have 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.080
 found that the tablet a lot 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.630
 has more on it than I said so 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.669
 First of all that that gg the tv future 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.750
 Did you know yes with the tablet you can 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.980
 the turn of the tv 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.239
 then exactly in time 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:53.090
 I'll show you like her then 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:58.850
 I see it deeper we see 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.850
 I use the TV with the tablet 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.850
 I'll show you the console 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.380
 can equip with it ok that's also 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:27.250
 no big secret you know that it 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:30.070
 if you own in the wii and how 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.060
 even now you will see 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.369
 that even the playstation 3 with it 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.090
 can be controlled without assistance 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.560
 of the roller 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.680
 I'll put it down here 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.680
 As you can see the led lights shine for 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.250
 to start the console 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.020
 I do not know about which TV models 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.259
 it's all about samsung 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.560
 If you go to entrance so that you can 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.330
 various channels there I did go 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.479
 now on the hdmi cec channel the 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.429
 Playstation 3 starts is probably 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.040
 now the beep is heard from the console 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.480
 Now the console boots up my 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.610
 TV connects wife of 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.340
 console and the tablet service as me 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.799
 say times as a shorter remote control 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.299
 between the remote control of 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:31.750
 tvs and the dualshock controller 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.989
 the playstation 3 we can see you 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.200
 could the controller be switched off 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:42.390
 and we can see there is the menu what 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.630
 I can serve here now 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.260
 as I can see then I was also 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.260
 times so that a 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.079
 the playstation 3 is started like you 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:08.719
 you can also see the information 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:13.390
 with the analog sticks it could be the same 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.390
 Serve well if you look at this 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:23.290
 also went in this mode of the 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:26.780
 tablets the iks and y button as 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.959
 channel buttons and the start and select 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.750
 So plus minus button for the volume 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:38.180
 we can also see you can 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:44.000
 Of course, that severely limits that 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:50.480
 tablet also as a remote control for moment 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:53.750
 just as you can see it shows the 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.180
 controller of wii delikt is out there 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.019
 and even up there on the second 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:04.549
 controller people do not use the led 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:07.639
 I start the film with certain 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:10.250
 restrictions so with some 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.250
 Restrictions can you then despite 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:20.870
 All blu ray and dvd on the console 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:24.949
 look amazed which unfortunately are missing now 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.430
 she might be of advantage 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:32.389
 once the speed and the 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.789
 breaks function for the movie at least 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.729
 I have nowhere on the tablet 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:44.030
 found how to do it 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:46.750
 furthermore, one may also be missing 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:51.610
 skip the chapter 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.610
 the chapter skip functions 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.090
 We are now waiting for the movie to start 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.090
 Has 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:19.919
 so now it starts meeting after one 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:23.279
 short leash time now I'll show you 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:25.289
 now if you are here on the tray 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.309
 once on the controller presses on it 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:37.589
 that on the right or left 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:44.309
 analog stick it's both okay you have to 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:46.349
 it must be okay on it 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:47.839
 So I do not know the function yet 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.919
 by heart that means I even have 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:53.249
 figured out what is possible 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:57.559
 but if you follow with the analogstick 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:59.819
 right it's called the menu 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:04.860
 which you then serve normally 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:07.649
 you can also if you then once 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:15.110
 I click on the analogstick click 

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:19.259
 The menu disappears once again 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:23.039
 I could do more functions now 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:25.259
 unfortunately not find 

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:29.059
 so only forward and backward 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.059
 There are no functions here 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:35.759
 Alternatively, you can also use the steering wheel 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:41.550
 use for the menu with the high road 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:46.979
 to get into this chapter selection where 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:50.449
 but unfortunately nothing really that 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.449
 use can as I 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.450
 So you just stay on that 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.360
 most elementary then hang 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:09.630
 that means with the tablet could the 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.430
 playstation 3 in the cross media menu 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.470
 to serve without further ado 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:16.800
 you can start movies ye can 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.000
 However, the menus go unfortunately know each 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.460
 we can not see now 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.410
 has is within the dvd or content 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:27.540
 the user inside the blu-ray 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:28.800
 sorry to serve more functions 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.500
 how to play that forwards and backwards 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.480
 like breaks function or chapter 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.790
 skip 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.370
 Despite everything, I think the idea is quite good 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:42.600
 maybe nintendo will come with one 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:45.870
 patch maybe this kind of control 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.490
 Supports you know nothing then 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.790
 I say goodbye to you and 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:54.710
 wish you a nice one 

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.710
 Winter weekends in december at
