00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
this is skyler with equinox systems I'm

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.980 
this is skyler with equinox systems I'm
going<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.730> show<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.000> how<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.270> put<00:00:03.419> together<00:00:03.570> an

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
going to show you how to put together an

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.320 
going to show you how to put together an
EQ<00:00:04.410> you<00:00:04.560> 47<00:00:05.190> Mike<00:00:05.400> body<00:00:07.790> so<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.880> start<00:00:09.000> out

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
EQ you 47 Mike body so to start out

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.360 
EQ you 47 Mike body so to start out
you're<00:00:09.750> probably<00:00:10.080> going<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.559> want<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:10.920> put<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
you're probably going to want to put the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.270 
you're probably going to want to put the
male<00:00:11.880> bender<00:00:12.389> connector<00:00:12.929> inside<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.099> end

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
male bender connector inside of the end

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.370 
male bender connector inside of the end
cap<00:00:19.640> now<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.029> real<00:00:21.270> world<00:00:21.480> scenario<00:00:21.810> you

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
cap now in a real world scenario you

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.290 
cap now in a real world scenario you
would<00:00:22.500> probably<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.220> wiring<00:00:23.580> coming<00:00:24.150> from

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
would probably have wiring coming from

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.700 
would probably have wiring coming from
each<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.600> these<00:00:24.660> connectors<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:25.500> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
each of these connectors here and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.679 
each of these connectors here and
running<00:00:26.130> through<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.609> insert<00:00:27.029> nut<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
running through the insert nut and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.880 
running through the insert nut and
connecting<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> rest<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.310> circuit

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
connecting to the rest of your circuit

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.410 
connecting to the rest of your circuit
so<00:00:31.890> make<00:00:32.099> sure<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.820> insert<00:00:33.180> nut

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
so make sure you have this insert nut

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.479 
so make sure you have this insert nut
around<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> wires<00:00:34.320> before<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.980> solder<00:00:35.219> them

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
around the wires before you solder them

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.709 
around the wires before you solder them
or<00:00:35.700> connect<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.329> rest<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.660> your

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
or connect them to the rest of your

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.490 
or connect them to the rest of your
circuit<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:39.570> once<00:00:39.750> you've<00:00:39.899> done<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.469> can

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
circuit so once you've done that you can

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.540 
circuit so once you've done that you can
slide<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.309> male<00:00:41.489> insert<00:00:41.879> into<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.600> end<00:00:42.840> cap

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
slide the male insert into the end cap

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.220 
slide the male insert into the end cap
and<00:00:46.520> then<00:00:47.520> screw<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> insert<00:00:48.480> nut<00:00:48.719> all<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and then screw the insert nut all the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.310 
and then screw the insert nut all the
way<00:00:49.379> down<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:53.480> if<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.600> need<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.140> might

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
way down and if you need to you might

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.130 
way down and if you need to you might
have<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.559> use<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.739> screwdriver<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.899> get<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
have to use a screwdriver to get that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.260 
have to use a screwdriver to get that
nut<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.399> tight<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.879> there's<00:01:00.180> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
nut in there really tight and there's a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.760 
nut in there really tight and there's a
couple<00:01:00.449> slots<00:01:00.840> on<00:01:00.989> either<00:01:01.079> side<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.649> that

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
couple slots on either side for that

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.630 
couple slots on either side for that
specific<00:01:02.010> purpose<00:01:04.129> now<00:01:05.129> we're<00:01:05.339> going<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
specific purpose now we're going to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.160 
specific purpose now we're going to
attach<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.000> inner<00:01:06.570> rails<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> these<00:01:09.570> attach

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
attach the inner rails so these attach

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:34.230 
attach the inner rails so these attach
using<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.610> supplied<00:01:12.229> m3<00:01:13.229> flathead<00:01:13.830> screws

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.029 

by<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.299> way<00:01:35.509> if<00:01:35.840> you've<00:01:35.990> noticed<00:01:36.259> i<00:01:36.590> like<00:01:37.009> to

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
by the way if you've noticed i like to

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.309 
by the way if you've noticed i like to
use<00:01:37.189> rubber<00:01:37.670> gloves<00:01:38.090> when<00:01:38.450> assembling<00:01:39.109> this

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
use rubber gloves when assembling this

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.819 
use rubber gloves when assembling this
stuff<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:40.729> keeps<00:01:41.090> me<00:01:41.359> from<00:01:41.390> leaving<00:01:41.869> early

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
stuff it keeps me from leaving early

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:55.510 
stuff it keeps me from leaving early
fingerprints<00:01:43.429> all<00:01:43.549> over<00:01:43.579> everything

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.520 

now<00:01:56.520> we'll<00:01:56.760> do

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
now we'll do

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:13.040 
now we'll do
side<00:01:57.830> just<00:01:58.670> like<00:01:58.790> we<00:01:59.060> did<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.360> first

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.590 

now<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.130> these<00:02:14.250> flat<00:02:14.520> head<00:02:14.700> screws<00:02:15.150> you're

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
now with these flat head screws you're

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.390 
now with these flat head screws you're
going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> want<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.050> be<00:02:16.110> extra<00:02:16.710> careful<00:02:16.740> with

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
going to want to be extra careful with

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.400 
going to want to be extra careful with
your<00:02:17.580> screwdriver<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.810> don't<00:02:18.990> slip

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
your screwdriver so that you don't slip

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.070 
your screwdriver so that you don't slip
and<00:02:19.590> scratch<00:02:19.950> things<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.870> since<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.020> is

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and scratch things up and since this is

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.370 
and scratch things up and since this is
the<00:02:22.230> inside<00:02:22.440> of<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:23.310> mic<00:02:23.690> it's<00:02:24.690> probably<00:02:25.170> not

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
the inside of the mic it's probably not

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.770 
the inside of the mic it's probably not
that<00:02:25.410> important<00:02:26.190> but<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.940> will<00:02:27.060> become<00:02:27.480> more

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
that important but it will become more

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.300 
that important but it will become more
important<00:02:28.320> as<00:02:28.440> we're<00:02:28.710> dealing<00:02:28.980> with<00:02:29.010> some<00:02:29.220> of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
important as we're dealing with some of

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.830 
important as we're dealing with some of
these<00:02:29.400> external<00:02:29.850> screws<00:02:30.300> once<00:02:30.600> we<00:02:30.720> get

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
these external screws once we get

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:48.260 
these external screws once we get
further<00:02:31.050> in

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.020 

so<00:02:49.270> we've<00:02:49.600> got<00:02:49.780> these<00:02:49.900> two<00:02:50.140> rails<00:02:50.500> in<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.310> they

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
so we've got these two rails in and they

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.620 
so we've got these two rails in and they
are<00:02:52.240> installed<00:02:52.810> really<00:02:53.650> tightly<00:02:53.920> now<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.420> the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
are installed really tightly now so the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.770 
are installed really tightly now so the
next<00:02:55.780> thing<00:02:55.870> we're<00:02:56.080> going<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.230> do<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:57.780> take

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
next thing we're going to do is take

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.950 
next thing we're going to do is take
this<00:02:59.080> capsule<00:02:59.740> mount<00:03:00.040> disc<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.880> we're<00:03:01.720> going

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
this capsule mount disc and we're going

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.530 
this capsule mount disc and we're going
to<00:03:02.080> install<00:03:02.290> what<00:03:03.130> we<00:03:03.250> call<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:04.000> capsule

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
to install what we call the capsule

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.430 
to install what we call the capsule
platform<00:03:05.380> onto<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.930> one<00:03:11.140> thing<00:03:11.290> that's

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
platform onto it and one thing that's

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.940 
platform onto it and one thing that's
really<00:03:11.590> important<00:03:12.190> here<00:03:12.250> is<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:13.480> align<00:03:14.080> this

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
really important here is to align this

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.490 
really important here is to align this
capsule<00:03:15.580> platform<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:16.960> that<00:03:16.990> it<00:03:17.260> doesn't

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
capsule platform so that it doesn't

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.310 
capsule platform so that it doesn't
cover<00:03:17.920> up<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.490> back<00:03:18.730> hole<00:03:19.150> on<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.870> capsule

side holes here and these connect to the
rail<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.940> in<00:03:27.940> addition<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.510> you've<00:03:28.660> got

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
rail and in addition to that you've got

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.130 
rail and in addition to that you've got
these<00:03:28.990> three<00:03:29.530> smaller<00:03:30.310> holes<00:03:30.640> here<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.990> are

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
these three smaller holes here that are

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.550 
these three smaller holes here that are
mainly<00:03:32.620> used<00:03:32.800> for<00:03:33.250> routing<00:03:34.150> capsule<00:03:35.080> leads<00:03:35.290> to

mainly used for routing capsule leads to

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.520 
mainly used for routing capsule leads to
the<00:03:35.650> rest<00:03:35.830> of<00:03:35.920> your<00:03:36.070> circuit<00:03:37.080> so<00:03:38.080> if<00:03:38.380> you

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
the rest of your circuit so if you

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.190 
the rest of your circuit so if you
install<00:03:38.860> this<00:03:39.040> upside<00:03:39.550> down<00:03:39.880> you<00:03:40.870> end<00:03:41.050> up

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
install this upside down you end up

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.370 
install this upside down you end up
covering<00:03:41.650> up<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.130> third<00:03:42.670> hole<00:03:43.060> which<00:03:44.050> is<00:03:44.200> bad

covering up that third hole which is bad

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.930 
covering up that third hole which is bad
so<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.710> want<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.950> make<00:03:44.980> sure<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.640> align

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
so you want to make sure that you align

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.750 
so you want to make sure that you align
it<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:46.210> such<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> way<00:03:46.570> that<00:03:47.050> these<00:03:47.890> three<00:03:48.310> holes

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
it in such a way that these three holes

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.160 
it in such a way that these three holes
remain<00:03:49.270> uncovered<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.500> we<00:03:54.010> want<00:03:54.250> to<00:03:54.340> use<00:03:54.400> these

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
remain uncovered so we want to use these

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.540 
remain uncovered so we want to use these
little<00:03:56.170> black<00:03:56.440> m<00:03:56.770> two<00:03:57.580> set<00:03:58.270> screws<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:59.380> attach
