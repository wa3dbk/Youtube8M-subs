death in the beginning here that got
nice<00:00:06.950> for<00:00:07.100> me<00:00:07.189> from<00:00:07.460> last<00:00:07.640> and<00:00:08.000> so<00:00:08.630> I<00:00:08.660> think<00:00:09.050> I

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
nice for me from last and so I think I

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.740 
nice for me from last and so I think I
had<00:00:09.290> six<00:00:09.530> deaths<00:00:09.740> until<00:00:10.309> I<00:00:10.550> got<00:00:10.759> this<00:00:11.120> streak

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
had six deaths until I got this streak

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.749 
had six deaths until I got this streak
here<00:00:12.019> so<00:00:12.290> I'm<00:00:12.650> not<00:00:12.799> sure<00:00:12.950> how<00:00:13.130> many<00:00:13.190> kills<00:00:13.490> and

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
here so I'm not sure how many kills and

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.150 
here so I'm not sure how many kills and
I<00:00:13.849> pick<00:00:14.179> up<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:14.389> kill<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:14.929> last<00:00:15.650> stand<00:00:15.980> there

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
I pick up the kill and last stand there

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.570 
I pick up the kill and last stand there
so<00:00:17.000> I'm<00:00:17.150> using<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:17.540> p90<00:00:18.260> something<00:00:19.130> I<00:00:19.280> really

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
so I'm using the p90 something I really

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.490 
so I'm using the p90 something I really
haven't<00:00:19.760> used<00:00:20.180> before<00:00:20.390> in<00:00:21.110> any<00:00:21.260> of<00:00:21.410> my

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
haven't used before in any of my

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.650 
haven't used before in any of my
prestiges<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:22.370> I<00:00:22.970> thought<00:00:23.210> I<00:00:23.300> would<00:00:23.390> try<00:00:23.630> it

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
prestiges and I thought I would try it

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.060 
prestiges and I thought I would try it
out<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.020> then<00:00:24.350> end<00:00:24.470> up<00:00:24.620> getting<00:00:24.830> the<00:00:24.890> nuke

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
out and then end up getting the nuke

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.270 
out and then end up getting the nuke
with<00:00:25.460> it<00:00:25.610> so<00:00:26.710> obviously<00:00:27.710> not<00:00:27.830> a<00:00:27.860> bad<00:00:28.070> choice

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
with it so obviously not a bad choice

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.570 
with it so obviously not a bad choice
for<00:00:28.550> me<00:00:29.290> for<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:30.350> p90<00:00:30.800> yeah<00:00:31.010> I'm<00:00:31.220> kind<00:00:31.520> of

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
called before I actually used to snake

more<00:00:53.810> often<00:00:54.020> than<00:00:54.920> other<00:00:55.520> people<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.180> this

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
more often than other people and this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.270 
more often than other people and this
game<00:00:56.930> I'm<00:00:57.079> surprised<00:00:57.500> I<00:00:57.650> haven't<00:00:57.680> used<00:00:58.040> it<00:00:58.220> I

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
game I'm surprised I haven't used it I

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.590 
game I'm surprised I haven't used it I
think<00:00:58.460> I<00:00:58.520> used<00:00:58.670> it<00:00:58.790> once<00:00:58.940> or<00:00:59.120> twice<00:00:59.149> and<00:00:59.540> it

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
think I used it once or twice and it

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.360 
think I used it once or twice and it
just<00:00:59.780> didn't<00:00:59.989> really<00:01:00.290> I<00:01:00.770> didn't<00:01:01.070> like<00:01:01.190> catch

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
just didn't really I didn't like catch

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.750 
just didn't really I didn't like catch
on<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:01.730> it<00:01:01.850> was<00:01:01.970> that<00:01:02.149> even<00:01:02.540> a<00:01:02.630> good<00:01:03.400> SMD<00:01:04.400> but

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
on that it was that even a good SMD but

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.950 
on that it was that even a good SMD but
I<00:01:04.790> decided<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.360> use<00:01:05.479> it<00:01:05.510> for<00:01:05.659> a<00:01:05.780> little<00:01:05.870> bit

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
I decided to use it for a little bit

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.630 
I decided to use it for a little bit
here<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.290> it's<00:01:06.440> really<00:01:06.710> really<00:01:07.010> accurate<00:01:07.250> and

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
here and it's really really accurate and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.310 
here and it's really really accurate and
for<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:07.940> clip<00:01:08.120> signs<00:01:08.360> on<00:01:08.540> it<00:01:08.659> it's<00:01:08.780> incredible

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
for the clip signs on it it's incredible

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.100

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.780 
a reach-around a kind of a set bar to go
do<00:01:32.930> or<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.260> go<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.710> or<00:01:33.979> something<00:01:34.280> like<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.430> and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
do or a go to or something like that and

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.820 
do or a go to or something like that and
it's<00:01:35.360> just<00:01:35.450> kind<00:01:35.720> of<00:01:35.810> there's<00:01:36.470> somewhere<00:01:36.680> to

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
it's just kind of there's somewhere to

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.340 
it's just kind of there's somewhere to
just<00:01:37.670> I<00:01:37.940> don't<00:01:38.540> know<00:01:38.659> just<00:01:38.720> set<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.140> bar<00:01:39.290> I

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
just I don't know just set the bar I

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.130 
just I don't know just set the bar I
guess<00:01:39.619> I<00:01:39.860> can't<00:01:40.340> think<00:01:40.549> of<00:01:40.610> anything<00:01:40.790> else<00:01:41.140> to

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
guess I can't think of anything else to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.080 
guess I can't think of anything else to
go<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.799> then<00:01:43.010> I<00:01:43.100> kind<00:01:43.369> of<00:01:43.430> satisfy<00:01:43.850> that<00:01:44.030> I

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
go to and then I kind of satisfy that I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.910 
go to and then I kind of satisfy that I
get<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:44.479> with<00:01:44.810> that<00:01:45.170> gun<00:01:45.439> or<00:01:45.590> something<00:01:45.770> like

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
on the p90 uh I was thinking about going

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.729 
on the p90 uh I was thinking about going
for<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.269> stealth<00:02:11.510> approach<00:02:11.749> which<00:02:12.079> was<00:02:12.169> a<00:02:12.230> for

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
for a stealth approach which was a for

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:13.750 
for a stealth approach which was a for
me<00:02:12.859> it<00:02:12.980> would<00:02:13.129> entail

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
me it would entail

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.500 
me it would entail
something<00:02:14.030> like<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:15.849> probably<00:02:16.849> would<00:02:17.090> have<00:02:17.120> I'm

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
something like I probably would have I'm

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.759 
something like I probably would have I'm
not<00:02:17.629> sure<00:02:17.720> if<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:17.900> would<00:02:18.019> have<00:02:18.110> marathon<00:02:18.530> that

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
not sure if I would have marathon that

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.369 
not sure if I would have marathon that
but<00:02:18.950> I'm<00:02:19.040> going<00:02:19.189> to<00:02:19.250> use<00:02:19.370> sled<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.700> hand

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
but I'm going to use sled a hand

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.500 
but I'm going to use sled a hand
cold-blooded<00:02:21.379> and<00:02:21.590> ninja<00:02:22.280> or<00:02:22.610> probably

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
cold-blooded and ninja or probably

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.270 
cold-blooded and ninja or probably
marathon<00:02:23.989> for<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.200> first<00:02:24.379> one<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:25.099> best

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
marathon for the first one and the best

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.429 
marathon for the first one and the best
part<00:02:25.700> about<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:26.060> p90<00:02:26.569> is<00:02:26.599> that<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.290> know<00:02:27.409> I

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
part about the p90 is that you know I

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.610 
part about the p90 is that you know I
scavenged<00:02:28.400> room<00:02:28.700> more<00:02:28.879> often<00:02:29.269> then<00:02:29.959> anybody

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
scavenged room more often then anybody

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.009 
scavenged room more often then anybody
else<00:02:30.829> probably<00:02:31.220> does<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:32.030> really<00:02:32.599> go<00:02:32.780> if<00:02:32.930> you

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
else probably does it really go if you

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.360 
else probably does it really go if you
look<00:02:33.200> through<00:02:33.379> all<00:02:33.440> my<00:02:33.560> classes<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:34.220> use

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
look through all my classes I use

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.309 
look through all my classes I use
scavenger<00:02:34.819> amor<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.180> think<00:02:35.360> everything<00:02:35.840> but

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
scavenger amor I think everything but

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.199 
scavenger amor I think everything but
the<00:02:36.440> p90<00:02:36.829> has<00:02:36.950> such<00:02:37.159> a<00:02:37.190> huge<00:02:37.400> clip<00:02:37.849> I<00:02:37.970> think<00:02:38.120> it

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
the p90 has such a huge clip I think it

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.240 
the p90 has such a huge clip I think it
has<00:02:38.299> two<00:02:38.659> clips<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.379> 100<00:02:39.769> or<00:02:39.890> something<00:02:39.980> like

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
has two clips of 100 or something like

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.190 
has two clips of 100 or something like
that<00:02:40.310> I'm<00:02:40.909> not<00:02:41.030> sure<00:02:41.209> if<00:02:41.299> that's<00:02:41.420> correct<00:02:41.810> but

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
that I'm not sure if that's correct but

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.630 
that I'm not sure if that's correct but
it<00:02:42.500> has<00:02:42.650> such<00:02:42.829> a<00:02:42.859> big<00:02:43.040> clip<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.519> can

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
it has such a big clip that you can

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.130 
it has such a big clip that you can
actually<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.180> freedom<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.750> go

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
actually you have a freedom to go

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.190 
actually you have a freedom to go
through<00:02:45.439> and<00:02:45.650> use<00:02:45.799> different<00:02:46.780> use<00:02:47.780> different

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
through and use different use different

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.960 
through and use different use different
perks<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.920> stuff<00:02:49.280> like<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.549> rather<00:02:49.730> than

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
perks and stuff like that rather than

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.520 
perks and stuff like that rather than
scavenger<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.599> I<00:02:50.659> decide<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:50.959> use<00:02:51.049> marathon

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
using is stopping power again I'm just

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.069 
using is stopping power again I'm just
going<00:03:04.609> for<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.790> spray<00:03:05.120> gun<00:03:05.150> nothing<00:03:05.480> special<00:03:05.810> if

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
going for a spray gun nothing special if

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.319 
going for a spray gun nothing special if
I<00:03:06.170> want<00:03:06.349> it<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.560> be<00:03:06.700> sneaky<00:03:07.700> or<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.030> kind<00:03:08.269> of

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
I want it to be sneaky or and kind of

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.180 
I want it to be sneaky or and kind of
just<00:03:08.540> go<00:03:08.750> around<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.170> be<00:03:09.379> unseen<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:09.889> would<00:03:10.010> use

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
just go around and be unseen I would use

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.699 
just go around and be unseen I would use
cold<00:03:10.430> blooded<00:03:10.720> cold<00:03:11.720> blooded<00:03:11.900> Pro<00:03:12.109> sorry<00:03:12.379> and

cold blooded cold blooded Pro sorry and
I<00:03:13.159> would<00:03:13.280> probably<00:03:13.400> worked<00:03:13.700> out<00:03:13.819> pretty<00:03:13.909> well

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
I would probably worked out pretty well

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.750 
I would probably worked out pretty well
and<00:03:14.329> my<00:03:14.599> third<00:03:14.810> perk<00:03:15.049> is<00:03:15.290> steady<00:03:15.590> aim<00:03:15.799> because

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
and my third perk is steady aim because

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.490 
and my third perk is steady aim because
again<00:03:17.359> it's<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.629> spray<00:03:17.900> gun<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.169> when<00:03:18.379> you're

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
again it's a spray gun and when you're

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.569 
again it's a spray gun and when you're
running<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.829> gunning<00:03:18.949> you<00:03:19.280> don't<00:03:19.430> always

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
running and gunning you don't always

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.729 
running and gunning you don't always
have<00:03:19.790> time<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.120> aim<00:03:20.239> down<00:03:20.389> the<00:03:20.449> sights<00:03:20.739> that's

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
have time to aim down the sights that's

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:22.869 
have time to aim down the sights that's
why<00:03:21.829> probably<00:03:22.010> sleight<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.370> hand<00:03:22.579> would<00:03:22.730> be<00:03:22.849> a

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
why probably sleight of hand would be a

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.479 
why probably sleight of hand would be a
good<00:03:23.560> suit<00:03:24.560> for<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.769> p90<00:03:25.129> since<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.400> can

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
good suit for the p90 since you can

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.119 
good suit for the p90 since you can
about<00:03:25.699> the<00:03:25.790> sights<00:03:25.970> anyway<00:03:26.269> pretty<00:03:26.480> quickly

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
about the sights anyway pretty quickly

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.800 
about the sights anyway pretty quickly
with<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.400> sliding<00:03:29.030> hand<00:03:29.239> would<00:03:29.359> just<00:03:29.569> go<00:03:29.690> up

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
with the sliding hand would just go up

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.170 
with the sliding hand would just go up
super<00:03:30.169> quick<00:03:30.379> so<00:03:31.129> those<00:03:31.639> are<00:03:31.730> my<00:03:31.790> perks<00:03:32.030> I

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
super quick so those are my perks I

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.189 
super quick so those are my perks I
thought<00:03:32.359> they<00:03:32.510> worked<00:03:32.720> out<00:03:32.840> pretty<00:03:32.959> well<00:03:33.079> for

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199 
thought they worked out pretty well for

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.890 
thought they worked out pretty well for
a<00:03:33.440> running<00:03:33.680> gun<00:03:33.889> class<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:34.519> I'm<00:03:35.120> Oda<00:03:35.389> c-130

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
a running gun class and I'm Oda c-130

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.470 
a running gun class and I'm Oda c-130
here<00:03:36.169> and<00:03:36.410> I<00:03:36.739> think<00:03:36.980> they<00:03:37.280> are<00:03:37.609> getting<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:38.060> nuke

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
here and I think they are getting a nuke

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.270 
here and I think they are getting a nuke
one<00:03:38.750> year<00:03:38.989> not<00:03:39.199> in<00:03:39.440> your<00:03:39.650> kill<00:03:39.829> streak<00:03:40.129> like

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
one year not in your kill streak like

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.860 
one year not in your kill streak like
you're<00:03:40.459> 11<00:03:40.760> kill<00:03:40.940> streak<00:03:41.180> I<00:03:41.359> think<00:03:41.690> that's<00:03:41.810> a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
you're 11 kill streak I think that's a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.000 
you're 11 kill streak I think that's a
little<00:03:41.989> bit<00:03:42.139> a<00:03:42.260> better<00:03:42.470> way<00:03:42.590> to<00:03:42.650> get<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:42.889> new

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
little bit a better way to get the new

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.439 
little bit a better way to get the new
you<00:03:43.160> think<00:03:43.400> it's<00:03:43.519> more<00:03:43.730> interesting<00:03:43.879> to<00:03:44.180> watch

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
you think it's more interesting to watch

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.659 
you think it's more interesting to watch
because<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:45.290> know<00:03:45.379> it's<00:03:45.560> just<00:03:45.709> not<00:03:45.919> because

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
because you know it's just not because

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:47.619 
because you know it's just not because
when<00:03:46.819> you're<00:03:46.910> in<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.030> h1<00:03:47.269> 30<00:03:47.449> you're

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
when you're in the h1 30 you're

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.089 
when you're in the h1 30 you're
completely<00:03:47.959> safe<00:03:48.169> or<00:03:48.470> depending<00:03:48.799> where<00:03:48.949> you

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
completely safe or depending where you

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.420 
completely safe or depending where you
called<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.549> in<00:03:49.699> and<00:03:50.680> this<00:03:51.680> way<00:03:51.889> he<00:03:51.919> kind<00:03:52.190> of<00:03:52.280> had

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
called it in and this way he kind of had

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.250 
called it in and this way he kind of had
that<00:03:52.549> pressure<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:53.120> like<00:03:53.269> if<00:03:53.419> you're<00:03:54.019> kind<00:03:54.199> of

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
that pressure of like if you're kind of

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.509 
that pressure of like if you're kind of
you're<00:03:54.379> close<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.859> so<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.250> don't<00:03:55.400> know<00:03:55.459> if

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
you're close to it so you don't know if

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.339 
you're close to it so you don't know if
you're<00:03:55.609> gonna<00:03:55.669> get<00:03:55.819> into<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:56.900> just
