to the Razr booth where we checking out
the<00:00:11.670> NZXT<00:00:12.259> s340<00:00:13.259> designed<00:00:13.830> by<00:00:14.160> Razer<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.849> you

the NZXT s340 designed by Razer so you

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.640 
the NZXT s340 designed by Razer so you
guys<00:00:15.059> probably<00:00:15.299> remember<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.809> H<00:00:15.990> 440

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
guys probably remember the H 440

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.540 
guys probably remember the H 440
designed<00:00:16.980> by<00:00:17.130> Razer

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
designed by Razer

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.120 
designed by Razer
this<00:00:17.850> one<00:00:18.090> looks<00:00:18.359> generally<00:00:19.109> similar<00:00:19.920> in

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
this one looks generally similar in

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.710 
this one looks generally similar in
terms<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> Razer<00:00:20.850> styling<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:21.510> we'll<00:00:21.630> get

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
terms of the Razer styling but we'll get

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.689 
terms of the Razer styling but we'll get
more<00:00:21.779> into<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.260> later<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.430> case

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
more into that later on this is a case

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.970 
more into that later on this is a case
that's<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.090> 25%<00:00:24.720> smaller<00:00:25.470> than<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.920> one

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that's about 25% smaller than that one

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.650 
that's about 25% smaller than that one
so<00:00:26.279> if<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.430> were<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> Razer<00:00:27.210> green

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
so if you were going for the Razer green

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.750 
so if you were going for the Razer green
theme<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.349> wanted<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> smaller<00:00:28.980> case<00:00:29.250> well

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
theme and but wanted a smaller case well

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.490 
theme and but wanted a smaller case well
here<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.810> case<00:00:31.080> will<00:00:31.260> probably

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
here you go this case will probably

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
underground - back in the day but I

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.080 
underground - back in the day but I
think<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.250> actually<00:02:10.310> looks<00:02:10.640> pretty<00:02:10.849> sick

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
think it actually looks pretty sick

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.850 
think it actually looks pretty sick
there's<00:02:11.269> green<00:02:11.450> under<00:02:11.720> glow<00:02:11.900> one<00:02:12.440> on<00:02:12.590> each

there's green under glow one on each

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.190 
there's green under glow one on each
kind<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.310> side<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.120> case<00:02:14.330> moving<00:02:15.080> to

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
kind of side of the case moving to

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.900 
kind of side of the case moving to
behind<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.799> motherboard<00:02:15.950> there's<00:02:16.400> not<00:02:16.519> a<00:02:16.549> ton

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
behind the motherboard there's not a ton

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.970 
behind the motherboard there's not a ton
going<00:02:16.940> on<00:02:17.480> here<00:02:17.810> there<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.110> bunch<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.650> loops

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
going on here there is a bunch of loops

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.589 
going on here there is a bunch of loops
for<00:02:19.310> zap<00:02:19.549> straps<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:20.299> manage<00:02:20.450> your

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
for zap straps so you can manage your

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.750 
for zap straps so you can manage your
cables<00:02:21.110> though<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:21.769> you<00:02:21.830> should<00:02:22.069> have<00:02:22.250> not<00:02:22.489> too

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
cables though so you should have not too

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.130 
cables though so you should have not too
bad<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.150> time<00:02:23.360> as<00:02:23.540> long<00:02:23.629> as<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.900> do<00:02:24.019> have

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
bad of a time as long as you do have

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.110 
bad of a time as long as you do have
some<00:02:24.319> sap<00:02:24.500> jobs<00:02:24.769> laying<00:02:25.010> around<00:02:25.160> one<00:02:26.030> thing

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
some sap jobs laying around one thing

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.670 
some sap jobs laying around one thing
that<00:02:26.299> I<00:02:26.330> must<00:02:26.510> say<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.989> I<00:02:27.019> like<00:02:27.290> about<00:02:27.470> this
