00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.020
 This has been a process that has 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.110
 taken around two weeks a 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:14.290
 process that has been designed between 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:19.539
 francisco palencia rafael bridge and his 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:22.779
 server in this process we had the idea 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.180
 first to generate a list a list 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.960
 of possible candidates for management 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.570
 chivas technique from that list 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.059
 we selected five people as well 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.089
 I 've already told you I 'm not going to say the 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.670
 names out of respect for those who are not 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.760
 today here 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.250
 those five people were interviewed 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.870
 for us at the end of the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.250
 interviews we analyze 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.559
 the kindnesses and differences that 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.469
 could have with each of them in 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.860
 case of being our technical manager 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:06.610
 and at the end of the day we decided 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.120
 after an in- depth analysis that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.360
 what carlos likes is 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.960
 ideal to carry out the works 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.960
 of this institution 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.560
 he is a practically scholar 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.570
 live with what we require 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.200
 here in chivas that is an offensive football 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.180
 and balanced in the part of in the part 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.210
 behind 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.690
 and because he makes an excellent group with his 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:39.340
 coaching staff demands players 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:43.020
 but at the same time convince them of the system 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.020
 tactical then it seems to me that 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.460
 the choice is the ideal one for the team 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.460
 at this time then 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.890
 If you want to hold 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.600
 someone if things do not change here 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.179
 they have three characters in front of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.000
 who can hold responsible for this 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.340
 situation we take in consensus in a 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.740
 absolute democracy this decision and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.360
 we are convinced that all in one 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.829
 same boat because we are more than 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.959
 united and very strong 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.489
 let's go to chivas or go to 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.489
 return to chivas to the first planes
