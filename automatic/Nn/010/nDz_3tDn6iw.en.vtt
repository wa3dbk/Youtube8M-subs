00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
in his mind that became the World

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.390 
in his mind that became the World
Heavyweight<00:01:39.689> Champion<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.009> think<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
Heavyweight Champion and I think that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.330 
Heavyweight Champion and I think that
