00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 udder 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.610
 hello hello to all here this man coc 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.820
 and I find you for the second 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.220
 village presentation video 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.320
 so this second village is us 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:33.600
 presented by gace pyromane levet 34 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.750
 leed money 3 996 trophy then this 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.399
 player belongs to jaguar clan then 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.770
 this is my little brother's plan and this 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.859
 player watched my video and asked me 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.590
 to present his village so that I 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:54.350
 outline the strengths and points 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.410
 weak of his village 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.899
 then all the subscribers of my channel 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.070
 can ask me to present their 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.960
 village as long as they are not max and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.720
 because it would be too easy 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.660
 no I laugh everyone can me 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.420
 ask to present his village 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.869
 even if he's not in the plans go 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.599
 we immediately go to the heart of the matter 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.679
 general presentation 

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:28.369
 this village is a village review defense 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:31.950
 then the rock village is a village 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.140
 which aims to lose the least amount of 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.880
 possible trophies and if possible to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:44.000
 win but it's difficult then 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:48.570
 the rock village has for peculiarity 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.850
 to have his town hall in the center of 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.189
 village not to lose a star 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.770
 beth or so as you can see 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:01.770
 it's a level 5 city hall with 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.899
 walls 4 and 3 removed then we 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.860
 part we go right to the points 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.940
 strong and weak points 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.099
 good then the big weak point of this 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.450
 village is unfortunately only the base 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.160
 is not symmetric then a base no 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.610
 symmetrical 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.290
 that is, there is a weak point 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.330
 any base that is not 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.069
 symmetrical a weak point ie 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.410
 that it is easier to the technique 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.959
 on one side than another for example a 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.120
 village breaks with walls 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.780
 totally symmetrical will have no weight 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.000
 fun this one there is one I'll let you 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:48.769
 guess it but it is rather easy to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.769
 see this weak point is this case 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:58.480
 because that's the little technical problem 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.490
 but if they sway sappers there and 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.070
 well it simply destroys two 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.040
 cells and goes back to the heart of the village to 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:12.360
 a wall of difference dumortier which 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:18.010
 is there then I explain myself the 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.660
 villages hd v5 the defensive building the 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.520
 more important and the mortar 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.870
 because he's doing zone damage and 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.110
 destroy everything in its path 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.090
 the archers the barbarians the goblins 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.950
 same legion 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.530
 so you have to protect it put it in 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.430
 the same cell where alone in a 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.830
 cell with City Hall as it is 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.420
 very important I repeat it must 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.230
 that it's centered on the village and 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.870
 that it covers the entire village 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:50.110
 so here he puts us in the cell 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.610
 central an air anti level 1 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:58.750
 why not Thursday but at this level and at 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.600
 this league especially league money 3 this 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.000
 does not serve much of yesterday 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.020
 nothing because it would surprise me that players 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.730
 of level 20 is it already dragons who 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.380
 will you do a massacre in your 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.680
 town 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.230
 so I propose wasting romagna that you 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.270
 take off your air anti for the 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:24.790
 replace by I do not know me the the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:30.900
 wizard tower or something else 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:33.940
 because or even removed the antiaircraft and 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.370
 retrieve walls to make a 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.080
 symmetrical base 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.669
 that's it but otherwise the base is good 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.610
 built all the defenses are at 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.210
 middle are in the village rather the 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.070
 reserves are protected because one can 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.440
 still do it with this type of village 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:56.320
 this type of arrival excuse me here is 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:59.430
 so after the ramparts are not 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.460
 maximized as a matter of fact 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.950
 level 4 and level 3 the age of the 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.610
 drawings that allows walls to 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.950
 level 5 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.330
 the walls of gold if you do not 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:15.660
 do not know she's asking for 30000 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:21.570
 gold which is not much I 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:23.940
 makes you say it because compared to 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.540
 battlements level 7 which are 1,200 miles 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.140
 it's more cotton to have them then I 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.290
 advise you to read you immediately to 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:39.540
 they fart do not because it's all about 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:41.550
 following an effect how to say of fear on 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.630
 the opponent when they see a village 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.830
 with all gilded with ramparts all 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.590
 level 5 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.440
 he'll say to himself oh here this one he got 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.540
 he had played its ranks not I 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.860
 not attack him and if I do not attack 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.890
 want to be feverish and I'm not going 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.530
 to achieve an optimal attack and so you 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:05.990
 as any many more defenses 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:09.500
 buddies so here's a tip always 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:13.560
 although I do not always do the 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.210
 have the ramparts of a single level by 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.850
 example there is one of the ramparts of 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.700
 level 3 and ramparts 2004 this makes 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:24.480
 a bit of a kit village or for 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:28.400
 the expression good otherwise this village is 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.720
 very well but it lacks the symmetry cpt 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.880
 go this representation please 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.880
 lacquered and subscribe you ciao
