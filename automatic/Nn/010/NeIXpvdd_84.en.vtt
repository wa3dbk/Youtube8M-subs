00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:13.049
 we find the soccer where we find it 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.100
 only in milk 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.859
 we have been bombarded for years by commercials 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.029
 advertising that indicated as a source 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.849
 main calcium milk and cheese 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.849
 we are very careful it is true that the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.160
 milk and certain types of cheese 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.700
 they contain high amounts of calcium we must 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 but try to understand if actually 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:43.140
 this calcium is assimilated into the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.870
 our body or not and we are now 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 and several studies indicating that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 the highest incidence of osteoporosis is 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.070
 present in the populations they consume 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.570
 paradoxically so much milk and so many 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.250
 milk derivatives as explained 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.170
 this paradox may be various 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.340
 mechanisms there are theories that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.570
 they say that drinking and eating products 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.930
 vaccines lead to acidification 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.210
 tissue 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.560
 the eight classes are cells appointed to 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.890
 reabsorption therefore real 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.900
 destruction of our bones for 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.270
 recover the calcium contained in them 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.560
 so when our body has to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.040
 dab the acidity produced by food 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.600
 acids is literally destroyed 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.600
 part of our bone to release 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.340
 calcium and buffer this state of ph 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.220
 other other arguments a lot 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.700
 important is that very often who does 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.049
 much use of nonsololatte but foods of 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.759
 animal origin one forgets that one must 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.640
 eat at the same time for 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.909
 absorb calcium even high doses of 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.129
 Vitamin C and Vitamin K Vitamin K is 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.149
 contained in very large quantities in 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.430
 crucifers in ca 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.329
 in short, with acen and cabbage 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.159
 leafy vegetables and is a vitamin 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:22.110
 essential for calcium absorption 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:23.610
 very important factors in the bones then 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.200
 never to forget for the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.420
 osteoporosis prevention for 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.040
 calcium intake is exercise 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.920
 physical that needs to be done 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.409
 daily it is an exposure to the sun 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.689
 adequate that can be on average also 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:41.819
 5 and 10 minutes a day and that too 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.739
 in the coldest periods in ours 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.609
 latitudes normally more than 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:51.120
 enough if on all these things that 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:54.269
 we said there is some doubt of 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.000
 shortage you can do a simple exam 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.489
 hematic measuring itself to the calcemia is the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.239
 Vitamin D is that of tamina that 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.780
 together with soccer it becomes part 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.829
 of bone bone formation 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.829
 of bone health
