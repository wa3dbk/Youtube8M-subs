cydia<00:01:16.049> pop<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:16.799> away<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.640> i<00:01:17.790> go<00:01:18.000> into

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
cydia pop up right away if i go into

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.120 
cydia pop up right away if i go into
cydia<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.930> going<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.320> rid<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.740> see
