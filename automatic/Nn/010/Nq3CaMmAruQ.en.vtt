now<00:00:03.210> that<00:00:03.419> we<00:00:03.510> have<00:00:03.720> all<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.259> information

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
now that we have all of the information

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.710 
now that we have all of the information
to<00:00:05.130> figure<00:00:05.279> out<00:00:05.549> how<00:00:05.790> many<00:00:05.970> stitches<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.540> need

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
to figure out how many stitches we need

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.450 
to figure out how many stitches we need
to<00:00:06.839> come<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.259> how<00:00:07.440> many<00:00:07.589> stitch<00:00:07.770> repeats<00:00:08.189> and

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
to come in how many stitch repeats and

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.400 
to come in how many stitch repeats and
then<00:00:08.730> how<00:00:08.820> many<00:00:08.880> stitches<00:00:09.210> repeats<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:09.809> have

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
then how many stitches repeats we have

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.169 
then how many stitches repeats we have
to<00:00:10.559> decrease<00:00:10.860> over<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.490> points<00:00:11.940> we<00:00:12.059> have

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
to decrease over to what points we have

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.450 
to decrease over to what points we have
all<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.719> little<00:00:13.019> intricate<00:00:14.009> shaping

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
all of this little intricate shaping

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.609 
all of this little intricate shaping
that's<00:00:14.639> happened<00:00:15.030> down<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.450> area<00:00:15.630> how

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
that's happened down in this area how

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.279 
that's happened down in this area how
deep<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.609> we<00:00:17.789> make<00:00:18.029> our<00:00:18.240> armhole<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.050> what

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
deep do we make our armhole and what

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.170 
deep do we make our armhole and what
that<00:00:19.470> means<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.800> literally<00:00:20.250> where<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.029> it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
that means is literally where is it

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.000 
that means is literally where is it
going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.420> fall<00:00:21.570> from<00:00:21.810> our<00:00:22.020> shoulder<00:00:22.410> point<00:00:22.710> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
going to fall from our shoulder point to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.980 
going to fall from our shoulder point to
our<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> top<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.300> our<00:00:24.390> armhole<00:00:24.810> because

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
our to the top of our armhole because

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.089 
our to the top of our armhole because
you<00:00:25.080> don't<00:00:25.230> want<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.410> right<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.830> on<00:00:25.920> your

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
you don't want it right up on your

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.769 
you don't want it right up on your
armpit<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
armpit and this is so this is the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.540 
armpit and this is so this is the
armhole<00:00:28.320> height<00:00:28.560> then<00:00:28.769> we<00:00:28.859> talked<00:00:29.160> about<00:00:29.400> that

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
armhole height then we talked about that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.730 
armhole height then we talked about that
a<00:00:29.609> little<00:00:29.760> bit<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> fit<00:00:30.900> your<00:00:31.140> measurement

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
a little bit in the fit your measurement

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.830 
a little bit in the fit your measurement
section<00:00:32.189> where<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.149> measured<00:00:33.450> yourself

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
section where we measured yourself

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.000 
section where we measured yourself
because<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.140> actually<00:00:34.320> measured<00:00:34.890> your

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
because you actually measured your

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.770 
because you actually measured your
armhole<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.730> measured<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.300> top<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.630> your

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
armhole and you measured the top of your

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.889 
armhole and you measured the top of your
bra<00:00:36.989> band<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:38.160> between<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.360> armhole

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
bra band so between the armhole

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.540 
bra band so between the armhole
measurement<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> top<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> your<00:00:41.100> shoulder

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
measurement and the top of your shoulder

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.660 
measurement and the top of your shoulder
that's<00:00:41.850> how<00:00:42.059> deep<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.690> want<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:43.170> sweater

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.470 
that's how deep you want your sweater
conveniently<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.910> have<00:00:45.090> our<00:00:45.239> favorite

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
conveniently we have our favorite

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
conveniently we have our favorite
sweater<00:00:45.870> measurement<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> kind<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:46.860> off<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
sweater measurement to kind of go off of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
sweater measurement to kind of go off of
but<00:00:47.550> I'm<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> let<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.300> something

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
but I'm going to let you know something

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
but I'm going to let you know something
I've<00:00:49.260> learned<00:00:49.559> over<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> last<00:00:50.100> three<00:00:50.670> or<00:00:50.760> four

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
I've learned over the last three or four

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.090 
I've learned over the last three or four
years<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.329> designing<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.860> bit<00:00:52.980> of

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
years of designing is a little bit of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.860 
years of designing is a little bit of
information<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.670> my<00:00:53.910> tech<00:00:54.149> editor<00:00:54.329> gave<00:00:54.660> me

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
information that my tech editor gave me

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.799 
information that my tech editor gave me
and<00:00:55.050> she<00:00:55.260> will<00:00:55.469> never<00:00:55.710> size<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> garment<00:00:57.360> past

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and she will never size a garment past

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.439 
and she will never size a garment past
ten<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.590> half<00:00:58.770> inches<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.730> her<00:00:59.969> armhole

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
ten and a half inches for her armhole

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.240 
ten and a half inches for her armhole
depth<00:01:00.690> because<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.829> gets<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.100> little

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
depth because then it just gets a little

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.280 
depth because then it just gets a little
bit<00:01:02.460> too<00:01:02.640> low<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> it'll<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> start<00:01:04.110> like

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
bit too low and it it'll to start like

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.500 
bit too low and it it'll to start like
mid<00:01:04.589> boob<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:06.060> an<00:01:06.299> attractive

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
mid boob and it's just not an attractive

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.210 
mid boob and it's just not an attractive
look<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> mean<00:01:07.680> you'll<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.860> sloppy

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
look and so you mean you'll have sloppy

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.219 
look and so you mean you'll have sloppy
sleeves<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:09.299> not<00:01:09.510> good<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.110> more

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
sleeves it's not good so the more

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.899 
sleeves it's not good so the more
tailored<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:11.010> make<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.340> arm<00:01:11.520> hole<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
tailored you can make your arm hole the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.179 
tailored you can make your arm hole the
better<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.720> would<00:01:13.049> say<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:13.619> go<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
better so I would say don't go all the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.859 
better so I would say don't go all the
way<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.340> ten<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> half<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> don't<00:01:15.630> have

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
way to ten and a half if you don't have

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.490 
way to ten and a half if you don't have
to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.039 
to
I<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:17.130> prefer<00:01:17.580> 9<00:01:18.150> inches<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.720> know<00:01:18.780> that

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
I actually prefer 9 inches I know that

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.649 
I actually prefer 9 inches I know that
that<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.500> custom<00:01:19.979> figure<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.640> me<00:01:20.970> my<00:01:21.299> body

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that is my custom figure for me my body

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.960 
that is my custom figure for me my body
these<00:01:22.380> are<00:01:22.590> numbers<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
these are numbers that you are going to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.999 
these are numbers that you are going to
use<00:01:24.240> based<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.259> favorite<00:01:25.500> sweater
