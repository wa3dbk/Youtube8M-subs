hi I'm Matthew from workshop Evan today
we're<00:00:10.680> going<00:00:10.799> to<00:00:10.860> have<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> look<00:00:11.129> at<00:00:11.219> sharpen

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
we're going to have a look at sharpen

we're going to have a look at sharpen
start<00:00:12.980> off<00:00:13.070> with<00:00:13.220> a<00:00:13.280> little<00:00:13.460> bit<00:00:13.550> of<00:00:13.580> theory

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
start off with a little bit of theory

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.780 
start off with a little bit of theory
and<00:00:14.150> then<00:00:14.870> we'll<00:00:15.020> go<00:00:15.110> on<00:00:15.290> to<00:00:15.680> do<00:00:16.370> a<00:00:16.400> bit<00:00:16.700> of

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
and then we'll go on to do a bit of

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.109 
and then we'll go on to do a bit of
practical<00:00:18.040> okay<00:00:19.040> a<00:00:19.190> couple<00:00:19.520> of<00:00:19.700> example

hopefully you can see if I can get the
light<00:00:43.790> right<00:00:44.060> that<00:00:45.019> there's<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.519> small

grinding<00:00:55.760> marks<00:00:56.059> on<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:58.370> that's<00:00:58.609> what

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
grinding marks on it so that's what

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.540 
grinding marks on it so that's what
concave<00:00:59.539> backs<00:00:59.870> are<00:01:00.050> there<00:01:00.199> to<00:01:00.350> achieve<00:01:00.550> if

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
concave backs are there to achieve if

this<00:01:01.730> was<00:01:01.879> flat<00:01:02.179> you'd<00:01:02.449> need<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.750> polish<00:01:03.019> the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
this was flat you'd need to polish the

this was flat you'd need to polish the
entire<00:01:03.530> surface<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.930> every<00:01:05.930> time<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.290> wanted

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
entire surface and every time you wanted

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.680 
entire surface and every time you wanted
to<00:01:06.830> polish<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.790> underside<00:01:08.180> of<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.390> cutting

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
to polish the underside of the cutting

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.660 
to polish the underside of the cutting
bevel<00:01:08.990> you'd<00:01:09.380> need<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.710> remove<00:01:09.980> material<00:01:10.160> over

concavity in the length of the chisel

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.940 
concavity in the length of the chisel
allows<00:01:17.510> us<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.810> polish<00:01:18.110> just<00:01:18.410> this<00:01:18.530> area

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
allows us to polish just this area

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.200 
allows us to polish just this area
underneath<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.460> cutting<00:01:19.790> edge<00:01:19.910> where<00:01:20.120> we

on<00:01:21.980> the<00:01:22.130> amount<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.490> work<00:01:22.640> that<00:01:22.760> we<00:01:22.820> need<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.060> do

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500

the concavity is so slight that it won't

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.470 
the concavity is so slight that it won't
affect<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.750> accuracy<00:01:27.260> of<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.440> tool<00:01:28.300> on<00:01:29.300> the

that<00:02:02.780> gets<00:02:03.050> too<00:02:03.290> big<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.340> just<00:02:04.550> go<00:02:04.640> back<00:02:04.850> and

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
that gets too big you just go back and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.540 
that gets too big you just go back and
grind<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.360> primary<00:02:05.750> bevel<00:02:05.930> and<00:02:06.340> reduce<00:02:07.340> that

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
grind the primary bevel and reduce that

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.130 
grind the primary bevel and reduce that
down<00:02:07.820> again<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.300> about<00:02:08.450> half<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.780> millimeter

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
down again to about half a millimeter

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.009 
down again to about half a millimeter
and<00:02:09.560> then<00:02:10.129> start<00:02:10.429> honing<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.789> honing<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.870> back

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
and then start honing and honing it back

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.240 
and then start honing and honing it back
up<00:02:12.170> again<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.870> can<00:02:15.140> get<00:02:15.379> probably<00:02:15.980> eight

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
up again so you can get probably eight

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.960 
up again so you can get probably eight
or<00:02:16.430> ten<00:02:16.610> honing<00:02:17.540> 's<00:02:17.709> out<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.010> chisel<00:02:19.370> before

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
or ten honing 's out of a chisel before

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.610 
or ten honing 's out of a chisel before
you<00:02:20.090> need<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.330> regrind<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.780> primary<00:02:21.170> bevel

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
you need to regrind the primary bevel

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.990 
you need to regrind the primary bevel
okay<00:02:25.160> if<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.400> place<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:28.080> new<00:02:28.530> narcs<00:02:29.489> this

this piece of float glass and just grab
a<00:02:37.920> feeler<00:02:38.340> gauge<00:02:38.519> I<00:02:38.910> will<00:02:39.780> start<00:02:40.019> off<00:02:40.230> with<00:02:40.500> a

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.750 

this<00:02:51.239> should<00:02:51.720> not<00:02:52.709> slide<00:02:53.040> enter<00:02:53.370> at<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.489> tip

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
this should not slide enter at the tip

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.720 
this should not slide enter at the tip
and<00:02:54.079> it<00:02:55.079> will<00:02:55.319> slide<00:02:55.680> under<00:02:55.890> in<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.459> middle

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
and it will slide under in the middle

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.680 
and it will slide under in the middle
and<00:02:57.950> then<00:02:58.950> not<00:02:59.220> again<00:02:59.519> up<00:02:59.670> here<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.120> we<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.390> see

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
and then not again up here so we can see

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.620 
and then not again up here so we can see
that<00:03:00.840> we've<00:03:00.959> got<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.170> concavity<00:03:01.590> there<00:03:02.420> we<00:03:03.420> try

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
that we've got a concavity there we try

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.720 
that we've got a concavity there we try
a<00:03:03.660> three<00:03:04.049> ther<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:05.549> just<00:03:06.030> getting<00:03:06.360> under

a three ther the just getting under
again<00:03:08.730> not<00:03:08.940> at<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.180> tip<00:03:09.420> fourth<00:03:10.079> ow<00:03:11.930> that's

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.809 

not<00:03:16.379> really<00:03:16.709> having<00:03:16.950> very<00:03:17.129> much<00:03:17.280> luck<00:03:17.340> at<00:03:17.640> all

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
not really having very much luck at all

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.330 
not really having very much luck at all
and<00:03:18.120> at<00:03:18.420> 6:00<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:19.739> straight<00:03:20.010> up<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.220> down

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
and at 6:00 it's straight up and down

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.069 
and at 6:00 it's straight up and down
the<00:03:20.519> side<00:03:21.200> so<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:22.709> it's<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.430> very<00:03:23.459> very<00:03:24.079> small

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
the side so it's it's a very very small

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.170 
the side so it's it's a very very small

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:15.229 
backs we want a unilateral tolerance so

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.960 
backs we want a unilateral tolerance so
one<00:04:16.229> direction<00:04:16.709> only<00:04:16.799> want<00:04:17.280> them<00:04:17.400> very

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
one direction only want them very

slightly<00:04:18.269> concave<00:04:18.599> if<00:04:19.139> they're<00:04:19.979> convex<00:04:20.459> then

slightly concave if they're convex then

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.180 
slightly concave if they're convex then
you<00:04:21.750> end<00:04:21.900> up<00:04:21.989> with<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.139> bump<00:04:22.349> in<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.560> back<00:04:22.650> that

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
you end up with a bump in the back that

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.129 
you end up with a bump in the back that
becomes<00:04:24.060> self-perpetuating

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
becomes self-perpetuating

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.809 
becomes self-perpetuating
so<00:04:25.409> just<00:04:25.770> get<00:04:25.919> worse<00:04:26.129> and<00:04:26.340> worse<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.520> worse

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
so just get worse and worse and worse

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.909 
so just get worse and worse and worse
until<00:04:26.849> you<00:04:27.210> do<00:04:27.300> something<00:04:27.599> about<00:04:27.689> it<00:04:27.870> it's<00:04:28.830> not

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
until you do something about it it's not

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
it's more work than a concave one let me

it's more work than a concave one let me
show<00:04:35.039> you<00:04:35.099> what<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.310> mean

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
show you what I mean

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.260 
show you what I mean
okay<00:04:37.949> if<00:04:38.039> we<00:04:38.159> take<00:04:38.310> this<00:04:38.430> board<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.849> represent

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
okay if we take this board to represent

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.969 
okay if we take this board to represent
our<00:04:39.449> sharpening<00:04:40.199> surface<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:42.000> can<00:04:42.150> see<00:04:42.830> if<00:04:43.830> I

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
our sharpening surface you can see if I

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.899 
our sharpening surface you can see if I
place<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.490> chisel<00:04:44.939> with<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.389> bump<00:04:45.689> in<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:46.909> onto

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
place a chisel with a bump in it onto

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.520 
place a chisel with a bump in it onto
there<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.990> then<00:04:49.199> we<00:04:49.319> try<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.740> hone<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:51.530> we're

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
there and then we try and hone it we're

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.129 
there and then we try and hone it we're
working<00:04:52.979> not<00:04:53.490> only<00:04:53.520> on<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.509> bump<00:04:54.750> shown<00:04:54.990> in

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
working not only on the bump shown in

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.860 
working not only on the bump shown in
green<00:04:55.409> but<00:04:56.400> we<00:04:56.550> also<00:04:56.699> got<00:04:56.969> a<00:04:57.030> remove<00:04:57.300> material

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
green but we also got a remove material

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.649 
green but we also got a remove material
from<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.169> area<00:04:58.469> shown<00:04:58.710> in<00:04:58.889> red<00:04:59.389> so<00:05:00.389> we<00:05:00.419> can

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
from the area shown in red so we can

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.119 
from the area shown in red so we can
work<00:05:00.810> away<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.289> work<00:05:01.439> away<00:05:01.620> and<00:05:01.860> work<00:05:01.979> away

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
work away and work away and work away

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.219 
work away and work away and work away
and<00:05:02.490> we're<00:05:02.639> going<00:05:02.759> to<00:05:02.819> spend<00:05:03.060> absolutely<00:05:03.779> ages

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
and we're going to spend absolutely ages

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.200 
and we're going to spend absolutely ages
trying<00:05:04.949> to<00:05:05.159> remove<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:05.580> bump<00:05:05.879> because<00:05:06.000> we're

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
trying to remove that bump because we're

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.929 
trying to remove that bump because we're
doing<00:05:06.270> twice<00:05:06.479> as<00:05:06.539> much<00:05:06.810> work<00:05:06.990> as<00:05:07.139> we<00:05:07.259> need<00:05:07.439> to

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:07.939 
doing twice as much work as we need to

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.129 
doing twice as much work as we need to
if<00:05:08.939> you<00:05:09.060> do<00:05:09.180> get<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.389> bump<00:05:09.599> in<00:05:09.719> the<00:05:09.779> back<00:05:09.930> of<00:05:10.050> your

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
if you do get a bump in the back of your

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.309 
if you do get a bump in the back of your
chisel<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:11.310> best<00:05:11.520> bet<00:05:11.789> is<00:05:12.210> to<00:05:12.270> invert<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.810> and

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
chisel the best bet is to invert it and

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.480 
chisel the best bet is to invert it and
use<00:05:14.279> something<00:05:14.550> like<00:05:14.759> this<00:05:14.969> a<00:05:15.240> narrow<00:05:16.490> diamond

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
use something like this a narrow diamond

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.820 
use something like this a narrow diamond
file<00:05:17.789> and<00:05:18.779> just<00:05:19.080> work<00:05:19.259> on<00:05:19.379> the<00:05:19.500> bump<00:05:19.710> in

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
file and just work on the bump in

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.920 
file and just work on the bump in
isolation<00:05:20.490> that<00:05:20.669> way<00:05:21.539> you're<00:05:21.750> going<00:05:21.900> to

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
isolation that way you're going to

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.570 
isolation that way you're going to
remove<00:05:21.990> only<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.830> material<00:05:23.340> that<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.550> need

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
remove only the material that you need

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.649 
remove only the material that you need
to<00:05:24.029> to<00:05:24.960> get<00:05:25.110> back<00:05:25.349> to<00:05:25.590> a<00:05:26.360> flat<00:05:27.360> or<00:05:27.539> slightly

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
to to get back to a flat or slightly

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.610 
to to get back to a flat or slightly
concave<00:05:28.080> surface<00:05:30.139> the<00:05:31.139> other<00:05:31.169> problem<00:05:31.529> with

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
concave surface the other problem with

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.860 
concave surface the other problem with
bumps<00:05:31.979> is<00:05:32.159> that<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.520> chisel<00:05:32.699> won't<00:05:33.180> cut<00:05:33.479> as

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
bumps is that the chisel won't cut as

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.269 
bumps is that the chisel won't cut as
you<00:05:33.930> can<00:05:34.139> see<00:05:34.349> there's<00:05:34.589> a<00:05:34.620> gap<00:05:34.830> underneath

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
you can see there's a gap underneath

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:36.800 
you can see there's a gap underneath
there<00:05:35.520> so<00:05:35.729> if<00:05:35.849> you're<00:05:35.940> trying<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.180> pare<00:05:36.449> across

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
there so if you're trying to pare across

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.619 
there so if you're trying to pare across
a<00:05:36.839> an<00:05:37.139> existing<00:05:37.949> flat<00:05:38.159> surface<00:05:38.699> you're<00:05:39.599> going

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:39.629 
a an existing flat surface you're going

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.230 
a an existing flat surface you're going
to<00:05:39.900> miss<00:05:40.169> anything<00:05:41.039> that's<00:05:41.219> lower<00:05:41.699> than<00:05:42.000> the

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
to miss anything that's lower than the

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.659 
to miss anything that's lower than the
tip<00:05:42.509> of<00:05:42.629> the<00:05:42.690> chisel<00:05:43.190> if<00:05:44.190> you're<00:05:44.370> trying<00:05:44.580> to

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
tip of the chisel if you're trying to

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.189 
tip of the chisel if you're trying to
sharpen<00:05:45.060> and<00:05:45.240> you're<00:05:45.330> applying<00:05:45.569> pressure<00:05:45.900> at

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
sharpen and you're applying pressure at

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.469 
sharpen and you're applying pressure at
the<00:05:46.349> tip<00:05:46.589> of<00:05:46.710> the<00:05:46.830> chisel<00:05:47.190> all<00:05:48.120> you're<00:05:48.360> going

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
the tip of the chisel all you're going

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.719 
the tip of the chisel all you're going
to<00:05:48.539> do<00:05:48.719> is<00:05:48.900> make<00:05:49.139> that<00:05:49.319> bump<00:05:49.620> worse<00:05:49.889> so<00:05:50.520> every

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
to do is make that bump worse so every

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.559 
to do is make that bump worse so every
time<00:05:50.909> you<00:05:51.060> make<00:05:51.240> a<00:05:51.289> short<00:05:52.289> cut<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:53.569> apply

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
time you make a short cut and apply

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:56.809 
time you make a short cut and apply
pressure<00:05:54.779> at<00:05:55.289> the<00:05:55.469> the<00:05:56.039> front<00:05:56.250> of<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.490> chisel

00:05:56.809 --> 00:05:56.819 
pressure at the the front of the chisel

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.360 
pressure at the the front of the chisel
the<00:05:57.000> back<00:05:57.180> lifts<00:05:57.629> and<00:05:58.169> away<00:05:58.680> you<00:05:58.710> go<00:05:58.860> making

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
the back lifts and away you go making

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.589 
the back lifts and away you go making
your<00:05:59.490> bump<00:05:59.699> worse<00:05:59.849> and<00:06:00.060> worse<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.389> worse

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
your bump worse and worse and worse

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.179 
your bump worse and worse and worse
until<00:06:01.110> eventually<00:06:01.229> it's<00:06:01.650> a<00:06:01.710> really<00:06:01.919> huge

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.189 
until eventually it's a really huge

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:04.969 
until eventually it's a really huge
noticeable<00:06:02.819> horrible<00:06:03.210> thing<00:06:03.419> and<00:06:03.680> you<00:06:04.680> end<00:06:04.860> up

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
noticeable horrible thing and you end up

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.350 
noticeable horrible thing and you end up
sticking<00:06:05.189> money<00:06:05.400> by<00:06:05.669> for<00:06:05.849> somebody<00:06:06.089> else<00:06:06.240> to

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
sticking money by for somebody else to

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.480 
sticking money by for somebody else to
worry<00:06:06.539> about

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
worry about

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.140 
worry about
not<00:06:08.490> that<00:06:08.639> anyone<00:06:08.849> would<00:06:08.969> do<00:06:09.089> that<00:06:11.120> with<00:06:12.120> a

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
not that anyone would do that with a

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.670 
not that anyone would do that with a
concave<00:06:12.629> chisel<00:06:13.219> in<00:06:14.219> comparison<00:06:15.680> your

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
tip which is the bit that we want to

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.550 
tip which is the bit that we want to
polish<00:06:21.479> the<00:06:21.750> underside<00:06:22.110> of<00:06:22.139> this<00:06:22.319> cutting

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
polish the underside of this cutting

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.959 
polish the underside of this cutting

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
move this back you can see as we draw

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.670 
move this back you can see as we draw
that<00:06:30.599> off<00:06:31.250> the<00:06:32.250> honing<00:06:32.639> medium<00:06:33.529> that<00:06:34.529> that

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.120 
angle is getting shallower and shallower
and<00:06:36.719> shallower

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
and shallower

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.159 
and shallower
so<00:06:39.130> as<00:06:39.280> we<00:06:39.400> get<00:06:39.550> back<00:06:39.729> to<00:06:39.910> here<00:06:40.150> and<00:06:40.449> it's<00:06:41.050> only

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
so as we get back to here and it's only

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.070 
so as we get back to here and it's only
referencing<00:06:41.740> between<00:06:42.069> these<00:06:42.280> two<00:06:42.520> points

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
referencing between these two points

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.710 
referencing between these two points
you're<00:06:44.080> almost<00:06:44.560> just<00:06:45.280> polishing<00:06:46.240> on<00:06:46.330> a<00:06:46.360> slight

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
you're almost just polishing on a slight

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.040 
you're almost just polishing on a slight
angle<00:06:48.150> you<00:06:49.150> are<00:06:49.180> going<00:06:49.360> to<00:06:49.539> remove<00:06:49.780> a<00:06:49.840> little

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
angle you are going to remove a little

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.260 
angle you are going to remove a little
bit<00:06:50.199> of<00:06:50.319> material<00:06:50.919> along<00:06:51.550> the<00:06:51.699> center<00:06:52.060> of<00:06:52.180> the

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
bit of material along the center of the

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.230 
bit of material along the center of the
chisel<00:06:52.630> as<00:06:52.780> it<00:06:52.930> slides<00:06:53.229> off<00:06:53.410> the<00:06:53.440> edge<00:06:53.710> of<00:06:53.889> the

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
chisel as it slides off the edge of the

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.570 
chisel as it slides off the edge of the
honing<00:06:55.240> medium<00:06:55.630> but<00:06:56.590> the<00:06:56.650> majority<00:06:57.220> of<00:06:57.250> it<00:06:57.460> is

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
honing medium but the majority of it is

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.990 
honing medium but the majority of it is
going<00:06:57.849> to<00:06:57.940> be<00:06:58.030> removed<00:06:58.419> just<00:06:59.169> under<00:06:59.500> the<00:06:59.590> tip

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
going to be removed just under the tip

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.379 
going to be removed just under the tip
so<00:07:01.080> your<00:07:02.080> chisel<00:07:02.470> tip<00:07:02.680> is<00:07:02.919> jigged<00:07:03.370> and<00:07:03.610> that's

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389 
so your chisel tip is jigged and that's

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.110 
so your chisel tip is jigged and that's
where<00:07:04.569> the<00:07:04.690> majority<00:07:04.780> of<00:07:05.199> the<00:07:05.319> the<00:07:06.060> metal<00:07:07.060> is

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
where the majority of the the metal is

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.760 
where the majority of the the metal is
going<00:07:07.150> to<00:07:07.300> come<00:07:07.509> off<00:07:07.690> so<00:07:08.319> your<00:07:08.500> Hollow<00:07:08.680> is

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
going to come off so your Hollow is

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.080 
going to come off so your Hollow is
gradually<00:07:09.250> going<00:07:09.370> to<00:07:09.430> get<00:07:09.550> finer<00:07:09.789> and<00:07:10.060> finer

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
gradually going to get finer and finer

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.339 
gradually going to get finer and finer
but<00:07:10.509> it's<00:07:10.660> never<00:07:10.870> going<00:07:11.020> to<00:07:11.080> go<00:07:11.229> away

00:07:11.339 --> 00:07:11.349 
but it's never going to go away

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:16.680 
but it's never going to go away
altogether<00:07:14.099> and<00:07:15.099> that<00:07:15.430> will<00:07:15.610> result<00:07:15.910> in<00:07:16.210> a

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690 
altogether and that will result in a

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.390 
altogether and that will result in a
polished<00:07:17.199> underside<00:07:17.710> of<00:07:17.740> the<00:07:17.919> cutting<00:07:18.250> edge

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
polished underside of the cutting edge

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.120 
polished underside of the cutting edge
and<00:07:19.259> you<00:07:20.259> still<00:07:20.710> going<00:07:20.830> to<00:07:20.889> have<00:07:21.009> your

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130 
and you still going to have your

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.879 
and you still going to have your
grinding<00:07:21.400> marks<00:07:21.669> back<00:07:21.849> up<00:07:22.000> here<00:07:22.530> so<00:07:23.530> that's

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:23.889 
grinding marks back up here so that's

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:26.249 
grinding marks back up here so that's
what<00:07:24.070> we<00:07:24.160> got<00:07:24.340> in<00:07:24.550> the<00:07:25.030> Ashley<00:07:25.660> ours<00:07:25.810> chisel

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:26.259 
what we got in the Ashley ours chisel

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:28.439 
what we got in the Ashley ours chisel
that<00:07:26.590> we<00:07:26.710> looked<00:07:26.889> at<00:07:27.009> earlier<00:07:27.310> on<00:07:27.370> so<00:07:28.120> you<00:07:28.180> got

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:28.449 
that we looked at earlier on so you got

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:31.469 
that we looked at earlier on so you got
polish<00:07:28.960> at<00:07:29.080> the<00:07:29.169> tip<00:07:29.409> and<00:07:29.620> then<00:07:30.520> grinding<00:07:31.240> mark

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:31.479 
polish at the tip and then grinding mark

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:32.580 
polish at the tip and then grinding mark
still<00:07:31.690> up<00:07:31.780> here<00:07:31.900> you<00:07:32.020> might<00:07:32.169> get<00:07:32.259> a<00:07:32.320> little<00:07:32.409> bit

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:32.590 
still up here you might get a little bit

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.920 
still up here you might get a little bit
of<00:07:32.710> polishing<00:07:33.039> goes<00:07:33.190> up<00:07:33.340> on<00:07:33.520> up<00:07:33.729> here<00:07:33.940> but<00:07:34.720> the

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:34.930 
of polishing goes up on up here but the

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.600 
of polishing goes up on up here but the
majority<00:07:35.050> of<00:07:35.409> the<00:07:35.590> work<00:07:35.770> is<00:07:35.919> going<00:07:35.979> into<00:07:36.400> the

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:36.610 
majority of the work is going into the

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.700 
majority of the work is going into the
bit<00:07:36.759> that<00:07:36.909> we<00:07:37.000> want<00:07:37.180> to<00:07:37.300> actually<00:07:37.630> work<00:07:38.530> on

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
bit that we want to actually work on

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.180 
bit that we want to actually work on
polish<00:07:39.990> right<00:07:40.990> let's<00:07:41.500> have<00:07:41.650> a<00:07:41.680> go<00:07:41.830> at<00:07:41.949> that<00:07:42.039> in

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.190 
polish right let's have a go at that in

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:51.999 
polish right let's have a go at that in
practice

00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:52.009 

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:54.069
