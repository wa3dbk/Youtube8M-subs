00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.300

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.310 
she asked us what our sizes were
beforehand<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.610> guess<00:01:26.850> I'm<00:01:27.240> building<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
beforehand I guess I'm building a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.109 
beforehand I guess I'm building a
pattern<00:01:28.770> from<00:01:28.920> scratch<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.549> really<00:01:29.970> really

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
pattern from scratch is really really

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.760 
pattern from scratch is really really
difficult<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.840> what<00:01:30.990> she<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.439> did<00:01:31.590> was

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
difficult so what she kind of did was

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.730 
difficult so what she kind of did was
she<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:31.979> asked<00:01:32.280> when<00:01:32.369> our<00:01:32.460> sizes<00:01:32.880> were<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
she just asked when our sizes were and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
she just asked when our sizes were and
made<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.950> patterns<00:01:35.340> herself<00:01:35.790> along<00:01:36.180> with<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
made the patterns herself along with the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.819 
made the patterns herself along with the
owner<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> shop<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.200> when<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.439> got<00:01:37.619> there

bought this in Brixton um but just to
show<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:49.280> finished<00:02:50.280> one<00:02:50.580> um<00:02:51.709> this<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.890> what

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
show you a finished one um this is what

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.860 
show you a finished one um this is what
of<00:02:53.099> course<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.519> looks<00:02:53.550> like<00:02:53.940> I'm<00:02:54.420> not<00:02:54.629> going<00:02:54.810> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
of course it looks like I'm not going to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.290 
of course it looks like I'm not going to
put<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.110> on<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.220> look<00:02:56.340> damn<00:02:56.519> good<00:02:56.670> in<00:02:56.879> it<00:02:57.090> and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
put it on but I look damn good in it and

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.619 
put it on but I look damn good in it and
so<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.739> course<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:59.310> typically<00:02:59.849> is<00:03:00.030> made<00:03:00.390> out<00:03:00.599> of

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
so of course it typically is made out of

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.839 
so of course it typically is made out of
four<00:03:00.959> layers<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.860> your<00:03:01.890> outer<00:03:02.280> layers<00:03:02.610> you

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
four layers to your outer layers you

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.130 
four layers to your outer layers you
have<00:03:02.970> two<00:03:03.150> inner<00:03:03.330> layers<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:03.840> then<00:03:04.019> you're

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
have two inner layers and then you're

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.199 
have two inner layers and then you're
lining<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:05.190> this<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.370> what<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:05.580> mean<00:03:05.790> when<00:03:05.909> I<00:03:05.970> say

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
lining so this is what I mean when I say

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.600 
lining so this is what I mean when I say
the<00:03:06.390> lining<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:06.989> then<00:03:07.409> also<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:08.099> can<00:03:08.430> have

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
the lining and then also you can have

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.369 
the lining and then also you can have
trim<00:03:08.970> which<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.269> different<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:09.900> this<00:03:10.080> is<00:03:10.230> your

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
trim which is different so this is your

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.339 
trim which is different so this is your
trim<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.970> I'm<00:03:12.239> making<00:03:12.420> one<00:03:12.659> of<00:03:12.690> these<00:03:12.870> bad<00:03:13.110> boys

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
trim so I'm making one of these bad boys

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.839 
trim so I'm making one of these bad boys
which<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.739> one<00:03:14.069> of<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.220> most<00:03:14.430> complicated

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
which is one of the most complicated

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.290 
which is one of the most complicated
projects<00:03:15.659> in<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.379> history<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:17.280> sewing<00:03:18.000> well

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300

that<00:04:17.130> don't<00:04:17.160> match<00:04:17.519> up<00:04:19.910> because<00:04:20.910> how<00:04:21.150> the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
that don't match up because how the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.720 
that don't match up because how the
course<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.620> works<00:04:22.919> is

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
course it works is

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.870 
course it works is
each<00:04:24.480> panel<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.650> this<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.370> confusing

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
each panel and this is the confusing

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.580 
each panel and this is the confusing
part<00:04:27.030> ii<00:04:27.390> go<00:04:27.540> together<00:04:27.720> like<00:04:27.900> this<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.260> sew<00:04:28.470> it

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
part ii go together like this you sew it

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.140 
part ii go together like this you sew it
together<00:04:28.740> by<00:04:29.100> laying<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.610> on<00:04:29.670> top<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:29.940> each

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
together by laying it on top of each

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.260 
together by laying it on top of each
other<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.170> angles<00:04:31.710> line<00:04:32.430> up<00:04:32.610> so

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
other so that the angles line up so

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.530 
other so that the angles line up so
panel<00:04:34.080> one<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.650> panel<00:04:35.580> two<00:04:35.790> will<00:04:36.090> face<00:04:36.120> each

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
panel one and panel two will face each

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.660 
panel one and panel two will face each
other<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:37.020> then<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:38.550> sew<00:04:39.150> along<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.630> scene

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
other and then you sew along that scene

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.030 
other and then you sew along that scene
panel<00:04:41.670> to<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.360> panel<00:04:42.990> three<00:04:43.290> mirror<00:04:43.890> each

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
panel to and panel three mirror each

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.890 
panel to and panel three mirror each
other<00:04:45.080> so<00:04:46.080> then<00:04:46.200> you<00:04:46.290> sew<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:46.620> together

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
other so then you sew that together

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.630 
other so then you sew that together
panel<00:04:48.900> three<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:49.320> panel<00:04:49.620> for<00:04:49.830> again<00:04:50.280> as<00:04:50.490> you

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
panel three and panel for again as you

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.000 
panel three and panel for again as you
see<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:50.880> angles<00:04:51.390> match<00:04:51.900> up<00:04:52.200> so<00:04:52.440> that's<00:04:52.890> how

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
see the angles match up so that's how

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.160 
see the angles match up so that's how
you<00:04:53.070> get<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.430> shape<00:04:53.820> of<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.270> corset<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:55.050> but

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
like i said the pattern is just one side

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.300 
like i said the pattern is just one side
and<00:05:05.760> um<00:05:06.690> this<00:05:06.990> is<00:05:07.170> two<00:05:07.380> sides<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:07.800> this<00:05:07.980> is<00:05:08.160> what

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310

in<00:05:29.970> to<00:05:30.900> show<00:05:31.320> her<00:05:32.870> the<00:05:33.870> frame<00:05:34.170> of<00:05:34.380> the

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
in to show her the frame of the

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.170 
in to show her the frame of the
underbust<00:05:34.920> and<00:05:35.220> we<00:05:35.310> just<00:05:35.520> kind<00:05:35.670> of<00:05:35.820> mirrored

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
underbust and we just kind of mirrored

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.260 
underbust and we just kind of mirrored
it<00:05:36.300> in<00:05:36.540> that<00:05:37.020> pattern<00:05:37.350> there<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.850> I<00:05:38.880> am<00:05:39.240> very

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
it in that pattern there so I am very

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.430 
it in that pattern there so I am very
very<00:05:40.110> excited<00:05:41.780> isn't<00:05:42.780> that<00:05:42.810> crazy<00:05:43.050> how<00:05:43.350> it

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
very excited isn't that crazy how it

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.010 
very excited isn't that crazy how it
lines<00:05:43.620> up<00:05:43.920> weird<00:05:44.610> town<00:05:45.060> I<00:05:45.390> can't<00:05:45.660> believe<00:05:45.750> I'm

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
lines up weird town I can't believe I'm

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.380 
lines up weird town I can't believe I'm
actually<00:05:46.200> making<00:05:46.530> something<00:05:46.890> like<00:05:47.130> this<00:05:47.390> it's

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
actually making something like this it's

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.960 
actually making something like this it's
crazy<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:49.860> next<00:05:50.130> update<00:05:50.280> will<00:05:50.460> most<00:05:50.760> likely

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
crazy the next update will most likely

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.360 
crazy the next update will most likely
be<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.570> finished<00:05:52.320> product<00:05:52.770> but<00:05:52.860> that's<00:05:53.160> where

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
be the finished product but that's where

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.930 
be the finished product but that's where
I<00:05:53.400> am<00:05:53.610> so<00:05:53.970> far<00:05:54.270> inner<00:05:55.340> excited<00:05:56.340> I'm<00:05:56.550> so<00:05:56.760> proud

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
I am so far inner excited I'm so proud

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.840 
I am so far inner excited I'm so proud
of<00:05:57.000> myself<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.710> I<00:05:58.710> don't<00:05:59.520> know<00:05:59.610> I<00:05:59.640> don't<00:05:59.760> know

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
of myself and I don't know I don't know

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.850 
of myself and I don't know I don't know
if<00:05:59.970> I<00:06:00.030> make<00:06:00.180> another<00:06:00.450> one<00:06:00.600> it<00:06:00.870> seems<00:06:01.110> really

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
if I make another one it seems really

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.650 
if I make another one it seems really
overwhelming<00:06:02.520> and<00:06:02.730> also<00:06:03.120> they're<00:06:03.270> expensive

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
overwhelming and also they're expensive

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.090 
overwhelming and also they're expensive
to<00:06:03.840> make<00:06:04.110> because<00:06:04.290> not<00:06:04.560> only<00:06:04.590> you<00:06:04.830> have<00:06:04.920> to<00:06:04.980> get

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
to make because not only you have to get

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.080 
to make because not only you have to get
the<00:06:05.190> fabric<00:06:05.550> but<00:06:05.640> you<00:06:05.700> have<00:06:05.790> to<00:06:05.880> get<00:06:05.970> the

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
the fabric but you have to get the

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.010 
the fabric but you have to get the
boning<00:06:06.600> inside<00:06:07.590> and<00:06:08.160> the<00:06:08.340> lacing<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:09.840> all

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
boning inside and the lacing and all

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.200 
boning inside and the lacing and all
that<00:06:10.230> stuff<00:06:10.380> so<00:06:10.500> it's<00:06:10.950> very<00:06:11.460> material

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
that stuff so it's very material

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.090 
that stuff so it's very material
intensive<00:06:12.840> and<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.140> hardware<00:06:13.530> needs<00:06:13.800> to<00:06:13.980> be

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
intensive and the hardware needs to be

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.980 
intensive and the hardware needs to be
on<00:06:14.220> point<00:06:14.460> where<00:06:14.670> it<00:06:14.760> won't<00:06:14.850> last<00:06:15.060> I<00:06:15.450> get

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
on point where it won't last I get

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.750 
on point where it won't last I get
really<00:06:16.170> excited<00:06:16.410> about<00:06:16.800> crafts<00:06:17.220> and<00:06:17.550> I<00:06:17.580> go

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760
