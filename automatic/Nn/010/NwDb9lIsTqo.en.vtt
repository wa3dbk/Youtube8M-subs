00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.410 
they have Tom six and some appear as a
character<00:03:37.040> saying<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:37.580> is<00:03:37.760> all<00:03:37.880> medically

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
character saying this is all medically

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.480 
character saying this is all medically
accurate<00:03:38.630> which<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.290> do<00:03:39.350> admire<00:03:39.950> them<00:03:40.280> for

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490
