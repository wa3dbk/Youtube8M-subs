00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
know and he's just going to quit if he

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.940

speed<00:01:20.630> or<00:01:20.750> something<00:01:21.110> like<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:21.770> it's<00:01:21.920> good

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
speed or something like it and it's good

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.859 
speed or something like it and it's good
