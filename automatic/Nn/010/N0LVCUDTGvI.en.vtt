00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
just gonna take a quick look at the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.720 
just gonna take a quick look at the
paleri<00:00:03.780> box<00:00:04.259> there's<00:00:04.920> really<00:00:05.220> nothing<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.700> it

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
paleri box there's really nothing to it

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.460 
paleri box there's really nothing to it
but<00:00:06.089> I'll<00:00:06.450> give<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.810> quick<00:00:06.990> tour<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.290> the

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
but I'll give you a quick tour of the

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:17.980 
but I'll give you a quick tour of the
actual<00:00:07.859> player<00:00:08.160> itself<00:00:09.170> so<00:00:10.170> just<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.679> box<00:00:13.670> Larry

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.540 

and<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> only<00:00:19.320> other<00:00:19.470> hand<00:00:19.800> side<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
and the only other hand side is the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:29.359 
and the only other hand side is the
manual<00:00:25.010> and<00:00:26.010> it'll<00:00:26.220> show<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.490> how<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:28.369> align

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
manual and it'll show you how to align

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.189 
manual and it'll show you how to align
in<00:00:29.670> both<00:00:29.970> hemispheres<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.720> all<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.929> stuff

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
in both hemispheres and all that stuff

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:42.470 
in both hemispheres and all that stuff
so<00:00:38.300> as<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.480> actual<00:00:39.660> PO<00:00:40.020> Larry

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.270 

so<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.109> looks<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.949> front

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580 

get<00:00:48.150> an<00:00:48.210> idea<00:00:48.450> how<00:00:48.630> big<00:00:48.810> it<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.020> I'll<00:00:49.170> put<00:00:49.290> a<00:00:49.320> pen

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
get an idea how big it is I'll put a pen

00:00:49.590 --> 00:01:05.650 
get an idea how big it is I'll put a pen
recited<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.190> pretty<00:00:53.460> small

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.430 

got<00:01:06.660> hole<00:01:06.900> there

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
got hole there

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.800 
got hole there
you<00:01:07.650> actually<00:01:07.800> look<00:01:08.100> through<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.490> way

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
you actually look through it this way

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
you actually look through it this way
and<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> how<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.350> would<00:01:10.650> align<00:01:11.160> it<00:01:11.340> you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and that is how you would align it you

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.780 
and that is how you would align it you
would<00:01:11.729> look<00:01:12.270> through<00:01:12.510> there<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:12.690> Center<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
would look through there and Center the

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.570 
would look through there and Center the
Polaris<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.360> Northern<00:01:15.660> Hemisphere<00:01:16.050> and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
Polaris in the Northern Hemisphere and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.550 
Polaris in the Northern Hemisphere and
then<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.150> would<00:01:18.270> you'd<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.540> aligned<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> ready

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
then it would you'd be aligned and ready

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.260 
then it would you'd be aligned and ready
to<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:22.220> in<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.310> back<00:01:23.550> that's<00:01:23.910> your

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
to go so in your back that's your

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.670 
to go so in your back that's your
compass<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.780> screws<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.260> we'll<00:01:25.470> show<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
compass that screws out we'll show that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.330 
compass that screws out we'll show that
in<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.950> second<00:01:27.260> on<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.410> top<00:01:28.650> there's<00:01:29.130> your

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
in a second on the top there's your

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.380 
in a second on the top there's your
switch<00:01:29.640> three<00:01:29.880> different<00:01:30.240> modes

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
switch three different modes

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.910 
switch three different modes
so<00:01:33.390> there's<00:01:33.660> off<00:01:35.119> set<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.270> mode<00:01:36.649> which<00:01:37.649> just

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
so there's off set up mode which just

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520 
so there's off set up mode which just
eliminates<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
eliminates the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.100 
eliminates the
the<00:01:40.920> latitude<00:01:41.280> meter<00:01:42.120> thing<00:01:42.480> here<00:01:42.660> which<00:01:42.900> will

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the latitude meter thing here which will

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.630 
the latitude meter thing here which will
help<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.970> do<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.150> doing<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:45.810> alignment

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
help you do your doing your alignment

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.580 
help you do your doing your alignment
especially<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:48.150> a<00:01:48.180> solar<00:01:48.870> alignment<00:01:49.470> where

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
especially for a solar alignment where

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.160 
especially for a solar alignment where
you<00:01:49.680> don't<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> star<00:01:50.370> to<00:01:50.550> use<00:01:53.870> and<00:01:54.870> there's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you don't have a star to use and there's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.120 
you don't have a star to use and there's
half<00:01:55.410> speed<00:01:55.710> tracking<00:01:56.840> for<00:01:57.840> starscapes<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
half speed tracking for starscapes and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.630 
half speed tracking for starscapes and
full<00:01:59.340> speed<00:01:59.610> tracking<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:01.950> solar<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
full speed tracking and then solar and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.270 
full speed tracking and then solar and
lunar<00:02:02.670> tracking

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.780 

all<00:02:10.280> right<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.700> there's<00:02:10.909> the<00:02:12.129> latitude<00:02:13.129> level

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
all right so there's the latitude level

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.150 
all right so there's the latitude level
so<00:02:14.629> you<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:14.840> see

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.340 

so<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.790> zuri<00:02:22.030> attached<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.570> camera<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
so the zuri attached the camera of the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.870 
so the zuri attached the camera of the
unscrew<00:02:24.040> these

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.270 

this<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.210> thing<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.720> actually<00:02:31.840> spins<00:02:35.280> so

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
this is the thing that actually spins so

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.860 
this is the thing that actually spins so
if<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.460> look<00:02:36.610> back<00:02:36.640> here<00:02:37.000> there's<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.300> thing

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
if you look back here there's a thing

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.940 
if you look back here there's a thing
that<00:02:37.900> pushes<00:02:38.380> in<00:02:40.350> when<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.440> push<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.770> in

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
that pushes in when you push that in

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.560 
that pushes in when you push that in
this<00:02:42.070> screw<00:02:42.400> pops<00:02:42.640> out<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.210> was<00:02:43.390> where

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
this screw pops out and that was where

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.140 
this screw pops out and that was where
you'd<00:02:43.690> screw<00:02:44.020> in<00:02:44.110> your<00:02:44.490> ball<00:02:45.490> head<00:02:45.700> mount<00:02:45.940> for

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
you'd screw in your ball head mount for

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:58.940 
you'd screw in your ball head mount for
your<00:02:46.300> camera

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.170 

I'm<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.670> back

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:17.530 

this<00:03:04.810> screws<00:03:05.200> off

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:26.940 

and<00:03:18.019> that<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.349> your<00:03:18.500> compass

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.430 

and<00:03:27.550> if<00:03:27.640> you<00:03:27.760> bought<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.090> optional<00:03:28.840> polar

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
and if you bought the optional polar

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.030 
and if you bought the optional polar
scope<00:03:29.770> it<00:03:30.160> would<00:03:30.250> go<00:03:30.400> through<00:03:30.580> there<00:03:31.950> but<00:03:32.950> if

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
scope it would go through there but if

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.559 
scope it would go through there but if
you<00:03:33.130> know<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.430> polar<00:03:33.640> scope<00:03:33.910> like<00:03:34.450> I

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
you know the polar scope like I

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.790 
you know the polar scope like I
mentioned<00:03:34.900> earlier<00:03:34.989> you<00:03:35.260> would<00:03:35.500> just<00:03:35.680> look

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
mentioned earlier you would just look

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.559 
mentioned earlier you would just look
through<00:03:36.010> this<00:03:36.099> little<00:03:36.310> hole<00:03:36.430> here<00:03:36.580> it's<00:03:37.450> not

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
through this little hole here it's not

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.360 
through this little hole here it's not
as<00:03:37.750> accurate<00:03:37.900> but<00:03:38.459> for<00:03:39.459> wide<00:03:39.640> fields<00:03:40.349> or<00:03:41.370> you

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
as accurate but for wide fields or you

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.650
