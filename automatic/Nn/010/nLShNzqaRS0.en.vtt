00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.149 

open<00:01:04.400> D<00:01:05.400> string<00:01:05.430> or<00:01:06.090> open<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> string<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.229> two

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.100 
on the D string so we're just going to
plug<00:01:12.450> those<00:01:12.659> two<00:01:12.830> strings

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.780 

and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.409> pretty<00:01:19.920> much<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.370> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
and then pretty much that's it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.450

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
we're just going to go back to the III

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.030 
we're just going to go back to the III
then<00:01:26.460> back<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.450> zero<00:01:29.360> D<00:01:30.360> 2<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.830> then

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
then back to the a zero D 2 and then

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:48.260 
then back to the a zero D 2 and then
back<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> e<00:01:32.909> 3<00:01:34.640> then<00:01:35.640> he<00:01:35.880> -<00:01:36.800> so<00:01:37.800> just<00:01:47.270> it's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
back to the e 3 then he - so just it's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.760
