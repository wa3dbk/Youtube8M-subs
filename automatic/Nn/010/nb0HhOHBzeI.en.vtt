00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.530
 and 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.740
 hello everybody it's white I hope 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.020
 you're well we 're going out today in 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.440
 way of the ona half for the 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.470
 presentation 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.050
 nacho 14.06 but it is still there 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.380
 complete hello killers who greet them to 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.490
 all 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.010
 he speaks to me from the sky the shock 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.180
 me for example I had I finally spit 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.500
 we beat at that price on it but I 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.910
 spit so stay twenty-four a 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.220
 transition at a time we cross 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.320
 immediately attack what's new in 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.050
 this tablecloth shot that seals since 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.510
 it's stuff especially how the block 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.920
 that's exactly so we 'll think that a 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.659
 new artist manna for apples 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.089
 golden big apples the 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.960
 pandores enchanted as they say in fact 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:59.780
 when the crafts are good we will have the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.220
 timone normally am not in a hurry 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.260
 did not put the tumor but we have an art 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:08.210
 event breeds call condemns apple 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.500
 yann arthus manjul would display yet 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.290
 I do not even have kraft and it's not so 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.770
 weird though I do not know where 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.390
 is the problem 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.579
 no I do not know then you do not want to 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.049
 does not show up need not look 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.159
 is called snapshots bugs 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.469
 these bugs of this theme I agree 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.789
 these are the barriers that we 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.469
 had not spoken twice but who 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.380
 have already raged in the articles 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.430
 but this article so in fact now 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.140
 we place them in a democracy 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.329
 we see them like that it allows us 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.950
 to have a visualization vision actually 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.600
 he turns in relation to the meaning one is 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.289
 like the pc link in the teeth the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.700
 mornings here is exactly and the big 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.170
 advantage of these blocks is for them who 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.490
 speak a little bit would like to reproduce 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.829
 a contraction loan in minecraft 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.109
 to quote anyone that would allow them 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:51.360
 to not have to manage visitors 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:56.220
 who tries to go to mc saÃ¯da 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.180
 i 1 it is sometimes and so transport 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.860
 now you can change the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.860
 color of the sheep here and killer yes 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.210
 yes you have something to say a substrate to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.040
 yes then the color the sheep it is 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.250
 finds that can not change it thanks 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.210
 directly to the textures in the back and 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.270
 abdat two meters forty is the cat 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.830
 to dissociate the conservative 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.620
 it's okay so we'll talk about 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:33.150
 again she was 200 guests a 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:35.340
 object yes of course yes I confirm 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.110
 so sorry for names the new n is going 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.170
 that allow us to place a block at 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.580
 on top of another in adventure mode 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.800
 with such as I have give 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.400
 orders at the loose div race 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.650
 @ keystone 16.0 can fly zone 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.060
 minecraft of fist dia same block what 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.280
 So we can go from the stone 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.280
 above a blog 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.340
 I think you watch at the same time 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.630
 the antenna date access to a beta data 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.110
 it's just a person who has been 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.489
 added 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.670
 that's exactly next in 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.590
 speaking that I attack you well again 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.870
 so that allows us to hide these 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.769
 information from the bubble info what can 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.959
 to be practical enough if you want 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.430
 really do not show that one was 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.850
 mass such or such in room it can be 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.280
 nice enough, please joke your joke 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.280
 so the 1 is the enchantment 2 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.580
 has changed to four cup breaks so 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.810
 to eight can destroy sand that can not be 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.510
 not destroy and that's what I like 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.940
 that we can not place exactly 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.820
 I think that's where it begins 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.470
 tiger jetty is added it's with a 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.330
 new trick in the common blocks we 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.960
 we are quiches to above so we are you 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.830
 just say he new orders 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.410
 that is also normal again 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.080
 new scoreboard trick so a 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.760
 new I find more we can you me 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:03.610
 says that a commander's players 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.720
 scoreboard does if we put it several times 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.940
 the same player is good to put the 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.450
 little star instead 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.890
 exactly 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.150
 there is also a new tube that is 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.890
 terrible is that we can put the 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.690
 player's score directly to 0 via the 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.460
 firm command scoreboard as it 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.230
 see there is so now they had 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.170
 new very objective criteria and so 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.470
 when you're finally a specific team 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.050
 take who preempts england and who 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.670
 worried building or that's what can 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.820
 to be handy if you want to do 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.500
 a kind of ktp with friends you know 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.700
 how can you kill that? 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.870
 how many dead equipped 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.289
 you have gained areas you have 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.729
 not killed players of your team that's it 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.830
 and I think that's all we 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.319
 had to say because it is said that 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.330
 I go to the sila level there it starts 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:49.449
 there I did so you could you 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.149
 can do there you live an effect of 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.819
 no potion but now you can 

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:57.580
 add the fact that we see more 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.080
 particles so cead particle so you 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.869
 will have the order with all the little ones 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.819
 criteria that appears on the screen in the 

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:06.669
 so what is barack called for 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.649
 hide the little ones exactly by 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.909
 example as if you had a potion 

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:11.050
 sprint finish but you do not have 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.669
 not be cold and little bubbles that 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.689
 come out of you have it made you buy 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:19.749
 you are quiet you will love 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:22.589
 still here for the second time 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:28.110
 and yes yes exactly 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:30.669
 it's still spitting I'm kiffe and so 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.339
 we with a small hole on 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.439
 mobs exactly then bound to mobs 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:38.050
 So it is a long time I hear you 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.699
 not was changed she was changed 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.709
 for I think better optimization 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.689
 I do not know exactly what it is 

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:45.849
 in reality nobody knows about them 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.439
 people's words guy I think place and 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.919
 so we should finally a little bit more 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:52.029
 in the next stages shooter 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.649
 new touch so its highlights 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.939
 player so that's why we're in 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:55.779
 game to the spectators if we want to see the 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:58.360
 return of the players 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:59.919
 so you can set it through the menu 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.749
 how so I put the key 5 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.559
 bay windows like that what I have not 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:04.269
 still thought about everything I 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:05.889
 would put and so when our scales at 

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:08.199
 spectator we can see the turn of the 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.269
 player precisely with others can 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.219
 see our outlines if I'm wrong 

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:14.499
 finally here we can see the outline 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.419
 seals time exactly recently 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.439
 something very practical I think 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.019
 to see what happened that are 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:22.509
 dead does it all just make a 

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.979
 differentiation little milk slime 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:26.169
 now that will now be able to 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:28.180
 well, it's now swimming but 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.729
 since I'm crazy it did not work 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.050
 so now they know how to swim 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.539
 in the water and it no longer flows so it 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.889
 no longer missing in the water this is yes 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.550
 this is a good thing 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.439
 these novelties here exactly I think 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.330
 we will meet again the week 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.219
 next for a better video 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.889
 conditions this is nobody feels 

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:50.349
 direction we will do everything and so to 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:54.210
 the next assault what hi to all and 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:54.210
 and why the king and who their studio 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.180
 diamonds 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.180
 6 

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:08.740
 it is 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.220
 Oh 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.220
 It's okay
