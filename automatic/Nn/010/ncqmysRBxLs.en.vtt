three<00:00:43.910> times<00:00:45.070> you<00:00:46.070> know<00:00:46.220> there<00:00:46.670> is<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:47.330> know<00:00:47.480> I

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
three times you know there is you know I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.840 
three times you know there is you know I
think<00:00:47.750> I'll<00:00:48.170> kaslo<00:00:48.739> we<00:00:48.890> have<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.040> video<00:00:49.280> of<00:00:49.730> him

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
think I'll kaslo we have a video of him

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.200 
think I'll kaslo we have a video of him
you<00:00:50.720> know<00:00:50.870> basically<00:00:51.590> walking<00:00:51.950> through<00:00:52.310> it<00:00:52.490> if

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
you know basically walking through it if

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.410 
you know basically walking through it if
we<00:00:53.360> have<00:00:53.480> another<00:00:53.750> one<00:00:54.020> of<00:00:54.820> it<00:00:55.820> might<00:00:56.030> be<00:00:56.150> Brian

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
we have another one of it might be Brian

very<00:01:08.600> detailed<00:01:10.030> actually<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:11.090> walked<00:01:11.600> through

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.600 

one<00:01:15.290> of<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.530> interns<00:01:15.830> that<00:01:15.920> we<00:01:16.040> have<00:01:16.280> brought

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
have been done which are actually I feel

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.469 
have been done which are actually I feel
better<00:01:27.110> in<00:01:27.890> teaching<00:01:28.549> with<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.729> videos<00:01:29.210> and

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
better in teaching with the videos and

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.340 
better in teaching with the videos and
the<00:01:29.540> stuff<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:29.840> we've<00:01:30.110> already<00:01:30.320> put<00:01:30.710> out<00:01:30.790> I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
the stuff that we've already put out I

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.760 
the stuff that we've already put out I
don't<00:01:33.350> know<00:01:33.560> exactly<00:01:34.390> what<00:01:35.710> they're<00:01:36.710> looking

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
don't know exactly what they're looking

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.370 
don't know exactly what they're looking

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
for because every time i read that i was

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.969 
for because every time i read that i was
like<00:01:39.619> what<00:01:39.799> we've<00:01:40.010> done<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.780> four<00:01:41.780> times<00:01:41.979> you

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
like what we've done this four times you

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.960 
like what we've done this four times you
know<00:01:43.070> what<00:01:43.340> what<00:01:43.580> exactly<00:01:44.740> do<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:45.799> want<00:01:46.159> you

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
know what what exactly do you want you

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.609 
know what what exactly do you want you
know<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:48.100> now<00:01:49.100> it's<00:01:49.369> in<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:50.299> squat<00:01:50.689> in<00:01:51.080> the

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
know and now it's in the squat in the

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.370 
know and now it's in the squat in the
bench<00:01:52.159> press<00:01:52.280> are<00:01:52.820> a<00:01:52.850> lot<00:01:53.510> more<00:01:53.540> detail

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
bench press are a lot more detail

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.859 
bench press are a lot more detail
oriented<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.159> yet<00:01:55.460> took<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.270> lot<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.479> time

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
oriented so yet took a lot of time

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.810 
oriented so yet took a lot of time
there's<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.650> lot<00:01:57.920> of<00:01:57.950> corrections<00:01:58.640> that<00:01:58.700> need

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
there's a lot of corrections that need

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.640 
there's a lot of corrections that need
to<00:01:59.060> be<00:01:59.119> made<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.900> lot<00:02:00.049> of<00:02:00.200> things<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.530> can

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
to be made and a lot of things that can

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.710 
to be made and a lot of things that can
happen<00:02:00.830> so<00:02:01.340> those<00:02:01.549> you<00:02:02.180> know<00:02:02.299> or<00:02:02.420> video

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
happen so those you know or video

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.929 
happen so those you know or video
segments<00:02:03.320> are<00:02:03.409> pretty<00:02:03.680> long<00:02:03.890> time<00:02:04.159> the

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
segments are pretty long time the

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.990 
segments are pretty long time the
deadlift<00:02:05.450> doesn't<00:02:05.900> take<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.500> much<00:02:06.860> time<00:02:07.280> to

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
deadlift doesn't take that much time to

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.660 
deadlift doesn't take that much time to
really<00:02:08.209> teach<00:02:08.660> properly<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:10.250> know<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.549> it

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
really teach properly you know so it

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.590 
really teach properly you know so it
doesn't<00:02:11.000> take<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.239> 60<00:02:11.840> minute

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
doesn't take a 60 minute

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.320 
doesn't take a 60 minute
to<00:02:12.870> be<00:02:13.020> able<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.440> do<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.490> we've<00:02:14.730> had<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:15.210> I

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
to be able to do it so we've had it I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.180 
to be able to do it so we've had it I
suppose<00:02:15.390> maybe<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:16.470> go<00:02:16.590> back<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.800> change

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
suppose maybe I can go back and change

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.520 
suppose maybe I can go back and change
the<00:02:17.460> name<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.730> all<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.060> videos<00:02:18.230> too<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.470> you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the name of all the videos too so you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.950 
the name of all the videos too so you
think<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.040> deadlift<00:02:20.580> one<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.660> them<00:02:21.810> may

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
think you can deadlift one of them may

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.900 
think you can deadlift one of them may
actually<00:02:22.170> be<00:02:22.680> called<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.460> be<00:02:23.580> honest

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
actually be called that to be honest

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.710 
actually be called that to be honest
with<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:25.220> and<00:02:26.220> with<00:02:26.610> that<00:02:26.640> regard<00:02:27.120> what<00:02:27.660> do

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
with you so and with that regard what do

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.960
