00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.940
 These travelers are easy for us 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.750
 only working animals 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.990
 always overcrowded and dingy 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.360
 simple machines means to purpose 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.849
 operational disruptions they come I come 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.950
 so again too late 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.840
 they rush through life without ever leaving 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.560
 to sit back and see the prospect 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.110
 enjoy 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.200
 Landscapes are out of focus 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.690
 over physio look down hope 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.390
 unnoticed by them we roll along 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.750
 from one station to the next 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.240
 they look 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 but they do not see it unrecognized 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.040
 backbone of a nation 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.170
 For you, the goal is one of ours 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.020
 travel 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.190
 from the steam age to the 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.310
 from the mountain pass to the coastal stretch 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.320
 we bring you everywhere 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.960
 we see the world in the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.239
 a face on the window a dented 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.340
 Bicycle in book over fields and places 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.440
 flows in and out of big and big ones 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.160
 small towns past fields and 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.150
 grasslands 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.850
 we are different we are many we are 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.100
 Railway fans There is a place at the 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.290
 the time belongs to the steamy 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.060
 diesel and electric motor dominate from 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.680
 the high speed line to the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.650
 siding it is all our trains equal 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.220
 vote goods or people too classic 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.830
 or modern near or far where 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.380
 Driver developers and enthusiasts themselves 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.520
 meet to share your passion 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.130
 a place for all railway enthusiasts 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.460
 Symphony of smoke and heat flasks and 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.560
 steam irrepressible force and 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.700
 fast speeds we 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.320
 know you are one of us 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.330
 we are many 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.330
