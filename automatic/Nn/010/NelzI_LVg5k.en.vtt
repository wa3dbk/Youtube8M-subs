it<00:00:00.120> so<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.780> is<00:00:00.930> 4<00:00:01.260> lakhs<00:00:01.560> fair<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:01.920> Lazarus

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:02.659 
it so this is 4 lakhs fair and Lazarus

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:04.940 
it so this is 4 lakhs fair and Lazarus
and<00:00:03.659> I'll<00:00:03.780> show<00:00:03.929> you<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.200> leading<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.799> base

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
and I'll show you the leading the base

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.000 
and I'll show you the leading the base
together<00:00:05.370> 30<00:00:06.029> through<00:00:06.440> to<00:00:07.440> start<00:00:07.710> off<00:00:07.830> with<00:00:07.980> a

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
together 30 through to start off with a

G minor G to D minor B flat bay and the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.380 
G minor G to D minor B flat bay and the
base<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:22.550> when<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.640> hit<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.850> b-flat

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
base for that when you hit that b-flat

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.310 
base for that when you hit that b-flat
and<00:00:25.019> play<00:00:25.260> arising<00:00:25.920> g<00:00:26.670> DG

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.880 

then<00:00:31.320> when<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.560> hit<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:32.310> we<00:00:33.210> play<00:00:33.450> descending

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.100 

and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:38.550> we're<00:00:38.670> into<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.880> song<00:00:39.090> profit<00:00:39.570> so

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and then we're into the song profit so

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.380 
and then we're into the song profit so
back<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.710> G<00:00:40.890> minor<00:00:41.130> and<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.820> time<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
back the G minor and this time it's a

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.939 
back the G minor and this time it's a
see<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.960> flat<00:00:47.540> G<00:00:48.540> sorry<00:00:48.900> and<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.890> rising<00:00:51.949> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
see you flat G sorry and the rising to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.560 
see you flat G sorry and the rising to
the<00:00:53.040> D<00:00:53.190> minor<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.030> C<00:00:54.600> E<00:00:54.989> flat<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the D minor and C E flat and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.009 
the D minor and C E flat and
and<00:00:57.900> a<00:00:58.290> rising<00:01:01.010> next<00:01:02.010> chord<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.940> an<00:01:03.090> E<00:01:03.270> flat<00:01:03.450> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and a rising next chord is an E flat so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:14.010 
and a rising next chord is an E flat so
it's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:05.660> a<00:01:07.130> flat<00:01:08.600> with<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> rising<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.830> flat

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.010 

and<00:01:14.469> then<00:01:15.299> DC<00:01:16.380> b-flat<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:18.329> rather<00:01:19.329> than<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.780> D

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
and then DC b-flat a rather than the D

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.810 
and then DC b-flat a rather than the D
minor<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:20.590> is<00:01:20.710> an<00:01:20.799> F<00:01:20.950> so<00:01:21.549> it's<00:01:21.869> everything

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
minor this is an F so it's everything

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.510 
minor this is an F so it's everything
then<00:01:25.820> we're<00:01:26.450> back<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.920> if<00:01:27.920> it's<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.159> bit<00:01:28.310> at<00:01:28.430> the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
then we're back to if it's a bit at the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.230 
then we're back to if it's a bit at the
start<00:01:28.729> again<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:29.329> it's<00:01:29.509> a<00:01:30.520> busy<00:01:32.439> bee<00:01:33.439> flat<00:01:33.829> G<00:01:34.640> &amp;

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
start again so it's a busy bee flat G &amp;

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.420 
start again so it's a busy bee flat G &amp;
G

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.650 

and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> same<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.750> again<00:01:42.980> DC<00:01:44.390> black<00:01:45.390> a

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
and the same is that again DC black a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.450 
and the same is that again DC black a
and<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> D<00:01:46.560> minor

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.890 

f<00:01:53.460> G<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:55.460> b-flat

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.040 

and<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:02.130> base<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.580> is<00:02:03.080> when<00:02:04.080> you're<00:02:04.320> not<00:02:04.500> G

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
and the base that is when you're not G

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:18.800 
and the base that is when you're not G
it's<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:08.630> flat

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.040 

and<00:02:19.349> when<00:02:19.500> hear<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.860> last<00:02:20.160> G<00:02:20.840> we<00:02:21.840> play

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and when hear that last G we play

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.260 
and when hear that last G we play
descending<00:02:22.880> g

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
descending g

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.650 
descending g
and<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.930> very<00:02:26.320> low<00:02:26.560> G

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
and a very low G

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.560 
and a very low G
and<00:02:28.110> then<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.010> little<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.490> little<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:30.180> little<00:02:30.270> bar

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
and then a little a little a little bar

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.050 
and then a little a little a little bar
before<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.440> next<00:02:31.530> verse<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.070> that's<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.520> do

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
before the next verse and that's just do

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.950 
before the next verse and that's just do
you<00:02:33.150> see<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:34.140> flat<00:02:35.100> a

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
you see a flat a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.440 
you see a flat a
what<00:02:37.960> I<00:02:37.990> play<00:02:38.350> here<00:02:38.590> when<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.010> hear<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.460> is

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
what I play here when you hear that a is

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.160 
what I play here when you hear that a is
an<00:02:41.290> a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.710 

so<00:02:46.170> hopefully<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.130> makes<00:02:47.310> sense<00:02:47.600> if<00:02:48.600> it

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
so hopefully that makes sense if it

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.510 
so hopefully that makes sense if it
seems<00:02:48.930> daunting<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.440> bass<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.920> bass<00:02:50.040> just

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
seems daunting the bass the bass just

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.850 
seems daunting the bass the bass just
always<00:02:50.700> rises<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.450> fifths<00:02:51.990> so<00:02:52.740> like<00:02:52.920> their<00:02:53.100> DNA

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
always rises in fifths so like their DNA

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.830 
always rises in fifths so like their DNA
and<00:02:56.240> GD<00:02:57.240> so<00:02:58.080> it's<00:02:58.230> as<00:02:58.410> dead<00:02:58.560> logical<00:02:59.390> and<00:03:00.390> if

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
and GD so it's as dead logical and if

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.720 
and GD so it's as dead logical and if
you're<00:03:00.960> any<00:03:01.080> questions<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.920> post<00:03:02.070> them<00:03:02.520> and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
you're any questions just post them and

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.230 
you're any questions just post them and
I<00:03:03.270> will<00:03:03.540> answer<00:03:03.750> them<00:03:04.820> hope<00:03:05.820> that's<00:03:05.940> what<00:03:06.060> some

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
I will answer them hope that's what some

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.420 
I will answer them hope that's what some
use
