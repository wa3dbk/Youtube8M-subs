of<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:43.120> might<00:02:43.359> get<00:02:43.599> detected<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:44.819> be<00:02:45.819> a

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
of you might get detected but be a

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.830 
of you might get detected but be a
little<00:02:45.939> stuffing<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.060> Jets<00:02:49.299> pawn<00:02:49.599> right

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
little stuffing so the Jets pawn right

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.500 
little stuffing so the Jets pawn right
there<00:02:50.079> cargo<00:02:50.530> bombs<00:02:50.849> Barnes<00:02:51.849> behind<00:02:52.269> me

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
there cargo bombs Barnes behind me

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.119 
there cargo bombs Barnes behind me
Titans<00:02:53.290> are<00:02:53.379> right<00:02:53.590> here<00:02:53.769> I'm<00:02:53.829> gonna<00:02:53.919> try<00:02:54.069> to

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
Titans are right here I'm gonna try to

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.729 
Titans are right here I'm gonna try to
take<00:02:54.310> one<00:02:54.519> really<00:02:54.790> fast<00:02:55.470> hopefully<00:02:56.470> there's

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
take one really fast hopefully there's

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.860 
take one really fast hopefully there's
not<00:02:56.889> a<00:02:56.950> tank<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.639> I<00:02:58.000> think<00:02:58.209> there<00:02:58.359> is<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> tank

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
not a tank and I think there is a tank

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.920 
not a tank and I think there is a tank
so<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.079> might<00:03:02.439> be<00:03:02.470> also<00:03:03.099> a<00:03:03.819> tight<00:03:04.689> in

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
so this might be also a tight in

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.530 
so this might be also a tight in
gameplay<00:03:05.260> if<00:03:05.739> I<00:03:05.859> can<00:03:06.069> take<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.340> hopefully<00:03:07.329> I

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
gameplay if I can take it hopefully I

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.470 
gameplay if I can take it hopefully I
took<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.739> landed<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.609> on<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.879> airstrip<00:03:10.090> at

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
took it I landed it on the airstrip at

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.240 
took it I landed it on the airstrip at
the<00:03:10.569> airport<00:03:11.049> but<00:03:11.560> then<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.739> hit<00:03:12.040> an<00:03:12.189> invisible
