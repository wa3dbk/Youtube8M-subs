00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.590
 special all 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.720
 but we started with direct cooking all 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.200
 about fried foods we are with the first 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.200
 called 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.990
 direct line cook speak 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.350
 very well 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.380
 It is very good and it is very good regards to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.500
 everyone I have my this consultation and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.410
 my question is to see tell me what 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.930
 amount I need oil to make 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.180
 french fries the amount of oil 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.550
 it is actually more or less excellent 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.280
 just or like to make some potatoes 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.630
 fried 7 will have overflowed in laughter that 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.090
 you get rich that what before and that 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.649
 do not overflow because it is a little 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.530
 clear potato chips theme 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.120
 exactly good the subject is so 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.940
 always not only for french fries 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.950
 but for any frying we have for 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.860
 here because I have a pot with oil on 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.800
 Indian warming shit 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.650
 notice that there is oil below the 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.960
 half of the pot 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.430
 I would tell you that at most until the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.230
 half of the pot but you have to have 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.510
 very careful or pan of course 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.670
 because potatoes tend to overflow 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.080
 fried clear you do not have to have so much 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.850
 amount does not have to have as much 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.040
 amount but as you know rule 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.960
 general of any frying not only of 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.310
 french fries and meanwhile I who 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.600
 I have some cut potatoes that I am going to 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.460
 dry because it is another very important thing 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.380
 strategy ask 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.810
 it is important to highlight the very important 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.820
 to anything that you're going to fry 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.310
 have moisture for example fish by 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.210
 example whatever this can be frying 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.280
 of everything 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.260
 you have to dry it well before us 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.479
 we had in water so to avoid 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.890
 that rust but now so that 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.660
 there is a contrast with water and 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.700
 oil and starts to burst everything to 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.140
 Everywhere you have to dry it was created and 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.650
 that way you will also look good 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.900
 but 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.280
 but we're golden in cook 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.980
 direct line we are talking to 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.690
 pour ituzaingÃ³ and we are to do 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.240
 a good potato chips how much of 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.400
 oil told you freshly half that by 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.470
 general rule for you for all 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.010
 who are on the other side and writing 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.950
 It has to be in abundant oil to 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.450
 what for you when you put any 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.530
 product not only to walk I'll put 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.660
 most acute potatoes of oils and warm 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.910
 you see sizzling kickers 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.080
 and this is very important is step 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.070
 we talk about writing and how it has 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.050
 what to do 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.760
 we are going to gradually put all the 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.530
 Popes did not throw them all at once because 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.170
 Sometimes potatoes usually make 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.240
 overflow all this clear do not go 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.040
 as I said just from the friendship of the 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.530
 pot I would tell you that with a third is 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.930
 well but that is abundant that nothing in 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.910
 the products in oil because if you do not 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.320
 what happens is that the temperature is lowered 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.300
 The same thing can happen to you if you put 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.130
 too many potatoes or too much estimate 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.230
 product the temperature is lowered and 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.240
 absorb oil and you have a frying 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.030
 much heavier 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.090
 new song in children 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.390
 far from the painting the line far away 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.160
 of little boys in the back 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.170
 in passing we answer a little of all 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.420
 we are answering here amount of 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.150
 oil use to make good potatoes 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:21.520
 fried and also serves for all kinds of 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:23.770
 preparations like when I was 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.540
 little kid many years ago 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.060
 talk to my first teacher 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.170
 first teacher makes many now half 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.660
 this plan 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.380
 calabrese honey is also calabrese and 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.790
 he always said hello hello my life 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.060
 how are you doing well 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.920
 this what we had to do was 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.200
 a lot of oil oil 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.420
 always hot and that everything you go 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.010
 to put the oil in there nobody in 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.620
 do not stay 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.420
 little amount absorb the coarse oil 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.269
 a heavy heavy fry something else 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.379
 important when it is removed 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.140
 Of course he would lack 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.450
 quite when you always withdraw it to 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.920
 absorbent paper and not the above because 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.959
 if the enzymes generate steam and it 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.329
 softens the fried potato the same as for 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.409
 any future this is very, very, very 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:16.039
 important was clear mirtha 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:20.209
 very much I can say it my daughter-in-law who 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:22.070
 is here with me it seems that it is good for them 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.560
 I send a big kiss to the little boy 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.180

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.900
 nor the names 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.060
 a pretty little kiss, what is it called 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.540
 to see where they have to see kissing with 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.540

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:45.000

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.110
 we continue with this special fried 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.610
 but the direct line cook after 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.350
 of a small break because I 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.930
 I find that kroll canola oil 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.970
 it's the healthiest virgin oil because 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.400
 helps you reduce cholesterol is very 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.300
 rich in vitamin e and is also apt 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.300
 to make leader post look 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.569
