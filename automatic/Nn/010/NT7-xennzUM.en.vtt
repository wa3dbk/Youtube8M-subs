00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.140
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.480
 in the kitchen of the palace of flavors 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.110
 I propose you today a dessert 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.080
 a cake spilled with peaches so for 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.350
 realize this cake you will need for 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.300
 caramel 100 g of sugar and for the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:28.460
 cake 120 g of sugar then there you 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.460
 will require 600 g of fishing 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:40.079
 4 '120 g melted butter 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:44.129
 a tablespoon of yogurt 50 g of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.320
 spelled flour 100 g flour type 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.610
 45 teaspoon of bicarbonate 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.579
 so at first we will 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.579
 cut the peaches into slices 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.649
 then with sugar we will achieve 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:17.890
 a blond caramel that we pour 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.159
 then directly into the mold well 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.159
 Butter 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.399
 here after a few minutes the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.959
 result obtained a Carmel we are going to 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.270
 quickly made that the two parts the 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:36.270
 caramel in the village on board and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.179
 attention or the very hot we try to 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.590
 spread the caramel is everywhere but 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:58.920
 you see is displayed very quickly do that 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.920
 quickly 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:18.400
 we divide the fishing hair trains 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.400
 harmoniously if we can 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:32.860
 this is the result then we will bring 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.269
 a few pros because lady despite the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.480
 valleys go back a bit on the whole 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.480
 area 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:03:00.170
 then we will whip that sugar with 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.170
 others 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.380
 I prefer cases it's a donkey in a 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.630
 small ramekin in case there are 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.830
 cookies it's easier to remove a 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.830
 times in the salad bowl 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:43.170
 indeed the tablespoon of yoghurt 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:43.170
 nature the flour gradually 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.890
 the teaspoon of baking soda 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.410
 and finish by pouring the melted butter 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.410
 did people say 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:51.350
 that's how you see we get 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:54.910
 smooth and homogeneous mixture that we will 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.910
 pour over pears 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.310
 here is more than bake for 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.340
 twenty minutes at 180 Â° heat 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.890
 rotating right away 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:21.190
 so after 15 of the 20 minutes 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.470
 pardon cooking 180 degrees it was 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.750
 prolonged by increasing the 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.150
 temperature by passing 1,200 degrees on 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.510
 the extension of ten minutes of cooking 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.430
 cake 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:46.660
 we are going to demolish it right away 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:50.380
 very hot that's the result after the 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:53.110
 demolding cake well brown the goods 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.080
 caramelized held without 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.980
 problem as we can see it remains 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:03.400
 more than cutting it 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:06.070
 there is to taste it here is a good big 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.530
 share this cake bench I confess 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.720
 Honestly I 'm not sure I can 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.880
 wait for them to cool for the 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.640
 savor 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.040
 nothing but the smell go I wish you 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.380

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.560
