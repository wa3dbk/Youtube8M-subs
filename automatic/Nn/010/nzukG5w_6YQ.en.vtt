dishwasher put it in rice for two days
take<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.270> out<00:05:11.069> it<00:05:12.069> will<00:05:12.219> work<00:05:13.110> fine<00:05:14.789> but<00:05:15.789> I

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
take it out it will work fine but I

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.519 
take it out it will work fine but I
still<00:05:15.939> don't<00:05:16.270> like<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.569> speed<00:05:16.840> why<00:05:17.289> is<00:05:17.379> it

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
still don't like the speed why is it

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.830 
still don't like the speed why is it
only<00:05:17.650> a<00:05:17.800> five<00:05:18.159> megabytes<00:05:18.490> per<00:05:18.639> second<00:05:19.029> that<00:05:19.779> is

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
only a five megabytes per second that is

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.080 
only a five megabytes per second that is
ridiculous<00:05:20.469> I<00:05:22.680> neither<00:05:23.680> transfer<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.430> single

hurry<00:06:03.240> up

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.200 

are<00:06:07.570> you<00:06:07.720> kidding<00:06:08.170> me

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.600 

that's<00:06:13.990> better<00:06:14.530> let's<00:06:14.740> turn<00:06:14.889> it<00:06:15.070> out<00:06:15.190> at<00:06:15.370> like

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
that's better let's turn it out at like

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.629 
that's better let's turn it out at like
500<00:06:15.970> kilobytes<00:06:16.660> per<00:06:16.810> second<00:06:17.229> I<00:06:17.289> was<00:06:17.470> scared

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.450 

this<00:06:21.639> is<00:06:21.880> rising<00:06:22.389> I<00:06:22.919> probably<00:06:23.919> need<00:06:24.160> a<00:06:24.190> bigger

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
this is rising I probably need a bigger

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.650 
this is rising I probably need a bigger
file<00:06:24.880> 700<00:06:25.600> megabytes<00:06:26.490> or<00:06:27.490> get<00:06:27.970> it<00:06:28.090> to<00:06:28.240> rise<00:06:28.449> to

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
file 700 megabytes or get it to rise to

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.350 
file 700 megabytes or get it to rise to
its<00:06:28.810> full<00:06:29.080> speed<00:06:29.699> before<00:06:30.699> the<00:06:30.820> transfer<00:06:31.240> is

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
its full speed before the transfer is

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.430 
its full speed before the transfer is
complete<00:06:31.919> we<00:06:32.919> like<00:06:33.100> a<00:06:33.130> 5<00:06:33.910> gigabyte<00:06:34.630> file<00:06:35.110> I

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
complete we like a 5 gigabyte file I

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.940 
complete we like a 5 gigabyte file I
can't<00:06:35.830> find<00:06:36.009> any

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.190 

see<00:06:40.520> transfer<00:06:41.150> speeds<00:06:41.420> for<00:06:41.600> this<00:06:41.720> are

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.200 
see transfer speeds for this are

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.149 
see transfer speeds for this are
brilliant<00:06:42.830> even<00:06:43.100> after<00:06:43.400> going<00:06:43.640> to<00:06:43.730> a<00:06:43.760> dish
