 and it's about what my whole life is all about 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.259
 busy I want to finally 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.590
 speak fearless and call 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.590
 can 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:42.370
 even if you feel like talking here now 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:45.030
 you and always the fear of others 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.030
 rejected 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.210
 you have no head anymore 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.579
 to recognize suspected culprits and me 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.579
 to look after the really important things 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.190
 you try if you just that or me 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.590
 as good as possible somehow still 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.549
 and against it every day 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.770
 does not get better it always gets 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.030
 worse 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.680
 i have the feeling i can do it myself 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.530
 no one else can help me 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.420
 help 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.789
 what is a biggest problem with blockade 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.020
 acquit 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.659
 and you said that earlier 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.789
 thought that you must speak it for 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.990
 you now only films turn so 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.819
 what could happen 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.440
 which words could I use 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:43.890
 grasp the thinking that others make 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.950
 I am ridiculous I am just getting it 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.539
 this whole spiral 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.330
 that starts with sweaty hands 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:55.170
 heartbeat pulse goes up in the air 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:01.590
 I also get black before my eyes 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:05.070
 I have war panic and your fear 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.689
 to talk to others and even up here 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.299
 to stand with the micro europe 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.470
 make sense to say how high is this 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.769
 afraid if you imagine that now you 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.200
 you can see whole races here 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.769
 look at me please and eyes heavy 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.519
 and tired and finally fall in 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.859
 difficult to get heavier and heavier 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.049

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:31.140

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.519
 deeper with her twist sexy deeper 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:45.090
