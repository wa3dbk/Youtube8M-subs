00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 say about my evening care means 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.049
 evening care actually he i wouldn't 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.500
 said he is very different from mine 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.090
 morning care means exclusion from 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.340
 what means but this is me now 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.900
 I will tell that is how I usually do 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.910
 starting with a very thorough cleansing 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.090
 because I understood one thing so that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.029
 so that your skin is clean so that you have 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.519
 there was no clogging 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.470
 be sure to clean very well 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.829
 I also use this moment for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.930
 after all for makeup removal and the same 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.610
 shit and hodge think lenses but a goal 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.260
 ronnie cassettes only I would not say 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.960
 that he removes his makeup very well 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.980
 Well, I use it twice to be honest 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.410
 I have not found that perfect tool 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.590
 which is suitable for makeup removal 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.480
 so 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.010
 as a whole it cleared to me like and 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.870
 if i use it twice i mean 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.239
 first time i take off you top coat 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.939
 Makeup of the second time I use 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.850
 its Foreo moon in this case sharpener 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.770
 doing its job well 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.400
 after i took my say so 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.570
 chapter 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.210
 mostly make up if i have something 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 left before my eyes then I wash off usually to 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.600
 any butter now I 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.340
 I use avocado oil 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.000
 or 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.820
 I also use olive oil especially 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.539
 I don't bother much I stopped 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.770
 buy these two-phase agents why 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.289
 because after all there is a lot of 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.119
 all sorts of different chemicals these oils are not in 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.329
 the principle of coping is a very 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.450
 not bad even so why waste 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.459
 extra money if there is in your so 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.619
 let's say arsenal are so wonderful 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:56.420
 oils that bring you 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.009
 extra protection of the skin of the eyes and nourish 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.599
 additionally therefore dependent 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.780
 moods you can change these oils 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:06.719
 therefore, in principle, nothing more 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.989
 need i am very satisfied after 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.269
 I took off my makeup after that 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:17.970
 I use tonic tonic I use 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:19.500
 either like this this time is ten 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.220
 honestly ca n't wrong 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.879
 uttered this tonic was bought and if 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.370
 you are friends with 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.980
 a long time ago most likely you already have it 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.989
 and either you at least once heard him 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.040
 really don't like it 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.790
 natural then there is no alcohol here 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.430
 aloe vera in composition comes in well 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.130
 principle moisturizes with vitamins and 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.290
 very good enough for 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.810
 sensitive skin 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.389
 if I have redness on the skin either 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.440
 Are there any other rashes? 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.190
 I use here so here is a tonic 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.739
 crawled away 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.359
 called fish srul henceforth min then 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:06.780
 there is this this this tonic he in order to 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.310
 remove skin irritation and in order to 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.569
 to remove 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.739
 reddening with how we ended up with 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.450
 tonics and my skin has dried up from this 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.519
 tonic skin basically dries out very 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:23.669
 quickly but from this the skin dries longer 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.680
 I turn to mean cosmetics and 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:29.190
 in general, I would say that evening 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.959
 I leave care that's exactly for 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.970
 order to fight with some on 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.879
 his problems on his skin that is 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.189
 whether it is rash or anti-aging 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.319
 any changes mean this moment 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.569
 I use these two creams here both 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.299
 cream and I ordered her up in a both 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.659
 cream I did a review leave a reference 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.519
 below who are interested come see 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:53.909
 love two creams, I think that with these 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.920
 two creams well, that is, as if not 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.150
 only with these creams, well, it's probably 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.879
 my main discoveries 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.159
 mean last year and these creams 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.040
 allow me to keep the skin in 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:10.260
 good condition is a cream with retinol 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.769
 and cream with 10% glycolic 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.380
 acid means cream with retinol I im 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.469
 I usually use probably around 1 5 in 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.840
 week means then when i'm not 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:26.610
 use or and then when i need 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.650
 it means more powerful what is it too 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.800
 a cream to fight off 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.979
 peeling off in retinol i'm taking advantage 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.770
 10% glycolic acid this 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.220
 yak cream in your review if you saw 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.050
 I already said I use it more as 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.810
 peeling at home as you 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.300
 very very much and i enjoyed it 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.990
 three days in a row and got a skin burn 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.610
 so for daily care my skin 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.479
 on him not to perceive too he 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.400
 strong and that's it for the times in this time 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.200
 a week twice a week here for these 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.889
 goals fit very well those days when 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.340
 my skin is irritated i'm not 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.690
 know if i'm moving with retinol or 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.880
 went too far with glycol 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.590
 acid and its media also spoke it 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.520
 cannot be applied with a thick layer therefore 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.160
 if you overdo it and 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.250
 and apply thick sand and can easily 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.010
 for getting burned so i use 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.330
 mean cream and volume and it can 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.580
 use like in the morning as soon as 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:31.590
 I do nâ€™t know in the evening I said no at first 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:34.780
 But I also spoke to me 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.810
 Unfortunately, not enough gives me 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.860
 moisturizing so after this cream i 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:45.550
 usually wear another bioderma cream 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.260
 I will not pronounce exactly I will leave 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.120
 I will try to show the information below 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.120
 close packing 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:58.389
 I will not pronounce the name so as not to 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:01.630
 breaking his tongue he goes for deep 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:04.720
 he is very light and he specially 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.600
 designed for dehydrated skin 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.820
 that's why if in moments when he is me 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.310
 dehydrated skin and fused climate sign 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.790
 changing is there any i lack moisture in 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:18.580
 air then i use this this cream 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:22.810
 either one more i have cream for 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:25.990
 moisturizing this cream too so here it is 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.270
 Looks like I'll leave a link to the bottom 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:34.660
 Unfortunately, these creams have such names 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:35.580
 what to produce is very hard sometimes 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.490
 moron 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:44.440
 also very suitable for sensitive 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:46.450
 skin for irritated for dry for 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.970
 sensitive he already said for 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:53.620
 sensitive penetrates very deeply into 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:55.530
 skin and well moisturize only want 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.419
 say about this cream he has 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.940
 It means not very bad that they 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:03.100
 very good not very natural 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.710
 anyway anyway 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:08.250
 little pump robin thicke so if 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.740
 you are still looking for cosmetics based 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.440
 natural means herbs and ingredients 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:17.350
 it probably is not very likely 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.479
 this cream is not suitable 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.410
 no smell and bioderma to me very 

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:24.850
 pleasant smell i generally love cream and 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.880
 means of smell so I really 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.740
 like it smells really gentle clean and 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.620
 expensive even though you are great for watching 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.780
 I hope this video was useful to you 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.300
 put your fingers up if you have questions 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:41.190
 always leave below and before 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.190
 meeting in the next video bye bye
