00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
next and I'm gonna start a program in

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.200 
next and I'm gonna start a program in
the<00:00:42.480> program<00:00:42.629> we're<00:00:42.960> gonna<00:00:43.020> start<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:44.340> gonna

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the program we're gonna start is gonna

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.930 
the program we're gonna start is gonna
be<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:46.230> built<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.829> program<00:00:47.129> called<00:00:47.370> shut<00:00:47.730> down

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
be a built in program called shut down

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.799 
be a built in program called shut down
and<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.480> want<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.840> say<00:00:49.050> browse<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:51.120> this

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
and we want to say browse and this

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.720 
and we want to say browse and this
program<00:00:52.140> lives<00:00:52.710> under<00:00:53.280> C<00:00:53.989> windows<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.730> system

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
program lives under C windows and system

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
program lives under C windows and system
32<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.699> what<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.969> looks<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.270> there<00:01:00.480> C

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
32 so that's what it looks like there C

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.060 
32 so that's what it looks like there C
windows<00:01:01.199> system32<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:03.059> quickly<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.780> to

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
windows system32 and to quickly get to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.830 
windows system32 and to quickly get to
any<00:01:05.070> file<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.760> folder<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.330> type<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
any file in a folder you just type the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.960 
any file in a folder you just type the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
letter of a full that starts with you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.670 
letter of a full that starts with you
can<00:01:09.240> even<00:01:09.390> type<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.110> first<00:01:10.260> two<00:01:10.500> or<00:01:10.650> three

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.820 
can even type the first two or three
letters<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.250> I'm<00:01:11.310> gonna<00:01:11.460> type<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.850> SH<00:01:12.830> and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
letters so I'm gonna type in SH and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.350 
letters so I'm gonna type in SH and
that's<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> get<00:01:14.490> us<00:01:14.580> down<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> SH

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
that's going to get us down to the SH

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.630 
that's going to get us down to the SH
area<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.890> we're<00:01:17.009> gonna<00:01:17.130> scroll<00:01:17.400> down<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
area and we're gonna scroll down a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.219 
area and we're gonna scroll down a
little<00:01:17.759> bit<00:01:18.030> more<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.570> there's<00:01:18.720> our<00:01:18.869> program

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
little bit more and there's our program

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.320 
little bit more and there's our program
shutdown<00:01:19.770> exe<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.640> we're<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> open

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
shutdown exe and we're going to open

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.050 
shutdown exe and we're going to open
this<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.860> we<00:01:22.860> want<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> add<00:01:23.220> two<00:01:23.490> arguments

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
this and we want to add two arguments

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.749 
this and we want to add two arguments
the<00:01:24.540> argument<00:01:24.990> though<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.610> reboots<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the argument though that reboots the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.800 
the argument though that reboots the
computer<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.689> -<00:01:28.110> R<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.600> another<00:01:30.600> argument

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
computer is is - R and another argument

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.929 
computer is is - R and another argument
is<00:01:31.350> -<00:01:31.860> F<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:33.509> -<00:01:33.720> F<00:01:33.990> will<00:01:34.470> force<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.430> computer<00:01:35.820> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
is - F so - F will force the computer to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
is - F so - F will force the computer to
reboot<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.110> there's<00:01:37.290> any<00:01:37.409> computer<00:01:37.860> any

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
reboot and if there's any computer any

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640 
reboot and if there's any computer any
programs<00:01:38.610> keeping<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.570> from<00:01:39.689> rebooting<00:01:40.170> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
programs keeping it from rebooting this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.620 
programs keeping it from rebooting this
will<00:01:40.920> ignore<00:01:41.340> those<00:01:41.610> programs<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.450> it'll

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
will ignore those programs and it'll

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.440 
will ignore those programs and it'll
just<00:01:42.780> force<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.590> reboot<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.240> wanted

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
just force it to reboot so if you wanted

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.530 
just force it to reboot so if you wanted
it<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.720> shut<00:01:46.049> down<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.530> would<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:46.979> -<00:01:47.280> s<00:01:47.700> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
it to shut down it would just be - s so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.270 
it to shut down it would just be - s so
we're<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> reboot<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
we're just going to do a reboot and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.429 
we're just going to do a reboot and
we're<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.610> force<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.030> reboot<00:01:51.439> we're

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
we're going to force it to reboot we're

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.319 
we're going to force it to reboot we're
gonna<00:01:52.560> hit<00:01:52.740> next<00:01:52.770> we're<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> say<00:01:53.729> reboot

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
gonna hit next we're going to say reboot

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.560 
gonna hit next we're going to say reboot
weekly<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.560> want<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.860> open<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.570> properties
