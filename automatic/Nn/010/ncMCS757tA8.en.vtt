00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
quite a zing off it however the point is

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.390 
quite a zing off it however the point is
that<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.779> free-form<00:00:25.439> LEDs<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.130> zig

ohm<00:00:36.480> resistors<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
ohm resistors and just because it

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.500 
ohm resistors and just because it
actually<00:00:37.829> suited<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> base

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
actually suited it to the base

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.350 
actually suited it to the base
this<00:00:40.350> base<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.969> salvaged<00:00:41.969> from<00:00:42.000> an<00:00:42.180> existing

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
this base is salvaged from an existing

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.229 
this base is salvaged from an existing
LED<00:00:42.840> light<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:44.100> has<00:00:44.309> these<00:00:44.520> pop-out<00:00:44.910> pins

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
LED light so I it has these pop-out pins

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.270 
LED light so I it has these pop-out pins
and<00:00:45.510> by<00:00:45.570> putting<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.230> resistors<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.829> could

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
and by putting on two resistors I could

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.709 
and by putting on two resistors I could
just<00:00:47.430> pop<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> resistor<00:00:48.090> leads<00:00:48.239> down<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
just pop the resistor leads down and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.270 
just pop the resistor leads down and
then<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.140> push<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> pins<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.129> wedge

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
then just push the pins in to wedge

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
then just push the pins in to wedge
against<00:00:50.579> leads<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> how<00:00:51.390> these<00:00:51.539> made

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
against leads which is how these made

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.779 
against leads which is how these made
connections<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> use<00:00:53.010> two<00:00:53.219> resistors

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
connections so I use two resistors

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.180 
connections so I use two resistors
I<00:00:53.820> used<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.960> bridge<00:00:55.170> rectifier<00:00:55.350> made<00:00:55.980> from

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
I used a bridge rectifier made from

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.770 
I used a bridge rectifier made from
discrete<00:00:56.550> one<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.910> four<00:00:57.180> double<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.510> seven

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
discrete one and four double of seven

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.360 
discrete one and four double of seven
diodes<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.350> that's<00:00:58.829> 100<00:00:59.160> ohm<00:00:59.300> 100<00:01:00.300> ohm<00:01:01.370> per

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
diodes so that's 100 ohm 100 ohm per

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.020 
diodes so that's 100 ohm 100 ohm per
direct<00:01:02.640> fire<00:01:04.700> 1n4<00:01:05.700> double-oh-seven

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
direct fire 1n4 double-oh-seven

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.380 
direct fire 1n4 double-oh-seven
diode<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.479> AC<00:01:09.750> AC<00:01:10.260> plus<00:01:11.150> minus<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
diode so that's AC AC plus minus and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.149 
diode so that's AC AC plus minus and
then<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.740> output<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.250> put<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.790> capacitor

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.510 

four<00:01:20.159> point<00:01:20.369> seven<00:01:20.580> micro<00:01:21.000> farad<00:01:22.189> 400<00:01:23.189> volts

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
four point seven micro farad 400 volts

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.700 
four point seven micro farad 400 volts
and<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.869> because<00:01:24.869> these<00:01:25.049> operates<00:01:25.470> at<00:01:25.530> very

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and that because these operates at very

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.010 
and that because these operates at very
low<00:01:25.860> current<00:01:26.100> really<00:01:26.700> low<00:01:26.820> current<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.689> means

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
low current really low current it means

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.569 
low current really low current it means
that<00:01:28.229> there's<00:01:28.380> no<00:01:28.619> flicker<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.400> all

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that there's no flicker at all

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.370 
that there's no flicker at all
absolutely<00:01:30.210> nothing<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.079> solid

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
absolutely nothing it's just a solid

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.950 
absolutely nothing it's just a solid
soft<00:01:31.890> light<00:01:32.189> not<00:01:32.909> high<00:01:33.180> current<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
soft light not high current I have to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.620 
soft light not high current I have to
say<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.770> something<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:36.979> is<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
say really it's something like and is it

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.319 
say really it's something like and is it
to<00:01:39.630> me<00:01:39.840> lamps<00:01:40.340> through<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> LEDs<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.060> really

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
to me lamps through the LEDs it's really

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.940 
to me lamps through the LEDs it's really
quite<00:01:42.540> low<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.020> there's<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> discharge

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
quite low so there's a discharge

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
quite low so there's a discharge
resistor<00:01:44.579> across<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> stop<00:01:45.450> any<00:01:45.689> nasty

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
resistor across there to stop any nasty

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.330 
resistor across there to stop any nasty
surprises<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.950> 1<00:01:47.250> megohm<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:50.450> then<00:01:52.340> because

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
surprises it's 1 megohm and then because

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.490 
surprises it's 1 megohm and then because
I<00:01:53.640> had<00:01:53.850> eight<00:01:54.060> filaments<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.899> combined

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
I had eight filaments and the combined

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.870 
I had eight filaments and the combined
voltage<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.100> eight<00:01:56.189> filaments<00:01:56.670> would<00:01:56.790> have

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
voltage of eight filaments would have

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.260 
voltage of eight filaments would have
been<00:01:56.969> too<00:01:57.180> high<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.420> across<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.909> put<00:01:59.909> one

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
been too high just across this I put one

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.510 
been too high just across this I put one
10k<00:02:00.750> resistor<00:02:01.170> there<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:03.979> then<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.070> put<00:02:05.100> two

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
10k resistor there and then I put two

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.649 
10k resistor there and then I put two
separate<00:02:06.000> 10k<00:02:06.420> resistors<00:02:09.200> there

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659

the<00:02:12.659> dissipation<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.439> negligible<00:02:14.219> this<00:02:14.310> one

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
the dissipation is negligible this one

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.349 
the dissipation is negligible this one
dissipates<00:02:14.939> about<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:17.730> dissipates<00:02:18.180> more

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
dissipates about and it dissipates more

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.759 
dissipates about and it dissipates more
in<00:02:18.420> those<00:02:18.569> ones<00:02:18.810> because<00:02:18.959> it's<00:02:19.260> dropping<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
in those ones because it's dropping the

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.050 
in those ones because it's dropping the
bulk<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.659> voltage<00:02:22.099> and<00:02:23.099> this<00:02:23.790> one<00:02:23.939> just

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
bulk of the voltage and this one just

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.720 
bulk of the voltage and this one just
pitched<00:02:24.269> around<00:02:24.450> about<00:02:25.370> 90<00:02:26.370> milliwatts

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
pitched around about 90 milliwatts

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.330 
pitched around about 90 milliwatts
really<00:02:27.659> nothing<00:02:28.049> major<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:30.829> so<00:02:31.829> that<00:02:32.159> because

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
really nothing major and so that because

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.910 
really nothing major and so that because
though<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.730> filaments<00:02:33.480> are<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:37.470> goes<00:02:37.739> out

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
though the filaments are that goes out

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.530 
though the filaments are that goes out
to<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.250> center<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.939> then<00:02:39.359> the<00:02:39.599> branch<00:02:39.930> out

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
to the center and then the branch out

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.300 
to the center and then the branch out
and<00:02:43.489> one<00:02:44.489> goes<00:02:44.909> to<00:02:44.939> there<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:47.010> other<00:02:47.159> one

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
and one goes to there and the other one

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.229 
and one goes to there and the other one
goes<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:48.019> there<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.760> divides<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.909> current

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
goes to there and that divides a current

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.300 
goes to there and that divides a current
so<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:52.530> goes<00:02:53.489> around<00:02:53.879> and<00:02:54.120> evenly<00:02:54.689> and<00:02:55.310> so

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
so that it goes around and evenly and so

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.899 
so that it goes around and evenly and so
there<00:02:56.459> we<00:02:56.579> go

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
there we go

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.240 
there we go
and<00:02:57.000> that's<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:58.200> it's<00:02:58.470> really<00:02:58.739> as<00:02:58.829> simple<00:02:58.889> as

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and that's it it's really as simple as

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.909 
and that's it it's really as simple as
that<00:02:59.659> and<00:03:00.659> when<00:03:01.349> I<00:03:01.439> light<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:03.230> it<00:03:04.230> looks<00:03:04.590> like

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
that and when I light it it looks like

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:15.730 
that and when I light it it looks like
this<00:03:12.530> not<00:03:13.530> too<00:03:13.709> bad<00:03:13.919> at<00:03:14.040> all

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
this not too bad at all

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.600 
this not too bad at all
so<00:03:16.370> there<00:03:16.550> we<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:17.830> quite<00:03:18.830> visually<00:03:19.370> right

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
so there we have it quite visually right

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.910 
so there we have it quite visually right
I'm<00:03:19.820> just<00:03:19.970> gonna<00:03:20.360> turn<00:03:20.900> these<00:03:21.080> lights<00:03:21.230> off<00:03:21.530> or

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
I'm just gonna turn these lights off or

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.050 
I'm just gonna turn these lights off or
is<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.100> just<00:03:22.160> going<00:03:22.490> to<00:03:22.580> be<00:03:22.640> too<00:03:22.820> bright<00:03:23.030> for

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
is that just going to be too bright for

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.850 
is that just going to be too bright for
twenties<00:03:23.510> lights<00:03:23.690> off<00:03:23.930> its<00:03:24.110> going<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.320> Swamper

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
twenties lights off its going to Swamper

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.580 
twenties lights off its going to Swamper
if<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.070> turn<00:03:25.280> these<00:03:25.400> lights<00:03:25.580> off<00:03:25.820> isn't<00:03:26.030> it<00:03:26.210> yeah

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
if I turn these lights off isn't it yeah

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.380 
if I turn these lights off isn't it yeah
but<00:03:27.590> there<00:03:27.740> we<00:03:27.830> go<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.580> is<00:03:28.730> one-sided

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
but there we go and it is one-sided

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.180 
but there we go and it is one-sided
because<00:03:29.840> well<00:03:30.020> those<00:03:30.230> are<00:03:30.350> side<00:03:30.560> lights<00:03:30.860> but

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
because well those are side lights but

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.730 
because well those are side lights but
it's<00:03:31.310> more<00:03:31.520> diffused<00:03:32.260> because<00:03:33.260> this<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.560> say

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
it's more diffused because this to say

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.380 
it's more diffused because this to say
the<00:03:33.800> LEDs<00:03:34.190> are<00:03:34.340> mounted<00:03:34.670> onto<00:03:34.820> had<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.270> mount

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
the LEDs are mounted onto had to mount

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.150 
the LEDs are mounted onto had to mount
the<00:03:35.540> LED<00:03:35.600> specifically<00:03:36.380> around<00:03:36.590> that<00:03:36.770> way<00:03:36.920> but

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
the LED specifically around that way but

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.330 
the LED specifically around that way but
there<00:03:37.520> we<00:03:37.670> have<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.320> world's<00:03:39.340> weirdest

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
there we have it the world's weirdest

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.120 
there we have it the world's weirdest
and<00:03:40.580> biggest<00:03:41.000> LED<00:03:41.450> filament<00:03:41.930> lamp<00:03:42.140> oh<00:03:42.440> and

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
and biggest LED filament lamp oh and

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.590 
and biggest LED filament lamp oh and
because<00:03:43.490> of<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.820> use<00:03:43.970> of<00:03:44.000> a<00:03:44.150> fairly<00:03:44.450> big

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
because of the use of a fairly big

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.570 
because of the use of a fairly big
capacitor<00:03:45.140> where<00:03:45.590> you<00:03:45.650> turn<00:03:45.830> it<00:03:45.920> off<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.070> fades

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
capacitor where you turn it off it fades

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.870 
capacitor where you turn it off it fades
away

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
away

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.230 
away
it<00:03:47.840> doesn't<00:03:48.170> just<00:03:48.380> go<00:03:48.500> out<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:49.400> has<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.850> slight

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
it doesn't just go out it has a slight

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.160 
it doesn't just go out it has a slight
filter<00:03:50.780> which<00:03:51.290> is<00:03:51.440> quite<00:03:51.650> nice<00:03:51.830> too
