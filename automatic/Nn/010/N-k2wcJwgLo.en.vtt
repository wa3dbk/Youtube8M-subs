00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.290 
this but this hair I can't just leave it
alone<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.350> have<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.550> keep<00:02:54.760> running<00:02:55.030> my

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
alone like I have to keep running my

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.230 
alone like I have to keep running my
hands<00:02:55.750> through<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.050> in<00:02:56.620> order<00:02:57.340> not

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
hands through it in order not

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.300 
hands through it in order not
continuously<00:02:59.110> but<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.560> can't<00:02:59.890> just<00:03:00.040> go<00:03:00.190> the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
continuously but I can't just go the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.860 
continuously but I can't just go the
whole<00:03:00.459> day<00:03:00.610> without<00:03:00.760> running<00:03:01.209> my<00:03:01.300> hands<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.750> it

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
whole day without running my hands to it

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.470 
whole day without running my hands to it
like<00:03:02.050> I<00:03:02.290> have<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:03.130> manipulated<00:03:03.970> in<00:03:04.090> some<00:03:04.300> type

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
like I have to manipulated in some type

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.000 
like I have to manipulated in some type
of<00:03:04.510> way<00:03:04.660> for<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.200> add<00:03:05.650> right<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:08.200> not<00:03:08.769> that

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
of way for it to add right it's not that

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.430 
of way for it to add right it's not that
it<00:03:09.160> gets<00:03:09.340> tangled<00:03:09.820> and<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.690> doesn't<00:03:11.290> get

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
it gets tangled and it doesn't get

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.310 
it gets tangled and it doesn't get
matted<00:03:12.390> but<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.510> gets<00:03:13.780> like<00:03:14.280> clump<00:03:15.280> together

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
matted but it gets like clump together

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.720 
matted but it gets like clump together
it's<00:03:17.320> hard<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.680> explain<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:18.040> lot<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.459> people

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
it's hard to explain a lot of people

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.180 
it's hard to explain a lot of people
have<00:03:18.820> still<00:03:19.090> been<00:03:19.120> telling<00:03:19.540> me<00:03:19.660> they<00:03:19.810> like

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
have still been telling me they like

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.729 
have still been telling me they like
this<00:03:21.190> hair<00:03:21.630> people<00:03:22.630> have<00:03:22.870> seen<00:03:23.140> me<00:03:23.380> with<00:03:23.530> it

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
this hair people have seen me with it

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.940 
this hair people have seen me with it
but<00:03:24.220> just<00:03:25.180> from<00:03:25.930> going<00:03:26.170> from<00:03:26.530> what<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.800> look

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
but just from going from what it look

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.920 
but just from going from what it look
like<00:03:26.980> when<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.310> first<00:03:27.580> installed<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.690> this

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
like when I first installed it to this

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.960 
like when I first installed it to this
and<00:03:29.320> I<00:03:29.800> don't<00:03:30.870> necessarily<00:03:31.870> care<00:03:32.140> for<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:33.040> it

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
and I don't necessarily care for but it

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.960 
and I don't necessarily care for but it
doesn't<00:03:34.450> get<00:03:34.680> tangled<00:03:35.680> or<00:03:36.100> matted<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.760> just

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
doesn't get tangled or matted it just

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.860 
doesn't get tangled or matted it just
gets<00:03:37.209> clumped<00:03:38.200> together<00:03:38.680> like<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:40.480> can<00:03:40.690> see

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
gets clumped together like you can see

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.240 
gets clumped together like you can see
how<00:03:40.959> fine<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.470> look<00:03:41.709> it's<00:03:41.890> just<00:03:42.100> I<00:03:42.190> don't

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
how fine this look it's just I don't

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.970 
how fine this look it's just I don't
like<00:03:42.430> how<00:03:42.700> it<00:03:42.850> just<00:03:42.880> clumped<00:03:43.450> together<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.950> I

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
like how it just clumped together so I

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.960 
like how it just clumped together so I
find<00:03:45.430> myself<00:03:45.989> having<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:48.060> comb<00:03:49.060> through<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.019> a

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
find myself having to comb through it a

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.660 
find myself having to comb through it a
lot

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.150 

and<00:03:55.480> as<00:03:56.230> I'm<00:03:56.440> coming<00:03:56.470> through<00:03:56.860> it<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.340> am<00:03:58.110> losing

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
and as I'm coming through it I am losing

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.350 
and as I'm coming through it I am losing
strands<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.370> have<00:04:01.000> yet<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.860> wash<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.310> hair<00:04:03.580> so

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
strands I have yet to wash the hair so

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.170 
strands I have yet to wash the hair so
that's<00:04:05.200> what<00:04:05.470> I'm<00:04:05.590> gonna<00:04:06.310> go<00:04:06.670> do<00:04:06.940> and

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
that's what I'm gonna go do and

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.559 
that's what I'm gonna go do and
hopefully<00:04:07.390> that'll<00:04:07.990> help<00:04:09.030> just<00:04:10.030> bring<00:04:10.420> this

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
hopefully that'll help just bring this

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.570 
hopefully that'll help just bring this
hair<00:04:10.870> back<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.170> life<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.860> little<00:04:11.890> bit<00:04:12.310> more

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
hair back to life a little bit more

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.000 
hair back to life a little bit more
because<00:04:13.360> I<00:04:13.840> mean<00:04:13.990> it's<00:04:14.110> still<00:04:14.290> very<00:04:14.590> pretty

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
because I mean it's still very pretty

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.800 
because I mean it's still very pretty
hair<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.430> still<00:04:15.730> blends<00:04:16.000> extremely<00:04:16.600> well

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
hair it still blends extremely well

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.750 
hair it still blends extremely well
because<00:04:17.440> once<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.769> comb<00:04:17.980> through<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.280> I'm<00:04:18.579> like

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
because once I comb through it I'm like

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.039 
because once I comb through it I'm like
I'm<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.120> 1<00:04:19.359> I'm<00:04:19.540> good

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
I'm a 1 I'm good

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.580 
I'm a 1 I'm good
but<00:04:20.890> I<00:04:21.220> just<00:04:21.690> maybe<00:04:22.690> it<00:04:22.870> just<00:04:22.900> needs<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.380> wash

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
but I just maybe it just needs a wash

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.070 
but I just maybe it just needs a wash
it's<00:04:23.980> been<00:04:24.160> 2<00:04:24.400> weeks<00:04:24.430> also<00:04:25.000> been<00:04:25.300> crazy<00:04:25.690> crazy

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
it's been 2 weeks also been crazy crazy

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.920 
it's been 2 weeks also been crazy crazy
humid<00:04:26.560> so<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:26.830> don't<00:04:27.160> know<00:04:27.340> if<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:28.390> has<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:28.690> do

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
humid so I don't know if that has to do

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.580 
humid so I don't know if that has to do
with<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.290> either

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
with it either

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.030 
with it either
so<00:04:29.919> that<00:04:30.760> clumpiness<00:04:31.210> could<00:04:32.140> just<00:04:32.440> be<00:04:32.590> from<00:04:32.860> it

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
so that clumpiness could just be from it

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.340 
so that clumpiness could just be from it
being<00:04:33.250> human<00:04:33.730> so<00:04:34.210> I'll<00:04:34.390> be<00:04:34.660> right<00:04:34.780> back<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.260> I

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
being human so I'll be right back and I

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.280 
being human so I'll be right back and I
shall<00:04:35.590> now<00:04:35.830> um<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.730> just<00:04:36.790> got<00:04:37.090> through<00:04:37.330> blow
