00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
we are gonna as I setup will not just a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:56.580 
we are gonna as I setup will not just a
little<00:02:43.390> bit<00:02:43.510> more

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:09.610 

so<00:02:57.590> we<00:02:57.740> mix<00:02:57.950> it<00:03:07.390> we<00:03:08.390> are<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.900> tiny<00:03:09.200> bit<00:03:09.470> of

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.940 

now<00:03:31.820> I'm<00:03:31.970> going<00:03:32.270> to<00:03:32.390> bring<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> stop<00:03:32.950> low

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
now I'm going to bring it to a stop low

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.480 
now I'm going to bring it to a stop low
heat<00:03:34.250> cover<00:03:35.000> it<00:03:35.240> up<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:35.660> would<00:03:36.290> say<00:03:36.500> 3540

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
heat cover it up I would say 3540

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.410 
heat cover it up I would say 3540
minutes<00:03:37.640> take<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.420> out<00:03:38.660> five<00:03:39.530> minutes<00:03:39.830> rest

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.330 

so<00:04:03.390> this<00:04:03.569> is<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:05.310> mushroom<00:04:05.730> karma<00:04:06.239> she<00:04:06.450> done

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
so this is the mushroom karma she done
