00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:11.200
 In 2012, the world of technology went crazy with goggles. He appeared on Kickstarter 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.660
 Oculus Rift, an idea for the helmet of virtual reality, which 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.890
 it would allow players to sink into games at an unprecedented scale. 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.380
 The concept turned out to be a hit, and the originators asking for investment in 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.280
 in the form of $ 250,000 in a month, they collected from enthusiastic people 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.330
 players, up to ten times this amount. Of course, this was not the first attempt 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.130
 creating a consumer VR system - the early 90s were a period in which 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.210
 the neofuturyi growi spread in their visions of the future with virtual ones 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.950
 glasses on heads. Two decades later, these predictions finally come 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.560
 chance to become reality. 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.350
 Usually, when we hear about new, revolutionary technology, it looks like it 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.680
 great on paper, but in practice, it leaves in its primitive form 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.140
 quite a lot to be desired. Reality does not coincide with expectations. 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.830
 It is different with Oculus. Assuming an early development prototype 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.190
 we immediately understand why this technology can have a future. 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.940
 Even in such an early form of the device, its purpose is completely for the recipient 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.000
 bright. The virtual reality revolution is so natural and 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.640
 of course, how natural the mouse, keyboard and color seem to us today 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.720
 monitors. By removing the glasses, we wonder: "why 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.200
 we had to wait for it so long "? 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.980
 The principle of operation of the accessory is fabulously simple. We put on goggles and 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.410
 we automatically become the hero of the game watching the world from his perspective. 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.900
 If we turn our heads, the protagonist will also turn his head. Our eyes are becoming 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.980
 through the eyes of a virtual avatar. The facade is heightened by the fact that the helmet displays the image in 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.300
 full 3D. 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.700
 Oculus Rift consists of a small liquid crystal display 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.190
 embedded in special head goggles. Left lens, and what 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.540
 this leaves the left eye, sees only the left half of the screen, the right lens sees 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.810
 half the right, together to create a synchronized, three-dimensional image. 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.880
 The device needs to be connected to a computer using three cables - 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.380
 power, HDMI or DVI that allows you to display the image from 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.140
 computer on the RIFT screen, and a USB cable with which the helmet transmits 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.780
 information about the user's head movements back to the computer. 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.700
 Oculus is only a display, the whole burden of image generation 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.980
 it rests on the computer. Unfortunately, this means that the device is compatible 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.240
 is exclusively with games specially adapted for this purpose. developers, 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.020
 using SDK packages must implement the service on their own 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.950
 devices. Games displaying in a friendly Oculus format 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.210
 are generated, as in similar 3D technologies, from the display next to 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.830
 two separate images. Because two rectangles 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.210
 rather like watching a three-dimensional film on a flat surface 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.550
 display in the cinema, the field of view is further distorted creating 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.780
 optical illusion of the surrounding image player. 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.450
 Unfortunately, ordinary video does not give the unusual impression of using Rifta, 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.430
 so you will have to take our word for it when we say that even now, in 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.650
 its early prototype form ... it just works. 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.170
 There is a long way to go before the creators of Rift - the premiere of the consumer version 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.230
 the device is planned for not earlier than the end of 2014, and the whole company 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.950
 time is experimenting with new functionality. And no wonder, though 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.760
 potential, there is still a lot to do. 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.510
 The problem is not the device itself but our brains. minds 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.720
 Oculus users have great difficulty adapting to the attack 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.060
 to their senses and they can not cope with what they see. Eyes say we're rushing 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.490
 a roller coaster, but a labyrinth and the rest sitting calmly on the body chair 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.590
 They deny. When we jump in the mech, we fall into the abyss or do it fast 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.220
 the car's turn comes to bizarre situations in which the whole 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.310
 our body reacts as if we actually took part in the action, even though this one 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.780
 it's only in our head. The side effect of this lack of compliance 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.510
 the senses is a condition called 'simulator disease'. 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.230
 Symptoms are typical of motion sickness - nausea, dizziness - 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.600
 in extreme cases, just a few seconds after wearing the helmet on the head. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.160
 And although it is not medical advice, so treat it with a pinch of salt: no 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.400
 no aviomarins or locomotives will help. We tried. 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.560
 This is first-hand information, for three people testing in the editorial office 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.470
 device, all reported similar symptoms of varying intensity. 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.240
 Interestingly, the problem only occurs in some games. In my case, those 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.000
 after which I would expect the biggest problems, like 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.050
 Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! they did not impress my labyrinth. From the virtual queue 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.130
 mountain, which in fact would not move me a bit, I had to 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.260
 "Come down" after a few seconds. 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.490
 Fortunately, if you believe the creators of the helmet, newer, not yet available in 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.780
 Oculus prototypes are sold thanks to the use of higher screens 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.460
 resolution and lower image delay almost eliminated this problem 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.650
 to zero. This is not the only improvement over which we sweat in the face 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.820
 the authors work. The latest prototype codenamed "Crystal Cove", 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.460
 presented at CES 2014, he cooperated with a camera that helped 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.120
 track not only the angle of inclination, but also the position of the device enabling 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.680
 moving movements such as tilting your head to the sides or 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.580
 looking closely at something. 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.210
 The fact that virtual reality technology has the potential to provide 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.760
 maybe a record sale of a prototype device or interest in itself 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.210
 Valve, the creators of Steam, which has recently even launched a special one 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.070
 a version of Pig Picture mode for vr displays, and even added support for Oculus 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.590
 to Team Fortress 2. 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.210
 Looking at the self-proclaimed expert, I would not expect a consumer 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.590
 Rifta premieres earlier than at the beginning of 2015, but when the device in its 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.300
 the final form will go to stores, in my opinion, you should go with it 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.220
 interest. This accessory can initiate a virtual revolution on 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.500
 mass scale and change our perception not only 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.010
 first-person video games, but even how we experience movies and 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.960
 television, and who knows, can and videoconferencing. I can not 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.680
 wait!
