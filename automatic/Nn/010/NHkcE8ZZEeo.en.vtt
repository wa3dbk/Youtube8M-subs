something like that

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.399 
something like that
but<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.470> learned<00:01:05.309> today<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.260> they<00:01:07.260> are

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.250 
but I just learned today that they are
bringing<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.890> bag<00:01:08.130> back<00:01:08.869> sometime<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.110> the

that's my thing I never wanted to bring

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.290 
that's my thing I never wanted to bring
two<00:03:21.940> bags<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.260> thought<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:23.709> would<00:03:24.270> show<00:03:25.270> you

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
two bags so I thought I would show you

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.090 
two bags so I thought I would show you
if<00:03:25.630> anybody<00:03:25.959> else<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.440> see<00:03:26.739> on<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:26.950> inside

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
if anybody else can see on the inside

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.560 
if anybody else can see on the inside
and<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.670> does<00:03:27.880> as<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.239> see<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:29.530> does<00:03:29.830> zip

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
and it does as you see it does zip

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.320 
and it does as you see it does zip
completely<00:03:31.570> closed<00:03:32.700> just<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.150> only

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
completely closed just the only

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.830 
completely closed just the only
difference<00:03:34.840> I<00:03:35.020> would<00:03:35.080> say<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.840> get

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
difference I would say is the get

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.190 
difference I would say is the get
carried<00:03:38.260> away<00:03:38.760> see<00:03:39.760> that<00:03:39.970> guy<00:03:40.180> has<00:03:41.170> a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
carried away see that guy has a

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.860 
carried away see that guy has a
breakaway<00:03:42.010> zipper<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.820> this<00:03:43.150> one<00:03:43.420> does<00:03:43.840> not

breakaway zipper and this one does not
have<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.530> breakaway<00:03:45.070> zipper<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.489> if<00:03:45.610> you

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
something a little bit smaller to have

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.280 
something a little bit smaller to have
to<00:04:03.459> carry<00:04:03.700> around<00:04:03.820> but<00:04:04.390> yeah<00:04:04.570> you<00:04:04.840> know<00:04:04.959> large

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
you can you think that this bag might do

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.050 
you can you think that this bag might do
the<00:04:09.250> trick<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:09.790> if<00:04:10.510> you<00:04:10.630> are<00:04:10.690> interested<00:04:11.500> keep

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the trick so if you are interested keep

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.420 
the trick so if you are interested keep
out<00:04:12.360> sometime<00:04:12.900> in<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.080> fall<00:04:13.319> and<00:04:13.890> like<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.310> said

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
out sometime in the fall and like I said

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.729 
out sometime in the fall and like I said
Vera<00:04:15.390> Bradley<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:15.870> supposed<00:04:16.230> to<00:04:16.350> be<00:04:16.470> bringing

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
Vera Bradley is supposed to be bringing

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.909 
Vera Bradley is supposed to be bringing
this<00:04:16.829> bag<00:04:17.070> back<00:04:17.430> but<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.810> color<00:04:19.109> choices<00:04:19.590> I

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
this bag back but the color choices I

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.199 
this bag back but the color choices I
could<00:04:19.980> even<00:04:20.340> begin<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.609> tell<00:04:20.850> you<00:04:20.910> what<00:04:21.120> would

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
could even begin to tell you what would

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.790 
could even begin to tell you what would
be<00:04:21.359> available<00:04:21.810> in<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.049> or<00:04:22.169> not<00:04:22.290> I<00:04:22.500> would<00:04:22.680> just

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
be available in it or not I would just

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.680 
be available in it or not I would just
assumed<00:04:23.130> maybe<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.700> current<00:04:24.000> colors<00:04:24.389> or<00:04:24.570> the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
assumed maybe the current colors or the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.270 
assumed maybe the current colors or the
colors<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.110> they'd<00:04:25.230> be<00:04:25.290> releasing

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
colors that they'd be releasing

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.820 
colors that they'd be releasing
so<00:04:26.850> if<00:04:27.060> it's<00:04:27.300> in<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:27.660> fall<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.380> would

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
so if it's in the fall that would

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.080 
so if it's in the fall that would
probably<00:04:29.130> be<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.280> winter<00:04:29.460> color<00:04:29.730> so<00:04:29.940> maybe

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
probably be the winter color so maybe

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.879 
probably be the winter color so maybe
only<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.630> winter<00:04:30.840> colors<00:04:31.139> I'm<00:04:31.380> not<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.680> hundred

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
only the winter colors I'm not a hundred

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.129 
only the winter colors I'm not a hundred
percent<00:04:32.010> sure<00:04:32.310> but<00:04:33.240> keep<00:04:33.480> an<00:04:33.630> eye<00:04:33.780> on<00:04:33.810> the

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
percent sure but keep an eye on the

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.530
