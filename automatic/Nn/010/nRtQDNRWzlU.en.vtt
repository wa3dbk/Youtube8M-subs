00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
go back to the other way I've got a

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.690 
go back to the other way I've got a
piece<00:01:18.430> of<00:01:18.549> string<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.799> a<00:01:22.140> plastic<00:01:23.140> bag<00:01:23.700> now

piece of string on a plastic bag now
this<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:25.030> where<00:01:25.210> you'll<00:01:25.330> have<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.509> experiment

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
this is where you'll have to experiment

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.429 
this is where you'll have to experiment
you<00:01:27.970> may<00:01:28.119> have<00:01:28.329> to<00:01:28.450> keep<00:01:28.570> cutting<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.990> plastic

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
you may have to keep cutting the plastic

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.160 
you may have to keep cutting the plastic
bag<00:01:29.680> until<00:01:30.130> it's<00:01:30.310> just<00:01:31.210> lightweight<00:01:31.509> enough

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
bag until it's just lightweight enough

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.680 
bag until it's just lightweight enough
to<00:01:33.070> pull<00:01:33.250> itself<00:01:33.549> through<00:01:33.909> here<00:01:35.490> but

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.390 

here's<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:43.650> of<00:01:44.650> course<00:01:44.830> you'll<00:01:45.040> need<00:01:45.220> plenty

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
here's the of course you'll need plenty

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.910 
here's the of course you'll need plenty
of<00:01:45.610> strength<00:01:46.170> what<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.290> do<00:01:47.410> is<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.620> run<00:01:47.800> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
of strength what you do is you run the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.470 
of strength what you do is you run the
lightweight<00:01:48.340> string<00:01:48.760> through<00:01:49.030> there<00:01:49.180> first

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
lightweight string through there first

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.180 
lightweight string through there first
and<00:01:49.840> then<00:01:50.400> you<00:01:51.400> tie<00:01:51.640> on<00:01:51.820> your<00:01:51.910> mule<00:01:52.300> tape<00:01:52.630> or<00:01:53.190> or

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
and then you tie on your mule tape or or

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.670 
and then you tie on your mule tape or or
something<00:01:55.120> a<00:01:55.210> little<00:01:55.450> stronger<00:01:55.720> because<00:01:56.290> all

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
something a little stronger because all

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.080 
something a little stronger because all
this<00:01:56.860> as<00:01:57.040> far<00:01:57.280> as<00:01:57.400> just<00:01:59.580> just<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.700> get<00:02:00.850> through

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
this as far as just just to get through

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.830 
this as far as just just to get through
the<00:02:01.330> pipe<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:01.900> then<00:02:01.990> after<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.560> then<00:02:02.950> you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the pipe and then after that then you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.330 
the pipe and then after that then you
you<00:02:04.840> put<00:02:05.080> something<00:02:05.260> a<00:02:05.470> lot<00:02:05.620> stronger<00:02:05.890> through

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
you put something a lot stronger through

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.590 
you put something a lot stronger through
there<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:07.300> pull<00:02:07.510> it<00:02:07.570> whatever<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:08.020> need<00:02:09.600> but

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
there to pull it whatever you need but

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.300 
there to pull it whatever you need but
this<00:02:10.810> works<00:02:11.050> pretty<00:02:11.290> pretty<00:02:11.770> easy<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.160> don't

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
this works pretty pretty easy you don't

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.210 
this works pretty pretty easy you don't
have<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.490> put<00:02:12.610> no<00:02:13.470> grease<00:02:14.470> or<00:02:14.680> anything<00:02:14.709> on<00:02:15.190> it

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
have to put no grease or anything on it

have to put no grease or anything on it
just<00:02:15.940> make<00:02:16.090> sure<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.360> plastic<00:02:16.570> blackback<00:02:17.290> not

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
just make sure the plastic blackback not

got<00:03:36.280> away<00:03:36.400> from<00:03:36.490> you<00:03:36.819> last<00:03:37.000> time

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.120 

well<00:03:43.230> did<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:43.890> again<00:03:45.710> we'll<00:03:46.710> go<00:03:46.800> check<00:03:46.830> the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
well did it again we'll go check the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.370 
well did it again we'll go check the
vacuum

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
vacuum

00:03:49.380 --> 00:04:01.870 
vacuum
you

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:17.750 

there<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:11.720> there's<00:04:12.720> our<00:04:12.870> plastic<00:04:13.380> bag<00:04:14.180> so

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.280 

I<00:04:17.790> mean<00:04:18.420> if<00:04:18.480> they<00:04:18.570> can<00:04:18.720> sucks<00:04:18.930> up<00:04:19.110> through

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
I mean if they can sucks up through

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.770 
I mean if they can sucks up through
there<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.770> know<00:04:19.920> it'll<00:04:20.420> take<00:04:21.420> just<00:04:21.450> about

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
there you know it'll take just about

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.250 
there you know it'll take just about
anything<00:04:22.820> but<00:04:23.820> if<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.420> doesn't<00:04:24.570> first<00:04:24.840> succeed

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
anything but if it doesn't first succeed

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.760 
anything but if it doesn't first succeed
just<00:04:25.560> keep<00:04:25.890> kept<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.370> plastic<00:04:26.820> down<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:31.650> the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
just keep kept the plastic down to the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.740 
just keep kept the plastic down to the
smallest<00:04:32.070> side<00:04:32.400> that's<00:04:32.850> where<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.420> vacuum

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
smallest side that's where the vacuum

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.520 
smallest side that's where the vacuum
will<00:04:33.870> grab<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:35.610> then<00:04:35.970> you've<00:04:36.500> got<00:04:37.500> it

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
will grab it and then you've got it

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.520 
will grab it and then you've got it
under<00:04:37.770> control

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
under control

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.060 
under control
and<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:41.130> will<00:04:41.310> work<00:04:41.430> with<00:04:41.810> metal<00:04:42.810> conduit<00:04:43.260> of

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
and this will work with metal conduit of

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.770 
and this will work with metal conduit of
course<00:04:44.310> if<00:04:44.490> you're<00:04:44.640> going<00:04:44.820> up<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.180> box<00:04:45.480> you

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
course if you're going up to a box you

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.010 
course if you're going up to a box you
know<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:45.990> have<00:04:46.230> to<00:04:46.410> start<00:04:47.280> at<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:47.490> box<00:04:48.020> it

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
know you have to start at the box it

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.910 
know you have to start at the box it
won't<00:04:49.290> jump<00:04:49.530> through<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.920> box<00:04:51.320> but<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.740> also

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
won't jump through the box but and also

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.520 
won't jump through the box but and also
plus<00:04:53.700> you'd<00:04:53.850> have<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.120> have<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.330> lot<00:04:55.320> more

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
plus you'd have to have a lot more

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.260 
plus you'd have to have a lot more
suction<00:04:55.770> power<00:04:56.190> on<00:04:56.490> conduit<00:04:56.910> because<00:04:57.150> there's

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
suction power on conduit because there's

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.630 
suction power on conduit because there's
going<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.450> be<00:04:57.510> so<00:04:57.690> many<00:04:57.780> leaks<00:04:58.110> in<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:58.640> but

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
going to be so many leaks in it but

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.460 
going to be so many leaks in it but
it'll<00:04:59.790> still<00:05:00.030> work<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:02.910> may<00:05:03.060> have<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.470> do

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
it'll still work and you may have to do

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.430 
it'll still work and you may have to do
it<00:05:04.590> like<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:05.570> catching<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.660> fish<00:05:06.840> because<00:05:07.320> you

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
it like a catching a fish because you

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.220 
it like a catching a fish because you
know<00:05:07.530> conduits<00:05:07.920> got<00:05:08.130> a<00:05:08.160> lot<00:05:08.340> of<00:05:09.020> whicker's<00:05:10.020> and

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
know conduits got a lot of whicker's and

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.470 
know conduits got a lot of whicker's and
burrs<00:05:10.380> in<00:05:10.590> there<00:05:10.950> plastic<00:05:11.640> will<00:05:11.970> get<00:05:12.240> caught

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
burrs in there plastic will get caught

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.750 
burrs in there plastic will get caught
on<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.840> but<00:05:13.020> if<00:05:13.140> you<00:05:13.310> will<00:05:14.310> get<00:05:14.400> it<00:05:14.490> around

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
on it but if you will get it around

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.720 
on it but if you will get it around
enough<00:05:15.030> you'll<00:05:15.270> get<00:05:15.420> it<00:05:15.510> through<00:05:15.690> there<00:05:16.730> all

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
enough you'll get it through there all

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.080 
enough you'll get it through there all
right<00:05:17.940> well<00:05:18.270> good<00:05:18.390> luck<00:05:18.570> on<00:05:18.720> this<00:05:18.960> project
