he's kind of natural he's got wood and

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.430 
he's kind of natural he's got wood and
and<00:01:12.100> leaves<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:12.940> stuff<00:01:13.119> on<00:01:13.300> him<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:14.320> know

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
and leaves and stuff on him so you know

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.200 
and leaves and stuff on him so you know
it<00:01:15.190> was<00:01:15.430> hard<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.640> fit<00:01:15.790> him<00:01:15.910> in<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.000> lot<00:01:16.180> of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
it was hard to fit him in a lot of

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.609 
it was hard to fit him in a lot of
places<00:01:16.420> obviously<00:01:16.630> if<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.110> creature<00:01:17.290> like<00:01:17.470> this

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
places obviously if a creature like this

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.469 
places obviously if a creature like this
was<00:01:17.890> in<00:01:17.979> a<00:01:18.040> lava<00:01:18.220> level<00:01:18.610> it<00:01:18.729> wouldn't<00:01:18.970> make<00:01:19.090> a

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
was in a lava level it wouldn't make a

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.880 
was in a lava level it wouldn't make a
whole<00:01:19.810> lot<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:20.020> sense<00:01:20.229> because<00:01:20.440> you'd<00:01:20.680> be<00:01:20.770> like

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
whole lot of sense because you'd be like

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.999 
whole lot of sense because you'd be like
how<00:01:21.009> does<00:01:21.130> even<00:01:21.340> survive<00:01:21.640> here<00:01:21.910> so

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
how does even survive here so

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.440 
how does even survive here so
fortunately<00:01:24.009> we<00:01:24.100> found<00:01:24.130> a<00:01:24.520> spot<00:01:24.789> form<00:01:25.090> and

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
fortunately we found a spot form and

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.440 
fortunately we found a spot form and
then<00:01:25.600> decided<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.080> make<00:01:26.200> them<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.410> full-fledged

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
wait from to ram against the wall and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.359 
wait from to ram against the wall and
then<00:01:49.899> you'll<00:01:50.020> see<00:01:50.200> one<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.679> eggs<00:01:51.099> dropped

then you'll see one of the eggs dropped

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.180 
then you'll see one of the eggs dropped
from<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.610> ceiling<00:01:51.849> when<00:01:52.119> that<00:01:52.270> happens<00:01:53.190> you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
from the ceiling when that happens you

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.010 
from the ceiling when that happens you
can<00:01:54.369> shoot<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.580> egg<00:01:54.789> towards<00:01:55.179> them<00:01:55.300> we<00:01:55.869> shall

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
can shoot the egg towards them we shall

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.150 
can shoot the egg towards them we shall
knock<00:01:56.170> them<00:01:56.289> on<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.470> side<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:56.800> then<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:56.979> can

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
knock them on the side and then you can

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:14.270 
knock them on the side and then you can
attack<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:57.819> sweet<00:01:58.240> soft<00:01:58.630> underbelly

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.070 

and<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.060> suppose<00:02:15.209> it's<00:02:15.390> also<00:02:15.510> worth<00:02:15.690> noting<00:02:15.900> I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and I suppose it's also worth noting I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.510 
and I suppose it's also worth noting I
mean<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.290> only<00:02:16.410> see<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.890> health<00:02:17.190> bar<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
mean you only see that health bar at the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.430 
mean you only see that health bar at the
bottom<00:02:17.580> during<00:02:18.030> boss<00:02:18.330> fights<00:02:18.630> just<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.260> you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
bottom during boss fights just so you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.510 
bottom during boss fights just so you
always<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> sense<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.160> where<00:02:20.310> you're<00:02:20.430> at

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
always have a sense of where you're at

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.360 
always have a sense of where you're at
it's<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:20.819> like<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.180> were<00:02:21.270> fighting<00:02:21.450> a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
it's not like if you were fighting a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.770 
it's not like if you were fighting a
skeleton<00:02:23.370> you'd<00:02:23.520> see<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.970> health<00:02:24.270> bar<00:02:24.420> for<00:02:24.660> him

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
skeleton you'd see a health bar for him

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.850 
skeleton you'd see a health bar for him
or<00:02:24.870> anything<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.170> just<00:02:25.260> felt<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.590> needed<00:02:25.650> to

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
or anything we just felt we needed to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.140 
or anything we just felt we needed to
have<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.160> for<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.430> boss<00:02:26.610> fights<00:02:26.910> because

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
have that for the boss fights because

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.000 
have that for the boss fights because
you<00:02:28.110> know<00:02:28.230> we<00:02:28.410> definitely<00:02:28.709> want<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.860> have<00:02:28.980> a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
you know we definitely want to have a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.160 
you know we definitely want to have a
sense<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.569> where<00:02:30.569> you're<00:02:30.720> at<00:02:30.750> how<00:02:30.989> you're

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
sense of where you're at how you're

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.510 
sense of where you're at how you're
doing<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:31.590> you're<00:02:31.620> doing<00:02:31.950> any<00:02:32.069> damage<00:02:32.220> at<00:02:32.459> all

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
doing if you're doing any damage at all

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.250 
doing if you're doing any damage at all
because<00:02:32.760> some<00:02:32.970> guys<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.840> know<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.140> could

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
because some guys you know you could

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.350
