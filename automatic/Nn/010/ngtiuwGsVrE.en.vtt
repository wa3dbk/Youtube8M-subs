bits but only three sizes 6 8 and 10 so

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.849 
bits but only three sizes 6 8 and 10 so
i<00:01:21.560> don't<00:01:21.770> know<00:01:21.829> if<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:21.950> other<00:01:23.560> style<00:01:24.560> is<00:01:24.770> an

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
i don't know if that other style is an

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.279 
i don't know if that other style is an
option<00:01:25.359> but<00:01:26.359> this<00:01:26.569> is<00:01:26.689> all<00:01:26.840> they<00:01:26.960> had<00:01:27.079> here<00:01:27.259> in

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
option but this is all they had here in

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.819 
option but this is all they had here in
a<00:01:27.409> way<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.909> it's<00:01:29.299> also<00:01:29.479> magnetic<00:01:29.899> so<00:01:30.560> once<00:01:30.740> you

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
a way so it's also magnetic so once you

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.529 
a way so it's also magnetic so once you
put<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.100> in<00:01:31.189> there<00:01:31.399> it's<00:01:32.060> going<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.299> stay<00:01:32.509> in

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
put it in there it's going to stay in

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.899 
put it in there it's going to stay in
there<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:34.700> handle<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.770> case<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.249> acts

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
there and the handle the case and acts

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.020 
there and the handle the case and acts
as<00:01:38.119> an<00:01:38.329> enhancement<00:01:38.869> for<00:01:39.679> the<00:01:39.799> handle<00:01:40.929> but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
as an enhancement for the handle but

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.359 
as an enhancement for the handle but
i've<00:01:44.030> used<00:01:44.329> it<00:01:44.539> just<00:01:45.130> like<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:48.159> so<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.249> know

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
i've used it just like this so you know

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.149 
i've used it just like this so you know
it's<00:01:49.520> going<00:01:49.639> to<00:01:49.700> work<00:01:49.939> on<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:51.679> bench<00:01:51.889> made

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159
