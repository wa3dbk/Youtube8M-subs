00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.590
 and hello everyone we meet for this 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.800
 fifth episode of how to create your 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.970
 pvp mode then in 4th goal which some 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.769
 dallas and all that was how 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.170
 two blocks creating spawn and 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.720
 today we will go back to the map 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.329
 she herself and we go and we go we go 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.100
 how to say we're going to deal with potions 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.600
 personalized so we have already seen some 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.280
 little stuff with pop are so by 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 example how to create a stoner I am 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.870
 switched to version 1.6 it works 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.700
 always as well that one he walks 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.039
 still as well as the npc so 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.360
 and here we will create potions 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.309
 custom that you can after 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.140
 to be in spoilers like this one 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.129
 where me that just the utility that I 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.920
 will have it is for example boyer 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:05.280
 so wait see I want to do 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.650
 so that the players when the haye 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.460
 a potion to recover them to use 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.460
 who will give them strength and 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.090
 very important assets but if it is 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.460
 fly or if ever ben they 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.570
 use too early where they have no time 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.610
 to use it because the person who 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.850
 was holding her dying and ben that will make them 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.240
 a lot of benefits so I think 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.869
 that we're going to be the blades here and we 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.759
 will see later 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.290
 how to make it appear at the moment 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.540
 wanted but I think here it's already 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.650
 well then all and you everywhere 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.560
 only what we have to do is to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.759
 put a chest like that we will talk 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.780
 on the other side for now we're going 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.060
 we want this weekend thala 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.670
 ccc that side then that I do not know 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.810
 why there is this here it is so in 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.970
 done in this chest we will take 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.070
 any potion you can 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.090
 find here so for example we go 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.799
 we will do the test with two positions 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.840
 different me take a potion of 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.250
 next is it so it's speed 1 I 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.689
 I was wrong in the episode I believe 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.740
 that it's episode 3 I've been looking for 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.509
 speed pressures and I found them 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.560
 not in fact it's just the potions 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.780
 of +9 never corrected 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.390
 in annotations in the video and we're going 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.560
 take a potion instead of Origen all 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.120
 beast we'll put them in the trunk 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.090
 we will put them in the trunk and we will 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.440
 pass on lci said to apply the wire 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.489
 so just put your body 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.989
 you put the potions you want 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.970
 inside and you go on mc is 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.870
 said to apply the filter one gets 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.989
 found in a few moments 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.459
 immediately and so here we are again 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.120
 mc is said 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.040
 then we'll just load the part 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.830
 so we see that we are con con 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.860
 our chest that we placed here in 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.970
 the angle is simply there is not a 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.560
 cabinet image so it's an image 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.980
 classic stone but we can see that 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.200
 it's a test that contains an item 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.730
 only holds in it must be in 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.410
 mourning 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.709
 so he's the most military the most 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.480
 present cd water bottle 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.430
 so we double click on it we do 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.920
 filter and there we will look in the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.690
 list of filters a next changes 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.310
 so the filter changes it is it 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.440
 which is not basic mc have said there must 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.330
 add thanks to the 7.7 bling filter 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.550
 then you go to link 2 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.610
 the download link of the filters 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.610
 you are looking for your app and potions you 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.490
 look for modifies potions and you 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.050
 simply install it 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.010
 and once they install and hop on 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.180
 will just click on effect and there 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.430
 we will see all the different effects 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.240
 that we can apply to our position 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.530
 so for example we want a 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.740
 position that allows us to have 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.510
 a lot of strength for a given time 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.590
 so we'll make sure that the potion 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.890
 gives string so force of so rank 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.180
 maximum his 127 is not going to put his 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.440
 what are we going to do I have not done too much 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.520
 of references for now we're going 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.580
 maybe make a strange the 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.020
 strange saint calais and over a period of 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.820
 over a period of 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.000
 maybe a minute be the sweat of the 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.770
 mend sixty seconds one filters and its 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.180
 buttocks and then apply one can 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.150
 add other effects for example we 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.520
 we will regenerate 5 60 seconds 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.050
 also and that's it applied to more 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.680
 what to do it was a bad thing more for 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:22.350
 save or simply mc says 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.760
 back here so I said we 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.230
 leave and we find ourselves on minecraft 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.980
 check or sme was actually 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.380
 foolishly 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.330
 so that cut off hit and once we 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.740
 is back in our party we click 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.050
 on our chest and we see that our 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.920
 position has become a position of 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.480
 force that gives us thong by peloting 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.130
 6 4 so you have to know that actually when 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.230
 we apply gallows i5 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.180
 it takes into account the zero value so 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.420
 in fact it puts us potton 6 4 but these 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.360
 five so and regeneration potion potton 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.100
 6 4 also on a minute and for the 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.280
 splash motion is exactly the same 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.730
 so we'll take the situation going to get 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.330
 put in game mode hours game mode 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.650
 zero and we will apply the potion is this 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.570
 maybe we're going maybe 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.670
 week after pig there to see the 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.430
 power she can have that it's 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.980
 this tree at the ap hm was happening then 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:19.100
 so we apply there we see that we have 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.940
 regeneration is full at the whey 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.670
 so here we kill him a lot more 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.360
 quickly by hand and we have both 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.700
 effects during low 46 40 seconds 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.800
 we will see a little the power of the 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.190
 region of 5 then we will go into game 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:40.400
 mode we will go up high enough 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:44.250
 she still does not have too much 0 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.200
 and wild is ultra fast and that 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.300
 works very very well so that's it 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.960
 it was a little tutorial to show you 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.080
 up 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.380
 how to create custom potions 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.419
 so now if you want them 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.610
 infinitely reuses them into 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.740
 different objects you just have to 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.990
 do middle mouse click and 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.420
 as you are in creative mode it's going 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.330
 you multiply 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.520
 the item to infinity so me for example 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.100
 up I take one the others we can 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.180
 throw them out and we will apply exactly 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.430
 the same chest 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.140
 the opposite for the other team and that's it 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.290
 it will be pretty much everything for this little 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.520
 so I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.900
 well, that's not all for the whole thing 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.320
 tutorial for cissé that's all for this 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.290
 episode there episode 5 in the next 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.340
 time we will see many more things 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.320
 how to create modes 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.460
 custom armor and 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.800
 customize the disenchantment and 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.030
 it's now me I tell you to the 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.480
 next you have everyone 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.480
 bye
