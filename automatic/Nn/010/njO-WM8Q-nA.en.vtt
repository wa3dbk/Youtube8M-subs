emails a day about it so it's totally

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.819 
emails a day about it so it's totally
something<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.840> handle<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.320> I'm<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.649> on

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
something I can handle and I'm just on

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.910 
something I can handle and I'm just on
top<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.480> good<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.899> done<00:00:37.140> more

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
top of and it's it's good it's done more

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.680 
top of and it's it's good it's done more
or<00:00:37.950> less<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.910> means<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.210> really<00:00:39.480> time

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
or less and that means it's really time

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.979 
or less and that means it's really time
to<00:00:40.020> reflect<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:42.030> one<00:00:42.180> right<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.719> what

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
to reflect on what one right and what

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.720 
to reflect on what one right and what
could<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.290> gone<00:00:43.410> better<00:00:43.440> which<00:00:44.370> kind<00:00:44.640> of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
could have gone better which kind of

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.389 
could have gone better which kind of
sounds<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.059> post<00:00:45.360> mortem<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.739> think<00:00:47.129> maybe

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
sounds like post mortem so I think maybe

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.010 
sounds like post mortem so I think maybe
I<00:00:47.489> should<00:00:47.700> write<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.850> post<00:00:48.149> mortem<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.899> would

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
I should write a post mortem that would

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.139 
I should write a post mortem that would
be<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> good<00:00:49.320> idea<00:00:49.399> at<00:00:50.399> least<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.789> would<00:00:50.910> like

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
be a good idea at least that would like

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.299 
be a good idea at least that would like
really<00:00:51.809> finalize<00:00:52.320> things<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> can

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
really finalize things and then I can

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.000 
really finalize things and then I can
just<00:00:53.340> move<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.170> still<00:00:55.649> feel<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
just move on because I do still feel a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.700 
just move on because I do still feel a
little<00:00:56.219> bit<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.969> I'm<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.020> bit<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.350> limbo

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.220 
little bit like I'm in a bit of a limbo

mega episode was what I thought of the

ps4<00:01:25.470> announcement<00:01:26.100> which<00:01:26.369> was<00:01:26.549> actually<00:01:26.939> like

right<00:01:31.259> yeah<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.970> never<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.570> talked

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
right yeah so I never really talked

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.510 
right yeah so I never really talked
about<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.470> at<00:01:34.619> least<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.860> don't<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.340> did

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
about that at least I don't think I did

so I wrote down some notes about what i
thought<00:01:37.770> just<00:01:37.799> off<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> bat<00:01:38.520> first<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.570> all

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
thought just off the bat first of all

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.230 
thought just off the bat first of all
the<00:01:40.020> architecture<00:01:40.770> sounds<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:41.909> good

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the architecture sounds really good

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.840 
the architecture sounds really good
because<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.049> sounds<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.799> crazy<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.610> sounds

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
because it sounds not crazy it sounds

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.600 
because it sounds not crazy it sounds
like<00:01:45.090> add<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:46.159> reasonably<00:01:47.159> beefy

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
like add just reasonably beefy

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.789 
like add just reasonably beefy
off-the-shelf<00:01:48.299> computer<00:01:48.990> which<00:01:49.560> is

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
off-the-shelf computer which is

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.830 
off-the-shelf computer which is
excellent<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.460> developers<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.659> hopefully

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
excellent for developers so hopefully

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.630 
excellent for developers so hopefully
that<00:01:52.079> will<00:01:52.170> bode<00:01:52.380> well<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.829> terms<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.220> ease<00:01:53.490> of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
that will bode well in terms of ease of

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.609 
that will bode well in terms of ease of
development<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> support<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:55.200> different

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
development and support for different

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.420 
development and support for different
libraries<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.130> things<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.369> that

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
libraries and things like that

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.550 
libraries and things like that
definitely<00:01:57.299> sounds<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:58.020> step<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
definitely sounds like a step in the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.929 
definitely sounds like a step in the
right<00:01:58.710> direction<00:01:58.770> rather<00:01:59.369> than<00:01:59.640> trying

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
right direction rather than trying

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.300 
right direction rather than trying
something<00:02:00.229> completely<00:02:01.229> new<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.469> crazy<00:02:01.860> that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
something completely new and crazy that

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.639 
something completely new and crazy that
takes<00:02:02.790> developers<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.659> years<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.409> get<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
takes developers like years to get the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.440 
takes developers like years to get the
hang<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.219> think<00:02:05.670> they<00:02:05.759> said<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.090> had<00:02:06.119> a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
hang of I think they said they had a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.260 
hang of I think they said they had a
dedicated<00:02:07.200> hardware<00:02:08.039> chip<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.910> manage

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
dedicated hardware chip to manage

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.869 
dedicated hardware chip to manage
background<00:02:09.840> downloads<00:02:10.349> which<00:02:10.860> sounds<00:02:11.640> kind

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
background downloads which sounds kind

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.500 
background downloads which sounds kind
of<00:02:11.940> crazy<00:02:12.360> but

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
of crazy but

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.970 
of crazy but
so<00:02:13.840> if<00:02:14.019> that's<00:02:14.260> what<00:02:14.409> they're<00:02:14.530> doing<00:02:14.799> that's

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
so if that's what they're doing that's

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.110 
so if that's what they're doing that's
what<00:02:15.129> they're<00:02:15.280> doing<00:02:15.549> I<00:02:15.700> wouldn't<00:02:16.060> be

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
what they're doing I wouldn't be

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.729 
what they're doing I wouldn't be
surprised<00:02:16.390> if<00:02:16.540> that's<00:02:16.780> something<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.319> kind

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
surprised if that's something that kind

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.819 
surprised if that's something that kind
of<00:02:17.829> gets<00:02:18.069> cut<00:02:18.459> in<00:02:18.670> future<00:02:19.209> for<00:02:19.239> costs<00:02:19.900> actually

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
of gets cut in future for costs actually

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.440 
of gets cut in future for costs actually
maybe<00:02:21.189> not<00:02:21.310> that's<00:02:21.700> kind<00:02:21.879> of<00:02:21.909> a<00:02:22.030> weird<00:02:22.060> thing

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
maybe not that's kind of a weird thing

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.149 
maybe not that's kind of a weird thing
to<00:02:22.510> end<00:02:22.720> up<00:02:22.840> cutting<00:02:23.049> later<00:02:23.409> I<00:02:23.709> was<00:02:24.010> more

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
to end up cutting later I was more

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.830 
to end up cutting later I was more
thinking<00:02:24.310> how<00:02:24.519> they<00:02:24.610> had<00:02:24.760> hardware<00:02:25.299> backwards

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
thinking how they had hardware backwards

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.259 
thinking how they had hardware backwards
compatibility<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.370> ps3<00:02:27.640> when<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.090> first

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
compatibility for the ps3 when it first

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.759 
compatibility for the ps3 when it first
came<00:02:28.390> out<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.659> I<00:02:28.720> ended<00:02:29.079> up<00:02:29.170> scrapping<00:02:29.439> that

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
came out and I ended up scrapping that

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.000 
came out and I ended up scrapping that
but<00:02:30.489> yeah<00:02:31.000> hardware<00:02:31.500> background<00:02:32.500> downloading

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
but yeah hardware background downloading

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.190 
but yeah hardware background downloading
that's<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.909> strange<00:02:34.269> approach<00:02:34.659> now<00:02:35.140> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
that's just a strange approach now the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.869 
that's just a strange approach now the
social<00:02:35.650> focus<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.220> they<00:02:36.340> seem<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.579> be<00:02:36.670> taking

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
social focus that they seem to be taking

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.850 
social focus that they seem to be taking
with<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.209> maybe<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:37.780> was<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:37.930> during<00:02:38.590> their

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
with it maybe that was just during their

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.619 
with it maybe that was just during their
like<00:02:39.250> press<00:02:39.609> event<00:02:39.940> they<00:02:40.090> really<00:02:40.359> wanted<00:02:40.540> to

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
like press event they really wanted to

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.720 
like press event they really wanted to
emphasize<00:02:41.049> that<00:02:41.260> it's<00:02:41.620> not<00:02:42.220> really<00:02:42.579> something

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
emphasize that it's not really something

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.289 
emphasize that it's not really something
I<00:02:43.030> care<00:02:43.480> too<00:02:44.049> much<00:02:44.079> about<00:02:44.640> however<00:02:45.640> when<00:02:46.180> they

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
I care too much about however when they

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.550 
I care too much about however when they
were<00:02:46.390> talking<00:02:46.510> about<00:02:46.750> all<00:02:47.079> the<00:02:47.230> various

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
were talking about all the various

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.500 
were talking about all the various
streaming<00:02:48.430> support<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:48.940> they<00:02:49.060> had<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.480> that

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
streaming support that they had and that

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.379 
streaming support that they had and that
basically<00:02:50.349> be<00:02:50.859> able<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.159> stream<00:02:51.940> your<00:02:51.970> games

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
basically be able to stream your games

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.319 
basically be able to stream your games
live<00:02:52.840> from<00:02:53.409> the<00:02:53.590> console<00:02:54.010> i'm<00:02:54.760> thinking<00:02:55.000> more

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
live from the console i'm thinking more

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.940 
live from the console i'm thinking more
like<00:02:55.389> broadcasting<00:02:56.290> for<00:02:56.409> other<00:02:56.530> people<00:02:56.859> to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
like broadcasting for other people to

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.770 
like broadcasting for other people to
watch<00:02:57.129> i<00:02:57.430> thought<00:02:57.849> that<00:02:57.940> was<00:02:58.000> really<00:02:58.209> cool<00:02:58.329> i

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
watch i thought that was really cool i

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.690 
watch i thought that was really cool i
think<00:02:59.079> really<00:02:59.260> shows<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.709> stuff<00:03:00.069> like<00:03:00.280> let's

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
think really shows that stuff like let's

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.490 
think really shows that stuff like let's
playing<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.389> speedrunning<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.349> just

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
playing and speedrunning and just

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.160 
playing and speedrunning and just
watching<00:03:03.159> people<00:03:03.190> play<00:03:03.819> games<00:03:03.909> is<00:03:04.599> really

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
watching people play games is really

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.710 
watching people play games is really
sort<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.560> gaining<00:03:06.250> steam<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.909> that<00:03:07.480> that's

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
sort of gaining steam and that that's

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.960 
sort of gaining steam and that that's
cool<00:03:08.280> speaking<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.310> which<00:03:09.370> steam<00:03:09.730> should

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
cool speaking of which steam should

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.030 
cool speaking of which steam should
totally<00:03:10.299> implement<00:03:10.690> that<00:03:10.810> anyway<00:03:11.440> now<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
totally implement that anyway now the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.710 
totally implement that anyway now the
other<00:03:12.129> stuff<00:03:12.519> about<00:03:12.760> like<00:03:13.030> streaming<00:03:13.510> your

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
other stuff about like streaming your

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.259 
other stuff about like streaming your
game<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.349> your<00:03:14.440> Vita<00:03:14.769> I'm<00:03:15.579> just<00:03:15.879> sort<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.090> like

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
game to your Vita I'm just sort of like

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.939 
game to your Vita I'm just sort of like
mirroring<00:03:16.659> it<00:03:16.840> kind<00:03:17.079> of<00:03:17.139> the<00:03:17.260> way<00:03:17.349> the<00:03:17.530> wii<00:03:17.709> u

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
mirroring it kind of the way the wii u

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.009 
mirroring it kind of the way the wii u
does<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.669> sounds<00:03:19.239> kind<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:19.599> gimmicky

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
does that sounds kind of gimmicky

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.559 
does that sounds kind of gimmicky
largely<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.980> way<00:03:21.069> that<00:03:21.340> we<00:03:21.579> use<00:03:21.819> sounds<00:03:22.269> kind

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
largely the way that we use sounds kind

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.020 
largely the way that we use sounds kind
of<00:03:22.629> gimmicky<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:24.340> other<00:03:24.489> stuff<00:03:24.760> they<00:03:24.879> had

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
of gimmicky and the other stuff they had

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.319 
of gimmicky and the other stuff they had
about<00:03:25.329> like<00:03:25.750> playing<00:03:26.199> games<00:03:27.000> remotely<00:03:28.000> via

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
about like playing games remotely via

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.000 
about like playing games remotely via
streaming<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.989> having<00:03:29.199> your<00:03:29.290> friend<00:03:29.560> jump<00:03:29.829> in

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
streaming and having your friend jump in

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.270 
streaming and having your friend jump in
and<00:03:30.220> take<00:03:30.370> over<00:03:30.549> for<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.000> that's<00:03:31.780> down<00:03:32.530> kind

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
and take over for you that's down kind

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.099 
and take over for you that's down kind
of<00:03:33.340> weird<00:03:33.609> it<00:03:33.879> it<00:03:34.359> almost<00:03:34.540> sounds<00:03:34.870> like<00:03:34.900> they

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
of weird it it almost sounds like they

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.770 
of weird it it almost sounds like they
have<00:03:35.260> all<00:03:35.919> this<00:03:36.370> technology<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.569> they

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
have all this technology and they

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.360 
have all this technology and they
haven't<00:03:38.019> yet<00:03:38.139> figured<00:03:38.379> out<00:03:38.620> what<00:03:39.129> they're

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
haven't yet figured out what they're

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.470 
haven't yet figured out what they're
going<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.579> be<00:03:39.699> doing<00:03:39.790> with<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:40.359> they're

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
going to be doing with it so they're

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.240 
going to be doing with it so they're
just<00:03:40.690> throwing<00:03:40.840> out<00:03:41.079> ideas<00:03:41.139> about<00:03:41.769> what<00:03:42.099> could

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
just throwing out ideas about what could

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.369 
just throwing out ideas about what could
be<00:03:42.280> fun<00:03:42.579> which<00:03:43.269> is<00:03:43.419> good<00:03:43.569> it's<00:03:43.840> nice<00:03:44.109> that<00:03:44.139> they

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
be fun which is good it's nice that they

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.140 
be fun which is good it's nice that they
have<00:03:44.590> some<00:03:44.859> of<00:03:44.949> this<00:03:45.099> sort<00:03:46.030> of

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
have some of this sort of

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.140 
have some of this sort of
forward-thinking<00:03:47.699> technology<00:03:48.699> built<00:03:48.970> in

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
forward-thinking technology built in

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.780 
forward-thinking technology built in
there<00:03:49.440> sounded<00:03:50.440> pretty<00:03:50.739> promising<00:03:51.370> although

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
there sounded pretty promising although

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.180 
there sounded pretty promising although
a<00:03:52.060> lot<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.599> it<00:03:52.780> also<00:03:53.049> sounded<00:03:53.530> horribly

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
a lot of it also sounded horribly

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.339 
a lot of it also sounded horribly
gimmicky<00:03:54.669> and<00:03:54.699> I<00:03:55.180> can't<00:03:55.750> really<00:03:56.019> see<00:03:56.169> myself

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
gimmicky and I can't really see myself

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.710 
gimmicky and I can't really see myself
using<00:03:56.739> ever<00:03:57.159> specifically<00:03:58.090> some<00:03:58.449> of<00:03:58.569> their

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
online functionality seems a bit far off

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.349 
online functionality seems a bit far off
where<00:04:01.780> they<00:04:01.900> wanted<00:04:02.199> the<00:04:02.739> system<00:04:03.129> to

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
where they wanted the system to

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.670 
where they wanted the system to
gradually<00:04:04.359> get<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.569> sense<00:04:04.840> of<00:04:04.959> what<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.379> like

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
gradually get a sense of what you like

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.250 
gradually get a sense of what you like
and<00:04:06.069> then<00:04:06.400> start<00:04:06.879> downloading<00:04:07.419> stuff<00:04:07.780> for<00:04:08.079> you

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260

and then start downloading stuff for you
before<00:04:08.590> you<00:04:09.040> decide<00:04:09.669> that<00:04:09.699> you<00:04:10.000> want<00:04:10.269> that<00:04:10.540> new

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
bandwidth caps I would certainly be

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.479 
bandwidth caps I would certainly be
disabling<00:04:17.199> that<00:04:17.380> as<00:04:17.560> soon<00:04:17.709> as<00:04:17.859> possible<00:04:18.310> so

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
disabling that as soon as possible so

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.370 
disabling that as soon as possible so
it's<00:04:18.760> not<00:04:18.909> really<00:04:19.299> something<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:19.959> appeals

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
it's not really something that appeals

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.379 
it's not really something that appeals
to<00:04:20.440> me<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:20.919> sort<00:04:21.430> of<00:04:21.459> cool<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.210> guess

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
to me it sort of cool and I guess

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.360 
to me it sort of cool and I guess
forward-thinking<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:23.500> consider<00:04:24.010> that<00:04:24.219> you

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
forward-thinking to consider that you

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.100 
forward-thinking to consider that you
could<00:04:24.580> turn<00:04:25.000> on<00:04:25.180> your<00:04:25.330> console<00:04:25.690> or<00:04:25.900> just

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
could turn on your console or just

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
could turn on your console or just
resume<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:26.710> from

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
resume it from

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.790 
resume it from
sleep<00:04:27.370> state<00:04:27.640> which<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.000> also<00:04:28.540> cool<00:04:28.900> and<00:04:29.170> then

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
sleep state which is also cool and then

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.440 
sleep state which is also cool and then
find<00:04:30.160> out<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.610> you<00:04:30.940> know<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.270> latest

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
find out that you know the latest

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.810 
find out that you know the latest
uncharted<00:04:32.320> demo<00:04:32.650> has<00:04:32.920> already<00:04:33.220> made<00:04:33.460> its<00:04:33.670> way

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
uncharted demo has already made its way

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.390 
uncharted demo has already made its way
to<00:04:33.880> your<00:04:34.000> console<00:04:34.450> it's<00:04:35.230> kinda<00:04:35.980> neat<00:04:36.220> I

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
to your console it's kinda neat I

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.250 
to your console it's kinda neat I
suppose<00:04:36.820> I<00:04:37.120> think<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.660> more<00:04:37.810> interesting

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
suppose I think the more interesting

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.140 
suppose I think the more interesting
thing<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:38.620> they're<00:04:38.860> proposing<00:04:39.250> that<00:04:39.490> all

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
thing is that they're proposing that all

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.450 
thing is that they're proposing that all
of<00:04:40.480> their<00:04:40.690> like<00:04:41.260> digital<00:04:41.680> content<00:04:42.130> would<00:04:42.250> be

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
of their like digital content would be

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.450 
of their like digital content would be
delivered<00:04:43.000> in<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.630> way<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:44.080> could<00:04:44.230> be<00:04:44.460> played

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
delivered in a way that could be played

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.920 
delivered in a way that could be played
as<00:04:45.700> soon<00:04:45.910> as<00:04:46.030> possible<00:04:46.450> so<00:04:46.540> you<00:04:46.600> don't<00:04:46.750> have<00:04:46.810> to

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
as soon as possible so you don't have to

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.260 
as soon as possible so you don't have to
download<00:04:47.170> like<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.680> 20<00:04:48.070> gig<00:04:48.310> game<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:49.090> start

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
download like a 20 gig game to start

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.790 
download like a 20 gig game to start
playing<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.720> first<00:04:49.900> half<00:04:50.200> hour<00:04:50.380> but<00:04:50.710> you

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
playing the first half hour but you

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.040 
playing the first half hour but you
could<00:04:51.010> download<00:04:51.520> maybe<00:04:51.970> 200<00:04:52.540> megs<00:04:52.750> which

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
could download maybe 200 megs which

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.080 
could download maybe 200 megs which
would<00:04:53.230> just<00:04:53.440> get<00:04:53.530> you<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:54.190> executable<00:04:54.850> and

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
would just get you the executable and

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.850 
would just get you the executable and
then<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.420> assets<00:04:55.930> required<00:04:56.350> for<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.680> first

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
then the assets required for the first

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.560 
then the assets required for the first
portion<00:04:57.100> of<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.370> game<00:04:57.520> and<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:58.120> rest<00:04:58.300> just

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
portion of the game and the rest just

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.660 
portion of the game and the rest just
sort<00:04:58.750> of<00:04:58.810> stream<00:04:59.140> in<00:04:59.350> it's<00:04:59.980> a<00:05:00.100> technology<00:05:00.400> that

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
sort of stream in it's a technology that

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.720 
sort of stream in it's a technology that
they<00:05:01.330> actually<00:05:01.630> used<00:05:01.810> a<00:05:02.140> bit<00:05:02.410> a<00:05:02.440> TA<00:05:02.950> for<00:05:03.190> stuff

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
they actually used a bit a TA for stuff

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.300 
they actually used a bit a TA for stuff
like<00:05:03.990> tiger<00:05:04.990> woods<00:05:05.020> golf<00:05:05.290> online<00:05:05.920> you<00:05:06.160> would

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
like tiger woods golf online you would

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.160 
like tiger woods golf online you would
basically<00:05:06.820> just<00:05:07.210> download<00:05:07.660> a<00:05:07.690> tiny<00:05:07.990> little

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
basically just download a tiny little

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.600 
basically just download a tiny little
client<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:08.770> then<00:05:08.860> you'd<00:05:08.980> be<00:05:09.070> able<00:05:09.160> to<00:05:09.310> start

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
client and then you'd be able to start

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.860 
client and then you'd be able to start
playing<00:05:09.940> you<00:05:10.240> would<00:05:10.330> have<00:05:10.450> accessed

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
playing you would have accessed

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
playing you would have accessed
everything<00:05:11.290> but<00:05:11.470> you're<00:05:11.560> not<00:05:11.680> playing

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
everything but you're not playing

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.790 
everything but you're not playing
everything<00:05:12.310> off<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.550> bat<00:05:12.700> anyway<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:13.420> that

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
everything off the bat anyway and that

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.370 
everything off the bat anyway and that
seems<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:15.070> lot<00:05:15.220> more<00:05:15.250> promising<00:05:16.230> especially<00:05:17.230> if

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
seems a lot more promising especially if

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.530 
seems a lot more promising especially if
you<00:05:17.530> could<00:05:17.740> start<00:05:18.460> playing<00:05:18.730> a<00:05:18.880> game<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:19.210> then

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
you could start playing a game and then

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.510 
you could start playing a game and then
decide<00:05:19.900> you<00:05:20.080> didn't<00:05:20.380> like<00:05:20.530> it<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:20.890> cancel<00:05:21.400> it

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
decide you didn't like it and cancel it

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.650 
decide you didn't like it and cancel it
before<00:05:21.670> you<00:05:21.850> head<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.060> download<00:05:22.420> the<00:05:22.510> whole

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
before you head to download the whole

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.050 
before you head to download the whole
thing<00:05:22.900> that'd<00:05:23.800> be<00:05:23.950> cool<00:05:24.100> anyway<00:05:24.730> those<00:05:25.030> are

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060

well nothing's really been announced so
in<00:05:39.280> my<00:05:39.760> opinion<00:05:39.940> it's<00:05:40.420> not<00:05:40.630> really<00:05:40.900> worth<00:05:41.230> like

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
in my opinion it's not really worth like

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.430 
in my opinion it's not really worth like
worrying<00:05:42.880> too<00:05:43.210> much<00:05:43.240> about<00:05:43.690> all<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.110> rumors

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440

that have been coming out there's a lot

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.150 
that have been coming out there's a lot
of<00:05:45.850> stuff<00:05:46.090> talked<00:05:46.600> about<00:05:46.960> for<00:05:47.440> always<00:05:47.950> online

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
of stuff talked about for always online

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.770 
of stuff talked about for always online
and<00:05:48.790> whether<00:05:49.000> or<00:05:49.120> not<00:05:49.210> that's<00:05:49.360> a<00:05:49.510> good<00:05:49.660> idea

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
and whether or not that's a good idea

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.560 
and whether or not that's a good idea
and<00:05:50.380> then<00:05:50.470> there<00:05:50.620> was<00:05:50.760> yeah<00:05:51.760> just<00:05:52.000> a<00:05:52.180> lot<00:05:52.480> of

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
and then there was yeah just a lot of

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.140 
and then there was yeah just a lot of
drama<00:05:52.840> around<00:05:53.050> that<00:05:53.560> and<00:05:53.830> really<00:05:54.460> it<00:05:55.090> just

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
drama around that and really it just

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.730 
drama around that and really it just
doesn't<00:05:55.690> make<00:05:55.780> sense<00:05:55.840> to<00:05:56.260> get<00:05:56.440> worked<00:05:56.620> up

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
doesn't make sense to get worked up

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.710 
doesn't make sense to get worked up
about<00:05:56.920> it<00:05:57.040> until<00:05:57.580> you<00:05:57.730> actually<00:05:57.970> know<00:05:58.360> whether

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
about it until you actually know whether

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.080 
about it until you actually know whether
or<00:05:58.870> not<00:05:58.960> it's<00:05:59.170> true<00:05:59.350> so<00:05:59.770> I'm<00:06:00.340> not<00:06:00.670> gonna<00:06:00.910> bother

an annoying I'm actually no it's not
kind<00:06:19.660> of<00:06:19.750> it<00:06:19.960> is<00:06:20.230> definitely<00:06:21.190> an<00:06:21.400> annoying

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
kind of it is definitely an annoying

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.450 
kind of it is definitely an annoying
restriction<00:06:22.930> but<00:06:23.710> it's<00:06:23.860> also<00:06:24.010> something<00:06:24.310> that

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
restriction but it's also something that

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.430 
restriction but it's also something that
clearly<00:06:24.880> we've<00:06:25.300> been<00:06:25.450> able<00:06:25.570> to<00:06:25.720> live<00:06:25.990> with<00:06:26.200> at

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
clearly we've been able to live with at

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.740 
clearly we've been able to live with at
least<00:06:26.590> to<00:06:26.830> some<00:06:26.980> degree<00:06:27.040> so<00:06:27.580> it<00:06:28.210> wouldn't<00:06:28.690> be

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
least to some degree so it wouldn't be

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.600 
least to some degree so it wouldn't be
the<00:06:29.110> end<00:06:29.140> of<00:06:29.350> the<00:06:29.470> world<00:06:29.680> even<00:06:30.100> if<00:06:30.310> that<00:06:30.490> were

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
the end of the world even if that were

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.960 
the end of the world even if that were
the<00:06:30.640> case<00:06:30.810> although<00:06:31.810> having<00:06:32.140> said<00:06:32.410> that<00:06:32.970> it

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
the case although having said that it

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.610 
the case although having said that it
actually<00:06:34.030> would<00:06:34.480> be<00:06:34.540> really<00:06:34.990> really<00:06:35.169> annoying

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
actually would be really really annoying

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.219 
actually would be really really annoying
anyway<00:06:36.280> this<00:06:36.850> is<00:06:37.090> worrying<00:06:37.600> about<00:06:37.750> something

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
anyway this is worrying about something

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.990 
anyway this is worrying about something
that<00:06:38.260> hasn't<00:06:39.130> been<00:06:39.370> conferred

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
that hasn't been conferred

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.900 
that hasn't been conferred
or<00:06:40.450> refuted<00:06:41.260> yet<00:06:41.440> so<00:06:41.830> worried<00:06:42.610> about<00:06:42.760> that

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
or refuted yet so worried about that

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.060 
or refuted yet so worried about that
later<00:06:43.360> okay<00:06:44.110> and<00:06:44.290> the<00:06:44.410> very<00:06:44.590> last<00:06:44.800> thing<00:06:44.920> I

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
later okay and the very last thing I
