00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.130 
like it so the only bad thing I can feel
about<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.459> week<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.119> it<00:02:04.330> doesn't<00:02:04.810> come

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
about this week is that it doesn't come

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.680 
about this week is that it doesn't come
with<00:02:05.170> any<00:02:05.500> clips<00:02:06.490> in<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.789> back<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:07.479> it's<00:02:07.630> like

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
with any clips in the back so it's like

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.080 
with any clips in the back so it's like
just<00:02:07.990> laying<00:02:08.319> there<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.640> doesn't<00:02:09.970> feel

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
just laying there and it doesn't feel

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.320 
just laying there and it doesn't feel
really<00:02:10.360> secure<00:02:10.539> in<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.110> bag<00:02:11.319> like

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.010 

other<00:02:15.330> than<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:16.310> love<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.540> you<00:02:18.540> can<00:02:18.720> diet

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.010 
other than that I love it you can diet
you<00:02:19.620> can<00:02:19.650> flat<00:02:20.100> iron<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.030> curl<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
you can flat iron it you can curl it you

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.449 
you can flat iron it you can curl it you
can<00:02:22.200> prime<00:02:22.470> what<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.740> can<00:02:22.890> do<00:02:22.980> whatever<00:02:23.160> you

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.650 
can prime what you can do whatever you
want<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.790> week<00:02:24.030> because<00:02:24.240> there<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.630> a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
is like i said one hundred and fifty

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.090 
is like i said one hundred and fifty
percent<00:02:54.330> density<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.170> originally<00:02:55.769> cost<00:02:55.950> a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
percent density it originally cost a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.340 
percent density it originally cost a
hundred<00:02:56.220> dollars<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.420> i<00:02:57.630> paid<00:02:57.959> one<00:02:58.110> hundred

and fifteen dollars for the edit

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.960 
and fifteen dollars for the edit
thickness<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.260> i<00:03:01.530> think<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:02.010> i<00:03:02.250> like<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.760> i

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
thickness and i think that i like it i

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.820 
thickness and i think that i like it i
actually<00:03:03.870> probably<00:03:04.140> would<00:03:04.380> want<00:03:04.500> more

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
actually probably would want more

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.340 
actually probably would want more
thickness<00:03:05.160> they<00:03:05.459> also<00:03:05.670> offer<00:03:06.060> 180<00:03:06.840> which<00:03:07.200> is

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
thickness they also offer 180 which is

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.150 
thickness they also offer 180 which is
like<00:03:07.530> really<00:03:08.250> full<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.800> next<00:03:10.800> time<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:10.980> might

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
like really full and next time I might

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.570 
like really full and next time I might
get<00:03:11.370> one<00:03:11.489> hundred<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:11.820> eighty-one<00:03:12.480> percent

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
get one hundred and eighty-one percent

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.790 
get one hundred and eighty-one percent
because<00:03:14.580> this<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.060> still<00:03:15.300> kind<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.690> thin<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.650> me
