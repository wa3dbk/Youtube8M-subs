00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.200
 now welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.869
 chocolate pepper or we can be 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.390
 making a super delicious recipe 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.090
 we can make a tabulate but not a 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.930
 conventional tabulate a quinoa taboule 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.620
 we will be using 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.620
 and not 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.270
 my healthy friend we are going to do 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.520
 substituting the wheat that what is used 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.129
 conventionally to do the tabboule 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.449
 but it is usually very heavy at least 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.220
 I eat tabulÃ© and I fall world knows is 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.989
 a salad indicated is heavy 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.360
 obviously but the pile of wheat that 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.510
 take then today we're going to do it 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.699
 super livianito using the tub and you're going to 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.699
 see that the flavor it gives is mega 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.129
 delicious I now particularly 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.560
 I prefer to do this vule with quinoa that 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.350
 with wheat or with couscous believe with what 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.610
 replace it so you'll see that it goes down 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.290
 love 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.600
 let's start cooking this 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.600
 delicious and healthy estabul is small 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.360
 to make this delicious taboo we're going 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.790
 to need 2 tomatoes half cucumber a 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.430
 small stalk of scallions a cup of 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.460
 parsley 1 quarter cup of peppermint 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.290
 a cup of cooked quinoa salt and pepper 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.170
 to taste a tablespoon of oil 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:44.080
 olive and the juice of half a lemon 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.080
 here to see how to sew quinoa 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.450
 we started to make our taboo 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.090
 chopping the tomatoes in squares 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.670
 I'm using some tomatoes that are 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.310
 Pretty flavor you can use tomatoes 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.680
 they fly cherry tomatoes the tomato that more 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.470
 you like it 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.420
 I'm going to chop it into cubes 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.220
 the conventional way of making tabbouleh 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.830
 but you can really explain them as 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.440
 you want 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.180
 typical in typical squares you give 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.090
 mind now I'm going to chop my herbs that 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.160
 are parsley and mint the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.880
 Peppermint is going to give you a super touch 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.460
 refreshing to our tabulate plus that 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.060
 Mega is healthy and parsley us 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.180
 brings a lot of vitamins so to 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.340
 eating parsley I love putting 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.410
 Pretty, but you're at ease if you 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.740
 you want to put less parsley to test 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.370
 do what I'm going to chop also my 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.040
 Chickens chives and now I'm going to chop 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.380
 my cucumbers to which I am 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.120
 removing the seed so that I do not get 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.120
 make lots of water in the salad 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.319
 to these also remove the skin because 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.120
 I feel heavy in my stomach if I 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.510
 you like you can leave them with all the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.470

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.109
 well big bowl I'm going to roll the lemon 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.190
 to get more juice and I'm going to 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.050
 squeeze on my salad 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.700
 I'm using yellow lemon but you 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.819

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.319

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.459
 pepper to taste and now I'm going to put 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:43.910

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:48.640
