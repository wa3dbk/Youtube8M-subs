00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
in it that it stops that little bit of

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.580 
in it that it stops that little bit of

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
twitchiness with the old model so mode

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.830 
twitchiness with the old model so mode
is<00:04:12.769> pretty<00:04:12.980> good<00:04:13.159> so<00:04:13.459> as<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.819> all<00:04:14.299> round<00:04:14.480> black

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
is pretty good so as a all round black

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.399
