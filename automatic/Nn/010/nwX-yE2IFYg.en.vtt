the<00:00:20.670> models<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.240> game<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.720> use<00:00:21.900> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the models in this game I use the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.529 
the models in this game I use the
special<00:00:22.320> UV<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.100> texturing<00:00:23.519> technique<00:00:23.730> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
special UV and texturing technique to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.560 
special UV and texturing technique to
get<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.930> vector<00:00:25.470> graphic<00:00:26.250> look<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.029> what

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
get this vector graphic look and what

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.689 
get this vector graphic look and what
that<00:00:27.750> means<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.320> graphics<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.310> never<00:00:29.550> get

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
that means is graphics that never get

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.840 
that means is graphics that never get
pixelated<00:00:30.359> no<00:00:30.510> matter<00:00:30.689> how<00:00:30.960> much<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.380> zoom<00:00:31.619> in

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
pixelated no matter how much it zoom in

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.790 
pixelated no matter how much it zoom in
like<00:00:32.850> graphics<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:34.020> comes<00:00:34.230> up<00:00:34.410> from<00:00:34.590> other

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
like graphics that comes up from other

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.180 
like graphics that comes up from other
the<00:00:35.040> illustrator<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.850> maybe<00:00:36.390> flash<00:00:37.190> for

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the illustrator and maybe flash for

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.250 
the illustrator and maybe flash for
example<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.879> plant<00:00:39.180> guy<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:40.110> can

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
example for this plant guy here you can

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.080 
example for this plant guy here you can
see<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.770> never<00:00:41.070> gets<00:00:41.250> pixelated<00:00:41.969> no

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
see that it never gets pixelated no

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.940 
see that it never gets pixelated no
matter<00:00:42.300> how<00:00:42.540> much<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.930> zoom<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:45.739> here<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
matter how much it zoom in and here the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.700 
matter how much it zoom in and here the
textures<00:00:47.520> are<00:00:47.730> used<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> models<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:49.530> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
textures are used for the models as you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.590 
textures are used for the models as you
can<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.039> simple<00:00:50.489> color<00:00:50.730> palette<00:00:51.210> style

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
can see simple color palette style

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.650 
can see simple color palette style
pictures<00:00:52.520> thanks<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> simplicity<00:00:54.180> I'm

pictures thanks to the simplicity I'm
able<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.199> compress<00:00:55.559> both<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.190> these<00:00:56.340> textures

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
able to compress both of these textures

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.310 
able to compress both of these textures
in<00:00:57.120> 32<00:00:57.660> by<00:00:57.840> 32<00:00:58.170> pixels<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.100> even<00:00:59.760> lower<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:01.140> get

in 32 by 32 pixels and even lower to get

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.869 
in 32 by 32 pixels and even lower to get
this<00:01:01.440> effect<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:02.190> simply<00:01:02.579> grabbing

this effect with simply grabbing

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.390 
this effect with simply grabbing
specific<00:01:03.570> polygons<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> model<00:01:04.739> taking

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
specific polygons on the model taking

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.850 
specific polygons on the model taking
the<00:01:05.640> UV<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.210> those<00:01:06.420> polygons<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.380> mapping

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the UV of those polygons and mapping

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.940 
the UV of those polygons and mapping
them<00:01:07.979> onto<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.430> color<00:01:08.640> palettes<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.950> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
them onto the color palettes I want the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.420 
them onto the color palettes I want the
polygons<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.970> colors<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:13.229> method<00:01:13.650> to

polygons are the colors this method to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
polygons are the colors this method to
do<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.880> mind<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.570> select<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.409> the

do this in mind here I select all the
polygons<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.280> want<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.640> put<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.030> color

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
polygons that I want to put in a color

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.230 
polygons that I want to put in a color
square<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.560> UV<00:01:19.920> editor<00:01:20.210> polygons<00:01:21.210> menu

square go to the UV editor polygons menu

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.200 
square go to the UV editor polygons menu
and<00:01:22.020> select<00:01:22.380> split<00:01:22.500> new<00:01:22.890> video<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.000> put

and select split new video and then put

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
and select split new video and then put
the<00:01:24.299> polygons<00:01:24.720> into<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.170> color<00:01:25.409> palettes<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the polygons into the color palettes you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.289 
the polygons into the color palettes you
want<00:01:27.590> but<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:28.770> thing<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> notice<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.850> this

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
want but one thing to notice is this

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.690 
want but one thing to notice is this
this<00:01:31.110> method<00:01:31.560> requires<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.310> mount<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
this method requires the mount of

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.899 
this method requires the mount of
certain<00:01:33.060> topology<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:35.220> shadow<00:01:35.490> part<00:01:35.790> of

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
certain topology like the shadow part of

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.039 
certain topology like the shadow part of
the<00:01:36.060> pot<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> models<00:01:39.780> in

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the pot here so for all the models in

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.690 
the pot here so for all the models in
this<00:01:40.170> project<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.829> had<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.040> think<00:01:41.189> about<00:01:41.310> this

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
this project I had to think about this

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.420 
this project I had to think about this
from<00:01:41.970> modeling<00:01:42.509> phase<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:43.439> adding<00:01:44.280> some

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
from modeling phase like adding some

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
from modeling phase like adding some
polygons<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.210> tweaking<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.810> topology<00:01:46.110> here

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
polygons and tweaking the topology here

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.980 
polygons and tweaking the topology here
and<00:01:46.680> there<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.159> get<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.520> shapes<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.000> want<00:01:48.210> for

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and there to get the shapes I want for

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.149 
and there to get the shapes I want for
optimizing<00:01:49.500> reasons

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
optimizing reasons

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.090 
optimizing reasons
polygons<00:01:50.939> are<00:01:51.329> actually<00:01:52.049> cheaper<00:01:52.619> than

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
polygons are actually cheaper than

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
polygons are actually cheaper than
textures<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.899> compress<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
textures so if I can compress the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.100 
textures so if I can compress the
texture<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:56.159> really<00:01:56.700> small<00:01:57.000> adding<00:01:57.719> few

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
texture really really small adding few

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.139 
texture really really small adding few
polygons<00:01:58.590> actually<00:01:59.189> doesn't<00:01:59.520> matter<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.939> much

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
polygons actually doesn't matter so much

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.240 
polygons actually doesn't matter so much
I<00:02:00.420> need<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.960> say<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.469> effect<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.040> also

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
I need to say that this effect can also

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.270 
I need to say that this effect can also
be<00:02:02.460> achieved<00:02:02.549> using<00:02:02.969> vertex<00:02:03.540> colors<00:02:04.040> but<00:02:05.040> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
be achieved using vertex colors but I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.069 
be achieved using vertex colors but I
personally<00:02:05.759> prefer<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.570> in<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.840> way

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
personally prefer to do it in this way

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.740 
personally prefer to do it in this way
because<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:08.190> easier<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.789> do<00:02:09.090> changes<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
because it's easier to do changes and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.940 
because it's easier to do changes and
fix<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.050> later

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
fix this later

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.680 
fix this later
but<00:02:11.950> one<00:02:12.130> reason<00:02:12.460> is<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:12.760> it's<00:02:13.150> easier<00:02:13.540> to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
but one reason is that it's easier to

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.720 
but one reason is that it's easier to
make<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.930> hybrid<00:02:14.440> between<00:02:14.740> normal<00:02:15.160> texturing

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
make a hybrid between normal texturing

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.330 
make a hybrid between normal texturing
techniques<00:02:16.260> one<00:02:17.260> example<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:17.920> truck

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
techniques one example is this truck

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.290 
techniques one example is this truck
here<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:20.500> logo<00:02:20.680> on<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:20.980> truck<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.610> simple

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
here the logo on this truck is a simple

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.720 
here the logo on this truck is a simple
plain<00:02:22.570> polygon<00:02:23.170> map<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.860> drawing<00:02:24.310> but

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
plain polygon map to the drawing but

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.370 
plain polygon map to the drawing but
everything<00:02:25.150> else<00:02:25.330> in<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.600> model<00:02:25.750> snapped<00:02:26.230> on

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
everything else in the model snapped on

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.230 
everything else in the model snapped on
the<00:02:26.410> color<00:02:26.680> palette<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.490> two<00:02:27.820> previous

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
the color palette like the two previous

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.440 
the color palette like the two previous
models<00:02:28.710> texture<00:02:29.710> look<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.100> this<00:02:30.330> thank<00:02:31.330> to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
models texture look like this thank to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.780 
models texture look like this thank to
this<00:02:31.570> color<00:02:31.930> palette<00:02:32.170> method<00:02:32.710> I<00:02:32.890> can<00:02:33.250> use<00:02:33.520> most

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
this color palette method I can use most

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.750 
this color palette method I can use most
of<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.000> textures<00:02:34.450> space<00:02:34.780> for<00:02:35.080> your<00:02:35.200> logo

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
of the textures space for your logo

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.710 
of the textures space for your logo
everything<00:02:36.760> else<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.270> model<00:02:37.600> is

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
everything else on the model is

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.610 
everything else on the model is
scrunched<00:02:38.230> into<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.710> side<00:02:38.920> space<00:02:39.340> here<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
scrunched into the side space here and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.980 
scrunched into the side space here and
that's<00:02:41.920> basically<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.640> hope<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.420> got<00:02:43.570> an<00:02:43.690> idea

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
that's basically I hope you got an idea

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.290 
that's basically I hope you got an idea
about<00:02:44.050> how<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.410> got<00:02:44.740> double<00:02:45.040> duty<00:02:45.640> by<00:02:45.760> Modest
