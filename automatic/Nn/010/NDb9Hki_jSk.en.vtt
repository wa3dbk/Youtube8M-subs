00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.340
 hello on this occasion we will talk about 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.070
 LED diodes and photo diodes will start 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.110
 with the question what is a diode these 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.970
 devices in a driver which 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.490
 let the current pass in one direction and 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.010
 opposes the other is formed by two 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.830
 crystals in conductors or packs one of 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.170
 type p and another of type n forming a 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.210
 union stick when the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.570
 positive potential to the terminal the 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.430
 crystal p and the negative to n is said to 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.250
 the union is polarized in the sense 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.500
 direct low its electrical resistance and 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.780
 the iodine leads if we invest the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.510
 polarity then it is said to be 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.629
 polarized in the opposite direction increases its 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.610
 electrical resistance and does not drive a 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.339
 of the many applications of diodes 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.100
 is the grinding allowing turning 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.049
 alternating current to direct 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.780
 the symbol that is usually used 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.970
 to denote a diode is like the one that 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.210
 shown in the picture 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:18.410
 now we will talk about the led diode and the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.540
 photo god diode led leds or diodes 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.910
 light emitters of the opto type 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.220
 electronic broadcast in different 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.110
 wavelengths or colors depending 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.110
 exclusively of the type of material 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.940
 semiconductor used its candles 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.370
 they come from the English like in mission god 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.200
 the symbol with which the 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.010
 led diode is like the one in the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.560
 image working on the diodes 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.900
 light emitters the supply of 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.390
 electrons of higher energy comes from 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.760
 direct polarization injecting 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.310
 electrons in the ny region and causing 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.470
 gaps in the region p the gaps and 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.990
 injected electrons combine with 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.430
 the majority carriers close to 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.220
 Union 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.730
 radiation by recombination is 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.760
 issued in all directions 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.490
 the effect called electroluminescence 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.710
 is given when stimulated by a 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.930
 direct voltage difference over their 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.690
 terminals electric charges 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.400
 negative and electric charges 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.350
 positive are attracted to the area of 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.630
 exhaustion where they combine with each other 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.500
 resulting in the release of 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.620
 photon energy here shows a 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.080
 table with most used materials for 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.120
 build the LEDs as well as your band 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.170

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.790
 They are also manufactured in different colors 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.730
 corresponding to the wavelength of 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.459
 the luminous radiation red green amber 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.040
 blue orange and infrared depending 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.960
 of the type of doping add to crystal 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.660
 semiconductor 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.030
 the led diode behave inverse like 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.520
 most grades not circulating 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.750
 the current appreciated in direct the 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.090
 threshold voltage but between 1.3 and 42 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.010
 depending on the redemption that the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.680
 minimum intensity so that a led of 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.420
 half visible light is 4000 jumpers and 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.180
 as a precaution as a maximum 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.700
 apply 50 while the typical value 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.510
 of intensity that is usually used is 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.239
 of 10 thousand euros 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.519
 here we are an accession table and 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.519
 ominous and the attention they name typical 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.140
 Some advantages of LEDs 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.739
 extremely high and low speeds 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.480
 cost 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.239
 Long life compared with lamps 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.730
 linearity in a wide range in 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.400
 output power depending on 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.110
 input intensity operation 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.409
 low voltage which makes them 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.870
 compatible with integrated circuits 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:54.740
 variety of colors some disadvantages 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.200
 of leds 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.300
 the recent output power and the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.670
 location of the wavelength center 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.560
 depend on the temperature easy 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.050
 destruction due to over voltage or over 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.960
 currents large optical bandwidth 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.300
 compared to links theoretically not 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.160
 get good performance except with 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.810
 special cooling or work 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.579
 intermittent 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.519
 law enforcement 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.099
 the use of thanks to their innumerable 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.740
 Advantages such as duration 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.349
 resistance saving easy installation and 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.650
 control allow us to get many and 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.840
 varied application applications more 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.729
 common of LEDs is to get a 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.949
 adequate lighting and ambience 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.069
 according to the figures that require it 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.469
 example interior lighting 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:45.379
 Exteriors your visibility and decoration 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:48.750
 environmental signage and lighting 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:50.759
 public as well as we talked a little bit about what 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.390
 which is an LED diode now we will talk 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.880
 about what is a photoshop 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.220
 tutorial the photos of a two are 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.990
 semiconductor devices that have 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.980
 the same electrical characteristics 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.350
 than those of conventional diodes 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.450
 when they are not subject to lighting 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.880
 this means that your resistance 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.980
 indirect driving is low and its 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.500
 resistance in reverse is high without 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.570
 But when these fingers light up 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.700
 with adequate frequency light the 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.249
 reverse iodine current increases with 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.649
 lighting intensity 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:27.009
 the symbol with which the 

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:29.569
 photodiode is like if you take a picture 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.159
 a joining photodiode consists 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.739
 basically in a union in lepe 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:38.149
 polarized in reverse direction field 

00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:41.299
 contrary to the union of 

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:44.029
 way that a diffusion zone is created 

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:46.930
 devoid of carriers whose width 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:49.630
 depends on the applied potential 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.850
 when no resolution arrives 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.190
 this region the electrons have the 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.020
 enough energy to pass through and 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.039
 therefore the current will be practically 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.470
 null when the light radiation is of 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.900
 adequate wavelength and affects the 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.090
 broadcast area are created for that 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.580
 hollow electron that are attracted to the 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.530
 applied electric field resulting a 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.199
 current immersed by the union in ep 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.080
 proportional to the energy absorbed and 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:19.180
 therefore to the luminous flux that they affect 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.870
 about union as we are in the 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.870
 next curve 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.330
 in photos and now you can use it as 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.910
 light detector device that 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.620
 turns light into electricity and is 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.330
 several has electricity is the one 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.640
 used to report that there was a change 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.280
 at the level of illumination on the 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.380
 button called and the photo will be left 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.830
 connected so that by the circle 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.080
 the current in the extension of the date 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:50.280
 polarized in direct sense the light that 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.110
 prevents him would have no effect on him and 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.560
 would behave like a me 2 in the 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:58.350
 normal driver uses the photo 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.410
 violated one of the applications that was 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.360
 can give a photodiode s the readers 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.890
 I decided to recover the information 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.230
 engraved in the groove of the cid and 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.690
 transforming the light of the class 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.910
 reflected in it without impulses 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.430
 electric appliances to be processed by the 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.190
 system that results in the 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:20.350
 Recorded data can also be used 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:23.170
 in the detectors of 1 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.120
 with this we finished the presentation what 

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.250
 which were some types of diode 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.230
 we hope it was of your total 

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.650
 information convention that they 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:35.040
 presented on led diode and photodiode 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.040
 thanks for your attention
