 conga loera and I'm here to give you the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.449
 best beauty tips of how 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.900
 prepare and groom your hair in 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.470
 only three steps step number 1 apply a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.140
 little bit of spray number 2 soften and 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.170
 polish the hairs that are little horses 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.460
 little ones or new hair number 3 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.430
 this is going to be the triangle section 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.980
 so they start doing the division and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.350
 equally or equally and not 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.680
 finish with a very wide braid of a 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.260
 side they end up obviously grabbing 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.079
 particular sections of the part of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.810
 down to braid up and have 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.910
 control never forget them 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.130
 first have a spray that has 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.500
 quite firm now what I'm 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.960
 doing is bringing a little more 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.630
 divisions or section of hair 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.090
 towards the middle part of the head I continue 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.620
 doing the braid trying to finish 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.450
 the lower part of the neck now and this 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.410
 goal is to try to get the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.360
 Extra hair under the hair 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.670
 which is on the left side to create 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 a kind of crown, I'm going to have to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 apply a league especially if this 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 sir has too much hair what 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.540
 let's do next is to try 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.119
 of hiding the league to try to 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.570
 Camouflage ar the color simply 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:48.000
 uses the hair is natural and in clock 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:55.130

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.130
 little steps has a quick simple hairstyle 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.610
