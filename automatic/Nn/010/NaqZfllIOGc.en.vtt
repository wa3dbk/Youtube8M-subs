00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
morning this is Tom 950 276 and I'm

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.850 
morning this is Tom 950 276 and I'm
going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.620> be<00:00:04.770> charging<00:00:05.390> two<00:00:08.150> batteries<00:00:09.860> they

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
going to be charging two batteries they

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.039 
going to be charging two batteries they
are<00:00:11.099> 12<00:00:11.910> volt<00:00:12.179> 5.5<00:00:13.170> amp<00:00:13.500> hours<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.719> 20<00:00:15.719> hours

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
are 12 volt 5.5 amp hours and 20 hours

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.529 
are 12 volt 5.5 amp hours and 20 hours
is<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.350> it's<00:00:16.619> stating<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:18.150> way<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.300> have

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
is what it's stating and the way I have

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.230 
is what it's stating and the way I have
them<00:00:18.660> connected<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.350> they<00:00:19.650> are<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:20.240> parallel

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
them connected is they are in parallel

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.929 
them connected is they are in parallel
which<00:00:21.600> means<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.350> black<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.550> black<00:00:23.730> are

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
which means the black and the black are

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.630 
which means the black and the black are
connected<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:25.769> positive<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.460> is

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
connected and the positive which is

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.210 
connected and the positive which is
positive<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.500> positive<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:29.070> is

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
positive here and the positive which is

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.910 
positive here and the positive which is
red<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.580> red<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.750> I'm<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> take<00:00:31.769> my

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
red and red so I'm going to take my

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.990 
red and red so I'm going to take my
terminal<00:00:32.340> connect<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:34.670> what<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:35.969> see

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
terminal connect it and what you can see

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.250 
terminal connect it and what you can see
is<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:39.890> now<00:00:40.890> these<00:00:41.100> batteries<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.579> together

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
is that now these batteries are together

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
is that now these batteries are together
and<00:00:45.649> got<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.800> across<00:00:47.390> positive

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
and got it going across positive

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.799 
and got it going across positive
positive<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:50.100> comment<00:00:50.910> comment<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.480> negative

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
positive and comment comment or negative

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.529 
positive and comment comment or negative
tuning<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.170> I'll<00:00:52.559> take<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.890> terminals<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.300> I'm

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
tuning it I'll take my terminals and I'm

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.760 
tuning it I'll take my terminals and I'm
only<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> connect<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.469> side<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
only going to connect on one side of

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.560 
only going to connect on one side of
this<00:00:57.920> positive<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.910> there's<00:01:00.570> negative<00:01:00.840> so

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
this positive and there's negative so

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.600 
this positive and there's negative so
think<00:01:03.570> you'll<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> idea<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:05.280> don't<00:01:05.460> want

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
think you'll get the idea you don't want

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.609 
think you'll get the idea you don't want
to<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.299> across<00:01:06.540> you're<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> good

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
to have it going across you're a good

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.469 
to have it going across you're a good
way<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.799> remember<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:08.850> say<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
way to remember it is you could say I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.140 
way to remember it is you could say I
learned<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> three<00:01:11.010> stooges<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.640> are

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
learned this on the three stooges is are

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.480 
learned this on the three stooges is are
you<00:01:12.390> positive<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.530> positive<00:01:14.070> which

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
you positive that it's positive which

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.450 
you positive that it's positive which
means<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> positive<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
means you have a positive here and a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.039 
means you have a positive here and a
positive<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.540> know<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.900> those

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
positive there so you know that those

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.820 
positive there so you know that those
are<00:01:19.290> correct<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> charge<00:01:21.750> controller<00:01:22.259> turn

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
are correct so I charge controller turn

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
are correct so I charge controller turn
it<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:24.680> see<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.830> reading<00:01:26.159> 12.8<00:01:27.150> which<00:01:28.080> means

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it on see it's reading 12.8 which means

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.039 
it on see it's reading 12.8 which means
it's<00:01:28.590> charging<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.130> batteries<00:01:29.869> since<00:01:30.869> it's

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it's charging these batteries since it's

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.160 
it's charging these batteries since it's
sunny<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.640> it<00:01:32.640> would<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.540> jumping<00:01:34.049> all

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
sunny here it would be like jumping all

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.390 
sunny here it would be like jumping all
over<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.439> place<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> yep<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.560> at<00:01:37.680> 13<00:01:38.159> now

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
over the place so yep it's up at 13 now

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.980 
over the place so yep it's up at 13 now
which<00:01:38.790> means<00:01:38.939> these<00:01:39.180> batteries<00:01:39.570> are<00:01:39.630> pretty

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
which means these batteries are pretty

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.670 
which means these batteries are pretty
low<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.710> applying<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.960> correct<00:01:43.259> current

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
low so it's applying the correct current

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
low so it's applying the correct current
if<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:45.500> like<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.619> said<00:01:46.829> if<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.430> wasn't<00:01:47.460> connected

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
if I like I said if it wasn't connected

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.120 
if I like I said if it wasn't connected
and<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.420> jumping<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:48.899> around<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.530> 14

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and be jumping all around it's like 14

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.789 
and be jumping all around it's like 14
and<00:01:51.170> goes<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> way<00:01:52.500> down<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:53.070> 12<00:01:53.399> so

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
and goes all the way down to like 12 so

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.380 
and goes all the way down to like 12 so
hope<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.009> helps<00:01:56.310> anyone<00:01:56.490> who's<00:01:57.090> trying<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
hope this helps anyone who's trying to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.630 
hope this helps anyone who's trying to
connect<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.960> some<00:01:58.200> batteries<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.430> thing

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
connect up some batteries the one thing

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.749 
connect up some batteries the one thing
I<00:01:59.930> think<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.079> should<00:02:01.259> know<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.610> want

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
I think you should know is that you want

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.830 
I think you should know is that you want
to<00:02:02.820> make<00:02:02.909> sure<00:02:02.939> they're<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.270> same<00:02:03.299> rated

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
to make sure they're the same rated

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.230 
to make sure they're the same rated
batteries<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.799> don't<00:02:04.979> want<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.369> like

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
batteries you don't want to have like

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.109 
batteries you don't want to have like
this<00:02:06.540> one<00:02:06.719> being<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.140> 5.5<00:02:07.890> amp<00:02:08.429> hours<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.030> this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
this one being a 5.5 amp hours and this

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.890 
this one being a 5.5 amp hours and this
one<00:02:09.330> being<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.709> 3.5<00:02:10.709> amp<00:02:10.979> hours<00:02:11.340> because<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:12.569> I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
one being a 3.5 amp hours because it I

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
one being a 3.5 amp hours because it I
believe<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.500> take<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
believe is going to take the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.460 
believe is going to take the
lowest<00:02:14.099> one<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.480> doesn't<00:02:15.840> make<00:02:15.959> any<00:02:16.170> sense

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
lowest one so it doesn't make any sense

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.860 
lowest one so it doesn't make any sense
you<00:02:16.830> want<00:02:17.040> them<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.310> have<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.610> same<00:02:17.849> rating<00:02:18.150> so

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
you want them to have the same rating so
