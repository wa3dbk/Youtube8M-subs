00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 in uk and so good about when he told me 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.879
 that special skill has the 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.770
 potential to become great 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.740
 fighter but you have to use all yours 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.820
 senses and I more senses than I pray it 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.830
 I mean my spider sense 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.900
 one of these days I will find one more 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.230
 original but for now it remains so okay well 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.670
 you have an extra sense now to use it to the fullest 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.320
 which then you can exactly mean 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.360
 see your opponents before he sees 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 matter so you can decide which to attack 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.559
 first and I need this skill 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.559
 now of what 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.420
 one of my informants and the danger 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.220
 something big is going to happen e 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.280
 not a way to divide the sniper who 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.449
 I could use the meaning of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.710
 spider to find the sniper is already 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.239
 exactly I bet that there will be 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.160
 more than one I tell you where it is 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.690
 the informant and from there he can start the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.320
 research 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.320
 ok i'm ready 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.210
 here is the place of spider sense 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.210
 do your duty 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.750
 here is the informant where the bad guys are 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
 here they are 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.950
 all ok i owe you friend life not 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.950
 thank me but cage 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.160
 Yup 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.110
 seen 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.400
 this 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.599
 you have been to the spider man job 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.840
 the task of us heroes is really helpful 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.700
 just because you don't use the spider sense 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.799
 to identify other hooligans for the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.629
 roads take them out before they cause 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.629
 other damages but of course
