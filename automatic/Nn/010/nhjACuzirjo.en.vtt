I<00:00:00.179> just<00:00:00.930> saw<00:00:01.079> a<00:00:01.110> really<00:00:01.260> cool<00:00:01.380> tutorial<00:00:02.010> from

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
I just saw a really cool tutorial from

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.280 
I just saw a really cool tutorial from
Joe<00:00:02.520> Deegan<00:00:02.879> on<00:00:03.090> this<00:00:03.419> zoom<00:00:03.720> effect<00:00:04.080> that<00:00:04.230> he

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
Joe Deegan on this zoom effect that he

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.320 
Joe Deegan on this zoom effect that he
uses<00:00:04.650> in<00:00:04.890> PowerPoint<00:00:05.609> for<00:00:05.970> e-learning

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
uses in PowerPoint for e-learning

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.230 
uses in PowerPoint for e-learning
courses<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.290> if<00:00:08.160> we<00:00:08.250> play<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.460> real<00:00:08.639> quick<00:00:08.820> see

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
courses and if we play it real quick see

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.070 
courses and if we play it real quick see
his<00:00:10.110> effect<00:00:10.530> what<00:00:11.099> he<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.490> using<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.849> zoom

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
his effect what he is is using the zoom

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.270 
his effect what he is is using the zoom
animation<00:00:13.080> effect<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.530> then<00:00:13.620> zooming<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.099> on

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
animation effect and then zooming in on

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.730 
animation effect and then zooming in on
a<00:00:14.340> monitor<00:00:14.910> as<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> transition<00:00:16.049> technique<00:00:16.440> to

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
a monitor as a transition technique to

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.550 
a monitor as a transition technique to
his<00:00:17.190> next<00:00:17.760> slide<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.779> Joe<00:00:19.109> threw<00:00:19.289> out<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> little

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
his next slide so Joe threw out a little

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.349 
his next slide so Joe threw out a little
challenge<00:00:20.010> at<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> end<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.939> see<00:00:21.150> if

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
challenge at the end of that to see if

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
challenge at the end of that to see if
there<00:00:21.900> wasn't<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> better<00:00:22.380> way<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.590> maybe

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
there wasn't a better way to maybe

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.769 
there wasn't a better way to maybe
control<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> focal<00:00:23.789> point<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.420> example

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
control the focal point so for example

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.630 
control the focal point so for example
if<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.930> were<00:00:25.050> focusing<00:00:25.590> more<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
if you were focusing more on the the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.400 
if you were focusing more on the the
scissors<00:00:27.090> over<00:00:27.390> here<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> speakers<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
scissors over here are the speakers and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.049 
scissors over here are the speakers and
I<00:00:28.830> think<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.929> using<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.199> motion<00:00:31.949> path<00:00:32.369> so

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
I think you can using the motion path so

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.150 
I think you can using the motion path so
here's<00:00:33.300> my<00:00:33.750> take<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.440> real<00:00:34.680> quick<00:00:34.890> we<00:00:35.010> just

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
here's my take on it real quick we just

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.940 
here's my take on it real quick we just
hit<00:00:35.309> play<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> I'm<00:00:36.989> using<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> grow<00:00:37.649> shrink

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
hit play so I'm using the grow shrink

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.920 
hit play so I'm using the grow shrink
but<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.940> also<00:00:39.120> combined<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:39.899> a

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
but then I also combined it with a

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530 
but then I also combined it with a
motion<00:00:40.379> path<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:41.040> kind<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.910> move<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.360> image

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
motion path that kind of move this image

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.170 
motion path that kind of move this image
off<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.440> slide<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.460> we're<00:00:44.700> actually<00:00:44.850> able<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
off the slide so we're actually able to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.310 
off the slide so we're actually able to
zoom<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.629> over<00:00:45.930> here

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
zoom in over here

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.750 
zoom in over here
you<00:00:46.680> can<00:00:46.829> see<00:00:46.950> maybe<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.190> series<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.520> buttons

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
you can see maybe a series of buttons

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.340 
you can see maybe a series of buttons
that<00:00:48.059> would<00:00:48.210> link<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> different<00:00:48.660> parts<00:00:49.140> based

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that would link to different parts based

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.350 
that would link to different parts based
on<00:00:49.530> where<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> slide<00:00:50.370> branches<00:00:50.879> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
on where that with the slide branches so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.670 
on where that with the slide branches so
let<00:00:51.449> me<00:00:51.510> show<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.719> how<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.930> set<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:52.590> I'm

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
let me show you how I set it up now I'm

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.910 
let me show you how I set it up now I'm
working<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.160> PowerPoint<00:00:53.579> 2010<00:00:54.559> but<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
working in PowerPoint 2010 but the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.799 
working in PowerPoint 2010 but the
effects<00:00:56.399> are<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> process<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
effects are in the process is really the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:58.760 
effects are in the process is really the
same<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.559> different

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
same it's just a little different

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430 
same it's just a little different
interface<00:00:59.309> so<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:00.600> my<00:01:00.719> final<00:01:01.050> version

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
interface so there's my final version

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.439 
interface so there's my final version
but<00:01:01.469> let's<00:01:02.460> go<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:02.789> build<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.239> real

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
but let's go and just build it out real

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
but let's go and just build it out real
quick<00:01:03.619> starting<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> image<00:01:05.489> I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
quick starting with just this image I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.270 
quick starting with just this image I
want<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> bring<00:01:05.939> open<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.360> animation<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.280> on

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
want to bring open my animation and on

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.560 
want to bring open my animation and on
the<00:01:08.369> animation<00:01:08.760> tab<00:01:09.150> I'm<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> select

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the animation tab I'm going to select

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.570 
the animation tab I'm going to select
grow<00:01:10.080> shrink<00:01:12.530> grow<00:01:13.530> shrink<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:14.100> an<00:01:14.340> emphasis

click and just choose effect options and
make<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.549> around<00:01:21.229> maybe<00:01:22.229> 300<00:01:22.950> or<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.220> okay

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
make that around maybe 300 or so okay

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
make that around maybe 300 or so okay
just<00:01:24.630> enough<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:29.119> bring<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> lot<00:01:30.570> larger

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
just enough to bring that a lot larger

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.090 
just enough to bring that a lot larger
you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.470> zooms<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.799> pretty<00:01:32.040> well

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
you can see it zooms in pretty well

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.190 
you can see it zooms in pretty well
right<00:01:32.400> there<00:01:32.610> okay<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> next<00:01:33.869> thing<00:01:34.079> I'll

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
right there okay now the next thing I'll

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.499 
right there okay now the next thing I'll
do<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.439> combine<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:36.030> grow<00:01:36.329> shrink

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
do is just combine this grow shrink

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.660 
do is just combine this grow shrink
animation<00:01:37.110> with<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> motion<00:01:37.950> path<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.579> I'll

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
animation with a motion path so I'll

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850 
animation with a motion path so I'll
select<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.090> object<00:01:39.570> now<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.500> animation

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
select the object now for the animation

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.170 
select the object now for the animation
to<00:01:41.130> add<00:01:41.250> an<00:01:41.460> animations<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> little<00:01:42.090> bit

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
to add an animations a little bit

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.210 
to add an animations a little bit
different<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.689> here's<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.710> button<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.189> I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
different here here's the button for I

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.609 
different here here's the button for I
think<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.960> 2007<00:01:45.960> there's<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.170> button<00:01:46.409> over<00:01:46.500> here

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
think in 2007 there's a button over here

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950 
think in 2007 there's a button over here
that<00:01:46.740> says<00:01:46.829> add<00:01:47.159> effect<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.659> time<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.869> want

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
that says add effect so this time I want

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.370 
that says add effect so this time I want
to<00:01:49.170> add<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.590> motion<00:01:49.890> path<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:54.020> I'm<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.200> going

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to add a motion path now I'm just going

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.800 
to add a motion path now I'm just going
to<00:01:55.409> use<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> straight<00:01:55.950> line<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.540> I'm<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to use a straight line and I'm going to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.030 
to use a straight line and I'm going to
right<00:01:58.020> click<00:01:58.049> I'm<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> choose<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.890> go

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
right click I'm going to choose it to go

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.530 
right click I'm going to choose it to go
somewhat<00:01:59.490> off<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> left<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
somewhat off to the left and this is the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.700 
somewhat off to the left and this is the
part<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.960> had<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.259> actually<00:02:01.320> spend<00:02:01.680> a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
part that I had to actually spend a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.200 
part that I had to actually spend a
little<00:02:01.770> time<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:03.979> little<00:02:04.979> time<00:02:05.219> playing<00:02:06.030> with

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
little time a little time playing with

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.520 
little time a little time playing with
so<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.659> go<00:02:06.869> straight<00:02:06.930> down<00:02:07.200> by

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so it's going to go straight down by

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.930 
so it's going to go straight down by
default<00:02:07.979> first<00:02:08.129> thing<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> want<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.759> just

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
default first thing I want to do is just

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.130 
default first thing I want to do is just
right<00:02:09.119> click<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.390> choose<00:02:09.660> start<00:02:09.989> with

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
right click and choose start with

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.900 
right click and choose start with
previous<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:10.860> these<00:02:10.979> two<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.310> together<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.730> if

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
previous so these two go together so if

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.850 
previous so these two go together so if
I<00:02:11.940> click<00:02:12.150> play

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
I click play

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.970 
I click play
the<00:02:14.220> motion<00:02:15.000> path<00:02:15.180> goes<00:02:15.420> down<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.800> want

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the motion path goes down so what I want

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.610 
the motion path goes down so what I want
to<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.490> I'm<00:02:17.640> actually<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.180> case

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
to do is I'm actually in this case

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.680 
to do is I'm actually in this case

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
telling PowerPoint to move this image

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.720 
telling PowerPoint to move this image
off<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.230> stage<00:02:22.500> as<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.830> gets<00:02:22.950> bigger<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.490> want

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
off the stage as it gets bigger I want

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.580 
off the stage as it gets bigger I want
this<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.150> come<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.840> actually<00:02:25.290> we<00:02:25.410> want

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
this to be come in so actually we want

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.380 
this to be come in so actually we want
to<00:02:25.680> zoom<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.190> left<00:02:26.460> of<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.940> motion<00:02:27.210> path

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
to zoom to the left of the motion path

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.480 
to zoom to the left of the motion path
to<00:02:27.630> bring<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:27.930> into<00:02:28.170> more<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.800> center<00:02:29.340> of

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
to bring this into more of the center of

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.300 
to bring this into more of the center of
the<00:02:29.610> slide<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.320> let<00:02:31.410> me<00:02:31.470> just<00:02:31.590> try<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.010> now

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.450 

okay

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
okay

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.190 
okay
couple<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.090> things<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.300> on<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.050> is

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
couple of things going on and this is

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.740 
couple of things going on and this is
something<00:02:37.410> also<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.770> just<00:02:38.010> noticed<00:02:38.340> by<00:02:39.240> default

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
something also I just noticed by default

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.230 
something also I just noticed by default
and<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.200> true<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.620> 2007<00:02:41.340> PowerPoint<00:02:42.180> is

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
and this is true in 2007 PowerPoint is

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.550 
and this is true in 2007 PowerPoint is
going<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> put<00:02:42.600> some<00:02:42.810> sort<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.020> an<00:02:43.140> easing

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
going to put some sort of an easing

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.150 
going to put some sort of an easing
effect<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.040> me<00:02:44.130> right<00:02:44.340> click<00:02:44.490> this<00:02:44.700> real<00:02:44.910> quick

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
effect so me right click this real quick

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.370 
effect so me right click this real quick
there<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.490> smooth<00:02:48.210> start<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.750> an<00:02:48.870> end<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.260> a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
there is a smooth start and an end and a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.440 
there is a smooth start and an end and a
smooth<00:02:49.680> end<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.700> little<00:02:50.790> end<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.270> what's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
smooth end that little end is what's

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.660 
smooth end that little end is what's
causing<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:52.110> little<00:02:52.410> jiggle<00:02:52.800> at<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.190> end<00:02:53.370> so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
causing this little jiggle at the end so

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.590 
causing this little jiggle at the end so
let's<00:02:53.700> try<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.000> one<00:02:54.090> more<00:02:54.240> time<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.570> just

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
let's try it one more time and just

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.300 
let's try it one more time and just
watch<00:02:54.720> for<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.230> image<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.980> move<00:02:56.070> back<00:02:56.280> and

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
watch for this image to move back and

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.430 
watch for this image to move back and
forth<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.450> kind<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.690> does<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> soft<00:02:58.230> little

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
forth so it kind of does a soft little

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.770 
forth so it kind of does a soft little
easing<00:02:59.370> effect<00:02:59.700> if<00:02:59.850> you<00:02:59.910> don't<00:03:00.120> want<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.510> or

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
easing effect if you don't want that or

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.850 
easing effect if you don't want that or
you<00:03:00.870> feel<00:03:00.990> like<00:03:01.050> that's<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.380> little<00:03:01.500> bit<00:03:01.680> too

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
you feel like that's a little bit too

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.670 
you feel like that's a little bit too
much<00:03:02.330> you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.630> drop<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.959> down<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.230> zero

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
much you can just drop that down to zero

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.760 
much you can just drop that down to zero
and<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:06.390> start<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.810> okay<00:03:07.110> actually<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:07.590> just

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
and the start is okay actually it's just

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.240 
and the start is okay actually it's just
the<00:03:07.890> end<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:08.400> I'll<00:03:08.490> turn<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.820> off<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.980> let's

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
the end so I'll turn that off and let's

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.690 
the end so I'll turn that off and let's
try<00:03:11.370> playing<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.760> one<00:03:11.850> more<00:03:12.000> time<00:03:13.100> okay<00:03:14.100> looks

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
try playing it one more time okay looks

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.160 
try playing it one more time okay looks
good<00:03:14.910> just<00:03:15.390> probably<00:03:15.600> want<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.840> bring<00:03:16.020> this

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
good just probably want to bring this

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.199 
good just probably want to bring this
over<00:03:16.320> just<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:16.860> little<00:03:16.890> bit<00:03:17.250> more<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.730> that's

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
over just a little bit more and that's

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.430 
over just a little bit more and that's
the<00:03:18.360> part<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.750> want<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.019> keep<00:03:19.140> playing

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
the part that you want to keep playing

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.500 
the part that you want to keep playing
with<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.010> see<00:03:20.190> how<00:03:20.340> far<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:21.209> actually<00:03:21.480> I

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
with is to see how far so actually I

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.610 
with is to see how far so actually I
want<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.660> turn<00:03:21.810> off<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.110> start<00:03:22.410> because<00:03:22.590> I

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
want to turn off this start because I

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
want to turn off this start because I
don't<00:03:22.769> like<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:22.950> way<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.130> starts<00:03:23.430> kind<00:03:23.550> of

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
don't like the way this starts kind of

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.340 
don't like the way this starts kind of
looping<00:03:24.000> outward<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.600> then<00:03:24.720> coming<00:03:24.989> back<00:03:25.019> in

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
looping outward and then coming back in

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.900 
looping outward and then coming back in
and<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.100> again<00:03:26.519> more<00:03:26.760> my

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
and this is just again more my

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.040 
and this is just again more my
preference<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.420> want<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.750> be<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> little

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
preference I want it to be a little

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.780 
preference I want it to be a little
straighter<00:03:28.320> path<00:03:28.820> play<00:03:29.820> these<00:03:29.940> together<00:03:30.150> and

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
straighter path play these together and

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.070 
straighter path play these together and
there's<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.880> quick<00:03:33.030> effect<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:33.540> combining<00:03:33.870> it

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
there's a quick effect so combining it

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.530 
there's a quick effect so combining it
with<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.380> grow<00:03:34.800> effect<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.940> motion<00:03:36.300> path

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
with the grow effect and the motion path

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.330 
with the grow effect and the motion path
motion<00:03:36.989> paths<00:03:37.170> going<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.500> go<00:03:37.620> off<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:38.040> center

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
motion paths going to go off the center

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.310 
motion paths going to go off the center
according<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.330> course<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.660> how<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.900> depend<00:03:40.260> on

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
according the course of how it depend on

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.570 
according the course of how it depend on
where<00:03:40.590> your<00:03:40.739> image<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.280> where<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.459> want

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
where your image is and where you want

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.460 
where your image is and where you want
to<00:03:41.610> focus<00:03:41.760> you'll<00:03:42.120> adjust<00:03:42.540> your<00:03:42.989> motion<00:03:43.290> path

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
to focus you'll adjust your motion path

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.930 
to focus you'll adjust your motion path
you<00:03:43.680> no<00:03:43.800> longer<00:03:44.340> or<00:03:44.670> shorter<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:47.130> don't

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
you no longer or shorter and I don't

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.340 
you no longer or shorter and I don't
know<00:03:48.030> that's<00:03:48.239> my<00:03:48.360> try<00:03:48.570> at<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.930> hopefully

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
know that's my try at it hopefully

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.390 
know that's my try at it hopefully
someone<00:03:49.800> else<00:03:49.980> will<00:03:50.130> have<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.310> another<00:03:51.060> idea
