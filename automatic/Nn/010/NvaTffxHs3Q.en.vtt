00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.889
 Welcome to Claire Vorm here 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.670
 I, I have to touch the kettle 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.670
 a kettle with touch look at it 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.330
 times that she still really was beautiful and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.150
 cool off a touch with what they do 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.740
 you can adjust the temperature 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 know the touch of eg mobile phone or 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:35.670
 tablet and here you can download the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:38.250
 Set temperature from 40 to 100 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.430
 grad 40 degrees they think among other things 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.129
 to baby food for example 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.760
 bottle milk or 70 degrees for one 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.370
 green tea or just 100 degrees around that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.800
 to boil water when the water is 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.649
 has reached correct temperature then 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.980
 listen to a battery are ten years and 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.289
 the kettle turns on 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.989
 automatically but there is something else 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.500
 more and that is here this 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.920
 Special button that is the warm hold 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.310
 function so if the water is the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.850
 temperature has reached as it is 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.390
 to wish 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.479
 just press the button of the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.869
 keep warm and then it will work 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.360
 water for two hours on the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.380
 temperature kept you set 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.270
 even if they have in the meantime times 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:40.020
 a cup can be so then the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.700
 kettle back again and that was 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.170
 the water temperature is going through again 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.750
 measured and then if necessary that becomes 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.210
 water again on temperature 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.829
 even if they have a second one 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.939
 or a third time 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.180
 it does that for up to two hours 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.270
 even after these two hours will be 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.899
 automatically dodge this again 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.239
 Turn off the kettle again 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.280
 how nice that it is 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.230
 really cool 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.030
 more important for them to do 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.790
 We know that we have a 1.7 liter here 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:25.100
 have water and we have cooking here 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.500
 an external water level indicator 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:33.209
 an external water level display 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.819
 Also ideal then one hand operation 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.530
 means push button up and down 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.500
 As you can see here we have one here 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.630
 beautiful big mouth that means too 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.050
 A big strong men's hand can 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.070
 here for a change, for example 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.540
 By the way, the water on the heating element 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:57.920
 we have hidden so they do not see any 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.800
 heating element in the water tank here 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:06.600
 then we have the infusion here 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:09.360
 behind it is a calf filter so that is 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.730
 this one here is the lime filter like that 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.910
 what else do you need to know? 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:19.950
 have central contact here centrally 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:23.780
 contact athletic 360 degrees but also 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:27.690
 again, of course, with cable rewind 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.299
 then you want to choose what you want 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.880
 you want to touch this sound 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.390
 kettle in the color black 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.540
 or do you like the color? 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.269
 I know and then I have another question 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.660
 when you start with them 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.660
 Cook
