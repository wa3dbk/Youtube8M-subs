out<00:01:31.250> now<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.610> created<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.150> tool<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:34.260> you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
out now you have created a tool that you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.310 
out now you have created a tool that you
can<00:01:34.650> use<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:36.840> pull<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:38.220> inside<00:01:38.820> pin<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
can use to pull the inside pin out and

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.260 
can use to pull the inside pin out and
actually<00:01:43.320> instead<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.130> pin<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> should<00:01:44.970> say

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
actually instead of a pin I should say

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.630 
actually instead of a pin I should say
it<00:01:45.420> looks<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> key<00:01:46.649> which<00:01:47.220> I'll<00:01:47.399> show

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
it looks more like a key which I'll show

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.560 
it looks more like a key which I'll show
you<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.060> moment

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you in a moment

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.340 
you in a moment
select<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.440> link<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.580> want<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.790> remove

take the point of the nail and stick it

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.450 
take the point of the nail and stick it
in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.960> hole<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.670> end<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.450> link<00:01:57.720> now

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
in the hole on the end of that link now

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.510 
in the hole on the end of that link now
you're<00:01:59.460> going<00:01:59.580> to<00:01:59.670> place<00:01:59.910> a<00:02:00.679> thumb<00:02:01.679> on<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
you're going to place a thumb on the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.630 
you're going to place a thumb on the
link<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> right<00:02:03.539> and<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.860> thumb<00:02:05.190> on<00:02:05.429> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
link to the right and a thumb on the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:34.910 
link to the right and a thumb on the
link<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.179> left<00:02:07.160> just<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.280> that

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.410 

I<00:02:35.390> will<00:02:36.390> say<00:02:37.160> that<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.280> takes<00:02:38.550> quite<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.060> bit<00:02:39.209> of

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
I will say that it takes quite a bit of

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
I will say that it takes quite a bit of
force<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.640> strength<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:42.690> actually<00:02:43.200> push

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
force and strength to actually push

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.340 
force and strength to actually push
these<00:02:43.680> out<00:02:44.630> they're<00:02:45.630> not<00:02:45.840> going<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.050> come<00:02:46.230> out

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
these out they're not going to come out

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.840 
these out they're not going to come out
easy<00:02:48.170> as<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.300> see<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.980> taken<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.640> tip

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
easy as you can see I have taken the tip

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.810 
easy as you can see I have taken the tip
of<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> nail<00:02:54.330> in<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:55.560> hole<00:02:55.770> pushing<00:02:56.640> with<00:02:56.790> my

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
of the nail in the hole pushing with my

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:02.000 
of the nail in the hole pushing with my
thumbs<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:58.560> way<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.390> my<00:03:00.390> index<00:03:01.230> finger<00:03:01.620> this

thumbs this way and my index finger this

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.940 
thumbs this way and my index finger this
way<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.040> popped<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.840> key<00:03:07.110> out<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.709> the

in that spot on that link you simply

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:27.159 
in that spot on that link you simply
bend<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:14.870> remove<00:04:16.940> like<00:04:17.940> this

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:41.360 

once<00:04:28.169> again

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.730 

once<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.520> have<00:04:42.640> taken<00:04:42.850> out<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.570> right<00:04:44.470> amount

into<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.470> links<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.890> hold<00:04:51.070> them<00:04:51.160> together

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.530 

basically<00:04:55.600> it<00:04:56.350> goes<00:04:56.590> in<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:58.000> opposite<00:04:58.480> way

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.770 

like<00:05:10.830> that

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.760 

to<00:05:15.350> set<00:05:15.620> this<00:05:15.890> all<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.580> way<00:05:16.700> in<00:05:17.380> or<00:05:18.380> the<00:05:18.530> catch

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
to set this all the way in or the catch

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.000 
to set this all the way in or the catch
is<00:05:19.100> in<00:05:19.670> the<00:05:19.760> hole<00:05:19.940> where<00:05:20.150> it<00:05:20.210> needs<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.420> be

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
is in the hole where it needs to be

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.370 
is in the hole where it needs to be
simply<00:05:22.010> just<00:05:22.190> push<00:05:22.520> this<00:05:23.480> in<00:05:23.870> on<00:05:24.050> a<00:05:24.080> hard

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
simply just push this in on a hard

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:41.580 
simply just push this in on a hard
surface<00:05:24.680> such<00:05:25.490> as<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:26.000> table<00:05:30.520> like<00:05:31.520> that
