00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.950
 Good people, I'm here for today. 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.450
 present to you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.660
 ab toner the homemade made by the saw 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.429
 My friend my father is telling you 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.300
 now here a little bit of the history of by 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.210
 What have we done, do you know? 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.430
 faucet buy a land on the coast 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.490
 We spend the weekend and such a 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.800
 people are making a thousand residents 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:37.050
 and how complete it is not a thing 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:39.030
 really does is not my profession it 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.500
 concrete very difficult very heavy 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.910
 there was then the need was 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:52.649
 wanting to buy a concrete mixer 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.910
 however the price remains the time of launch at 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.570
 smaller than I found most while 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.340
 820 les trois for 1,500 reais and all 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.090
 We know that in Brazil, it's all very much. 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:12.689
 expensive and reduces taxes so I looked at one 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.150
 video on youtube very interesting of 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.909
 various models and such 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.520
 this model was easier than the people 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.619
 can develop there we start the race 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.549
 scrap iron we managed to get some 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.360
 parts are showing senac of 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.000
 motor principle we got the team 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.420
 the title bike stopped there talking to 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.659
 he also grant this motel is 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:50.549
 showing you here is the detail is 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:54.400
 that weg engine doing to make it legal 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:02:06.040
 and it 's a horse room 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:11.800
 the closure of the highway 110 and 220 155 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.510
 peres in 2010 and 2 and mail president as 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.330
 The boss of this is easier here in our 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.850
 region since the closing of the engine in 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.670
 110 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.250
 So for us to know the power of the 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.310
 motor is p 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:34.510
 like him to reduce not see the 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:39.630
 current then 5v 127 would give 601 little 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:43.630
 do not go to the maikon farm milk washing 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:48.459
 practically good so we got a 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:52.050
 engine was in the junkyard to get this 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:56.550
 set of gears because it says 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.550
 because due to the rotation of the motor 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:07.140
 six thousand and 3410 quotations 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.870
 then the oil company has to run in 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.160
 around 25 to 30 which has five notes 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.900
 for less 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.150
 so come on let's get it 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.990
 this set of gears in the iron 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.940
 old 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:30.450
 hagman and we adapted to run is of 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:36.000
 washing machine also polishing of 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.020
 washing machines also and there we made the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.810
 adaptation 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.600
 remembering that everything here was acquired 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.690
 in an old iron the more expensive piece that 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:50.040
 it was the one of gear that most attended 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.220
 cool 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.680
 the 200 liter drum 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:04.710
 we paid 20 reais for legal term is okay 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:10.470
 practically conserved 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:14.070
 to 200 liters making jabÃ¡ also beauty 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.810
 structure also bought the hill 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:24.120
 old sky at around $ 20 and it is 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.410
 cooking on the wheel I paid 7 is the ladder 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.670
 1 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.670
 we give two wheels 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:42.480
 River're not there to see the structure of something 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.480
 very easy concrete 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:50.750
 ezequias she turn and makes 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.900
 concrete has shown you a detail 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.920
 is not yet ready for a certain role 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.680
