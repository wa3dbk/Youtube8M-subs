video I've ever done
so<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.930> thought<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.289> know<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.560> let's<00:00:28.769> revisit

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
so I thought you know it let's revisit

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.609 
so I thought you know it let's revisit
this<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.760> um<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.210> had<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> new<00:00:30.810> spin<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
this but um I had a new spin to it and

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.490 
this but um I had a new spin to it and
had<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.800> kind<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.099> new<00:00:32.340> look<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.870> look

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
had a kind of new look to it so the look

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.380 
had a kind of new look to it so the look
that<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.800> gonna<00:00:34.890> go<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.640> think<00:00:35.790> some<00:00:36.239> of

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
that I'm gonna go for is I think some of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.690 
that I'm gonna go for is I think some of
the<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.559> may<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.950> VMAs<00:00:38.370> in

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the I think this may be the VMAs in

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.049 
the I think this may be the VMAs in
America<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:40.079> um<00:00:40.379> he<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.430> supporting<00:00:41.940> like

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
America that um he was supporting like

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.389 
America that um he was supporting like
the<00:00:42.180> rockabilly<00:00:42.600> kind<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.200> um<00:00:43.350> curl<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.250> his

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the rockabilly kind of um curl in his

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.459 
the rockabilly kind of um curl in his
hair<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> had<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> young<00:00:46.170> blonde

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
hair and I think it had the young blonde

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.139 
hair and I think it had the young blonde
quick<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:46.980> blonde<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.610> kinda<00:00:47.940> thing

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
quick like that blonde with kinda thing

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.850 
quick like that blonde with kinda thing
so<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> thought<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.410> let's<00:00:49.649> try

so I thought you know what let's try

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799 
so I thought you know what let's try
that<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> haven't<00:00:50.789> seen<00:00:51.059> anyone<00:00:51.480> do<00:00:51.690> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
that because I haven't seen anyone do it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.740 
that because I haven't seen anyone do it
as<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.350> yet<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.100> YouTube<00:00:53.489> there<00:00:54.180> might<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.420> more

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
as of yet on YouTube there might be more

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
of the like you can tell that it's kind

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.590 
of the like you can tell that it's kind
of<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.170> bit<00:01:31.350> dirty<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.600> completely

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
of a bit dirty and it's not completely

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.080 
of a bit dirty and it's not completely
clean<00:01:33.869> hair<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.280> actually<00:01:35.430> makes<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.060> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
clean hair it just actually makes it a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.670 
clean hair it just actually makes it a
little<00:01:36.240> easier<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.689> work<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:36.960> when<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.530> do

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
little easier to work with when you do

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.289 
little easier to work with when you do
have<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.400> natural<00:01:38.549> oil<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.240> hair

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
have a bit of natural oil in your hair

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.960 
have a bit of natural oil in your hair
because<00:01:40.200> um<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.799> style<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.250> kind<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.579> really

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
because um the style is kind of really

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
because um the style is kind of really
messy<00:01:42.299> at<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> back<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.930> stuff<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.920> do

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
messy at the back and stuff so if you do

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.800 
messy at the back and stuff so if you do
have<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.610> natural<00:01:44.790> oil<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.540> there<00:01:45.659> you

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
have that natural oil and there you

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
have that natural oil and there you
don't<00:01:45.960> actually<00:01:46.200> need<00:01:46.500> as<00:01:46.649> much<00:01:46.829> product<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
don't actually need as much product and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.639 
don't actually need as much product and
it's<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.420> lot<00:01:48.630> easier<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.140> create<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
it's just a lot easier to create the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.499 
it's just a lot easier to create the
look<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.250> my<00:01:50.399> hair<00:01:50.549> texture<00:01:50.939> actually<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
look so my hair texture actually is a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.690 
look so my hair texture actually is a
bit<00:01:51.840> curly<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> ends<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.520> going

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
bit curly on the ends so this is going

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.609 
bit curly on the ends so this is going
to<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.880> quite<00:01:54.149> an<00:01:54.329> easy<00:01:54.450> tutorial<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:55.290> me<00:01:55.439> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
to be quite an easy tutorial for me to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.609 
to be quite an easy tutorial for me to
do<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:58.079> different

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
do but if you do have a different

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.270 
do but if you do have a different
texture<00:01:58.890> here

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
texture here

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.950 
texture here
it's<00:01:59.580> really<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.270> straight<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.750> might

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's really really straight you might

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.530 
it's really really straight you might
need<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.410> just<00:02:02.400> curl<00:02:02.730> it<00:02:02.760> a<00:02:03.030> bit<00:02:03.180> with<00:02:03.330> like<00:02:03.510> a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
need to just curl it a bit with like a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.390 
need to just curl it a bit with like a
hair<00:02:03.840> strand<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.410> like<00:02:04.530> flick<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:04.980> out<00:02:05.100> at

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
hair strand I just like flick it out at

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.520 
hair strand I just like flick it out at
the<00:02:05.520> ends<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.030> right<00:02:06.480> through<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.110> flick<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
the ends like right through and flick it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.109 
the ends like right through and flick it
out<00:02:07.620> so<00:02:07.800> that<00:02:07.950> you've<00:02:08.070> got<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> little<00:02:08.940> bit

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
out so that you've got like a little bit

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.060 
out so that you've got like a little bit
of<00:02:09.240> curl<00:02:09.479> because<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:09.929> my<00:02:10.410> natural<00:02:10.470> hair

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
of curl because that's my natural hair

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.030 
of curl because that's my natural hair
it<00:02:11.670> does<00:02:11.910> curl<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.450> end<00:02:12.600> but<00:02:13.410> if<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.830> don't

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
it does curl the end but if you don't

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.699 
it does curl the end but if you don't
have<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.550> maybe<00:02:14.940> try<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.300> create<00:02:15.810> that<00:02:16.080> just

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
have that maybe try to create that just

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.140 
have that maybe try to create that just
with<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.100> straightening<00:02:17.580> iron<00:02:17.700> oh<00:02:17.970> if<00:02:18.030> you

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
with the straightening iron oh if you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.670 
with the straightening iron oh if you
have<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.300> curling<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.810> actually<00:02:19.140> tried<00:02:19.500> this

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
have a curling I actually tried this

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.310 
have a curling I actually tried this
book<00:02:19.920> just<00:02:19.950> earlier<00:02:20.490> today<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.660> did<00:02:22.110> burn

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
book just earlier today and I did burn

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.410 
book just earlier today and I did burn
myself<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:23.220> probably<00:02:23.520> can't<00:02:23.790> tell<00:02:23.880> but<00:02:24.030> about

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
myself you probably can't tell but about

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.770 
myself you probably can't tell but about
myself<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:24.930> with<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.190> curling<00:02:26.910> wand<00:02:27.060> so

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
myself here with the curling wand so

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.410 
myself here with the curling wand so
just<00:02:28.320> be<00:02:28.500> careful<00:02:28.790> but<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.820> think<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.270> about

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
just be careful but I think it's about

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.060 
just be careful but I think it's about
time<00:02:30.630> we<00:02:30.840> started<00:02:31.260> actually<00:02:31.440> doing<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
time we started actually doing the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.620 
time we started actually doing the
tutorial<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.880> should<00:02:33.090> probably<00:02:33.239> stop

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
tutorial and I should probably stop

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.780 
tutorial and I should probably stop
talking<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.890> yeah<00:02:35.010> let's<00:02:35.250> get<00:02:35.400> into<00:02:35.550> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
talking now but yeah let's get into it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.430 
talking now but yeah let's get into it
okay<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.600> first<00:02:36.720> thing<00:02:36.959> I'm<00:02:37.050> gonna<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.410> is

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440

I'm<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:37.950> gonna<00:02:38.150> section<00:02:39.150> off<00:02:39.209> my<00:02:39.270> hair<00:02:39.450> just

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
with my fingers you just have to

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.800 
with my fingers you just have to
remember<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.400> precision<00:02:45.150> kind<00:02:45.720> of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
remember this is not a precision kind of

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.300 
remember this is not a precision kind of
a<00:02:45.930> hair<00:02:46.350> tutorial<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:47.430> very<00:02:47.700> messy<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:49.310> you

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
a hair tutorial it's very messy and you

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.470 
a hair tutorial it's very messy and you
don't<00:02:50.550> really<00:02:50.700> need<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.270> be<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.940> know<00:02:54.060> exact

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
don't really need to be you know exact

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.740 
don't really need to be you know exact
with<00:02:54.690> everything<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.600> all

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
with everything so but that all

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.140 
with everything so but that all
sectioned<00:02:58.140> off<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.680> top<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.310> sides<00:03:00.800> okay

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
sectioned off the top and the sides okay

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.699 
sectioned off the top and the sides okay
so<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.180> think<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.750> see<00:03:03.780> that's<00:03:04.080> my<00:03:04.260> natural

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
so I think you see that's my natural

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.370 
so I think you see that's my natural
hair<00:03:05.100> texture<00:03:06.650> quite<00:03:07.650> messy<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:10.080> now<00:03:10.200> I'm<00:03:10.290> just

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
hair texture quite messy so now I'm just

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.410 
hair texture quite messy so now I'm just
gonna<00:03:10.530> use<00:03:10.739> some<00:03:10.950> dry<00:03:11.190> shampoo<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.269> give

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
gonna use some dry shampoo just to give

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.690
