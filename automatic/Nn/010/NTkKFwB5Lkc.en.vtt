 war then you link to this channel 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.849

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.690
 description soon this person will become 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.870
 Hi all popular liner 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.510
 Yandex again and today I would like to 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:24.140
 tell a little tricks in dota 2 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:28.939
 ulta axa as you can always kill and 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:35.489
 not much bother looking at 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:39.480
 opponents and for example with an ulta 16 with 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.379
 Aganim we can kill the enemy with 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.860
 health threshold of 625 that is, we need 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.399
 watch when he has better 125 x n and 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.250
 kill with ulta 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.629
 But I would like to show you how to do it. 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.320
 this so as not to bother looking at 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.920
 his health and just beat ulta for 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:07.369
 we need this console command 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:12.470
 which looks like this from the very beginning 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:18.330
 we enter here such a team 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:24.409
 here is this team and here you can 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:27.000
 see by default it costs 250 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.390
 to change you just need to put 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.600
 other numbers why exactly 250 and what is it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.299
 it means that every 250 will 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.450
 black dash here you can see 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.079
 black dash here is a lot of worm 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.520
 black dash black big 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.049
 dash is thousands and here we are 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.409
 can see what 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.210
 how much of our opponent hp as you 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.590
 know ajax on the first level of pumping 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.880
 ults punching 250 hp and health vapor 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.899
 can be seen under this dash 250k 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.349
 to see the true rover at 625 we 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.810
 we enter 625 here and as you see 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:16.980
 dashes become much smaller 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.930
 and they became only every 625 x5 625 625 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.310
 625 is a black cap along the 2000s and 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.650
 so on here you see them more 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.610
 we let's check if it's true 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.480
 this score points 625 now a little bit 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.870
 hit the places a couple of times with our ultra and 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.319
 the main thing here is not to overdo it and as you can see 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.150
 dash removed means 560 efficiency and 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:52.440
 let's wait for Audrey to go 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.510
 600 25 whether dash 625 will appear and how you 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.180
 see the spell appeared. 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.180
 here we can hit several times and 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.370
 to see that the enemy little dash kn 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.959
 no black and you can safely and freely 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.030
 we can beat him on the neck 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.040
