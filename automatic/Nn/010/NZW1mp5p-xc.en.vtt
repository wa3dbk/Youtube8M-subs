00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
actually on this one even supports

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.170 
actually on this one even supports
things<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:11.730> VPN<00:02:12.599> and

onto the device itself I'll just lift
this<00:02:58.480> out<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:01.569> here<00:03:02.439> we<00:03:02.530> go<00:03:02.939> now<00:03:03.939> it's<00:03:04.090> quite<00:03:04.329> a

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
this out and here we go now it's quite a

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.300 
this out and here we go now it's quite a
large<00:03:04.719> unit<00:03:05.290> because<00:03:05.769> of<00:03:05.859> the<00:03:05.919> fact<00:03:06.129> it

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
large unit because of the fact it

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.770 
large unit because of the fact it
supports<00:03:06.879> up<00:03:07.299> to<00:03:07.359> those<00:03:07.719> for<00:03:08.200> hard<00:03:08.500> drives<00:03:08.889> but

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
supports up to those for hard drives but

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.559 
supports up to those for hard drives but
the<00:03:10.780> great<00:03:11.139> thing<00:03:11.169> about<00:03:11.439> that<00:03:11.829> is<00:03:11.889> is<00:03:12.569> going

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
the great thing about that is is going

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.539 
the great thing about that is is going
forward<00:03:14.139> you're<00:03:14.560> really<00:03:14.769> never<00:03:15.129> going<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.430> run

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
forward you're really never going to run

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.789 
forward you're really never going to run
out<00:03:15.579> of<00:03:15.730> any<00:03:15.969> storage<00:03:16.389> because<00:03:16.689> the<00:03:17.379> ability

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
out of any storage because the ability

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.939 
out of any storage because the ability
to<00:03:17.979> go<00:03:18.010> up<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.430> 16<00:03:18.940> terabytes<00:03:19.379> should<00:03:20.379> last<00:03:20.650> you

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
to go up to 16 terabytes should last you

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.099 
to go up to 16 terabytes should last you
for<00:03:21.129> quite<00:03:21.400> some<00:03:21.699> period<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.120> time<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.629> know<00:03:23.019> it

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
for quite some period of time I know it

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.789 
for quite some period of time I know it
certainly<00:03:23.470> will<00:03:23.680> do<00:03:23.859> me<00:03:24.129> now<00:03:25.090> here<00:03:26.019> we<00:03:26.169> go<00:03:26.199> got

certainly will do me now here we go got

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.009 
certainly will do me now here we go got
the<00:03:26.919> box<00:03:27.129> itself<00:03:27.639> let's<00:03:28.449> just<00:03:28.689> take<00:03:28.870> the

power in now on the front we've got an
extra<00:04:09.370> USB<00:04:10.150> 3<00:04:10.959> port<00:04:11.259> there<00:04:11.470> on<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.709> front

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
extra USB 3 port there on the front

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:13.890 
extra USB 3 port there on the front
we've<00:04:12.400> got<00:04:12.549> a<00:04:12.579> collection<00:04:13.120> of<00:04:13.209> lights<00:04:13.569> as<00:04:13.870> well

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
we've got a collection of lights as well

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.719 
we've got a collection of lights as well
to<00:04:14.199> tell<00:04:14.379> us<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.620> activity<00:04:15.189> and<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.459> power

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:15.729

state<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.269> the<00:04:16.359> box<00:04:16.599> and<00:04:17.109> then<00:04:17.380> what<00:04:17.500> we<00:04:17.590> can<00:04:17.620> do

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
state of the box and then what we can do

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.399 
state of the box and then what we can do
we<00:04:18.489> can<00:04:18.519> actually<00:04:18.909> take<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.539> front<00:04:19.780> off<00:04:20.079> which

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
we can actually take the front off which

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:22.740 
we can actually take the front off which
is<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.590> nice<00:04:20.829> glossy<00:04:21.279> play<00:04:21.669> and<00:04:21.940> that<00:04:22.360> gives<00:04:22.599> us

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
is a nice glossy play and that gives us

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.230 
is a nice glossy play and that gives us
access<00:04:22.960> to<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.919> four<00:04:24.250> hot<00:04:24.729> swappable<00:04:25.180> drives

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
access to the four hot swappable drives

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.850 
access to the four hot swappable drives
now<00:04:26.599> what<00:04:26.750> we<00:04:26.840> can<00:04:26.990> actually<00:04:27.080> do<00:04:27.440> with<00:04:27.650> these

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
now what we can actually do with these

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.240 
now what we can actually do with these
these<00:04:28.550> are<00:04:28.789> just<00:04:29.319> cases<00:04:30.319> at<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.680> moment<00:04:31.099> or

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
these are just cases at the moment or

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.279 
these are just cases at the moment or
cages<00:04:31.819> and<00:04:32.360> what<00:04:32.539> you<00:04:32.630> can<00:04:32.750> actually<00:04:32.870> do<00:04:33.139> is

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
cages and what you can actually do is

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.499 
cages and what you can actually do is
just<00:04:33.440> push<00:04:33.710> them<00:04:33.889> in<00:04:34.099> slide<00:04:34.880> them<00:04:35.090> out<00:04:35.300> and

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
just push them in slide them out and

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.270 
just push them in slide them out and
then<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:36.020> actually<00:04:36.319> just<00:04:36.349> place<00:04:36.800> your<00:04:37.039> hard

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
then you actually just place your hard

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.870 
then you actually just place your hard
drive<00:04:37.580> in<00:04:37.819> the<00:04:38.000> tray<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:39.080> can<00:04:39.259> literally

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
drive in the tray and you can literally

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.490 
drive in the tray and you can literally
pull<00:04:40.880> them<00:04:41.090> in<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.389> out<00:04:41.599> even<00:04:42.259> when<00:04:42.349> the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
pull them in and out even when the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.159 
pull them in and out even when the
device<00:04:42.800> is<00:04:42.860> turned<00:04:43.069> on<00:04:43.520> put<00:04:44.300> a<00:04:44.330> new<00:04:44.569> one<00:04:44.599> in<00:04:44.960> and

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
device is turned on put a new one in and

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.050 
device is turned on put a new one in and
then<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.500> raid<00:04:45.710> will<00:04:45.979> rebuild<00:04:46.370> itself<00:04:46.789> and

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
then the raid will rebuild itself and

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.059 
then the raid will rebuild itself and
give<00:04:47.389> you<00:04:47.539> back<00:04:47.750> all<00:04:47.960> of<00:04:48.229> your<00:04:48.380> data<00:04:48.560> integrity

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
give you back all of your data integrity

data<00:04:56.990> storage<00:04:58.090> now<00:04:59.090> like<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.360> say<00:04:59.599> this<00:04:59.630> one

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
data storage now like I say this one

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.110 
data storage now like I say this one
comes<00:05:00.199> in<00:05:00.409> at<00:05:00.500> about<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.919> 500<00:05:01.550> pounds<00:05:01.880> mark

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
comes in at about the 500 pounds mark

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.999 
comes in at about the 500 pounds mark
that's<00:05:02.270> without<00:05:02.509> the<00:05:02.810> hard<00:05:03.020> drives<00:05:03.380> so<00:05:03.979> a

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009 
that's without the hard drives so a

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.920 
that's without the hard drives so a
fairly<00:05:04.430> expensive<00:05:04.759> device<00:05:05.330> but<00:05:05.900> the

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
fairly expensive device but the
