scenario that happened in my life and I
know<00:01:10.890> happens<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.760> many<00:01:11.939> women's<00:01:12.420> lives<00:01:12.659> is

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
know happens in so many women's lives is

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.730 
know happens in so many women's lives is
losing<00:01:14.340> their<00:01:15.000> menstrual<00:01:15.479> cycle<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.590> where

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
losing their menstrual cycle so where

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.870 
losing their menstrual cycle so where
their<00:01:16.950> menstrual<00:01:17.430> cycle<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:18.060> stops<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
doesn't come back and it's because

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
doesn't come back and it's because
they're<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.369> slowing<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:23.850> there<00:01:24.240> too

recently<00:01:33.270> until<00:01:33.390> about<00:01:33.840> three<00:01:34.140> months<00:01:34.290> ago<00:01:34.530> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
recently until about three months ago I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.249 
recently until about three months ago I
never<00:01:35.159> had<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.670> menstrual<00:01:36.090> cycle<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
never had a menstrual cycle I think I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.859 
never had a menstrual cycle I think I
had<00:01:37.439> one<00:01:37.640> about<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> year<00:01:39.000> ago<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.390> was<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
had one about a year ago and that was it

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.179 
had one about a year ago and that was it
and<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:41.250> reason<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.820> happens<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.810> because

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
and the reason that happens is because

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.219 
and the reason that happens is because
usually<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.090> diet<00:01:45.450> related<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.200> you

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
usually it can be diet related but you

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.060 
usually it can be diet related but you
can<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.680> overly<00:01:47.280> active<00:01:47.820> now<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.740> researched<00:01:49.740> it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.889 
movement that I researched it with says
actually<00:02:03.899> no<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.950> your<00:02:05.219> body<00:02:05.549> screaming<00:02:06.390> for

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
actually no it's your body screaming for

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.730 
actually no it's your body screaming for
homeostasis<00:02:07.700> which<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.060> balance<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:09.989> me

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
homeostasis which is that balance at me

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.320 
homeostasis which is that balance at me
so<00:02:11.740> if<00:02:11.830> we're<00:02:11.980> always<00:02:12.100> going<00:02:12.550> going<00:02:12.970> going

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
so if we're always going going going

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.690 
so if we're always going going going
going<00:02:13.660> going<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.350> we're<00:02:15.010> going<00:02:15.220> from<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.460> gym

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
can really mess up our homeostasis and I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.920 
can really mess up our homeostasis and I
