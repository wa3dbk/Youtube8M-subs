cell

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.540 

so<00:00:33.290> they<00:00:33.470> can<00:00:33.680> probably<00:00:33.980> hear<00:00:34.100> is<00:00:34.190> very

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
so they can probably hear is very

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:49.479 
so they can probably hear is very
hearing<00:00:34.880> bumps<00:00:35.180> in<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.300> road

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:59.689 

so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.540 

what<00:01:00.699> you're<00:01:00.850> hearing<00:01:01.059> is<00:01:01.390> why<00:01:01.839> I<00:01:01.870> of<00:01:02.199> see<00:01:02.550> all

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
what you're hearing is why I of see all

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.789
