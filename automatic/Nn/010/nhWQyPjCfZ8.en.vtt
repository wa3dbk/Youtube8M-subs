00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
reasons you might want to freeze it for

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.500

a<00:00:28.019> few<00:00:28.230> hours<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.800> then<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.640> kills<00:00:29.910> all<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
a few hours and then that kills all the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.510 
a few hours and then that kills all the
parasites<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.439> potentially<00:00:32.009> could<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.369> in

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
parasites that potentially could be in
