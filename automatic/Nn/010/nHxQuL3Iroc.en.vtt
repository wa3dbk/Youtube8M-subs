00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.899
 so hello everyone today I can show you 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:10.769
 restore the speedometer cable which 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.509
 often breaks on one side this is where 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.010
 mounted wheels then at the moment 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:21.480
 Here I am now growing like this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.800
 just the skin on the hook and on the ring given 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.900
 part of the speedometer inserted it hold 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:38.339
 pull out 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:42.030
 folded part the second part of the cameras 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:46.649
 didn't smoke here quadratic here 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.280
 at this end will come a fork which 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.649
 then comes he can say caliper 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.780
 and there already another mechanism draws the cable 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:02.929
 now try to stop this by 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:09.409
 I 'll tell you what I took from here 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:09.409
 This type of tube was visible 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:20.780
 copper tube inside i let in did 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:26.630
 cut along 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:39.140
 and then you did it all 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:39.980
 view you see I cut 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.940
 received and 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:47.450
 edges cut off a whole piece and here everything 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.080
 pressed gently on the boat about the skin 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.570
 I shortened the body 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.290
 neat KVN I pull it out clearly 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:01.430
 for example on but centimeters and cancellation 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.810
 kratil casing shortening from the side 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.320
 speedometer this flared off and 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:13.420
 Then I forgot to start up the needles so 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.420
 now I'll show it how it works 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.390
 here she is certainly not as it was in 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.740
 standard but nevertheless she is all 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.750
 everything works 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.910
 Began to customize for each technique 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.739
 each his 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.340
 Well, in principle, the speedometer and I have already checked 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.100
 everything works fine of course the way 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.410
 many will say not the most successful because 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.800
 easier to buy than to fool with so much 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.150
 millet but still there is time 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.060
 interest in this 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.140
 so I decided to make such a riddle 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.140
 thank you all request
