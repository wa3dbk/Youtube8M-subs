I have a passion about the teaching the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.069 
I have a passion about the teaching the
main<00:00:46.140> thing<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.670> be<00:00:47.670> myself<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.870> best

that I can do I have a talent of break

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.189 
that I can do I have a talent of break
down<00:00:56.969> complex<00:00:57.390> problems<00:00:58.520> into<00:00:59.520> smaller

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
down complex problems into smaller

down complex problems into smaller
simple<00:01:01.199> problems<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.719> I<00:01:04.339> have<00:01:05.339> very<00:01:06.000> good

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
simple problems and I have very good

skill in visualize things and a present

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.080 
skill in visualize things and a present
them<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:12.210> blackboard<00:01:13.189> that's<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.369> very<00:01:14.610> old

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
them in on blackboard that's a very old

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.170 
them in on blackboard that's a very old
fashioned<00:01:15.570> skills<00:01:16.610> it's<00:01:17.610> also<00:01:17.790> very

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
fashioned skills it's also very

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
fashioned skills it's also very
important<00:01:18.930> skill<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.210> for<00:01:21.210> example<00:01:22.159> in

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
important skill and for example in

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.969 
important skill and for example in
calculus<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.360> would<00:01:24.509> say<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:25.380> want<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> find

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
calculus you would say we want to find

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.700 
calculus you would say we want to find
the<00:01:26.220> volume<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.540> cylinder<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the volume of this cylinder in the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.340 
the volume of this cylinder in the
sector<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.460> cylinder<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.659> very<00:01:30.960> hard

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
sector with this cylinder it's very hard

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.230 
sector with this cylinder it's very hard
for<00:01:31.500> students<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.490> visualize<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:35.310> had<00:01:35.880> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
for students to visualize it and I had I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.179 
for students to visualize it and I had I
have<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> ability<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:38.030> draw<00:01:39.320> 3d<00:01:40.320> diagram<00:01:40.710> to

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
have the ability to draw 3d diagram to

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:49.650 
have the ability to draw 3d diagram to
show<00:01:41.220> them<00:01:41.700> how<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.710> cylinders<00:01:43.710> intersect

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.230 

it's<00:01:50.660> also<00:01:51.440> just<00:01:52.660> got<00:01:53.660> attitude<00:01:54.170> towards

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
it's also just got attitude towards

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.710 
it's also just got attitude towards
towards<00:01:56.240> teaching<00:01:56.740> care<00:01:57.740> for<00:01:58.010> students

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
towards teaching care for students

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.550 
towards teaching care for students
well-being<00:01:59.720> and<00:02:00.970> respect<00:02:01.970> students<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.840> in

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
well-being and respect students and in

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.240 
well-being and respect students and in
classes<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:04.750> some<00:02:05.750> students<00:02:06.320> would<00:02:06.830> put<00:02:07.070> up

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
classes and some students would put up

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.310 
classes and some students would put up
their<00:02:07.520> hands<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.060> ask<00:02:08.570> questions<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:11.140> for<00:02:12.140> me

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
their hands and ask questions and for me

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.470 
their hands and ask questions and for me
there's<00:02:12.590> no<00:02:12.800> question<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.520> is<00:02:13.670> too<00:02:13.850> small<00:02:14.030> or

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
there's no question that is too small or

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
there's no question that is too small or
too<00:02:14.810> big

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
too big

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.110 
too big
if<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.920> student<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.640> brave<00:02:17.030> enough<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:19.120> reach

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
if the student is brave enough to reach

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.610 
if the student is brave enough to reach
the<00:02:20.270> henna<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.630> ask<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.960> question<00:02:21.500> then<00:02:22.280> perhaps

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
the henna to ask a question then perhaps

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.880 
the henna to ask a question then perhaps
many<00:02:24.620> other<00:02:24.860> students<00:02:25.550> don't<00:02:26.060> understand<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
many other students don't understand the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.690 
many other students don't understand the
problem<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.790> as<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.030> would<00:02:29.360> patiently<00:02:30.700> explain

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
problem and as I would patiently explain

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.870 
problem and as I would patiently explain
to<00:02:31.940> them<00:02:33.160> at<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.660> appropriate<00:02:35.660> level<00:02:36.880> encourage

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
to them at a appropriate level encourage

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.550 
to them at a appropriate level encourage
them<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.830> ask<00:02:40.010> questions<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.470> develop<00:02:42.470> a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
them to to ask questions and develop a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.620 
them to to ask questions and develop a
good<00:02:42.680> rapport<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:44.320> would<00:02:46.090> always<00:02:47.090> try<00:02:47.510> to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
good rapport I would always try to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.270 
good rapport I would always try to
perfect<00:02:48.620> my<00:02:49.160> teaching<00:02:49.970> skills<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:51.860> would

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
perfect my teaching skills and I would

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.810 
perfect my teaching skills and I would
think<00:02:52.640> how<00:02:53.239> can<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:53.600> motivate<00:02:54.380> my<00:02:54.980> students<00:02:55.550> I

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
think how can I motivate my students I

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.170 
think how can I motivate my students I
would<00:02:56.570> think<00:02:56.959> thickness<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.950> their<00:02:58.280> shoes<00:02:58.610> and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.290 

why<00:03:02.180> do<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.420> need<00:03:02.630> to<00:03:02.870> learn<00:03:03.050> these<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:05.090> subject

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
why do I need to learn these the subject

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.979 
why do I need to learn these the subject
I'm<00:03:05.720> teaching<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.320> especially<00:03:06.860> difficult<00:03:07.250> for

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
I'm teaching is especially difficult for

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.710 
I'm teaching is especially difficult for
most<00:03:09.280> engineering<00:03:10.280> students<00:03:10.850> because<00:03:11.420> I

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
most engineering students because I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.680 
most engineering students because I
teach<00:03:12.400> say<00:03:13.400> for<00:03:13.640> example<00:03:14.150> differential

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
teach say for example differential

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.250 
teach say for example differential
equations<00:03:15.140> it's<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.190> very<00:03:16.430> abstract<00:03:17.260> choice

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
equations it's a very abstract choice

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.220 
equations it's a very abstract choice
