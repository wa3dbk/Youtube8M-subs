can see by the custom cooling here and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.779 
can see by the custom cooling here and
by<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.200> fan<00:00:43.530> that's<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.890> here<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.579> really

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
by the fan that's on here it's really

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.340 
by the fan that's on here it's really
kind<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.120> hard<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.450> tell<00:00:45.660> just<00:00:45.899> by<00:00:45.960> looking<00:00:46.050> at

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
kind of hard to tell just by looking at

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.290 
kind of hard to tell just by looking at
it<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:46.649> underneath<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.160> card<00:00:47.430> as<00:00:47.550> well<00:00:47.789> are

a bunch of very large copper heat sinks

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
a bunch of very large copper heat sinks
what<00:00:51.390> these<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> these<00:00:52.170> help<00:00:52.469> dissipate

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
what these do is these help dissipate

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.180 
what these do is these help dissipate
the<00:00:53.399> heat<00:00:53.430> away<00:00:53.820> from<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.660> GPU<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:56.039> of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the heat away from the GPU and out of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.830 
the heat away from the GPU and out of
the<00:00:56.280> systems<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.969> card<00:00:57.210> runs<00:00:57.449> cooler

the card has a great feature that's
called<00:01:16.229> voltage<00:01:16.590> tweaking<00:01:17.250> now<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
called voltage tweaking now one of the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
called voltage tweaking now one of the
reason<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> voltage<00:01:18.840> tweaking<00:01:19.229> works<00:01:19.619> on

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
reason the voltage tweaking works on

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.950 
reason the voltage tweaking works on
this<00:01:20.009> card<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.520> due<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.479> its<00:01:21.600> excellent

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
this card is due to its excellent

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
this card is due to its excellent
cooling<00:01:22.470> because<00:01:22.890> we're<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> first<00:01:23.430> thing

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
cooling because we're the first thing

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.280 
cooling because we're the first thing
that<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> voltage<00:01:24.180> tweak<00:01:24.420> does<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.080> raises

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
that the voltage tweak does is it raises

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.260 
that the voltage tweak does is it raises
the<00:01:25.619> temperature<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:26.220> your<00:01:26.250> card<00:01:26.670> up

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the temperature of your card up

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.120 
the temperature of your card up
so<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:27.900> asus<00:01:28.259> has<00:01:28.290> done<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.920> they've<00:01:29.100> created

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
so what asus has done is they've created

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.810 
so what asus has done is they've created
better<00:01:29.939> cooling<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.659> their<00:01:31.170> card<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:32.460> make<00:01:32.640> it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
better cooling on their card to make it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.280 
better cooling on their card to make it
so<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> voltage<00:01:33.810> tweak

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
so that it can have the voltage tweak

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.530 
so that it can have the voltage tweak
now<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.100> card<00:01:35.340> supposed<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> overclock<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
now this card supposed to overclock to

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.260 
now this card supposed to overclock to
about<00:01:36.750> 50%<00:01:37.200> above<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.579> standard<00:01:39.090> reference

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
about 50% above the standard reference

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.200 
about 50% above the standard reference
designed<00:01:39.869> by<00:01:40.049> ATI<00:01:40.500> now<00:01:41.220> that's<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.820> pretty<00:01:41.970> good

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
designed by ATI now that's a pretty good

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.600 
designed by ATI now that's a pretty good
damn<00:01:42.420> thing<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.500> let's<00:01:43.979> keep<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
damn thing so let's keep going in the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.789 
damn thing so let's keep going in the
review<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.990> thing<00:01:46.110> I'll<00:01:46.229> mention<00:01:46.380> -<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.680> think

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
review one thing I'll mention - I think

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.260 
review one thing I'll mention - I think
most<00:01:47.009> people<00:01:47.159> know<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.490> by<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.970> also

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
most people know this by now is also

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.389 
most people know this by now is also
that<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.630> card<00:01:48.869> does<00:01:49.170> too<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.950> full<00:01:50.189> I

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that this card does too for the full I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.639 
that this card does too for the full I
affinity<00:01:50.970> line<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:51.990> three

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
affinity line so you can use three

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.100 
affinity line so you can use three
monitors<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.820> card<00:01:54.090> without<00:01:54.899> any

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
monitors with this card without any

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.560 
monitors with this card without any
additional<00:01:55.619> equipment<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.240> it

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
additional equipment so that's about it

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.660 
additional equipment so that's about it
let's<00:01:57.960> follow<00:01:58.140> along<00:01:58.229> now<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.920> let's<00:01:59.159> see<00:01:59.340> how

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
let's follow along now and let's see how

00:01:59.670 --> 00:03:01.990 
let's follow along now and let's see how
well<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.909> works<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.450> performance

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.369 

okay<00:03:03.000> so<00:03:03.060> at<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> end<00:03:03.599> of<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> day<00:03:04.019> after

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
okay so at the end of the day after

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.080 
okay so at the end of the day after
we've<00:03:04.709> looked<00:03:04.860> at<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.069> New<00:03:05.220> Age<00:03:05.550> Zeus

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
we've looked at the New Age Zeus

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.610 
we've looked at the New Age Zeus
eh<00:03:06.769> 5870<00:03:07.769> all<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.340> can<00:03:08.760> say<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.239> good<00:03:09.569> things<00:03:09.930> it

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
eh 5870 all I can say is good things it

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.949 
eh 5870 all I can say is good things it
actually<00:03:11.010> does<00:03:11.250> 1cor<00:03:12.060> than<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> standard

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
actually does 1cor than a standard

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.900 
actually does 1cor than a standard
reference<00:03:13.140> design<00:03:13.680> card<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.580> is<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.760> good

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
reference design card this is a good

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.520 
reference design card this is a good
thing<00:03:15.090> for<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.390> people<00:03:15.510> overclocking<00:03:16.349> and

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
thing for the people overclocking and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.110 
thing for the people overclocking and
for<00:03:17.010> those<00:03:17.129> people<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.459> want<00:03:17.730> their<00:03:17.790> card<00:03:18.060> to

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
for those people just want their card to

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.880 
for those people just want their card to
run<00:03:18.360> cooler<00:03:18.629> because<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.290> hot<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.650> card

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
run cooler because the hot of the card

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.770 
run cooler because the hot of the card
runs<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.519> actually<00:03:20.879> is<00:03:20.970> shorter<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.360> life<00:03:21.599> of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
runs the actually is shorter the life of

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.380 
runs the actually is shorter the life of
the<00:03:21.870> card<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.769> faster<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.220> burns<00:03:23.640> out<00:03:24.120> as

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
the card and the faster it burns out as

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.390 
the card and the faster it burns out as
you<00:03:24.900> can<00:03:25.019> see<00:03:25.200> this<00:03:25.349> card<00:03:25.620> over<00:03:25.709> clocks<00:03:26.069> pretty

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you can see this card over clocks pretty

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.820 
you can see this card over clocks pretty
well<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:27.269> doesn't<00:03:27.599> improve<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.410> performance

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
well it doesn't improve the performance

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.740 
well it doesn't improve the performance
quite<00:03:29.069> you<00:03:29.250> know<00:03:29.280> 100%<00:03:29.730> but<00:03:30.239> it's<00:03:30.510> all<00:03:30.629> about

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
quite you know 100% but it's all about

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.300 
quite you know 100% but it's all about
48<00:03:31.290> percent<00:03:31.319> improvement<00:03:31.920> with<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
48 percent improvement with the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.039 
48 percent improvement with the
overclocking<00:03:33.000> which<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.209> pretty<00:03:33.450> damn<00:03:33.720> good

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
overclocking which is pretty damn good

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.440 
overclocking which is pretty damn good
