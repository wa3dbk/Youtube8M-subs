Zelda<00:06:13.430> I<00:06:13.640> think<00:06:14.060> that's<00:06:14.210> fine<00:06:14.450> but<00:06:14.960> like<00:06:15.140> basic

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
Zelda I think that's fine but like basic

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.100 
Zelda I think that's fine but like basic
patterns<00:06:16.220> and<00:06:16.430> stuff<00:06:16.610> I<00:06:16.820> it's<00:06:16.970> just<00:06:17.000> I<00:06:17.450> saw<00:06:18.050> the

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
patterns and stuff I it's just I saw the

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.870 
patterns and stuff I it's just I saw the
basic<00:06:18.530> pattern<00:06:18.890> ones<00:06:19.130> were<00:06:19.310> just<00:06:19.550> a<00:06:19.640> dollar

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
basic pattern ones were just a dollar

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.240 
basic pattern ones were just a dollar
which<00:06:20.270> I<00:06:20.390> think<00:06:20.600> it's<00:06:20.720> kind<00:06:20.870> of<00:06:20.900> reasonable<00:06:21.290> so

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
which I think it's kind of reasonable so

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.770 
which I think it's kind of reasonable so
let's<00:06:22.430> go<00:06:22.640> ahead<00:06:22.670> and<00:06:22.910> check<00:06:23.360> out<00:06:23.540> our<00:06:23.570> new
