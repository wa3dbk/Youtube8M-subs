00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
want to do is lift the computer app and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.979 
want to do is lift the computer app and
make<00:01:03.130> a<00:01:03.160> visual<00:01:03.700> inspection<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.720> then<00:01:04.839> we'll

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
make a visual inspection and then we'll
