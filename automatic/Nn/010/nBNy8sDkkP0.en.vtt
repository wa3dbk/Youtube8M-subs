00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.730
 Y 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.040
 av 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.370
 all the kids here we are a 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.800
 new video today I bring you a new way 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.630
 of the game of cope 2 which is the mode 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.910
 league in which you are going up in rank 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.320
 and it's doing better positions, not what 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.710
 I'm doing a like / problem that 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.900
 I had to record it so to see this how 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.669
 is it fair 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.669
 then this is me I think 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:54.960
 it is an 89 and with only one game 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.930
 they already climbed me up to the 25th rank that is 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.260
 this game and the truth is that this 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.229
 mode is the one I like the most 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.509
 why look for it and here I think that the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.509
 more professional people so to speak 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:24.920
 well I have a little bit of the mp7 with a bullet 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.920
 I wanted to call with the ones from the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:35.400
 war and the founder of gusts I carry a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:40.020
 9 an airplane that now as well 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.000
 saying it is automatic and so to speak 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.370
 a kind of javier 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.660
 an attack on these lower waves that 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.790
 but I have put them on for a bit 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.490
 to try but always effectively 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.890
 I do not take them out I got more streaks 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:02.940
 talking a bit about the gusts too 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:06.869
 there is nothing else there is like white and a 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:12.720
 swarm another streak that makes 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:15.660
 you come a lot and here the gusts 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.070
 you do not go for losses but for points is 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.980
 say yes but you take a way 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.510
 has the 2003 points downloads to 150 well 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.420
 they add up and when you get to those 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.690
 in it and the same goes without you 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.690
 kill 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:37.550
 the hunter who is like a helicopter 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.780
 that an objective is set on the for 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:47.600
 be attentive to where it puts the casualties and 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.260
 already with him with the helicopter this truth 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:58.670
 that is pretty good 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:58.670
 I'm playing the players 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:05.819
 6 against 2 and 3 0 so if you have 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.450
 some question of the game I answer 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.299
 because you 've already seen that the game does not 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.400
 is the description solves enough 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.870
 doubts that people ask me and good 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.580
 lightning attack message 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.709
 it's like a daily attack I 'm done and 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.049
 Kills well the only thing to take the flag 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.049
 you can not really kill the truth 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.470
 I was fixing the points he threw 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.780
 with the past 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.100
 so it's already ending look has already 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.070
 finished I hope you liked the 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.280
 opacity 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.280
 until next time
