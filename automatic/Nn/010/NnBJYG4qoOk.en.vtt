00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.219
 while the average 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.219
 the nff ff 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
 easy access 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.520
 totally agree to complain 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 the cff and healthy 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.560
 last week 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.570
 Why 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.570
 and means 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.310
 I think there are some sacred music 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.310
 who does not get ready for the public in the building 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.640
 the artist very tall and unlike a scene that's 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.780
 it's not a direction any of these 360 ​​degrees 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.200
 so we have to adapt we have to see if it does not help 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 also the effect of speed counts that we have on the ice 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.010
 with music 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.909
 those still still believe 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.909
 one year before and the end of May 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.430
 find the bullring 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.430
 that's handmade to be here 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.469
 boursorama 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.929
 a month that I watch the acceleration of 13 hours before that will 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.649
 parents of pupils 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:20.159
 - excellent work 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.459
 fast enough 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.749
 so there in two days we managed to accomplish 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.519
 the basis of the program 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.150
 now there is still a great routine work it will have to be repeated 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.579
 until the movement is integrated 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.579
 maybe they had these stuff add to other places 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.369
 develop a choreography you need air 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.599
 you have to leave anyway 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.170
 let's still digest all these new things and there for my part I 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.009
 do not go 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.249
 go on tour with this title will be well it would be too early 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.139
 I need 2 hours and 30 minutes 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.119
 to the point of salvation 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:58.169
 the themes simply 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.019
 more than six months 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.019
 mounted alone with the music and g 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:06.759
 to an audience who want to discover what you want to share what 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.919
 as soon as I say good to myself this choreography is over 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.949
 it automatically disappears 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:28.799
 and one so that I can do it again I need to review a video and pears 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.279
 review the movement several times and redo it 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.119
 so it still takes 

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:36.119
 time to do an old choreography 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.979
 mont-joli toulouse 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.779
 the site of the team of benjamins and witnesses 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.759
 mentally it was obvious in his words 

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:55.849
 what I do whenever I have interpreted 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.129
 here j -p I could not be wrong 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.129
 I love to do it again 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.189
 the little door 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.199
 glitter next because the girls 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.849
 even after this period 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.879
 I suffered a lot where I really 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.879
 the feeling that my body can you 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.020
 and I had finally want to take the ice cream March m 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.710
 void while listening 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.710
 I immediately thought about it 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.020
 all that means 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.020
 the trend 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.529
 this series is finished at 6 and 3 and the gestures 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.210
 what drives me today is this passion 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.279
 skating these are the pressure of the compete 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.449
 and not having water 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.610
 of limits in skating that in a few years it will be better I 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.710
 I can 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.130
 let me go on completely different styles I feel 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:18.889
 very rare to meet the challenge of being to be they do not go 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.610
 a skater who brings something more and then why not also the 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.719
 develop in other skaters 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.719
 because I would like skating came I would like 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.399
 that young people today with their potential track develop 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.779
 what I could develop with my entourage 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.710
 and it is it is maybe also percent 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.710
 for a new breath for them for my free skating 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.210
 bongo 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.680
 the wall 

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:38.689
 immediately I do not fix the critics fuse 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:41.460
 there were four young mothers 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.759
 of tomorrow 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:46.830
 for a baritone a base and then we formed a group like the four bearded 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.549
 fo as the facts
