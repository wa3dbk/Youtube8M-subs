also<00:02:06.280> new<00:02:06.460> is<00:02:06.729> we<00:02:07.000> extended<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.689> sultry

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649

added<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.730> variable<00:02:12.150> control<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.780> we<00:02:12.930> call<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
added a variable control that we call a

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.130 
added a variable control that we call a
texture<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:15.290> increase<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.689> some<00:02:18.689> settings

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
texture and increase the some settings

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.319 
texture and increase the some settings
to<00:02:19.319> two<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.010> there's<00:02:20.219> one<00:02:20.879> that's<00:02:21.060> kind<00:02:21.239> of

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
to two now so there's one that's kind of

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.149 
to two now so there's one that's kind of
the<00:02:21.420> low<00:02:21.569> frequency<00:02:22.170> vintage<00:02:22.530> sound<00:02:22.799> another

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
the low frequency vintage sound another

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.140 
the low frequency vintage sound another
one<00:02:23.340> that's<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.549> little<00:02:23.640> bit<00:02:23.790> more<00:02:23.969> high

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
one that's a little bit more high

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.890 
one that's a little bit more high
frequency<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.359> cycles<00:02:27.720> through

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
frequency so it just cycles through

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.470 
frequency so it just cycles through
those
