it<00:01:01.260> was<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:02.999> of<00:01:03.030> work<00:01:03.329> basically<00:01:03.659> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
it was just a lot of work basically I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.070 
it was just a lot of work basically I
mean<00:01:04.700> when<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:05.820> decided<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.659> want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> do

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
mean when we decided that we want to do

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.560 
mean when we decided that we want to do
it<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.979> live-action<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.330> knew

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
it as if it is live-action but we knew

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.120 
it as if it is live-action but we knew
we<00:01:09.750> need<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.530> animation<00:01:10.890> because

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
we need to do it in animation because

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.340 
we need to do it in animation because
the<00:01:11.460> level<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.970> control<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.690> iteration<00:01:13.229> we

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the level of control and iteration we

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.980 
the level of control and iteration we
want<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.830> can't<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.400> live-action<00:01:14.990> so

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
want that you can't do in live-action so

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.890 
want that you can't do in live-action so
we<00:01:16.830> were<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.159> kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.090> slightly<00:01:18.479> worried

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
we were just kind of a slightly worried

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.569 
we were just kind of a slightly worried
could<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> point<00:01:20.430> where

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
could we get it to the point where

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.580 
could we get it to the point where
people<00:01:20.820> think<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.450> live-action<00:01:22.049> luckily<00:01:22.469> we

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
people think it's live-action luckily we

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.520 
people think it's live-action luckily we
were<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.719> lot<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.350> just

person's input every single person's

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.700 
person's input every single person's
creative<00:02:37.570> input<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:38.050> doesn't<00:02:38.290> matter<00:02:38.440> if<00:02:38.590> it's

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
creative input it doesn't matter if it's

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.590 
creative input it doesn't matter if it's
a<00:02:38.800> shade<00:02:39.070> of<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:39.520> a<00:02:39.610> lie<00:02:39.790> though<00:02:39.970> an<00:02:40.120> animator

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
a shade of it's a lie though an animator

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.170 
a shade of it's a lie though an animator
and<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.560> think<00:02:41.800> being<00:02:41.980> exposed<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.910> and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
and I think being exposed to that and

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.910 
and I think being exposed to that and
understanding<00:02:43.840> how<00:02:43.960> this<00:02:44.110> works<00:02:44.440> helped<00:02:44.800> me

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
understanding how this works helped me

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.980 
understanding how this works helped me
so<00:02:45.130> much<00:02:45.340> then<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.850> short<00:02:46.090> when<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.330> was<00:02:46.630> the

so much then in the short when I was the

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.370 
so much then in the short when I was the
director<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.910> just<00:02:48.930> being<00:02:49.930> open<00:02:50.350> to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380

everyone's creative input to it and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.790 
everyone's creative input to it and
taking<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:52.840> making<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.260> story

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
and the film so much more than it would

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.300 
and the film so much more than it would
have<00:02:56.200> been<00:02:56.380> if<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.590> would<00:02:56.800> have<00:02:56.860> done<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.160> just

levels<00:03:01.860> from<00:03:02.860> idea<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.670> execution<00:03:04.570> can<00:03:04.780> you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
levels from idea to execution can you

everything<00:03:10.810> basically<00:03:11.020> starts<00:03:11.620> with<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:11.830> core

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
everything basically starts with a core

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.700 
everything basically starts with a core
idea<00:03:12.640> and<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:13.480> me<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.930> was<00:03:14.050> an<00:03:14.290> umbrella<00:03:14.500> I

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
idea and for me that was an umbrella I

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.770 
idea and for me that was an umbrella I
found<00:03:15.070> when<00:03:15.910> he<00:03:15.940> was<00:03:16.090> raining<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.510> city

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
found when he was raining in the city

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.780 
found when he was raining in the city
and<00:03:16.960> just<00:03:16.990> looked<00:03:17.440> incredibly<00:03:18.070> sad<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.700> was

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
and just looked incredibly sad it was

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.490 
and just looked incredibly sad it was
abandoned<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:19.510> just<00:03:19.690> lied<00:03:19.990> in<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.290> gutter

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
abandoned and just lied in the gutter

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.410 
abandoned and just lied in the gutter
there<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:24.430> next<00:03:24.730> step<00:03:24.910> for<00:03:25.150> me<00:03:25.270> was<00:03:25.300> to

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
there and the next step for me was to

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.090 
there and the next step for me was to
find<00:03:25.840> an<00:03:25.960> emotional<00:03:26.440> connection<00:03:26.590> what<00:03:26.950> did

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
find an emotional connection what did

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.500 
find an emotional connection what did
that<00:03:27.130> mean<00:03:27.460> to<00:03:27.490> me<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.850> what<00:03:27.970> why<00:03:28.090> did<00:03:28.270> I<00:03:28.300> feel

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
sad about it I realized it was because I

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.280 
sad about it I realized it was because I
grew<00:03:31.240> up<00:03:31.300> in<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.510> city<00:03:31.720> where<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:31.930> rains<00:03:32.140> a<00:03:32.260> lot

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290

grew up in the city where it rains a lot
and<00:03:32.710> in<00:03:32.830> California<00:03:33.340> where<00:03:33.490> I<00:03:33.520> live<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.910> barely
