disgustingness in there so I cut all the
fat<00:01:46.849> off<00:01:46.999> so<00:01:47.119> I<00:01:47.179> don't<00:01:47.270> have<00:01:47.479> no<00:01:47.659> texture

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
fat off so I don't have no texture

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.949 
fat off so I don't have no texture
surprises<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.429> there<00:01:49.609> you<00:01:49.670> go<00:01:49.849> cut<00:01:50.599> that<00:01:50.630> bit

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
surprises so there you go cut that bit

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.989 
surprises so there you go cut that bit
of<00:01:51.049> fat<00:01:51.229> off<00:01:51.349> there<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.799> then<00:01:51.859> just<00:01:52.459> rotate

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
of fat off there and then just rotate

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.539 
of fat off there and then just rotate
the<00:01:53.119> chicken<00:01:53.420> breast<00:01:53.630> around<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:55.130> continue

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
the chicken breast around and continue

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.029

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
to remove the fat from the side with

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.769 
to remove the fat from the side with
your<00:01:58.219> paring<00:01:58.639> knife<00:01:58.849> so<00:01:59.090> this<00:01:59.209> is<00:01:59.329> why<00:01:59.479> you<00:01:59.539> use

00:01:59.769 --> 00:01:59.779 
your paring knife so this is why you use

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.089 
your paring knife so this is why you use
a<00:01:59.810> small<00:02:00.200> knife<00:02:00.229> because<00:02:00.590> it's<00:02:00.709> nice<00:02:00.859> and<00:02:00.889> easy

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
a small knife because it's nice and easy

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.269 
a small knife because it's nice and easy
to<00:02:01.459> maneuver<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:02.659> just<00:02:02.869> go<00:02:03.020> ahead<00:02:03.169> get<00:02:04.039> rid<00:02:04.189> of

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:04.279 
to maneuver and just go ahead get rid of

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.519 
to maneuver and just go ahead get rid of
all<00:02:04.399> that<00:02:04.749> look<00:02:05.749> it<00:02:05.840> doesn't<00:02:05.990> take<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:06.409> very

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:06.529 
all that look it doesn't take you very

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:07.989 
all that look it doesn't take you very
long<00:02:06.649> because<00:02:06.919> usually<00:02:07.429> you<00:02:07.579> know<00:02:07.669> chicken

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
long because usually you know chicken

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.910 
long because usually you know chicken
breast<00:02:08.209> is<00:02:08.360> quite<00:02:08.629> quite<00:02:09.049> a<00:02:09.079> lean<00:02:09.439> meat<00:02:09.709> so

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
breast is quite quite a lean meat so

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.479 
breast is quite quite a lean meat so
there's<00:02:10.099> not<00:02:10.189> a<00:02:10.250> whole<00:02:10.429> lot<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.670> fat<00:02:10.970> on<00:02:11.120> it

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
there's not a whole lot of fat on it

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.160 
there's not a whole lot of fat on it
so<00:02:11.730> that's<00:02:11.939> probably<00:02:12.150> as<00:02:12.450> far<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:12.870> I'm<00:02:12.989> going

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
so that's probably as far as I'm going

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.110 
so that's probably as far as I'm going
to<00:02:13.230> go<00:02:13.379> with<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> removing<00:02:14.010> fat<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:14.939> what
