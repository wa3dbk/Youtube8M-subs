00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.590
 Everybody can do his body 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.640

 I have the motive for the elephant 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.350
 the embroidery machine loaded 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.019
 best piece flows in the 30s frame 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.299
 clamped and now pieces the first 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:48.649
 sequence just flows on the piece 

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:57.530
 invented is programmed so that he 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:01:00.079
 30 x 18 cm frame completely fills then 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.320
 Put on fabric for the front 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.289
 the fleece on and rose this again 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.549
 that is, with the first sequence fixed 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.069
 you go back a step and 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.380
 send him again 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:14.539
 Alternatively, of course, directly 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.630
 the fabric is clamped in the frame 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.630
 become 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.310
 after that, the eye will exist 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.399
 and then they are hiding from her now 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.399
 first we have a position 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.830
 On top you put a piece of fabric 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.080
 if necessary, you can do something with it 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.590
 spray glue and piece of fabric piece 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.590
 firmly 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.690
 the donors are cut back and 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.340
 then the cards are sold 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.680
 I have another reward here 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.200
 I want to hang up here 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.710

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.710

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.440
 so does the completely assembled 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.710
 front then I'm out here 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:34.250
 added another name and to 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:36.740
 Finally, the back comes around who 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.080
 take a tail to the elephant 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.640
 I would like to do that 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.200
 Here is something made of jersey material 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.540
 prepared but you can also diagonally 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.780
 use a drawstring or other 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.840
 I have my tail here 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.209
 fixed on the adhesive tape and will now be on 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.370
 pick up the back with embroidered 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:07.190
 careful that he does not over here 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:09.080
 any edges protruding then lays 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.780
 he the fabric for the back with the 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.970
 nice side down on the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.840
 complete rose well and climbed the 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.840
 back 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.490
 so the last sequence please not 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.740
 stuck it just serves that right 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.510
 foot here in the turn of the opening 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.930
 stays and we take everything from the 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.930
 frame 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.370
 The piece of fleece is now removed and 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.140
 the elephant is cut out for 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.840
 elephant is now cut out and 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.310
 important for everyone in the uigures is like 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.980
 always to cut such curves with it 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.580
 The figures turn after each other 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.260
 can also develop nicely now 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.860
 we turn the elephant 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.320
 important here is such a narrow one 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.720
 shape like every proboscis we do 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.519
 start to turn at the top 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.910
 So we start at the top of the 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:26.140
 snout and snail this with a 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:32.880
 rounded object inwards to 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:35.860
 Body center then we can do it 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.260
 pull out of the walls through the walls 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.260
 and turn the complete figure 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:50.290
 yes so beautiful looks our turned and 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.990
 molded elephant then out in the 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.180
 tail I have offered now 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.100
 I only need the turnaround approaching 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.160
 shut down 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:03.250
 before the elephant eg with grains 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.110
 fill or with cotton wool and then he is 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.110
