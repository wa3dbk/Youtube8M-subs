00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:13.070
 The pallium is one of the 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.379
 fiat brand here in brazil and just like 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.390
 other traditional vineyard models 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.250
 losing ground fast to new 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.380
 excited the competition 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.779
 Look no better than in the year in 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.360
 That completes 15 years of Brazil to 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:36.559
 to win a new generation and this time 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:38.870
 brought real changes to begin with 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.720
 this pallium was developed in another 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.300
 platform based on the new one and 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.760
 this he gained in internal space 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.770
 and thanks to the new 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.550
 increased by almost 5 centimeters 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.310
 to the previous version and out and here easy 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.760
 also note the new height measures 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.760
 and width 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.720
 and more than size out here you 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.000
 realizes these very radical changes 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.580
 here in the back for example note a 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.830
 new set of lanterns much larger and 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.430
 now running along the sides of the 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.619
 columns and then you notice concern 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.759
 with visual standardization with others 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.860
 brand models 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.110
 but here in the case of the pair this gets very 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.030
 evident at the front of the car 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.190
 first because of the new bumper 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.890
 this black grid that reminds me much of what 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.850
 we see not one but mainly by 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.670
 this here 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.640
 the 800-type mustache thanks to this 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.740
 chrome fillet here and bearing the logo 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.539
 right in the middle of a package that is 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.240
 complemented by the set of headlights 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.690
 following the same proposal for a 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.090
 inside everything is renewed also and 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.670
 with a deserved highlight the paulo pasa 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.310
 quick a new and good impression 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.220
 interior refinement with a certain amount of 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.190
 creativity and abuse even in the design of 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.140
 panel that now just as it can not be 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.989
 customized by the owner of the canopy 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.860
 remains a profile car 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:12.080
 intermediary in here 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.540
 This means that if you want more 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.480
 Fine refinement looking through a car 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.090
 above in the case the point now back here is 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.730
 real gain of comfort space for the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.950
 legs to the head and still have a good 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.099
 new that the possibility now of 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.830
 adjust the backrest forward and 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.230
 which has two positions but still 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.260
 we do not have the backrest option 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.690
 that is, if you need to 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.959
 I'm not holding anything back 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:50.239
 already the trunk also gained a 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:51.050
 bit but won with three options of 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.760
 motor 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.340
 this new pallium can meet 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.349
 different tastes and styles when 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.030
 question is force to accelerate this 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.690
 version we are evaluating is 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.300
 equipped with a 1.0-liter 75-horsepower engine and 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.450
 same engine that equips the new one and 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.939
 there is no magic that feels the weight of 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.870
 bodywork and does not form a better recipe 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.870
 for the new party 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.750
 because this 1.0 palladium is going straight and 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.600
 after packing but in practice on the day 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.030
 to day he pity to face rises 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.270
 even walking without passengers and luggage 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.850
 And then to compensate for the lack of strength you 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.260
 requires more of the engine and does much more 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.840
 gear shifts 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.239
 finally it is difficult to achieve savings 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.709
 fuel for those who value very 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.140
 low consumption 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.080
 the most interesting recipe is the engine 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.010
 1.4 which is also small but delivery 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.050
 more strength 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.209
 good point here now well 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.390
 noticeable is the new suspension 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.850
 of the pallium that decreased that excess well 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.830
 softness of previous generation 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.750
 now pay attention it decreased well 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.120
 left suspension a little more rigid 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.860
 but it still values ​​a lot and if 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.380
 rotate softer 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.540
 It is also worth remembering two more points 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.299
 about the 2012 pallium 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.190
 it can be equipped with the transmission 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.280
 automated dualogic this for the 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.729
 versions with 1.6 engine and the version of 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.950
 Attractive entry 1.0 comes with steering 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.210
 hydraulics and on-board computer as 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.940
 serial number 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:35.700
 like this the new generation of the pallium 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.700
 compare with these models 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:45.240
 that the pallium has everything to recover the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.849
 its brightness here from now on 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.340
 this is no doubt now that the brand 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.139
 could have considered the inclusion of air 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.879
 conditioning as a serial 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.199
 version as well as with the 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:57.210
 hydraulic steering 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.190
 looks small detail but wanted 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.680
 further excite the buyer of a 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.050
 car of this size in this price range 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.629
 but it was not this time the fact is that for 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.770
 carry a more equipped palio the price 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.770
 Get up, too.
