this<00:00:27.599> was<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.349> innards<00:00:28.560> were<00:00:28.800> designed<00:00:29.160> by<00:00:29.460> my

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
this was the innards were designed by my

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400 
this was the innards were designed by my
friend<00:00:29.670> fish<00:00:30.060> phonetic<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.750> same<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.230> who

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
friend fish phonetic the same one who

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
friend fish phonetic the same one who
designed<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> piston<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.759> did<00:00:33.270> most<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
designed the piston I did most the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.500 
designed the piston I did most the
exterior<00:00:34.140> work<00:00:34.500> sits<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.520> really<00:00:35.910> complicated

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
exterior work sits so really complicated

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.479 
exterior work sits so really complicated
as<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:37.550> okay<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.930> got<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> block

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
as you can see okay so I got a block

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.540 
as you can see okay so I got a block
regular<00:00:41.750> size<00:00:42.750> block<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.649> guess<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.100> an<00:00:44.219> item

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
regular size block I guess of an item

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.610 
regular size block I guess of an item
that<00:00:44.969> would<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.120> dispensed<00:00:45.649> so<00:00:48.500> well<00:00:49.500> with

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
that would be dispensed so well with

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.319 
that would be dispensed so well with
them<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> top<00:00:50.690> look<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> see<00:00:51.930> TNT<00:00:53.329> another

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
them in the top look you see TNT another

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.450 
them in the top look you see TNT another
piece<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.570> chain<00:00:54.870> T<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.860> multiples<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
piece of chain T to do multiples at a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:05.780 
piece of chain T to do multiples at a
time<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:59.210> got<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> remote<00:01:00.570> again<00:01:04.159> so<00:01:05.159> yeah

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
time and got the remote again so yeah

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.250 
time and got the remote again so yeah
pretty<00:01:06.000> cool<00:01:07.189> this<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.369> pretty<00:01:08.580> much<00:01:09.080> going<00:01:10.080> on

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
pretty cool this is pretty much going on

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:20.710 
pretty cool this is pretty much going on
in<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> inside<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:18.350> battery<00:01:19.350> box<00:01:19.560> motor

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
in the inside so battery box motor

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.050 
in the inside so battery box motor

it's<00:01:24.060> very<00:01:24.840> simple<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.440> just<00:01:25.680> getting

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
it's very simple it's just getting

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.830 
it's very simple it's just getting
everything<00:01:26.370> lined<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.420> such<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> way<00:01:27.810> that

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
everything lined up in such a way that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.370 
everything lined up in such a way that
this<00:01:28.530> would<00:01:28.740> actually<00:01:28.770> work<00:01:29.450> motor<00:01:30.450> spins<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
this would actually work motor spins the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.940 
this would actually work motor spins the
gear<00:01:31.650> spins<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.310> gear<00:01:33.290> which<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.470> connected

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
gear spins this gear which is connected

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.560 
gear spins this gear which is connected
to<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.840> as<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.710> goes<00:01:37.890> around<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
to this this as it goes around with the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.249 
to this this as it goes around with the
gear<00:01:39.960> will<00:01:40.800> go<00:01:40.950> back<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.820> forth<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.900> it<00:01:43.050> pushes

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
gear will go back and forth so it pushes

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.350 
gear will go back and forth so it pushes
one<00:01:43.530> out<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.979> other<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.280> Falls<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:45.150> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
one out the other one Falls because it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.840 
one out the other one Falls because it
goes<00:01:45.479> back<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.130> as<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> gear<00:01:47.490> goes<00:01:47.640> around

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
goes back and as the gear goes around

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.790 
goes back and as the gear goes around
again<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:50.360> pushes<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> next<00:01:51.690> one<00:01:51.780> out<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:52.619> goes

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
again it pushes the next one out it goes

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.370 
again it pushes the next one out it goes
back<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:54.170> pushes<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.619> next<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:57.380> so

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
back and pushes the next out so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
back and pushes the next out so
something<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.220> little<00:01:59.550> simple

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
something a little simple

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.290 
something a little simple
you<00:02:00.660> probably<00:02:00.869> recreate<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.770> felt<00:02:02.640> by<00:02:02.940> having

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
you probably recreate it felt by having

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.910 
you probably recreate it felt by having
