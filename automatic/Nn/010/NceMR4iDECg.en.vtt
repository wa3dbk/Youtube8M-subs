contaminate<00:04:18.799> it<00:04:18.829> because<00:04:19.250> for<00:04:19.489> some<00:04:19.640> reason

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
contaminate it because for some reason

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.510

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
right there so I got rid of it before I

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.810 
right there so I got rid of it before I
even<00:04:26.660> used<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.080> on<00:04:27.170> my<00:04:27.320> nails<00:04:27.530> but<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.370> mix<00:04:28.640> the

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
even used it on my nails but I mix the

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.080 
even used it on my nails but I mix the
colors<00:04:29.210> up<00:04:29.530> just<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.710> see<00:04:30.950> how<00:04:31.640> it<00:04:31.670> would<00:04:32.030> look

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
colors up just to see how it would look

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.730 
colors up just to see how it would look
with<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.690> different<00:04:33.020> colors<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.380> was<00:04:33.500> thinking

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
with the different colors I was thinking

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.830 
with the different colors I was thinking
about<00:04:33.770> using<00:04:34.070> instead<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:34.940> using<00:04:35.180> one<00:04:35.480> base

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
about using instead of using one base

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.610 
about using instead of using one base
color<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.770> actually<00:04:37.370> chose<00:04:37.670> to<00:04:37.910> use<00:04:38.620> four

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
color I actually chose to use four

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.800 
color I actually chose to use four
different<00:04:39.650> colors<00:04:40.340> well<00:04:40.760> no<00:04:40.910> five<00:04:41.330> different

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
different colors well no five different

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.970 
different colors well no five different
colors<00:04:41.960> mixed<00:04:42.650> with<00:04:42.890> a<00:04:44.080> white<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:45.500> then<00:04:45.890> I

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
colors mixed with a white and then I

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.010 
colors mixed with a white and then I
tried<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.280> five<00:04:46.730> different<00:04:47.180> colors<00:04:47.330> mixed

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
tried the five different colors mixed

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.350 
tried the five different colors mixed
with<00:04:48.230> one<00:04:48.560> base<00:04:48.800> color<00:04:49.130> so<00:04:49.910> these<00:04:50.090> are<00:04:50.150> the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
with one base color so these are the

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.330 
with one base color so these are the
results<00:04:50.510> that<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.930> got<00:04:51.080> on<00:04:51.230> my<00:04:51.320> paper<00:04:51.530> play<00:04:51.830> and
