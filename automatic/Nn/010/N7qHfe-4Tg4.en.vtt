00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.250 

I<00:02:15.140> think<00:02:15.770> we've<00:02:15.860> hit<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.010> already<00:02:17.260> whoever

I think we've hit it already whoever
appears<00:02:18.620> here<00:02:18.860> will<00:02:18.980> be<00:02:19.070> timed<00:02:19.310> out<00:02:19.570> so<00:02:20.570> the

appears here will be timed out so the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.110 
appears here will be timed out so the
best<00:02:20.900> thing<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.110> do<00:02:21.320> now<00:02:21.350> send<00:02:21.920> number<00:02:22.700> 11<00:02:23.000> down

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
best thing to do now send number 11 down

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.850 
best thing to do now send number 11 down
the<00:02:23.240> steps<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.780> quite<00:02:24.410> right

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.960
