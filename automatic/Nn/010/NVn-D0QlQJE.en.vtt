I<00:02:00.170> met<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:01.579> captain<00:02:02.060> in<00:02:02.869> San<00:02:03.140> Francisco

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
I met the captain in San Francisco

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.679 
I met the captain in San Francisco
Airport<00:02:03.709> and<00:02:04.189> took<00:02:04.789> some<00:02:04.970> equipment<00:02:05.450> along

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
Airport and took some equipment along

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.620 
Airport and took some equipment along
and<00:02:06.079> we<00:02:06.739> recreated<00:02:07.340> that<00:02:07.610> event<00:02:08.030> with<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
and we recreated that event with the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.050 
and we recreated that event with the
aircraft<00:02:08.959> on<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.259> ground<00:02:09.470> of<00:02:09.679> course<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.940> I

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
aircraft on the ground of course and I

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.870 
aircraft on the ground of course and I
had<00:02:11.269> him<00:02:11.569> sit<00:02:12.019> exactly<00:02:12.410> where<00:02:12.799> he<00:02:12.980> sat<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.549> had

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
had him sit exactly where he sat I had

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.020 
had him sit exactly where he sat I had
him<00:02:14.530> take<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.590> grease<00:02:15.890> pencil<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.579> mark<00:02:16.819> up

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
him take a grease pencil and mark up

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.640 
him take a grease pencil and mark up
some<00:02:17.299> plastic<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.959> we<00:02:18.110> put<00:02:18.380> over<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
some plastic that we put over the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.130 
some plastic that we put over the
windows<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.970> doing<00:02:20.180> all<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.690> we<00:02:21.019> were

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
windows and in doing all that we were

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.470 
windows and in doing all that we were
able<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.500> reconstruct<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.310> flight<00:02:22.579> path<00:02:23.450> of

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
able to reconstruct the flight path of

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.650 
able to reconstruct the flight path of
the<00:02:23.930> object<00:02:24.170> relative<00:02:24.799> to<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.310> airplane<00:02:25.660> now

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
the object relative to the airplane now

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.190 
the object relative to the airplane now
why<00:02:26.900> can<00:02:27.079> we<00:02:27.200> do<00:02:27.349> that<00:02:27.560> because<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.370> autopilot

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
why can we do that because the autopilot

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.710 
why can we do that because the autopilot
was<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.379> at<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.160> times<00:02:31.389> maintaining<00:02:32.389> straight

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
was on at all times maintaining straight

spot in sky I would never not had this
is<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.550> that<00:04:24.789> and<00:04:25.419> they<00:04:25.660> said<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.560> shiniest

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
is that that and they said the shiniest

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.150 
is that that and they said the shiniest
that<00:04:27.340> I've<00:04:27.490> ever<00:04:27.669> seen<00:04:27.910> in<00:04:28.030> my<00:04:28.060> life<00:04:28.979> he<00:04:29.979> made

that I've ever seen in my life he made

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.740 
that I've ever seen in my life he made
another<00:04:30.400> interesting<00:04:30.850> statement<00:04:31.360> which<00:04:31.539> I

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
another interesting statement which I

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.710 
another interesting statement which I
will<00:04:31.990> recount<00:04:32.800> here<00:04:33.160> he<00:04:34.000> said<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.479> when<00:04:34.690> it

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
will recount here he said that when it

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.980 
will recount here he said that when it
first<00:04:35.080> appeared<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:36.669> impressed<00:04:37.270> him<00:04:37.510> as<00:04:37.660> if<00:04:37.810> it

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
first appeared it impressed him as if it

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.520 
first appeared it impressed him as if it
was<00:04:38.169> breaking<00:04:38.800> through<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.280> atmosphere<00:04:40.060> like

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
was breaking through the atmosphere like

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.529 
was breaking through the atmosphere like
splitting<00:04:41.530> Lea<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.190> blue<00:04:42.400> sky<00:04:42.760> open<00:04:43.210> in<00:04:43.360> order

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
splitting Lea the blue sky open in order

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.330 
splitting Lea the blue sky open in order
to<00:04:43.660> emerge<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.860> find<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.220> very

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
to emerge and I find that very

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.090 
to emerge and I find that very
interesting<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.900> raises<00:04:47.350> some<00:04:47.380> very

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
interesting it raises some very

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.540 
interesting it raises some very
interesting<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:48.880> fundamental<00:04:49.120> questions

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
interesting and fundamental questions

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.190 
interesting and fundamental questions
air<00:04:51.550> resistance<00:04:52.380> energy<00:04:53.550> shockwave<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:55.200> so

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
air resistance energy shockwave and so

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.100 
air resistance energy shockwave and so
forth<00:04:56.620> propulsion<00:04:57.600> fundamental<00:04:58.600> questions

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
forth propulsion fundamental questions

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.920 
forth propulsion fundamental questions
that<00:04:59.289> science<00:05:00.220> should<00:05:00.700> take<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.330> look<00:05:01.479> at

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
that science should take a look at

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.520 
that science should take a look at
so<00:05:02.710> in<00:05:03.130> conclusion<00:05:03.460> that's<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.120> great<00:05:04.419> case<00:05:04.720> a

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
so in conclusion that's a great case a

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.230 
so in conclusion that's a great case a
credible<00:05:06.400> witness<00:05:06.780> two<00:05:07.780> witnesses<00:05:07.810> actually

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
credible witness two witnesses actually

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.830 
credible witness two witnesses actually

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
professional pilots up front

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.260 
professional pilots up front
there<00:05:13.500> was<00:05:13.650> no<00:05:13.830> electromagnetic<00:05:14.220> effects<00:05:15.000> the

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
there was no electromagnetic effects the

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.999 
there was no electromagnetic effects the
compasses<00:05:15.750> did<00:05:15.960> not<00:05:16.139> deviate<00:05:16.380> in<00:05:16.830> this<00:05:17.009> case

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
compasses did not deviate in this case
