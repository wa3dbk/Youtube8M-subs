00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
do this correct you'll go to like a

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.940 
do this correct you'll go to like a
screen<00:01:39.850> where<00:01:40.509> when<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.320> get<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:41.770> kind

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
screen where when you get the kind

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.620 
screen where when you get the kind
you'll<00:01:42.130> come<00:01:42.280> out<00:01:42.340> your<00:01:42.579> garbage<00:01:42.729> you've<00:01:43.420> done

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
you'll come out your garbage you've done

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.300 
you'll come out your garbage you've done
this<00:01:43.780> correct<00:01:44.200> now<00:01:44.469> you<00:01:44.530> just<00:01:44.799> drive<00:01:45.039> it<00:01:45.070> into

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
this correct now you just drive it into

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.370 
this correct now you just drive it into
your<00:01:45.520> carriage<00:01:45.909> and<00:01:46.090> that's<00:01:46.780> basically<00:01:47.049> how

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
your carriage and that's basically how

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.160 
your carriage and that's basically how
to<00:01:47.680> get<00:01:48.039> any<00:01:48.310> stolen<00:01:49.000> county<00:01:49.600> coverage<00:01:49.780> and

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
to get any stolen county coverage and

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.590 
to get any stolen county coverage and
it's<00:01:50.770> duplicating<00:01:51.460> because<00:01:51.850> when<00:01:52.420> you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
it's duplicating because when you

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.600 
it's duplicating because when you
actually<00:01:52.869> get<00:01:53.200> your<00:01:53.380> friend's<00:01:53.770> car<00:01:54.039> he

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
actually get your friend's car he

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.789

actually<00:01:54.789> still<00:01:55.240> keeps<00:01:55.689> his<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.619> it's

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
actually still keeps his so it's

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.830 
actually still keeps his so it's
technically<00:01:57.219> a<00:01:57.310> car<00:01:57.549> duplication<00:01:57.729> glitch<00:01:58.299> so

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
technically a car duplication glitch so
