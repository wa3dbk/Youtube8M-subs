00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.189
 these periodic novelty or bookseller shipments 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.710
 this strong by referring to the time of the wrinkles son 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.410
 the broadcasters were dressed with each bookseller 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.700
 a series of threads 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.200

 quantities can then be changed by mutual agreement 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.950
 these new quantities are called priorities 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.520
