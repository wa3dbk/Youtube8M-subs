00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello everyone, Arthur was glad today 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.990
 minecraft pass discount card from 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.120
 dude asked to watch I rate 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.700
 I decided to write down such a shorter scheme 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.610
 came out and so drove greet you 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.449
 hello rule standard plays on 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.070
 peaceful at the easiest to play a few 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.519
 inputs change time okay drove 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 by the way read by the way if someone 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.840
 wants to make a map there and you wanted 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.239
 to know about you you can succeed with 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 my on there for me or how all he doesn't 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.399
 in scrap me these sounds have become a bit 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:48.780
 annoy so we have nothing here 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.980
 interesting hint hint of course 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.559
 we have this tip says a lot 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:02.489
 especially this great arrow 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:05.309
 shows this letter t t t t it to 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.970
 there it is on the accounts of 1 seemingly test 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:23.070
 since they don't call May there sold something 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:25.250
 heard about you vatafak and the price i'm bath in 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.820
 Generally someone if someone needs a future 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.939
 predict then write us in my 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:37.579
 including all sorts of mechanisms so but to us 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:42.320
 Palawan from there and how without parkour 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.320
 how can you do without this parkour 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:52.680
 This is 90 out of 100 cases that will be in the map 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.600
 Parkour is in Valentina's blood in general or 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.680
 I am not a god of course I can I in minecraft 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.230
 general lost 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.030
 so I listened to the news in general to whom 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.050
 who wants to make a card you need for 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.110
 do me something if it's not a scrap and I have it 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.120
 I will pass the tunnel of anti and I will pass I will write 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.530
 I recognize you so what are you guys these 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:19.550
 steel sounds a bit annoying this 4 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.450
 percent the cake itself will know about you if you 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:30.770
 it is necessary but surely look at 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:35.150
 same place this is nonsense by the way 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.730
 Soon there will be a competition 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.989
 seas freebies 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.060
 Of course you I'm just so everyone 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.670
 Fresh for a long time there is shorter than all the branches 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.000
 i will say it no it will not dota 2 it does not 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.400
 2 because now everyone has invites 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.220
 schoolchildren make a draw but although on 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:59.150
 dota feature already someone needs to already have 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:02.000
 every second dude and so like 20 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.459
 antimage the way, if I die, I 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.049
 dudes did not hurt him that I would be him 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:20.420
 case because this parkour is not 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:23.030
 I love so much 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.280
 so heat me back when you showed up 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.769
 idea to write a passage about the game 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.100
 grandfather space she will be so funny 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.410
 it will be possible to poorat this horror force 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.980
 if someone does not know this is such a mess well 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.980
 so horror 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.340
 so there take a look and by the way on this year 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.099
 the game crap the third part says that 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.319
 I did n't like it there but only 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.980
 case with him zalazim because all this 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.849
 goes monotonously don't fly falls it 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.510
 it is necessary to save someone but it is 0 floor 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:02.170
 it's not funny dudes bully potion 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:08.140
 hands so this product will 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:12.390
 and 201 for the second time this set 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:16.799
 annoy so when we shut it off 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.799

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:32.729
 doprygat was decided us to be so 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.610
 We look around to where we will jump up 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.430
 there must be a stop and there the same 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.729
 because we would be firmly michele this 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.729
 ceiling 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.700
