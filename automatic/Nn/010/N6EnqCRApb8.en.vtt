00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
how long it takes okay so now that the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.390 
how long it takes okay so now that the
device<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.200> still<00:02:50.590> going<00:02:50.890> through<00:02:51.010> this

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
device is still going through this

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.910 
device is still going through this
process<00:02:51.610> basically<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:53.470> has<00:02:53.739> been

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850
