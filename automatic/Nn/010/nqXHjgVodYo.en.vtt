of designed the operate system with in

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.069 
of designed the operate system with in
mind<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.430> thought<00:00:44.879> I'd<00:00:44.969> get<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.960> was

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
mind so I thought I'd get this and I was

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.270 
mind so I thought I'd get this and I was
going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.500> from<00:00:46.559> Apple<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> tell

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.569 
or an Apple Magic Trackpad the reason
why<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.590> both<00:00:52.710> cost<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:53.190> 60

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
why is because they both cost about 60
