take these levels to we want to have

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.760 
take these levels to we want to have
living<00:01:09.390> environments<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.590> there's

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
living environments so that there's

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.649

strategically<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> lot<00:01:47.880> different<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.750> you

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
strategically a lot different and you

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.530 
strategically a lot different and you
know<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.040> everything<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.420> know

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
know we want to have everything you know

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.840 
know we want to have everything you know
that<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.170> could<00:01:52.320> possibly<00:01:52.530> desire<00:01:53.009> from<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
that you could possibly desire from a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.819 
that you could possibly desire from a
medieval<00:01:54.270> combat<00:01:54.479> game<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.020> any<00:01:55.560> scenario

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
medieval combat game in any scenario

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.770 
medieval combat game in any scenario
that<00:01:56.189> could<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.460> been<00:01:56.579> even<00:01:57.030> feasibly

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that could have been even feasibly

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.080 
that could have been even feasibly
plausible<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.979> want<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.250> give<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.430> sneak<00:01:59.610> peak

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
plausible we want to give a sneak peak

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.819 
plausible we want to give a sneak peak
of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> village<00:02:00.719> level<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.380> really

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
of the village level this is really

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.370 
of the village level this is really
really<00:02:02.189> early<00:02:02.240> this<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.420> an<00:02:03.630> example<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:04.110> how

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
really early this is an example of how

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.859 
really early this is an example of how
we<00:02:04.439> start<00:02:04.860> off<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> level<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.420> level<00:02:06.750> is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
we start off a level and this level is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.869 
we start off a level and this level is
going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.229> about<00:02:07.350> more<00:02:07.979> indoors<00:02:08.520> you're

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
going to be about more indoors you're

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.490 
going to be about more indoors you're
gonna<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.119> big<00:02:09.270> open<00:02:09.509> spaces<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
gonna have big open spaces like in the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.990 
gonna have big open spaces like in the
barn<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:10.979> saw<00:02:11.220> there

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
barn that you saw there

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.810 
barn that you saw there
and<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.780> know<00:02:12.870> again<00:02:13.530> leading<00:02:14.040> into<00:02:14.520> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
and you know again leading into the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.940 
and you know again leading into the
different<00:02:15.150> attack<00:02:15.450> styles<00:02:15.810> open<00:02:16.200> fields<00:02:16.800> and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
different attack styles open fields and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.830 
different attack styles open fields and
things<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:17.760> archers<00:02:18.390> might<00:02:18.690> be

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
things like that so archers might be

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.330 
things like that so archers might be
more<00:02:19.020> dangerous<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.740> level<00:02:20.040> as<00:02:20.190> an

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
more dangerous in this level as an

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.820 
more dangerous in this level as an
example<00:02:20.960> we're<00:02:21.960> also<00:02:22.080> going<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> we<00:02:22.680> don't

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
example we're also going to we don't

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.990 
example we're also going to we don't
have<00:02:22.890> sneak<00:02:23.190> peeks<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.550> these<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:23.880> we're

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
have sneak peeks of these but we're

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.730 
have sneak peeks of these but we're
going<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.210> different<00:02:24.810> levels<00:02:25.260> on<00:02:25.410> top<00:02:25.620> of

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
going to have different levels on top of

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.250 
going to have different levels on top of
that<00:02:25.830> environment<00:02:26.610> towns<00:02:27.210> moors<00:02:27.930> and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
that environment towns moors and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.650 
that environment towns moors and
tournament<00:02:29.220> levels<00:02:29.550> there's<00:02:30.300> also<00:02:30.480> going<00:02:30.600> to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
tournament levels there's also going to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.300 
tournament levels there's also going to
be<00:02:30.720> weather<00:02:30.930> effects<00:02:31.350> in<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.620> game<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.100> lot

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
be weather effects in the game so a lot

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.790 
be weather effects in the game so a lot
of<00:02:32.400> these<00:02:32.490> levels<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.270> said<00:02:33.330> are<00:02:33.570> going<00:02:33.690> to

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
of these levels like I said are going to

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.620 
of these levels like I said are going to
be<00:02:34.800> added<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.310> significantly<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.330> there<00:02:36.480> might

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
be added to significantly so there might

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.020 
be added to significantly so there might
be<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:37.020> rain<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.500> might<00:02:37.650> have<00:02:37.770> fog<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.850> just

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
be have rain you might have fog it just

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.180 
be have rain you might have fog it just
depends<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.420> what<00:02:39.660> lens<00:02:40.110> best<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.860> level

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
depends on what lens best to the level
