00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
a door to get in and out you know it

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.860 
a door to get in and out you know it
might<00:00:33.760> be<00:00:33.790> a<00:00:33.910> little<00:00:34.059> compromising<00:00:34.660> get<00:00:34.780> in

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
might be a little compromising get in

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.299

now but once you're in there you know

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.220 
now but once you're in there you know
it's<00:00:36.460> plenty<00:00:36.820> of<00:00:36.910> space<00:00:37.149> once<00:00:37.749> we<00:00:37.899> decided

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
it's plenty of space once we decided

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.770 
it's plenty of space once we decided
that<00:00:38.379> it<00:00:38.530> would<00:00:38.589> go<00:00:38.769> on<00:00:38.859> mdx<00:00:39.249> platform<00:00:39.699> it<00:00:39.879> gave

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
that it would go on mdx platform it gave

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.569 
that it would go on mdx platform it gave
a<00:00:41.019> coupe<00:00:41.289> so<00:00:41.589> much<00:00:41.769> capability<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.460> was

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
a coupe so much capability it was

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.069 
a coupe so much capability it was
ridiculous<00:00:43.030> so<00:00:43.210> we<00:00:43.329> still<00:00:43.539> wanted<00:00:43.839> a<00:00:43.929> very

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079

ridiculous so we still wanted a very
coupe<00:00:44.289> like<00:00:44.499> driving<00:00:44.980> position<00:00:45.249> very

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
coupe like driving position very

coupe like driving position very
coupe-like<00:00:45.909> dynamic<00:00:46.629> very<00:00:47.170> sporting<00:00:47.649> feel

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
allowed us to do that the fact that we

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.029 
allowed us to do that the fact that we
still<00:01:49.149> have<00:01:49.329> 5<00:01:49.539> p-3<00:01:49.810> p<00:01:50.320> seating<00:01:50.710> in<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:50.890> back

haunches<00:01:52.810> was<00:01:52.960> something<00:01:53.289> that<00:01:53.409> helped<00:01:53.679> us

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
haunches was something that helped us

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.969 
haunches was something that helped us
really<00:01:54.070> keep<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.880> initial<00:01:55.210> sketches

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
really keep the initial sketches

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.249 
really keep the initial sketches
infiniti<00:01:56.979> FX<00:01:57.549> seemed<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:58.090> picked<00:01:58.840> up<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.079> pretty

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
infiniti FX seemed to picked up a pretty

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.840 
infiniti FX seemed to picked up a pretty
good<00:01:59.350> adoption<00:01:59.950> rate<00:02:00.130> especially<00:02:00.460> in<00:02:00.759> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
good adoption rate especially in the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.569 
good adoption rate especially in the
trendy<00:02:01.090> air<00:02:01.270> parts<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:02.100> urban<00:02:03.100> America

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
trendy air parts of urban America

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.609 
trendy air parts of urban America
driving<00:02:04.420> around<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.749> see<00:02:04.929> you<00:02:05.200> see<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.409> lot<00:02:05.590> of

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
driving around you see you see a lot of

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.859 
driving around you see you see a lot of
those<00:02:05.829> was<00:02:06.219> that<00:02:06.399> partly<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:07.600> know<00:02:07.689> what

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
those was that partly you know what

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.870 
those was that partly you know what
helped<00:02:08.080> influence<00:02:08.800> your<00:02:09.130> decision<00:02:09.520> possibly

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
helped influence your decision possibly

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.570 
helped influence your decision possibly
to<00:02:10.030> go<00:02:10.179> more<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.899> that<00:02:10.959> SUV<00:02:11.530> coupe<00:02:11.800> kind<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.400> a

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
to go more of that SUV coupe kind of a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.570 
to go more of that SUV coupe kind of a
direction

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
direction

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.310 
direction
again<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.420> know<00:02:14.540> we<00:02:14.690> really<00:02:14.930> weren't<00:02:15.050> looking

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
again you know we really weren't looking

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.660 
again you know we really weren't looking
at<00:02:15.410> anything<00:02:15.590> else<00:02:15.860> on<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.040> road<00:02:16.250> certainly

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
at anything else on the road certainly

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.980 
at anything else on the road certainly
when<00:02:16.790> we<00:02:16.880> started<00:02:17.240> this<00:02:17.330> more<00:02:17.660> than<00:02:17.690> four

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
when we started this more than four

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.330 
when we started this more than four
years<00:02:18.140> ago<00:02:18.410> there<00:02:18.590> was<00:02:18.710> really<00:02:18.860> nothing<00:02:19.040> like

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
years ago there was really nothing like

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.160 
years ago there was really nothing like
it<00:02:19.400> except<00:02:19.820> maybe<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.120> FX<00:02:20.540> as<00:02:20.750> far<00:02:20.960> as<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
it except maybe the FX as far as the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.650 
it except maybe the FX as far as the
crossover<00:02:21.770> category<00:02:22.520> or<00:02:22.640> something<00:02:23.030> but

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
crossover category or something but

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.180 
crossover category or something but
again<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.110> fact<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.380> it<00:02:24.500> was<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.620> coupe<00:02:24.890> first

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
again the fact that it was a coupe first

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.650 
again the fact that it was a coupe first
we<00:02:25.490> really<00:02:25.730> didn't<00:02:25.940> feel<00:02:26.060> like<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.210> shared<00:02:26.510> any

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
we really didn't feel like it shared any

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.410 
we really didn't feel like it shared any
SUV<00:02:27.290> connection<00:02:28.250> at<00:02:28.340> all<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:28.640> we<00:02:28.760> didn't<00:02:28.970> you

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
SUV connection at all so we didn't you

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.580 
SUV connection at all so we didn't you
know<00:02:29.510> connected<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.140> car<00:02:30.380> at<00:02:30.470> all

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
know connected to that car at all

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.980 
know connected to that car at all
ourselves<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.850> again<00:02:32.120> once<00:02:32.330> we<00:02:32.510> decided<00:02:32.810> the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
ourselves but again once we decided the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.630 
ourselves but again once we decided the
mdx<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.560> just<00:02:33.740> kind<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:33.950> came<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.280> life<00:02:34.460> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
mdx it just kind of came to life the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.730 
mdx it just kind of came to life the
whole<00:02:34.790> concept<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:35.570> being<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:36.110> coupe<00:02:36.530> with

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
whole concept of it being a coupe with

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.490 
whole concept of it being a coupe with
so<00:02:36.920> much<00:02:37.040> capability<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:38.420> know<00:02:38.570> was<00:02:39.140> what<00:02:39.320> we

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
so much capability you know was what we

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.110 
so much capability you know was what we
just<00:02:39.680> really<00:02:40.010> strove<00:02:40.310> for<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.790> idea<00:02:41.060> that

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
just really strove for and the idea that

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.760 
just really strove for and the idea that
we<00:02:41.270> could<00:02:41.300> capture<00:02:41.600> all<00:02:41.900> those<00:02:42.020> images<00:02:42.380> on

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
we could capture all those images on

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.560 
we could capture all those images on
this<00:02:43.220> vehicle<00:02:43.430> i<00:02:43.700> think<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.000> what<00:02:44.150> drove<00:02:44.360> the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
this vehicle i think is what drove the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.720 
this vehicle i think is what drove the
fact<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:44.870> mdx<00:02:45.320> was<00:02:45.500> chosen<00:02:45.740> you<00:02:46.580> can

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
fact that mdx was chosen you can

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.190 
fact that mdx was chosen you can
obviously<00:02:46.820> see<00:02:47.360> that<00:02:47.600> this<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.960> kind<00:02:48.170> of

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
obviously see that this is kind of

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.170 
obviously see that this is kind of

this<00:03:10.250> takes<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.640> definitely<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.150> next

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
this takes it definitely to the next

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.930 
this takes it definitely to the next
level<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:12.620> idea<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.040> this<00:03:13.430> car<00:03:13.700> really

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
level the idea that this car really

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.420 
level the idea that this car really
wasn't<00:03:14.360> based<00:03:14.510> on<00:03:14.750> an<00:03:14.870> image<00:03:15.260> like<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.560> jet<00:03:16.160> or<00:03:16.400> a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
wasn't based on an image like a jet or a

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.949 
wasn't based on an image like a jet or a
top<00:03:16.670> fuel<00:03:16.940> dragster<00:03:17.420> or<00:03:17.480> something<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:17.900> that

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
top fuel dragster or something like that

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.110 
top fuel dragster or something like that
but<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.260> was<00:03:18.350> more<00:03:18.530> based<00:03:19.040> on<00:03:19.310> emotion<00:03:19.940> and

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
but it was more based on emotion and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.600 
but it was more based on emotion and
passion<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.780> movement<00:03:21.650> was<00:03:22.250> something<00:03:22.580> that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
passion and movement was something that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.729 
passion and movement was something that
we<00:03:22.790> really<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:23.570> know<00:03:23.690> got<00:03:23.900> away<00:03:24.260> from<00:03:24.530> giving

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
we really you know got away from giving

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.140 
we really you know got away from giving
people<00:03:25.100> an<00:03:25.220> image<00:03:25.430> of<00:03:25.519> what<00:03:25.580> it<00:03:25.790> should<00:03:25.820> be<00:03:26.000> and

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
people an image of what it should be and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.030 
people an image of what it should be and
let<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.600> be<00:03:26.959> more<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.260> an<00:03:27.350> expression<00:03:27.800> of<00:03:27.920> their

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
let it be more of an expression of their

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.370 
let it be more of an expression of their
lifestyle<00:03:28.610> again<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.720> movement<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:30.290> the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
lifestyle again the movement and the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.810 
lifestyle again the movement and the
energy<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:30.980> feeling<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.459> this<00:03:31.580> car

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
energy and the feeling of this car

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.280 
energy and the feeling of this car
moving<00:03:32.000> even<00:03:32.300> while<00:03:32.510> standing<00:03:32.780> still<00:03:32.930> is

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
moving even while standing still is

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
moving even while standing still is
something<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:33.620> we<00:03:33.739> really<00:03:33.769> wanted<00:03:34.190> to

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
something that we really wanted to

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.620 
something that we really wanted to
capture<00:03:34.519> and<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.790> think<00:03:34.970> that's<00:03:35.120> new<00:03:35.360> for<00:03:35.390> us

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
capture and I think that's new for us

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.030 
capture and I think that's new for us
and<00:03:35.930> it's<00:03:36.019> definitely<00:03:36.320> transcending<00:03:36.950> into

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
and it's definitely transcending into

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.550 
and it's definitely transcending into
new<00:03:37.310> vehicles<00:03:37.790> from<00:03:37.940> us<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:39.050> next<00:03:39.260> reminds

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
new vehicles from us the next reminds

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.690 
new vehicles from us the next reminds
you<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.709> another<00:03:39.800> question<00:03:40.340> but<00:03:40.370> yeah<00:03:40.610> I<00:03:40.640> think

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
you of another question but yeah I think

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.220 
you of another question but yeah I think
you<00:03:40.880> answered<00:03:41.030> it<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:41.480> wasn't<00:03:41.750> asked<00:03:41.900> if<00:03:42.110> you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
you answered it I wasn't asked if you

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.229 
you answered it I wasn't asked if you
guys<00:03:42.380> had<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.590> animal<00:03:43.310> mascot<00:03:43.760> or<00:03:43.790> anything

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
guys had a animal mascot or anything

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.930 
guys had a animal mascot or anything
like<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:44.420> like<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.840> crouching<00:03:45.230> tiger<00:03:45.940> leaping

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
like that like a crouching tiger leaping

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.600 
like that like a crouching tiger leaping
on<00:03:47.209> ionic<00:03:47.720> cheetah<00:03:47.959> yeah<00:03:48.290> not<00:03:49.100> for<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:49.430> car

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
on ionic cheetah yeah not for this car

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.240 
on ionic cheetah yeah not for this car
actually<00:03:49.820> yeah<00:03:50.750> actually<00:03:51.110> early<00:03:51.560> on<00:03:51.709> the

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
actually yeah actually early on the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.640 
actually yeah actually early on the
images<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.630> know<00:03:53.750> captured<00:03:54.440> us<00:03:54.530> the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
images that you know captured us the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.070 
images that you know captured us the
most<00:03:54.830> was<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.100> slingshot<00:03:55.459> being<00:03:56.390> held<00:03:56.660> back<00:03:56.870> in

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
most was a slingshot being held back in

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.960 
most was a slingshot being held back in
dramatic<00:03:57.530> motion<00:03:57.890> before<00:03:58.280> it's<00:03:58.610> been<00:03:58.760> let<00:03:58.940> go

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
dramatic motion before it's been let go

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.110 
dramatic motion before it's been let go
yeah<00:03:59.450> that's<00:03:59.890> to<00:04:00.890> keep<00:04:01.130> that<00:04:01.370> energy<00:04:01.670> or

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
yeah that's to keep that energy or

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.640 
yeah that's to keep that energy or
something<00:04:02.510> but<00:04:02.660> then<00:04:02.810> also<00:04:02.989> even<00:04:03.440> just

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
something but then also even just

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.080 
something but then also even just
looking<00:04:03.800> at<00:04:04.070> some<00:04:04.220> architecture<00:04:04.880> was<00:04:05.060> a

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
looking at some architecture was a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.610 
looking at some architecture was a
little<00:04:05.330> bit<00:04:05.420> inspiring<00:04:05.810> because<00:04:06.019> it<00:04:06.290> is<00:04:06.410> such

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
little bit inspiring because it is such

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.530 
little bit inspiring because it is such
a<00:04:06.650> static<00:04:07.190> solid<00:04:07.550> object<00:04:07.940> but<00:04:08.120> yet<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.360> still

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
a static solid object but yet it still

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.970 
a static solid object but yet it still
appears<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:09.019> be<00:04:09.140> moving<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.620> know<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.739> lot<00:04:09.950> of

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
appears to be moving you know a lot of

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.289 
appears to be moving you know a lot of
that<00:04:10.100> dynamic<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.700> we<00:04:10.790> wanted<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.030> capture

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
that dynamic that we wanted to capture

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.789 
that dynamic that we wanted to capture
that<00:04:11.480> exhilarating<00:04:12.140> feeling<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:12.590> even

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
that exhilarating feeling that even

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.259 
that exhilarating feeling that even
though<00:04:12.890> it's<00:04:13.040> sitting<00:04:13.340> there<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:14.000> want<00:04:14.180> to

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
though it's sitting there you want to

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.990 
though it's sitting there you want to
get<00:04:14.360> it<00:04:14.450> move<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.989> so<00:04:15.709> again<00:04:16.100> all<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.489> motion

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
get it move it so again all that motion

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.449 
get it move it so again all that motion
based<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.570> know<00:04:17.600> emotion<00:04:18.169> motion<00:04:18.950> the

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
based you know emotion motion the

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.250 
based you know emotion motion the
surfaces<00:04:19.970> all<00:04:20.090> inter<00:04:20.390> communicated<00:04:21.019> you<00:04:21.140> know

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
surfaces all inter communicated you know

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.390 
surfaces all inter communicated you know
we<00:04:21.380> tried<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.709> make<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:21.859> look<00:04:22.039> as<00:04:22.190> if<00:04:22.280> the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
we tried to make it look as if the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.800 
we tried to make it look as if the
wheels<00:04:22.580> are<00:04:22.760> pushing<00:04:23.060> through<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.300> body<00:04:23.510> you

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
wheels are pushing through the body you

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.210 
wheels are pushing through the body you
know<00:04:23.930> instead<00:04:24.350> of<00:04:24.410> just<00:04:24.590> keeping<00:04:24.860> those<00:04:24.979> lines

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
know instead of just keeping those lines

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.750 
know instead of just keeping those lines
super<00:04:25.610> clean<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.090> simple

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
super clean and simple

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.580 
super clean and simple
we<00:04:26.940> have<00:04:27.090> them<00:04:27.300> affecting<00:04:27.780> every<00:04:28.200> other<00:04:28.320> line

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
we have them affecting every other line

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.500 
we have them affecting every other line
you<00:04:29.280> know<00:04:29.370> all<00:04:29.460> those<00:04:29.580> interacting<00:04:30.150> angles

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
you know all those interacting angles

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.790 
you know all those interacting angles
and<00:04:30.660> lines<00:04:30.810> we<00:04:31.020> feel<00:04:31.200> is<00:04:31.350> what<00:04:31.500> gives<00:04:31.590> this

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
and lines we feel is what gives this

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.350 
and lines we feel is what gives this
thing<00:04:32.010> a<00:04:32.070> lot<00:04:32.190> of<00:04:32.310> dynamic<00:04:32.730> appears<00:04:33.180> to<00:04:33.270> have

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
thing a lot of dynamic appears to have

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.870 
thing a lot of dynamic appears to have
quite<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.690> bit<00:04:33.900> lower<00:04:34.770> ride<00:04:35.160> height<00:04:35.190> than<00:04:35.760> an

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
quite a bit lower ride height than an

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.960 
quite a bit lower ride height than an
mdx<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.720> mean<00:04:36.900> was<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:38.040> suspension<00:04:38.580> points

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
mdx I mean was it the suspension points

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.630 
mdx I mean was it the suspension points
were<00:04:39.060> moved<00:04:39.270> up<00:04:39.480> I<00:04:39.780> mean<00:04:39.990> they<00:04:40.080> have<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.290> similar

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
were moved up I mean they have a similar

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.850 
were moved up I mean they have a similar
suspension<00:04:41.640> travel<00:04:41.820> or<00:04:42.380> well<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:43.470> still<00:04:43.680> has<00:04:43.830> a

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
suspension travel or well it still has a

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.740 
suspension travel or well it still has a
lot<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.280> capability<00:04:44.880> of<00:04:44.910> an<00:04:45.090> mdx<00:04:45.450> seeing

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
lot of the capability of an mdx seeing

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.330 
lot of the capability of an mdx seeing
that<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:45.990> is<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.260> same<00:04:46.410> platform<00:04:46.920> you<00:04:47.250> know

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
that it is the same platform you know

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.860 
that it is the same platform you know
certainly<00:04:47.880> ramp<00:04:48.150> angles<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.600> things<00:04:48.750> like

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
certainly ramp angles and things like

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.620 
certainly ramp angles and things like
that<00:04:48.930> are<00:04:49.260> not<00:04:50.220> necessarily<00:04:50.670> compromised<00:04:51.300> but

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
that are not necessarily compromised but

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.350 
that are not necessarily compromised but
we<00:04:52.320> had<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.500> lot<00:04:52.740> of<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:53.130> get<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.490> on-road<00:04:53.940> feel

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
we had a lot of to get the on-road feel

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.850 
we had a lot of to get the on-road feel
you<00:04:54.990> know<00:04:55.110> we<00:04:55.200> were<00:04:55.320> given<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.590> lot<00:04:55.740> of

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
you know we were given a lot of

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.380 
you know we were given a lot of
liberties<00:04:56.100> on<00:04:56.400> how<00:04:56.550> to<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:57.090> know<00:04:57.150> visually

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
liberties on how to you know visually

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.000 
liberties on how to you know visually
make<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.900> car<00:04:58.080> look<00:04:58.110> lower<00:04:58.440> even<00:04:58.650> though<00:04:58.890> we

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
make the car look lower even though we

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.560 
make the car look lower even though we
didn't<00:04:59.250> really<00:04:59.430> change<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.090> chassis<00:05:00.480> at

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
didn't really change the the chassis at

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.780 
didn't really change the the chassis at
all<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:01.350> know<00:05:01.470> we<00:05:01.650> carried<00:05:02.220> over<00:05:02.340> a<00:05:02.460> lot<00:05:02.670> of

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
all you know we carried over a lot of

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.580 
all you know we carried over a lot of
that<00:05:03.000> functioning<00:05:03.690> capability<00:05:04.110> lucky<00:05:04.380> for<00:05:04.560> us

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
that functioning capability lucky for us

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.620 
that functioning capability lucky for us
it's<00:05:04.890> a<00:05:05.040> very<00:05:05.220> dynamic<00:05:05.430> SUV<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.120> we<00:05:06.330> got<00:05:06.480> to

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
it's a very dynamic SUV that we got to

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.270 
it's a very dynamic SUV that we got to
use<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:07.200> know<00:05:07.320> it's<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.590> good<00:05:07.620> platform<00:05:08.010> to

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
use you know it's a good platform to

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.130 
use you know it's a good platform to
base<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.700> off<00:05:08.790> of<00:05:08.850> but<00:05:09.600> yeah<00:05:09.720> there's<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:09.990> lot<00:05:10.110> of

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
base it off of but yeah there's a lot of

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.200 
base it off of but yeah there's a lot of
liberties<00:05:10.470> given<00:05:10.890> here<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.670> make<00:05:11.880> it<00:05:12.030> feel

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
liberties given here to to make it feel

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.910 
liberties given here to to make it feel
more<00:05:12.270> on<00:05:12.600> road<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:13.110> certainly<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.560> hip<00:05:13.680> point

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
more on road and certainly the hip point

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.500 
more on road and certainly the hip point
and<00:05:14.130> everything<00:05:14.460> was<00:05:14.580> kind<00:05:14.700> of<00:05:14.820> moved<00:05:15.000> down<00:05:15.090> so

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
and everything was kind of moved down so

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.480 
and everything was kind of moved down so
it<00:05:15.780> does<00:05:16.020> dramatically<00:05:16.620> separate<00:05:17.250> itself

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
it does dramatically separate itself

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.100 
it does dramatically separate itself
from<00:05:17.580> mdx<00:05:18.030> but<00:05:18.270> there<00:05:18.420> still<00:05:18.570> is<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:18.840> lot<00:05:19.050> of

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
from mdx but there still is a lot of

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.140 
from mdx but there still is a lot of
that<00:05:19.320> same<00:05:19.560> you<00:05:20.100> know<00:05:20.130> capability<00:05:21.060> and

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
that same you know capability and

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:31.629 
that same you know capability and
platform<00:05:21.540> it's<00:05:22.020> not<00:05:22.200> dramatically<00:05:22.740> altered
