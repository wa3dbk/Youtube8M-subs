00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello people, quite a while ago, I didn't 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.919
 just unpacking something 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.349
 yes and in general comes to me a lot 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.650
 unpacking think now take off the review and 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.880
 like this time I don’t have a balcony now 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.410
 cling and something else in general 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.510
 Now it will be unpacking the car 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.539
 why we don't need want to put on 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.140
 one car that's not worth it to the signaling 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.290
 alligator s 500 her keychain broke 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.079
 analog keychain not anal and specifically from 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.690
 This alarm is 1600 on the Internet 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.660
 Offline there if he so much 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.610
 offline I was bought but rummaging 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.649
 Chinese sites I found an alarm to 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.530
 the same with autostart you were without 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.170
 autorun for something like 2000 rubles 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.320
 and in Russian written rashidin 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.949
 Now let's see if this is what 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.100
 open the parcel or rather begin 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.190
 autopsy 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.190

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.320
 all close of course will master the parcel 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:18.360
 someone immediately equal here we see the blue 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.130
 box which is written 2 29 by the way 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.069
 still there must be a lineman 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.789
 immobilizer something do not know put 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:29.420

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.850
 I throw it out 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.700
 the box is written starline earring 9 by 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:44.450

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:50.009
 tsiferki box suffered a little and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.429
 carriage hide we see what we just 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.649

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.329

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.259
 call call on aliexpress 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.319
 open a dispute 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:07.860
 1 keychain pretty 2 keychain very 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:10.229
 like an alligator keychain 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.069
 the river is basically no more accurate 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.299
 similar to scher-khan magicar same 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.940

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.799
 whitefish module 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:35.840
 antenna module book Russian 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.310
 language is possible starline 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.560
 I am such a man even warranty card 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:46.260
 Is the warranty card exactly? 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.959
 user memo alarm 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.230

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:58.380

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:02.790
 skoda cool alarm data already 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:06.030

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.040
 laser level will need to open 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.040
 dispute 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.030
 very long time looking like all the same 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.000
 called in Russian it is books on 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.110
 English then Chinese name 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:28.400
 Belozer’s crawler turns out to be forgotten 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.400
 keepass exactly keepass is called 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.780
 fell for yesterday gray cut his finger 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.830
 now a little uncomfortable to open 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.120
 every kind of box like this 1 general 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:46.260
 this thing is put on the ignition 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:52.110
 inserted inserted here than there has 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:55.860
 in the box again in Russian as 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.810
 set in the alarm module itself 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.709
 I plan to take off sometime on the tag I 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.549
 already put 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:07.170
 force therefore I think there is nothing complicated 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:11.850
 the same here is just all the wires already 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:14.880
 refined meaning no let's say services 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.650
 third parties to use because 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.209
 when I saw how not signalku set 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.209
 official dealers I smell 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:29.650
 so this is a two-way shock sensor 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.050
 scotch chinese so here we have 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:37.680
 here we have connecting wires for 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.680
 antenna hood switch 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:46.599
 what is this train but actually 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:50.169
 cable and connecting wires if 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:52.300
 anyone interested, I think you read 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.849
 instructions before ordering photos and 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.650
 understand why there are wires needed to 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:06.069
 the next stage of its plan to smoke 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:06.729
 disassemble the machine like this 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:12.460
 plastics 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:16.000
 they sentenced in one of the reviews here 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.639
 they are my favorite batteries of soup 36 38 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.229
 truer dinner in this carrier is already 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:25.990
 I will insert this battery right now 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:32.110
 let's see it works in general she blames the experience 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:34.000
 About earned me fun all the same 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.620
 honestly not a field car forget block 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.590
 power what not to connect and watch 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:42.060
 how is she there nuts clicks the signaling 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.060
 everything is fine for now
