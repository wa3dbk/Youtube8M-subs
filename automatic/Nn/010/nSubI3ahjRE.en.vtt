00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.249 
night line that's an amazing amount of
detail<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> ring<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> his<00:01:42.479> tail<00:01:42.689> even<00:01:43.049> has<00:01:43.229> a

detail on a ring and his tail even has a
slight<00:01:43.619> bit<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.799> articulation<00:01:45.890> but<00:01:46.890> um<00:01:47.960> yeah

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
slight bit of articulation but um yeah

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.940 
slight bit of articulation but um yeah
it<00:01:49.049> looks<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.229> they<00:01:49.380> meant<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:49.680> him<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> be

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it looks like they meant for him to be

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.980 
it looks like they meant for him to be
in<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> flying<00:01:50.369> pose<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:51.000> there's<00:01:51.210> no<00:01:51.390> flying

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990

in a flying pose but there's no flying
base<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.799> there's<00:01:53.759> no<00:01:53.939> reason<00:01:54.210> Mara<00:01:54.630> would<00:01:54.840> be

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
superfluous once again the lantern um

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.550

the<00:02:11.489> deputy<00:02:11.879> lanterns<00:02:12.300> did<00:02:12.599> not<00:02:12.810> have

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the deputy lanterns did not have

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.740 
the deputy lanterns did not have
lanterns<00:02:14.489> they<00:02:14.910> were<00:02:14.970> only<00:02:15.120> lanterns<00:02:15.540> for<00:02:15.660> a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
lanterns they were only lanterns for a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.210 
lanterns they were only lanterns for a
short<00:02:15.989> period<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.349> time<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.770> never<00:02:16.860> needed

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
short period of time and never needed

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.040 
short period of time and never needed
them<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.090> guess<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.420> could<00:02:18.480> use<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.810> for<00:02:18.989> a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
them so I guess you could use this for a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.710 
them so I guess you could use this for a
custom<00:02:19.530> figure<00:02:19.800> um<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.640> Mara<00:02:20.880> really<00:02:21.330> can't

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
doula I've slightly hindered full 360 on

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.680 
doula I've slightly hindered full 360 on
this<00:03:53.400> arm<00:03:53.670> this<00:03:53.850> arm<00:03:53.970> they<00:03:54.150> can't<00:03:54.359> because<00:03:54.600> of

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
this arm this arm they can't because of

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.140 
this arm this arm they can't because of
the<00:03:54.750> hair<00:03:55.160> bend<00:03:56.160> at<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.310> elbows<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:57.030> I'm

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
the hair bend at the elbows and I'm

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.420 
the hair bend at the elbows and I'm
unfortunately<00:03:57.510> have<00:03:58.109> no<00:03:58.350> wrist<00:03:58.680> articulation

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
unfortunately have no wrist articulation

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.370 
unfortunately have no wrist articulation
so<00:03:59.609> that<00:03:59.730> kind<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.060> hinder<00:04:00.870> some<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.170> poses

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
so that kind of hinder some of the poses

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.770 
so that kind of hinder some of the poses
you<00:04:01.620> would<00:04:01.739> do<00:04:01.829> with<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.040> staff<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:03.510> legs<00:04:03.690> go

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
you would do with the staff the legs go

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.430 
you would do with the staff the legs go
back<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.030> slightly<00:04:06.030> forward<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:06.720> she<00:04:07.230> bends

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
back and slightly forward and she bends

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.949 
back and slightly forward and she bends
in<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.590> knee<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:08.700> you're<00:04:09.120> sacrificing<00:04:09.359> a<00:04:09.840> lot

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
in the knee so you're sacrificing a lot

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.470 
in the knee so you're sacrificing a lot
of<00:04:10.109> articulation<00:04:10.829> so<00:04:11.760> overall<00:04:11.970> this<00:04:12.090> figure

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
of articulation so overall this figure

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.800 
of articulation so overall this figure
is<00:04:12.630> um<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:13.109> great<00:04:13.980> sculpt<00:04:14.489> absolutely<00:04:15.359> amazing
