00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
competition I think and and of course

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.089 
competition I think and and of course
it's<00:02:29.380> cb4<00:02:30.380> become<00:02:30.739> things<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:33.500> running<00:02:33.890> just

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
it's cb4 become things it's running just

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.370 
it's cb4 become things it's running just
now<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:35.180> yourself<00:02:36.079> you<00:02:36.200> had<00:02:36.349> a

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
now and you yourself you had a

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.130 
now and you yourself you had a
successful<00:02:36.910> successful<00:02:37.910> see<00:02:38.360> before<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.959> so

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
successful successful see before it so

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.660 
successful successful see before it so
far<00:02:39.470> quite<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.010> few<00:02:40.130> wickets<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:42.489> has<00:02:43.489> been

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
far quite a few wickets and has been

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.000 
far quite a few wickets and has been
doing<00:02:43.940> not<00:02:44.120> bad<00:02:44.299> obviously<00:02:44.650> wanted<00:02:45.650> with<00:02:45.739> more

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
doing not bad obviously wanted with more

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.640 
doing not bad obviously wanted with more
as<00:02:46.099> a<00:02:46.130> team<00:02:46.370> but<00:02:47.299> I<00:02:47.810> think<00:02:48.079> we're<00:02:48.530> showing

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
as a team but I think we're showing

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.620 
as a team but I think we're showing
signs<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.310> progression<00:02:49.880> but<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.090> guess<00:02:50.359> they

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
signs of progression but I guess they

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.680 
signs of progression but I guess they
know<00:02:51.579> we're<00:02:52.579> not<00:02:52.609> good<00:02:52.850> said<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.269> even<00:02:53.569> with

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
know we're not good said that even with

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.599 
know we're not good said that even with
all<00:02:53.810> potential<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> guy<00:02:54.920> who<00:02:54.980> played<00:02:55.340> in<00:02:55.519> a
