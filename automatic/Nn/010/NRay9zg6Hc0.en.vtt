00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.770
 hello friends from crazy road barcelona 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.379
 welcome to a new video in which 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.700
 let's talk about this helmet to see you 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.150
 what 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.640
 it's a modular helmet 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.770
 this one in particular has about 6 months of 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.240
 use you already know that we like 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.550
 try the products and not only 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.090
 unpack them and talk about them 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.789
 It has a weight of one thousand five hundred 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.010
 fifty grams which may seem 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.420
 heavy but we have to take into account 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.519
 which is a modular modular two by 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.040
 general rule weigh more with integral 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:42.149
 we could both say that the weight of 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.149
 this helmet is in the middle 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.350
 is to say that we are logado as much as 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.590
 integral as jetta type has the double 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.460
 homologation 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.150
 the simple hitch is typical of 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.150
 strip hook 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.240
 the ventilation of this helmet is one of 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:13.640
 the points to improve in my opinion has 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.870
 these front sockets that are fixed 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.060
 and then up has a little eyelash 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.600
 what it does is open to close these 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.600
 conduits 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.500
 in theory it channels in the air through 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.980
 of the helmet and the ventilated I sincerely 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.980
 do not 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.840
 I do not think so why 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.460
 in winter unless you have the pil 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.460
 doc gets blurred quite easily 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.920
 our street of xavi will be 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.110
 the curious way with the ripple 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.270
 in the middle that matches the part of the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.399
 shell to open opens from the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.399
 half get used 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.540
 and very important it comes with 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.130
 pre-installation of pin with installation 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.200
 of the pin and with the own good the gentlemen 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.460
 helmet manufacturers all would have to 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.460
 come with the series painter 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.800
 to disassemble the visor here we see that 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.930
 have 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.930
 let's just align it 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.600
 has a little arrow here 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.959
 the date of the visor another little arrow in 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.260
 the side of the helmet then you will see 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.470
 aligned and lift this tab and so 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.470
 will be 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.840
 it's very simple you really should use 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.450
 this system 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.270
 besides the conventional visor has 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.040
 A solar visor is operated from here 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.460
 it's a bit tricky up and running sometimes 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.460
 latina 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.220
 and here we found a little complicated 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.220
 but good 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.310
 here is the visor 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.400
 this visor I think it has no 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.070
 anti-fog treatment I do not know but 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.130
 the truth is that it is unlike the 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.140
 conventional visor that takes seeing that 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.210
 you do not get fogged up if you stand in a 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.910
 semaphore has quite easily 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.530
 tarnish I know 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.340
 a point also to improve 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.250
 as for the interior to access it 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.770
 open the helmet to open it 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.530
 you have to lower the visor hand there are some 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.240
 that you already have for example like this 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.180
 you start uploading it and it just goes down 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.180
 you have to download it by pressing this button 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.980
 and the helmet gets up 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.980
 inside 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.680
 a button 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.680
 regrettable 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.890
 to wash easily and has a 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.890
 pre-installation of bluetooth 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.070
 inside we see the gap there 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.070
 the microphone 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.850
 and as for the 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.850
 to the top 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.400
 if we want to circulate with it open 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.919
 which I personally do not recommend 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.430
 but good there is to each one we have this 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.639
 eyelash 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.540
 if we lower it 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.880
 is blocked 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.190
 so that although we have a hole or 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.960
 anything not 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.470
 we are not going to go down sometimes there are some 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.900
 modular helmets that if it 's a bump is 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.820
 a little white and low tap 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.630
 we are not going to put this in the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.630
 position that touches 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.830
 yes 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.830
 the helmet goes down again 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.910
 and nothing in terms of security 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.300
 has five stars on the page 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.730
 shark something to keep in mind and be 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.050
 rest assured that in case of accident 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.820
 that we hope not 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.270
 this helmet will offer us the maximum 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.270
 protection 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.410
 and nothing last the score that you 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.330
 we have given since you think of robots over 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:23.689
 all taking into account its price that is 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.519
 about 150 to 160 euros is 18 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:28.069
 and nothing you already know that if you want to see more
