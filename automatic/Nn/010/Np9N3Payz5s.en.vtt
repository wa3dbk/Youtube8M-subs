00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.219
 urban more with the more cheerful the more 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.560
 dynamic and the collection are in place 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.930
 of the lost objects as one 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.510
 Nothing is a collection like 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.020
 just the brand says we came a long time ago 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.580
 already presenting tristan catwalk is 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.680
 this time you are something unprecedented we have 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.440

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.750
 catwalk a complete collection with all 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.150
 an intention with a designed track and 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.640
 well nothing very happy father that 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.530
 simple acquire this dimension to me 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.270
 loved the color palette how is that 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.659
 decide on that color palette in shades 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.810
 black earth 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.069
 Well look at the truth is that there are two 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.749
 very important factors in our 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.189
 collection one are the materials that there are 

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:13.869
 is where the palette also defines a lot 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.880
 of color that we work with kaltex 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.799
 then we could to their offices 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.749
 we select materials we see what 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.759
 processes we can do teach us 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:24.219
 new products and allow us to go to your 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.289
 factory to experience as processes that 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.969
 we determine a lot the line of color and 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.219
 on the other hand it is the footwear that also 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.349
 We work with blocks and that helps a lot 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.700
 how to combine this this car to 

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:35.560
 Exterior 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.270
 and see that they mention the materials that 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.610
 materials but there are many good 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.370
 trench coats there are denims there are some 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.670
 things in silk 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:48.410
 well there are belts in skins of 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.320
 heavyweight heavyweight trench coats 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.340
 of heavy weight because nothing is in general 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.290
 there are cottons 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.790
 when the cotton fibers and very 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.659
 happy hey how come the change of 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.939
 the box to the catwalk 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.159
 well nation as we saw the box change 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.259
 it is but good now they have returned to 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.549
 to pass then it is a different dynamic the 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.819
 true that the box also has its own 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.860
 I think it has its charm 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.959
 present in that most personal way with 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.970
 the people but the catwalk has this 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.880
 fast thing 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.350
 that helps the product acquire a 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.510
 different dimension and that you see it 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.000
 perfectly lit 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.560
