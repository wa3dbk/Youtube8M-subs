00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.000
 When the sun rises 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.800
 Seeing my chest-there are few things today 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.500
 Ne-cesi-to-mas-Lava, Wood and Cu-e-ro 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.100
 I have two diamonds but three-would be better - That 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.100
 So-start my trip is the best 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.000
 The horizon calls-in mi-ven-ta-na today 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.000
 It's time to go outside and to explore. 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.800
 Although-the long way is-I do not have any more 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.400
 I'll take rhythm, pick and my a-mi-ga e-spa ~ da 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.200
 And to discover how low the cu-e-vas go 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.200
 I work hard but I can not drop the o ~ ro 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.200
 Because the privilege of mining these blocks is mine and only ~ mi ~~ o 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.200
 From the pigs to the trees 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.200
 a ground-bed to sleep 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.200
 My paradise in cubico-es 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.200
 And when I do-click and see 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.200
 A World-made for my 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.200
 A World-made for my 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.300
 A World-made for my 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.100
 Al-gu-nos gol-pes dÃ­ 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 And under the ground na-da vi 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.100
 Rapido Craftee a torch and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 I'm tired of looking for gems that "I think" are 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.200
 Whistles fa-mi-lia-res I felt 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.800
 everything would explode a-qui 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.800
 That leave me a-tur-di-do 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.600
 On the ground, agitated, and still inside 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.100
 So with - medium - heart, A running, travel - can-ce-la-do 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.000
 Take my bucket and then a thousand per hour home 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.800
 Creepers outside and the mobs about but I'm still going 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.500
 Live to dig another day, because this place is mine to rest 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.000
 From the pigs to the trees 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.200
 a ground-bed to sleep 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.000
 My paradise in cubico-es 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.300
 And when I do-click and see

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.000
 A World-made for my

 A World-made for my 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.600
 Traveling a-ve-lo-ci-dad light 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.200
 I swear - that I never so-ra-pi-do was ~ 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.100
 The door closes, at home at last 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.400
 I'm going to the end 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.400
 To what I - in-with-tre 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.800
 In my pe-cho keep it 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.400

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.900
 I will do everything again ---- 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.000
