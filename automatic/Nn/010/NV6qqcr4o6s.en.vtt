00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.390
 the cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondria, however of the three 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.040
 stages in which it is generally divided in the whole process, the first one is 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.080
 in the cytoplasm and is called glycolysis this consists of a series of reactions 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.460
 in which a molecule of glucose 6 carbons is converted into two pyro 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.820
 fact that there are three cambones with consumption of two ATP molecules and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.170
 of four in the second stage the cellular respiration the two molecules 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.840
 are transported to the interior of the mitochondria where they are 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.349
 processes its transformation 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.180
 1 and a7 occurred in killing the third stage in cellular respiration i is the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.089
 citric acid cycle, the credit cycle only takes place in the 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.520
 mitochondria at this stage of the citric acid gradation process in 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.570
 carbon dioxide conformation of the known pinhead and gaia 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.809
 fia bh two electron facilitators releasing two attacks at 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.610
 third stage is complete with phosphorylation the siva city on the wall 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.400
 mitochondria, the electrons transported by the mitochondria know more 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.720
 dhi sharp and h2 are transferred to the final electron colcci genotype 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.040
 which turns into water 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.550
 the energy released in the transfer of the electrons that the one used to pump 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.370
 readily pay more for this proton gradient is used in the synthesis of 34 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.450
 atp molecules 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.720
 afonso or sedative the most energetic stage in cellular respiration 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.230
 besides glucose, the fatty acids can also be used as 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.540
 compounds through a process called bertouci of action 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.680
 the fatty acids are converted into known oil in the air after which 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.790
 follows the normal course of glucose 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.070
 we can then do the energy balance of breathing from 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.100
 an initial glucose molecule the first agricultural step is produced four 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.230
 However, glycolysis is the only step in the 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.000
 respiration in which there is precisely two molecules of energy 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.430
 of atp and by what this consumption of the final balance should be subtracted the cycle 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.040
 the cycle of large products of the molecules of steam that 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.390
 will join the 34 coming from the mouth was the native orsi reaction the balance 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.040
 end of the cellular respiration from an initial molecule of razor beak 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.770
 of 38 atp molecules
