00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
of box contents so here is the G watch

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.970 
of box contents so here is the G watch
our<00:02:38.640> itself<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.810> first<00:02:40.200> impressions<00:02:40.769> it

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
our itself and on first impressions it

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.420 
our itself and on first impressions it
looks<00:02:41.370> really<00:02:42.060> really<00:02:42.750> nice<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.860> we've<00:02:44.220> got

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
looks really really nice so we've got

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.539 
looks really really nice so we've got
these<00:02:44.959> all<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.110> big<00:02:46.440> bezel<00:02:46.950> around<00:02:47.010> here<00:02:47.459> and

these all this big bezel around here and

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.729 
these all this big bezel around here and
I<00:02:47.580> think<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:47.910> how<00:02:48.140> LG<00:02:49.140> have<00:02:49.230> managed<00:02:49.560> to

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
I think this is how LG have managed to

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.800 
I think this is how LG have managed to
create<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.340> circular<00:02:51.030> display<00:02:51.390> they've<00:02:51.569> hidden

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
create a circular display they've hidden

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.440 
create a circular display they've hidden
any<00:02:52.650> screen<00:02:53.069> cables<00:02:53.519> and<00:02:53.640> stuff<00:02:53.730> behind<00:02:54.030> this

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
any screen cables and stuff behind this

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.960 
any screen cables and stuff behind this
bezel<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:55.019> make<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.350> truly<00:02:55.650> circular<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.549> LG

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
bezel to make it truly circular and LG

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.580 
bezel to make it truly circular and LG

watch<00:03:55.530> itself<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:57.389> whole<00:03:57.600> thing<00:03:57.840> weighs<00:03:57.989> in

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
watch itself the whole thing weighs in

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.059 
watch itself the whole thing weighs in
at<00:03:58.230> 62<00:03:58.739> grams<00:03:59.069> so<00:03:59.370> it's<00:03:59.639> heavier<00:04:00.329> than<00:04:01.069> some

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
at 62 grams so it's heavier than some

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.670 
at 62 grams so it's heavier than some
smart<00:04:02.400> watches<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:03.930> might<00:04:04.200> notice<00:04:04.470> the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
smart watches so you might notice the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.199 
smart watches so you might notice the
difference<00:04:05.040> actually<00:04:05.190> on<00:04:05.609> your<00:04:05.850> wrist<00:04:06.060> and

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
difference actually on your wrist and

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.470 
difference actually on your wrist and
it's<00:04:06.660> nine<00:04:06.989> point<00:04:07.440> seven<00:04:07.829> millimeters<00:04:08.639> thick

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
it's nine point seven millimeters thick

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.710 
it's nine point seven millimeters thick
so<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.590> slimmer<00:04:11.010> than<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.280> Moto<00:04:11.519> 360<00:04:12.389> but<00:04:12.630> it

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
so it's slimmer than the Moto 360 but it

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.259 
so it's slimmer than the Moto 360 but it
still<00:04:12.959> looks<00:04:13.170> quite<00:04:13.440> chunky<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:14.850> give<00:04:15.060> you<00:04:15.239> a

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
still looks quite chunky to give you a

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.390 
still looks quite chunky to give you a
comparison<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:16.200> have<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.410> storm<00:04:16.769> watch<00:04:16.950> here<00:04:17.220> and

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
comparison I have a storm watch here and

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.099 
comparison I have a storm watch here and
this<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.549> particularly<00:04:18.269> thin<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.840> don't<00:04:19.019> know

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
this is particularly thin I don't know

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.360 
this is particularly thin I don't know
if<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.260> can<00:04:19.320> get<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.560> perspective<00:04:20.100> of<00:04:20.190> that

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
if you can get the perspective of that

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.060 
if you can get the perspective of that
but<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.150> can<00:04:21.329> see<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:22.500> know<00:04:22.620> just<00:04:22.890> how<00:04:23.039> much

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
but you can see you know just how much

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.430 
but you can see you know just how much
it<00:04:23.460> compares<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.300> traditional<00:04:24.599> watch<00:04:25.200> so

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
it compares to a traditional watch so

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.379 
it compares to a traditional watch so
people<00:04:25.860> will<00:04:26.370> probably<00:04:26.550> think<00:04:26.880> well<00:04:27.120> that's

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
people will probably think well that's

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.610 
people will probably think well that's
a<00:04:27.419> bit<00:04:27.569> chunky<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.199> they<00:04:28.289> might<00:04:28.469> not

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
a bit chunky but they might not

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.850 
a bit chunky but they might not
instantly<00:04:29.129> think<00:04:29.430> it's<00:04:29.699> a<00:04:30.030> smart<00:04:30.539> watch<00:04:30.930> so

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
instantly think it's a smart watch so

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.070 
instantly think it's a smart watch so
let's<00:04:31.889> say<00:04:32.460> get<00:04:32.759> this<00:04:32.969> sort<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.270> set<00:04:33.569> up<00:04:33.599> for

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
let's say get this sort of set up for

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.769 
let's say get this sort of set up for
you<00:04:34.259> so<00:04:34.849> going<00:04:35.849> through<00:04:35.879> the<00:04:36.150> process<00:04:36.330> here<00:04:36.689> we

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:36.779 
you so going through the process here we

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:42.170 
you so going through the process here we
need<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.310> connect<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.490> Android<00:04:39.029> we're<00:04:39.710> here<00:04:41.180> so

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
need to connect to Android we're here so

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.510 
need to connect to Android we're here so
let's<00:04:43.159> go<00:04:44.159> and<00:04:44.520> set<00:04:44.879> that<00:04:44.999> up<00:04:46.159> so<00:04:47.159> we<00:04:47.249> pair<00:04:47.490> a

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
let's go and set that up so we pair a

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.239 
let's go and set that up so we pair a
new<00:04:47.699> wearable<00:04:47.939> so<00:04:48.749> on<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.349> Android<00:04:49.830> wear<00:04:50.009> app

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:50.249 
new wearable so on the Android wear app

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:51.800 
new wearable so on the Android wear app
on<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.729> phone<00:04:50.849> which<00:04:51.029> are<00:04:51.180> downloaded<00:04:51.659> from

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
on the phone which are downloaded from

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.019 
on the phone which are downloaded from
the<00:04:51.870> Play<00:04:52.110> Store<00:04:52.490> accept<00:04:53.490> all<00:04:53.639> of<00:04:53.669> the

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:54.029 
the Play Store accept all of the

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.480 
the Play Store accept all of the
conditions<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.680> it's<00:04:55.830> picking<00:04:56.159> up<00:04:56.249> different

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
conditions so it's picking up different

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.100 
conditions so it's picking up different
devices<00:04:56.999> so<00:04:57.389> I'm<00:04:57.449> going<00:04:57.569> to<00:04:57.629> go<00:04:57.749> with<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.930> G

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
devices so I'm going to go with the G

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.809 
devices so I'm going to go with the G
watch<00:04:58.289> here<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.800> then<00:04:59.340> it's<00:04:59.490> going<00:04:59.669> to

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
watch here and then it's going to

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:06.980 
watch here and then it's going to
connect<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:01.020> let's<00:05:01.529> pair<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:05.840> so<00:05:06.840> this

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
connect to that let's pair it so this

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.899 
connect to that let's pair it so this
can<00:05:07.229> take<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.560> few<00:05:07.800> minutes<00:05:08.219> to<00:05:08.550> actually

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
can take a few minutes to actually

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.179 
can take a few minutes to actually
configure<00:05:09.689> now<00:05:10.680> it's<00:05:10.949> going<00:05:11.039> to<00:05:11.129> be

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:11.189 
configure now it's going to be

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:12.379 
configure now it's going to be
interesting<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.580> see<00:05:11.729> how<00:05:11.759> that<00:05:12.060> bezel

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
interesting to see how that bezel

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:14.450 
interesting to see how that bezel
interacts<00:05:13.050> or<00:05:13.319> works<00:05:13.860> kind<00:05:14.159> of<00:05:14.189> with<00:05:14.340> your

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
interacts or works kind of with your

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.330 
interacts or works kind of with your
finger<00:05:14.759> swiping<00:05:15.150> on<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.300> daily<00:05:15.740> kind<00:05:16.740> of<00:05:16.830> basis

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
finger swiping on a daily kind of basis

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.469 
finger swiping on a daily kind of basis
be<00:05:19.159> denying<00:05:20.159> a<00:05:20.279> pic<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.490> is<00:05:20.759> raised<00:05:21.120> so<00:05:21.419> to

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
be denying a pic that is raised so to

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:22.820 
be denying a pic that is raised so to
get<00:05:21.629> to<00:05:21.689> the<00:05:21.839> screen<00:05:22.110> you<00:05:22.199> do<00:05:22.319> highly<00:05:22.589> have<00:05:22.740> to

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
get to the screen you do highly have to

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.110 
get to the screen you do highly have to
go<00:05:22.919> over<00:05:23.189> that<00:05:23.279> I<00:05:23.339> think<00:05:23.580> you'll<00:05:23.669> get<00:05:23.759> used<00:05:24.000> to

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
go over that I think you'll get used to

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.999 
go over that I think you'll get used to
its<00:05:24.270> not<00:05:24.449> as<00:05:24.539> chunky<00:05:24.810> as<00:05:25.020> I<00:05:25.139> actually<00:05:25.289> imagined

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
its not as chunky as I actually imagined

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.749 
its not as chunky as I actually imagined
it<00:05:26.129> would<00:05:26.310> be<00:05:27.229> but<00:05:28.229> Sir<00:05:28.680> yeah<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:29.550> might<00:05:29.699> be

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
it would be but Sir yeah that might be

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.809 
it would be but Sir yeah that might be
quite<00:05:30.360> interesting<00:05:31.139> that<00:05:31.169> okay<00:05:31.919> so<00:05:31.979> we're<00:05:32.610> now

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819 
quite interesting that okay so we're now

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.779 
quite interesting that okay so we're now
paired<00:05:33.240> with<00:05:33.839> the<00:05:33.870> G<00:05:34.469> watch<00:05:34.650> are<00:05:35.009> now<00:05:35.460> I<00:05:35.490> could

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
paired with the G watch are now I could

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.279 
paired with the G watch are now I could
go<00:05:35.939> through<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.360> Android<00:05:36.839> app<00:05:36.990> but<00:05:37.169> you've

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
go through the Android app but you've

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.019 
go through the Android app but you've
probably<00:05:37.500> seen<00:05:37.800> that<00:05:38.009> before<00:05:38.129> so<00:05:38.729> I'm<00:05:39.000> not

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029 
probably seen that before so I'm not

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:40.909 
probably seen that before so I'm not
going<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:39.389> go<00:05:40.199> through<00:05:40.409> that<00:05:40.500> let's<00:05:40.740> just
