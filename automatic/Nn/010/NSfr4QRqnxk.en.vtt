00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.770
 there was originally a partition 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.930
 separating the kitchen from the living room 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.240
 the customer asked to remove the partition 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.330
 make the type of studio to the kitchen 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:30.029
 combined guests on dismantling the wall 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.880
 It turned out that the builders did 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.610
 attic room with different levels 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.280
 ceiling kitchen and hall 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.100
 different level of ceilings to not 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.559
 redo the entire ceiling design from 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.780
 one room and another what 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.510
 labor intensive and costly and 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.590
 It was suggested to customers than he 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.860
 agreed to make a decorative beam 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.730
 thus, we sort of share a little 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.770
 living room from the kitchen thereby hiding this 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.299
 difference of ceilings visually she eyes 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.799
 does not rush in passing 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:14.400
 inside the beam is made of drywall 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.159
 padded armor corrugated hoses 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.970
 let's say so corrugated through which 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.540
 electric cables are laid 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.680
 go one outlet to the second outlet 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:30.930
 further after painting the ceilings 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.310
 completion of these works was necessary 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:39.000
 fix the lights as it turned out to me 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.860
 before painting the ceiling it turned out that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.619
 lamps have a larger diameter than 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.590
 the existing shelf was originally this 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.470
 here is the surface the floor was not sharp 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.649
 corner how to fix lights 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.399
 initially we just made a regiment later 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.799
 lamps appeared in our hands 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.110
 again it turned out that they are not the size 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.730
 enters 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.490
 out of the situation how 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.060
 artificially made drywall created 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.220
 such here in the corners of the three points in them 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.610
 fix lamps 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.960
 there is always a way out 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.870
 when everything is unreasonable in advance 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:25.760
 by the customer when the fixtures arrive 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.040
 when repairs are already at some stage 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.280
 complete there are always a way out 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.280
 out of position
