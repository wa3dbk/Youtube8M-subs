you<00:00:59.289> can<00:00:59.500> go<00:00:59.890> outside<00:01:00.039> and<00:01:00.250> see<00:01:00.610> your<00:01:00.789> work

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
you can go outside and see your work

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.060 
you can go outside and see your work
it's<00:01:01.449> not<00:01:01.570> just<00:01:01.629> something<00:01:02.559> that<00:01:02.649> you<00:01:02.860> can

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
it's not just something that you can

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.889 
it's not just something that you can
like<00:01:03.699> read<00:01:03.909> in<00:01:04.030> books<00:01:04.239> it's<00:01:04.479> something<00:01:04.780> that

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
like read in books it's something that

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.109 
like read in books it's something that
you<00:01:04.989> see<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.530> it's<00:01:06.039> really<00:01:06.340> interesting<00:01:06.850> so

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
you see and it's really interesting so

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.420 
you see and it's really interesting so
if<00:01:07.420> somebody<00:01:08.170> is<00:01:08.320> interested<00:01:08.560> in<00:01:08.890> coming<00:01:09.220> here

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
if somebody is interested in coming here

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.899 
if somebody is interested in coming here
I'd<00:01:09.789> suggest<00:01:10.299> that<00:01:10.689> they<00:01:11.399> look<00:01:12.399> more<00:01:12.580> into<00:01:12.880> it

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
I'd suggest that they look more into it

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.399 
I'd suggest that they look more into it
and<00:01:13.180> see<00:01:13.330> if<00:01:13.450> they<00:01:13.570> really<00:01:13.750> do<00:01:13.960> want<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.170> do<00:01:14.320> it

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
and see if they really do want to do it

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.910 
and see if they really do want to do it
because<00:01:14.500> it's<00:01:14.770> it's<00:01:15.159> really<00:01:15.430> cool<00:01:15.700> I<00:01:15.909> like<00:01:16.569> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
because it's it's really cool I like it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.260 
because it's it's really cool I like it
something<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.039> think<00:01:18.100> is<00:01:18.369> very<00:01:18.490> special<00:01:18.759> about

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
something I think is very special about

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.730 
something I think is very special about
the<00:01:19.450> students<00:01:19.929> that<00:01:20.050> are<00:01:20.170> drawn<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.590> our

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
the students that are drawn to our

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.090 
the students that are drawn to our
program<00:01:21.280> into<00:01:21.520> your<00:01:21.580> sciences<00:01:22.149> is<00:01:22.330> that<00:01:23.100> they

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
program into your sciences is that they

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.639 
program into your sciences is that they
come<00:01:24.520> here<00:01:24.759> because<00:01:25.030> they're<00:01:25.869> interested<00:01:26.440> in

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
come here because they're interested in

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.219 
come here because they're interested in
the<00:01:26.770> well-being<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:27.310> other<00:01:27.520> people<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.959> they

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
the well-being of other people and they

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.830 
the well-being of other people and they
come<00:01:30.039> and<00:01:30.399> through<00:01:31.000> their<00:01:31.149> studies<00:01:31.420> they

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
come and through their studies they

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.490 
come and through their studies they
learn<00:01:32.200> about<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:33.340> natural<00:01:33.490> world<00:01:33.819> and<00:01:34.500> then

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
learn about the natural world and then

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.279 
learn about the natural world and then
they're<00:01:35.619> always<00:01:35.770> looking<00:01:36.039> for<00:01:36.310> ways<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.569> go

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
they're always looking for ways to go

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.340 
they're always looking for ways to go
out<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.830> improve<00:01:39.399> it<00:01:39.610> or<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:40.149> protect<00:01:40.539> it<00:01:40.780> the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
out and improve it or to protect it the

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.109 
out and improve it or to protect it the
begin<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.649> the<00:01:41.679> semester<00:01:42.190> I<00:01:42.250> actually<00:01:42.700> helped

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
begin of the semester I actually helped

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.609 
begin of the semester I actually helped
build<00:01:43.270> an<00:01:43.450> instrument<00:01:43.899> which<00:01:43.990> is<00:01:44.020> really<00:01:44.409> cool

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
build an instrument which is really cool

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.090 
build an instrument which is really cool
because<00:01:45.280> it<00:01:46.000> took<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.750> lot<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.899> work<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.500> build

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
because it took a lot of work to build

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.029 
because it took a lot of work to build
something<00:01:48.399> that<00:01:48.659> from<00:01:49.659> scratch<00:01:50.020> is<00:01:50.320> really

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
something that from scratch is really

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.950 
something that from scratch is really
interesting<00:01:51.490> right<00:01:52.420> now<00:01:52.479> I'm<00:01:52.780> actually

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
interesting right now I'm actually

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.969 
interesting right now I'm actually
working<00:01:53.380> with<00:01:53.789> aerosols<00:01:54.789> and<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.180> see<00:01:55.539> if<00:01:55.979> what

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
working with aerosols and I see if what

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.499 
working with aerosols and I see if what
what<00:01:57.280> kind<00:01:57.549> of<00:01:57.579> properties<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.119> takes<00:01:58.329> to

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
what kind of properties it takes to

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.840 
what kind of properties it takes to
become<00:01:58.750> cloud<00:01:59.170> droplets<00:01:59.679> whether<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.609> size

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
become cloud droplets whether the size

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.870 
become cloud droplets whether the size
matters<00:02:01.359> are<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.600> supersaturation

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
matters are the supersaturation

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.620 
matters are the supersaturation
that's<00:02:03.880> what<00:02:04.030> I

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
that's what I

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.730 
that's what I
you<00:02:05.630> know<00:02:05.750> it's<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.200> world<00:02:06.380> is<00:02:06.560> their<00:02:06.710> oyster

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
you know it's the world is their oyster

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.609 
you know it's the world is their oyster
here<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.580> in<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.000> Geoscience<00:02:08.630> ISM<00:02:08.960> and<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:09.530> we

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
here and in the Geoscience ISM and so we

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.410 
here and in the Geoscience ISM and so we
have<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> range<00:02:10.070> of<00:02:10.369> options<00:02:10.880> really<00:02:11.240> for

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
have a range of options really for

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.710 
have a range of options really for
students<00:02:11.750> where<00:02:12.190> they<00:02:13.190> can<00:02:13.220> choose<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.330> focus

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
students where they can choose to focus

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.410 
students where they can choose to focus
on<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.050> discipline<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.830> get<00:02:16.100> a<00:02:16.130> degree<00:02:16.420> within

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
on a discipline and get a degree within
