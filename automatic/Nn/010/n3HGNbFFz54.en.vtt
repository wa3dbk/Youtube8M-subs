00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.869
 made for Adam and Eve and everything 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.000
 was in it 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:42.119
 that was almost everything from well 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.740
 god had said of all the trees that you 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.829
 looks in the garden 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.110
 you can only eat from that one tree in it 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.030
 in the middle of the garden 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.820
 may you not hot because that is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.560
 my tree and it thinks so strongly of this 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.840
 that went on all the time 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.810
 breathe well enjoyed it 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.720
 paradise and takes good care of it 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.700
 one day everything changed 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.899
 eva was alone in the middle of that day 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.980
 the garden 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:18.170
 when something crazy happened suddenly hey 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.220
 riga eva heard her name but she saw now 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.920
 no one 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.560
 and they don't recognize the voice either 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.519
 thought she thought but then she dreamed 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.250
 it was again 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.250
 eva committee come closer 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.269
 voice came from the direction of the tree 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:39.560
 from god but living is not possible 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.709
 talk then came even closer heard 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.080
 she went again after this time she saw the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.640
 a snake's voice was along the branches 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.319
 drove from the tree 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.790
 eva said he really is that god 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.569
 said you don't like every tree 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.569
 can eat in the garden 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.349
 eva thought it was strange talking 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.890
 snake but did answer him they are 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.540
 we boast eating all the trees in the garden 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.549
 but the fruits of this tree in it 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.370
 middle of the garden it may 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:13.370
 don't know what god has said there 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.910
 don't even touch it because who does that 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.340
 will definitely die 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.209
 the snake was silent for a moment you said against it 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.150
 eva and yes believe you should take a look 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.180
 how nice that flight looks in the 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.459
 You won't find a better sound throughout the garden 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.980
 you will certainly not die if you do 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.450
 eat it and god knows it all too well 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.160
 good 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.920
 god doesn't want you to do this fruit 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.470
 because he knows that all who eat it 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.500
 just as he himself knows 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.630
 becomes just like god 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.959
 riva looked at the tree and looked at 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.609
 close it so nice house and now so 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.060
 standing near that tree she could also do the 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.950
 sweet smell there are also delicious come here 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.650
 wait no longer and take a bite 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.380
 separate your wheel as much as you want 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.400
 she wants to get started 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.950
 life was god is a warning or 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.330
 forget she could only think 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:15.130
 on that flight and they believed the snake 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.590
 juicy certainly be allowed to decide already 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.760
 good question was that they are a god for it 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.310
 but I should have known better 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.500
 god had made her and for her and 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.290
 Adam a whole paradise are full of 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.690
 made beautiful animal plants and snakes 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.730
 couldn't talk or none 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.260
 made talking snakes so it had to 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.540
 be someone else who doesn't like that snake 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.910
 talk to who 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.010
 it wasn't Adam so it had to be one of them 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.160
 the persons are that god already before he 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.400
 the earth had created 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.760
 what kind of persons are they angels and 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.130
 angels are invisible to us 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.750
 one of those angels had become proud 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.790
 he also wanted to be an irish himself 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.020
 just like god 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.900
 he wants people to like him 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.650
 obey instead of god and it was 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.290
 that angel who does not speak the snake 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.850
 I managed the angel eva for business 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.530
 she kicked such a lie when he told her 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.440
 told that she would become just like god 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.300
 if they were off the flight they would eat 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.420
 believed him and ate 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.770
 and you want to let channels adam you 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.860
 have a look here 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.900
 they were lovely and just showered and laughed 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.610
 forbidden fruit police 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.530
 come you should take a taste too 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.050
 snack 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.280
 and instead of being against eva 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.830
 what have you done now 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.060
 he is not allowed to tackle the flight 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.430
 out of control and then channel 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.220
 they both sat on something they liked 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.100
 knew that not let loose and from which 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.110
 god he said to stay off 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.090
 also what god said there would be a punishment 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.880
 if it did 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.620
 he said they would die 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.510
 but it did not help 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.970
 Adam and Eve decided to be obedient 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.169
 his and god and lost my beautiful one there 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.440
 home 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:08.100
 that beautiful garden paradise they were not 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.320
 longer god created god are you thinking 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.970
 that goes better without me and like you 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.639
 be able to decide for yourself what is the best 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.389
 for you that is fine but then too 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.389
 really without me 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.169
 they were set out and out of the garden 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.690
 grew out everything already on the trees and in 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.430
 not just taking everything 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.050
 outside the garden they had to work hard 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.210
 my food 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.979
 and worse they started to die and 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.720
 grow older 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.180
 what does breathe life not to 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.310
 listen god 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.200
 and so we see that lying and taking 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.440
 of things that are not yours 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.830
 something terrible is lying and stealing 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.419
 both something that god hates very much 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.910
 I still continue to breathe 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:53.070
 outside of paradise and what about now 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.370
 with god 's original plan that the 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:58.680
 would live forever and happily is that 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.630
 opportunity now for everyone misjudged 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.160
 it was not fair we are 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.820
 we ca n't help it 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.160
