let me focus we do got the sleep sleep
like<00:02:31.890> power<00:02:32.220> button<00:02:33.800> thing<00:02:34.800> it's<00:02:34.980> not<00:02:35.160> really

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
like power button thing it's not really

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.050 
like power button thing it's not really
it's<00:02:35.580> not<00:02:35.670> hard<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.060> push<00:02:36.240> at<00:02:36.420> all<00:02:37.760> at<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.850> top

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
it's not hard to push at all at the top

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.810 
it's not hard to push at all at the top
I<00:02:40.460> think<00:02:41.460> this<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> IR<00:02:42.300> blaster<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.820> right

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
I think this is the IR blaster and right

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.460 
I think this is the IR blaster and right
here<00:02:45.030> we<00:02:45.180> got<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.450> microphone<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.230> think

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
here we got the microphone I think

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.320 
here we got the microphone I think
that's<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.770> microphone<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.970> headphone

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
that's the microphone and the headphone

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.600 
that's the microphone and the headphone
port<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:49.860> harder<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.100> put<00:02:50.250> back<00:02:50.400> in

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
port it's a little harder to put back in

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.060 
port it's a little harder to put back in
because<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.120> always<00:02:51.270> gets<00:02:51.540> caught<00:02:52.070> another

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
because it always gets caught another

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.950 
because it always gets caught another
big<00:02:53.190> deal

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.330 

focus<00:02:59.660> focus

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
focus focus

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.640 
focus focus
no<00:03:02.340> focus<00:03:02.730> your<00:03:02.850> stupid<00:03:03.150> camera

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.860 

timing<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.519> InFocus<00:03:09.269> here<00:03:09.599> we<00:03:09.720> got<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
timing of this InFocus here we got the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.440 
timing of this InFocus here we got the
volume<00:03:10.290> rocker<00:03:10.500> on<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:11.849> bottom<00:03:12.150> we<00:03:12.269> got<00:03:12.420> a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
volume rocker on the bottom we got a

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.960 
volume rocker on the bottom we got a
cutout<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.140> think<00:03:13.349> this<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.680> mic<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:13.950> two<00:03:14.730> mics

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
cutout I think this is a mic to two mics

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.880 
cutout I think this is a mic to two mics
I'm<00:03:15.299> pretty<00:03:15.540> sure<00:03:15.750> I'm<00:03:15.959> not<00:03:15.989> really<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.829> sure

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
I'm pretty sure I'm not really that sure

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.059 
I'm pretty sure I'm not really that sure
but<00:03:17.610> we<00:03:17.670> got<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.879> cover<00:03:18.060> for<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:19.069> charging

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
but we got the cover for the charging

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.250 
but we got the cover for the charging
port<00:03:21.079> not<00:03:22.079> hard<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.530> put<00:03:22.650> back<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:24.480> stuff<00:03:24.780> you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
port not hard to put back and stuff you

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.780 
port not hard to put back and stuff you
just<00:03:25.439> put<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.400> there

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
just put it in there

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.819 
just put it in there
dig<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.299> got<00:03:27.659> it<00:03:27.840> um<00:03:33.140> second<00:03:34.140> this<00:03:34.530> camera

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
dig in got it um second this camera

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.949 
dig in got it um second this camera
doesn't<00:03:35.129> know<00:03:35.310> like<00:03:35.489> focus<00:03:35.879> does<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.209> but

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
doesn't know like focus does it but

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.360 
doesn't know like focus does it but
overall<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:38.159> really<00:03:38.519> nice<00:03:38.670> fuel<00:03:38.970> of<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.599> case

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
overall it's really nice fuel of a case

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.149 
overall it's really nice fuel of a case
you<00:03:41.370> can<00:03:41.519> access<00:03:41.819> everything<00:03:42.950> you<00:03:43.950> have<00:03:44.069> to

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
you can access everything you have to

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.470 
you can access everything you have to
cut<00:03:44.310> out<00:03:44.430> for<00:03:46.459> that<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.639> nothing<00:03:48.000> that's<00:03:48.180> just

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
cut out for that is nothing that's just

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.360 
cut out for that is nothing that's just
something<00:03:48.659> under<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.079> camera<00:03:49.319> that's<00:03:50.069> just

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
something under the camera that's just

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.069 
something under the camera that's just
like<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.700> sensor<00:03:51.180> only<00:03:51.599> cameras<00:03:52.230> can<00:03:52.349> pick<00:03:52.500> up

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
like a sensor only cameras can pick up

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.140 
like a sensor only cameras can pick up
and<00:03:55.079> then<00:03:55.200> we<00:03:55.349> got<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:56.780> front-facing<00:03:57.780> camera

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
and then we got the front-facing camera

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.910 
and then we got the front-facing camera
