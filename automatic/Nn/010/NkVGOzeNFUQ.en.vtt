00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:11.170 
landing you got a test them first that's
the<00:01:58.270> reason<00:01:58.479> I'm<00:01:58.570> asking<00:02:01.649> ya

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.569 

okay<00:02:11.720> that's<00:02:11.959> that's<00:02:12.950> half<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.250> second<00:02:14.000> cool

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
okay that's that's half a second cool

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:27.789 
okay that's that's half a second cool
yeah<00:02:16.579> I<00:02:16.610> guess<00:02:16.939> while<00:02:17.689> you're<00:02:17.810> out<00:02:26.560> keep<00:02:27.560> some

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
yeah I guess while you're out keep some

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.240 
yeah I guess while you're out keep some
speed<00:02:28.069> up<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:30.680> looks<00:02:31.010> really<00:02:31.989> yeah<00:02:33.220> give<00:02:34.220> it

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
speed up it looks really yeah give it

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.630 
speed up it looks really yeah give it
some<00:02:34.459> throttle<00:02:34.579> before<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.120> do<00:02:35.239> anything

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
some throttle before you do anything

how<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.760> stalls<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.269> if<00:02:59.360> you're<00:02:59.480> gonna

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
how it stalls it if you're gonna

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
practice see what it does stall and get

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.300 
practice see what it does stall and get
away<00:03:01.790> up<00:03:02.030> there<00:03:02.209> first<00:03:02.769> which<00:03:03.769> wouldn't<00:03:04.190> be<00:03:04.250> a

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
away up there first which wouldn't be a

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:32.350 
away up there first which wouldn't be a
bad<00:03:04.459> idea<00:03:04.610> actually<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:30.620> want<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:31.150> stall<00:03:32.150> it

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
bad idea actually you want to stall it

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:41.319 
bad idea actually you want to stall it
while<00:03:32.510> it's<00:03:32.630> way<00:03:32.750> up<00:03:32.870> there<00:03:33.140> now<00:03:40.209> are<00:03:41.209> you

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
while it's way up there now are you

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:53.410 
while it's way up there now are you
gonna<00:03:41.450> land<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.870> direction

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.020 

yeah<00:03:55.069> you<00:03:56.069> could<00:03:56.250> make<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.430> lot<00:03:56.790> longer

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030

approach from the other way if you're
comfortable<00:03:58.830> that<00:03:59.220> way<00:04:04.490> and<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.819> rollout

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
comfortable that way and the rollout

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.840 
comfortable that way and the rollout
going<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.750> other<00:04:06.780> way<00:04:06.990> is<00:04:07.410> forever<00:04:08.220> even<00:04:08.819> if

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
going the other way is forever even if

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:47.409 
going the other way is forever even if
you<00:04:08.970> have<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.120> go<00:04:09.209> onto<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.480> road<00:04:13.610> yeah

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419
