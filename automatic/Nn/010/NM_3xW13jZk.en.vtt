aspire 5810 TZ this thing's from the
timeline<00:00:20.779> series<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.900> notebooks<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:23.039> you

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
timeline series of notebooks and if you

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.990 
timeline series of notebooks and if you
don't<00:00:23.279> know<00:00:23.340> why<00:00:23.460> they<00:00:23.609> caught<00:00:23.820> that's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
don't know why they caught that's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.670 
don't know why they caught that's
because<00:00:24.240> they<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> most<00:00:24.750> ridiculous

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
because they have the most ridiculous

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.220 
because they have the most ridiculous
batteries<00:00:26.580> these<00:00:26.730> things<00:00:26.910> go<00:00:27.060> forever<00:00:27.359> now

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
batteries these things go forever now

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.550 
batteries these things go forever now
they're<00:00:28.380> not<00:00:28.529> super<00:00:28.859> powerful<00:00:29.490> processors

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
they're not super powerful processors

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.900 
they're not super powerful processors
but<00:00:31.560> they<00:00:31.890> do<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> job<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:32.610> they're

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
but they do get the job then they're

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.639 
but they do get the job then they're
great<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.300> internet<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:33.989> presentations<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
great for internet for presentations and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.840 
great for internet for presentations and
stuff<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.950> what's<00:00:35.370> really<00:00:35.670> good<00:00:35.820> about

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
stuff like that what's really good about

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.639 
stuff like that what's really good about
them<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:36.930> if<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.200> don't<00:00:37.290> need<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.590> that

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
them is that if you don't need all that

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.799 
them is that if you don't need all that
extra<00:00:37.710> horsepower<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.579> far<00:00:38.760> CPU<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.329> concerned

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
extra horsepower as far CPU is concerned

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
extra horsepower as far CPU is concerned
you're<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> save<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.800> ton<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.129> battery

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you're going to save a ton of battery

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.280 
you're going to save a ton of battery
life<00:00:41.730> by<00:00:42.239> using<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.690> these<00:00:42.809> ultra<00:00:43.170> low

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
life by using one of these ultra low

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.479 
life by using one of these ultra low
voltage<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.800> actually<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> pentium

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
voltage this is actually a pentium

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.940 
voltage this is actually a pentium
processor<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.450> called<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.690> su<00:00:46.079> 4100<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
processor it's called the su 4100 and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.040 
processor it's called the su 4100 and
it's<00:00:47.460> basically<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.270> one<00:00:48.750> point<00:00:48.899> three

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it's basically a one point three

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.619 
it's basically a one point three
gigahertz<00:00:49.640> ultra<00:00:50.640> low<00:00:50.760> voltage<00:00:50.820> single<00:00:51.449> core

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
gigahertz ultra low voltage single core

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.000 
gigahertz ultra low voltage single core
but<00:00:51.870> what's<00:00:52.140> really<00:00:52.260> good<00:00:52.469> about<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
but what's really good about that is it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.590 
but what's really good about that is it
only<00:00:53.190> takes<00:00:53.399> 10<00:00:53.699> watts<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.180> run<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.480> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
only takes 10 watts to run it and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
only takes 10 watts to run it and
combine<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> six<00:00:56.129> cell<00:00:56.309> battery

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
combine it with the six cell battery

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.900 
combine it with the six cell battery
that's<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:56.940> which<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.149> actually<00:00:57.800> 5800

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
that's in here which is actually 5800

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.310 
that's in here which is actually 5800
milliampere<00:00:59.910> our<00:01:00.180> battery<00:01:00.780> it's<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.260> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
milliampere our battery it's going to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.779 
milliampere our battery it's going to
give<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.469> about<00:01:01.590> eight<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> half<00:01:02.219> hours<00:01:02.550> of
