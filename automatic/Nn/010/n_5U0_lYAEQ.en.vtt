00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.140

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.830
 and it is a 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.990
 nothing divine to these cures that says well 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.390
 mushroom llonga went to the beach in 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.390
 house or who cried mushrooms 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.189
 here in aquila here is the time to create a 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.979
 video dedicated to some characters of 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.340
 the fifth season there is if it goes crazy 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.920
 or better not stable as always I never 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.840
 he just sent a video so he 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.539
 I asked if they were a dedicated doctor 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.369
 to this pony on facebook and go yes 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.990
 he liked the idea 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.850
 well I do not blame them since it has a 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.759
 huge resemblance to all laya and then 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.310
 he also likes obama but that what 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.869
 have to see the best let's start with your 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.970
 starlight name yes yes that same if the 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.709
 same pattern of name as current and 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.049
 sunset that is to say it comes from the 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.630
 previous generations as well as their 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.970
 perfect meaning as well as session 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.610
 money apro recycling names and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.290
 futuremark characters is 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.290
 good just watch well 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.630
 as explained in the episode you want 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.510
 take over as explained in the episode 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.820
 you want to take over all the primar 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.470
 that is possible with a calculation that 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.930
 rather I think they were inspired by the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.450
 spear of longinos wants to have both 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.580
 as much and as much power in their helmets as 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.180
 them possible and nothing will prevent 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.959
 fulfill your work 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.959
 hold 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.360
 to wang 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.060
 also presents the first song of 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.280
 the new season and I must say no 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.849
 I liked the song but with a little 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.670
 of rhythm improvements and a lot of magic of 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:09.799
 the friendship is all possible and the weird is 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.799
 that now I can not stop listening to her 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.670
 Y 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.640
 two 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.640
 two 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.500
 this scene 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.340
 Its style and design are among the best 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.470
 I've seen and it's the truth and everything else 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.200
 ask if you look for your version of 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.320
 equestrian years and the fans could not 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.250
 give you a lot more glamor since I'm 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.590
 speaking as darling the talent that 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.020
 has with magic is amazing can 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.060
 smash rocks in a second uses 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.560
 very good long telekinesis 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.720
 away like the 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.000
 teleportation that according to her 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.200
 he studied many years as such for 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.030
 perfecting the king more and more 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.030
 as sunset silver truth and others 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.300
 everything I live 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.100
 I take advantage of this small space without 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.840
 meaning to save a minute of 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.840
 silence for the cat supporting 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.270
 it's being rumored that the lady is 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.670
 so it may reappear at the end of this 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.530
 season and of course I did not stay with 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.720
 his arms crossed and he was running to 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.370
 ask the first male and what do you think? 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.380
 will cross what do you think about the beginning 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.380
 about starlight gamer 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:29.450
 when I first had a terrorist 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.550
 but they say I can see the end 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.480
 but 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.530
 it seems pretty good to me 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.510
 I have a joke because starlight want 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.440
 quiet and marc because he does not care 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.440
 life puts you to 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.380
 very well I think a lot of communism for 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.780
 winona tell me down here what do you think 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.540
 be tear and you would like it to come back 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.050
 at the end of this fifth season but 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.050
 course 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.700
 If you want it to be the weather come back 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.830
 in this fifth season and another yellow 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.180
 queen by the pink and so she appeared in 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:48.580
 our bronze invasion 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.580
 that you do not believe me then look 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.650
