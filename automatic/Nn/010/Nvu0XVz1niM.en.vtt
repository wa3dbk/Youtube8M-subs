00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.800
 vehicle is already a double 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.289
 radio mounts the lg with janna 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.289
 ex factory has an input for one 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.609
 rear view camera which unfortunately not 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.650
 is unlocked 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.630
 on the last visit to a dacia 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.149
 I have this dealer over the dealer 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.090
 enable usb interface 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:45.120
 The whole did not last five minutes 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:55.410
 material we need the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:01:00.649
 rear view camera and an adapter cable the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.649
 camera to connect to the median 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:21.290
 After watching the exact camera position 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 must have set the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.430
 Interior trim of the boot lid 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.930
 and this one is with two top 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.930
 I first fix them 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.930
 remove 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.360
 After that, I'll just pull the disguise 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:00.899
 down from the handle of the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.659
 trunk lid is with six screws 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.030
 attached after she felt words 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.140
 you can just reach the back 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.140
 pull away 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.870
 next are the holes for the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:33.580
 Camera attachment and the cables 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:38.550
 Execution drilled after assembly of the 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.550
 camera, the handle is mounted again 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:57.730
 and the cable through the tailgate so 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:00.910
 under the framework by the committee below 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.150
 the roof sky to the right side of the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.990
 trunk on the right 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.970
 trunk door past behind the 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.710
 lining up under the front 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:19.540
 back seat from under the carpet 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:26.440
 through the center console until after 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:28.870
 at the front to the media relocated around the radio 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.470
 We use as an aid to expand 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.150
 a wooden stick so we the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.550
 do not confirm cladding 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:44.560
 We push the stick under the 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:49.000
 disguise and dissolve slowly 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.070
 Back away , all the claws are released 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.570
 to have 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:58.690
 then we draw the cladding, and 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.810
 remove the two plugs in the bottom 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.810
 Area 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.170
 with the help of a screwdriver 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.640
 we have the four mounting screws of the 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:21.030
 we can radically turn it out afterwards 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:25.710
 Pull out of the bay now fit 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.730
 we have the adapter for our purpose to the 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.450
 unneeded parts for 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:39.510
 power supply and the speakers 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:46.680
 I remove and connect the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:49.140
 severed cable with each other 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.050
 this picture you see the from behind 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.860
 seen right way connection socket of the 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.540
 median afx I need those here 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.540
 marked connection pence 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:13.289
 For this purpose, I have a cinch 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:19.800
 coupling for the camera signal and a 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:22.639
 banana clutch for the reinsurer 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.639
 Dokter cable 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:37.379
 the matching counterpart needed to that 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.169
 with forward led cable to 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:43.219
 voltage supply and different 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.219
 camera cable 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.990
 Now the adapter needs only 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:57.260
 interposed and the massacre 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.260
 to be attached to the radio housing 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:40.770

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.610

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.000
 connected 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:49.650
 For this we are expanding the candlesticks and 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.850
 connect the cable with violet white on 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.850
 Plug the return 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.300

 I have my rear view camera like that 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.720
 I aligned with that 

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:47.070
