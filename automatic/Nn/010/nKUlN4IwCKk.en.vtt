video I was shopping the other day at my
local<00:00:33.160> Kmart<00:00:33.519> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:35.230> found<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.809> it's<00:00:37.809> by

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
local Kmart and I found this it's by

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
local Kmart and I found this it's by
Libby's<00:00:38.500> and<00:00:39.460> it's<00:00:39.700> country<00:00:40.210> sausage<00:00:40.690> gravy

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
Libby's and it's country sausage gravy

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.970 
Libby's and it's country sausage gravy
now<00:00:42.700> it<00:00:43.030> was<00:00:43.180> only<00:00:43.300> $1<00:00:43.660> which<00:00:44.500> was<00:00:44.710> a<00:00:44.739> pretty

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
now it was only $1 which was a pretty

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.240 
now it was only $1 which was a pretty
good<00:00:45.129> price<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:46.770> here's<00:00:47.770> what<00:00:47.980> we've<00:00:48.129> been

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
good price and here's what we've been

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.979 
good price and here's what we've been
thinking<00:00:48.730> we<00:00:48.850> have<00:00:49.000> a<00:00:49.030> lot<00:00:49.210> of<00:00:49.239> Bisquick<00:00:49.750> and

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
thinking we have a lot of Bisquick and

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.200 
thinking we have a lot of Bisquick and
pancake<00:00:50.890> mixes<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.399> stuff<00:00:51.640> on<00:00:51.789> the<00:00:51.879> shelf<00:00:52.149> so

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
pancake mixes and stuff on the shelf so

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.090 
pancake mixes and stuff on the shelf so
we're<00:00:52.450> always<00:00:52.539> looking<00:00:52.780> at<00:00:53.050> ways<00:00:53.289> to<00:00:53.320> use<00:00:53.829> that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
we're always looking at ways to use that

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.479 
we're always looking at ways to use that
up<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:57.280> is<00:00:57.579> a<00:00:58.020> decent<00:00:59.020> way<00:00:59.170> also<00:00:59.980> there

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
up and this is a decent way also there

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.270 
up and this is a decent way also there
is<00:01:00.640> some<00:01:00.969> actual<00:01:01.570> meat<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.410> in<00:01:02.710> this<00:01:02.980> product

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
is some actual meat and in this product

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
is some actual meat and in this product
so<00:01:03.609> you<00:01:03.760> can't<00:01:04.000> have<00:01:04.180> some<00:01:04.360> protein<00:01:04.720> as<00:01:04.930> well

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
so you can't have some protein as well

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.240 
so you can't have some protein as well
stores<00:01:06.250> really<00:01:06.549> well<00:01:06.909> when<00:01:07.810> we<00:01:08.070> actually<00:01:09.070> put

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
stores really well when we actually put

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.830 
stores really well when we actually put
it<00:01:09.340> on<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.549> shelf<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:09.909> bought<00:01:10.090> about<00:01:10.330> 8<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.689> 10

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
it on the shelf and bought about 8 to 10

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.640 
it on the shelf and bought about 8 to 10
cans<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:11.619> and<00:01:12.960> tastes<00:01:13.960> pretty<00:01:14.049> good<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.470> I'm

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650
