again this is Mike her stats of flowing
here<00:00:37.950> Mike<00:00:38.400> well<00:00:38.880> these<00:00:39.060> are<00:00:39.240> two<00:00:39.300> arrows

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
here Mike well these are two arrows

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.870 
here Mike well these are two arrows
straighteners<00:00:40.470> where<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> shaft<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
straighteners where the shaft of the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.140 
straighteners where the shaft of the
arrow<00:00:42.060> gets<00:00:42.330> straightened<00:00:43.170> by<00:00:43.350> these<00:00:43.500> tools

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
arrow gets straightened by these tools

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.430 
arrow gets straightened by these tools
and<00:00:45.150> with<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.390> Native<00:00:45.690> Americans<00:00:46.080> used<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.320> do

and with the Native Americans used to do

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.710 
and with the Native Americans used to do
is<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:46.560> used<00:00:46.830> to<00:00:47.010> heat<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.610> arrow<00:00:47.790> the

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
is they used to heat up the arrow the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.170 
is they used to heat up the arrow the
shaft<00:00:48.990> and<00:00:49.470> then<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:50.220> it<00:00:50.310> against<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.880> piece

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
shaft and then put it against this piece

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.760 
shaft and then put it against this piece
right<00:00:51.330> here<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.810> can<00:00:51.870> flex<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.410> arrows

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
right here and you can flex the arrows

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.010 
right here and you can flex the arrows
to<00:00:52.950> become<00:00:53.190> straight<00:00:53.600> there's<00:00:54.600> two<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.900> them

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
to become straight there's two of them

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.690 
to become straight there's two of them
here<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.440> these<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:55.830> good<00:00:56.070> examples<00:00:56.100> where

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.819 
but what makes them separate is the size
of<00:02:17.069> which<00:02:17.340> each<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.790> them<00:02:17.910> get<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:19.560> bloom
