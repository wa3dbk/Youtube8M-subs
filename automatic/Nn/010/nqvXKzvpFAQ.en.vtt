 I used to write a lot, but if you use it during a mountain climb, 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 Hers increased risk of distress, so do the people who live fish structure is 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 I see. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.170
 There are a lot of people with almost 50% of the figures. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.800
 Ah, even the people in March may smell of alcohol . 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.759
 It's a serious problem right now. 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.660
 I do not know what kind of danger is drinking alcohol during mountain climbing. 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.590
 For those of you, I have now explained in detail about the dangers. 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.160
 I'll do it. 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:25.080

 4 But I did not grow angry jean line to go right next to me 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:42.710
 Oh, yes. So that's the risk of an accident. 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:47.479
 Yes, and now when it comes to alcohol again, alcohol is our body. 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.469
 So I chuuk being stretched and relaxed again expands the blood vessels 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.590
 It is. 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:56.030
 The blood circulation rate is 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.630
 Jigetjyo've done a little more normal rate normal, because if not so down 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.140
 In order to keep pace eventually you have to raise your blood pressure doegoyo 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:08.030
 Another would be the next cardiac cycle is more severe for raising blood pressure 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:12.380
 Yes, but the heart is already exhausted from the back mountain. 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.930
 Besides suffering from alcohol put up to the air-core resources even another bunch 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.549

 Uh gyesijyo such people whiskey again to prevent the trend in winter 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.630
 Attending bring a little air now 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.530
 There is one person who is cold when it is one , 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.609
 no 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.840
 If you take a drink , the standard effect is obviously a bit of an experience. 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:50.989
 4 But after that the outside that behind the problems that result five further body temperature 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.109
 It's the Ring that's going to cause the drop . 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.290
 Let me give you an example . Yes. I have a bonfire. 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:01.790
 The bonfire is out, but if you look at almost alcohol, 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.989
 The bonfire come and wait would be spread or spread to four alcoholic Key Trends 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.160
 How I came to fall 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.849
 5 Thanksgiving is the question of what happens in our bodies. 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.870
 It is. 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.519
 We temporarily increased the number of seats, but as a result, we 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.079
 I'll drop you. 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:22.579
 It is very cold when men can drink when they drink a lot of alcohol . 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:27.500
 Maybe you've experienced it. Then things like that happened. 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:31.849
 And like me, I quickly feel like I'm filling up what people are feeling artistic. 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.630
 He's a really dangerous act that you should never do. 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:40.090
 Also, drinking can have a detrimental effect on the liver. 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.190
 The number of words, that is, when alcohol enters our body, our body is surprised 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.669
 It is not foreign to our good buy 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:51.079
 So our body will not break it down quickly 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:53.280
 There is no choice but to power four pitches the way to the top of the decomposition of alcohol 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.820
 What is your organ? 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.660
 Yes. Yes. Go to liver forgery. 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.640
 I usually get to know how much I'm going to get alcohol , 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.310
 It's not the organ that's coming. 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:12.870
 Oh weak, I am happy because I came the need that was not normal times for example, 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.270
 So, you know what I'm trying to detoxify . 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.840
 I have more work to do than work. 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:23.700
 I mean, uh, I told you all the time. 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.080
 The glucose carbohydrates that we use and remain can store our body's gonadal storage 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.340
 Because there is no way 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:34.650
 For which side in good form, browse wells changing market store right 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:38.910
 By replacing carbohydrates with fat , 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:42.960
 Teach middle of the night so the fact that they are the most directly 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.450
 Carbohydrate changes to fat and energy again today 4 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.650
 The role I created so I can use it 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.320
 It is simple, and I have also made several enzymes, 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.880
 I'm doing things that help me work. 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.110
 When the chair disassembly alcohol deogu ever iteusijyo the need for alcohol-degrading enzymes 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.600
 I did not. 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:08.220
 But we do not have any other enzymes in our bodies 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:10.050
 Yes , yes, so when you break down alcohol, 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.860
 It's free . 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:18.840
 Yes, but some scholars say this again. 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:22.169
 2 years old The amount of enzyme that someone can use for a lifetime is limited 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:26.400
 4 So after you have finished using the enzyme, 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:30.780
 Hers is a problem in the way health're being so precious that the Lake 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:35.820
 I went to the cell kkaeseo professor came to bring the film to break down alcohol writes 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.660
 The professor is out soon, and the Suong River can get worse sooner. 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.950
 I will. 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:44.700
 Well I went this example, you're asleep drunk joins Dai 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:48.660
 When I was younger, I had a lot of strength, so I was drinking a lot, 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:52.830
 A lyase enzyme is now healthy doeseo later wrote that use of our free 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.740
 I'm talking about what's going to be a problem and I can not drink anymore 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:59.810
 It is. 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:06.110
 Oh, I've heard it, so this drink can not be good for our body. 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:07.580
 But I drink a cup of teachers hiking the perfect accompaniment so after this also 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.080
 Can not I 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:16.400
 There are not any good things to drink a lot of Haasanju 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:19.819
 So why do not you have a lot of heart exhausted during climbing. 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.750
 When I get to Hassan, I know the heart. 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:25.310
 This guy is doing arrows right now. Oh, he's had a lot of trouble all day . 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:30.050
 I need a break in front of you. 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:34.099
 The change in heart choya ever break stage I'm surprised it contains alcohol 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:37.819
 Because Mari is contracted, raise blood pressure again and digest blood well 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:42.080
 Would work hard in order to jump, so easy of heart jumped again 

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:46.550
 We wake up and we get to work hard and we have to overdo the heart. 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:52.039
 So it's cold, you should not eat too much. 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:55.759
 Through our mountain climbing, we are able to clean our bodies and clean them with sweat. 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:57.259
 Uh Please enter fresh water, clean air coming down mandeuleotne alcohol is 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:01.460
 We inject drugs 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:06.199
 There is no good for health. No, no, no. 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:11.659
 There are a lot of people who can come out like this, 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:16.190
 Hasineunde hard climbing this week would have to think that may be 

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:19.310
 Such people are the lead body or doejyo God who's it going, and I was just naohsin 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:23.479
 This is a problem because you have a lot of HaShan. 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.830
 And if you look at some of them, 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:28.940
 To untie 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:34.190
 Hot steam room is a lot of work should not go low 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:38.240
 That's not good either . Why is that? The alcohol's expanding blood vessels. 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:42.289
 But if you go to a hot spot, the blood vessels expand. 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.490
 So the more the heart because it reminds the crowd go yet never good 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:46.400
 no 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:50.300
 I heard your teacher's story so well. 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.469
 Drinking during climbing can increase safety accidents and harm your health 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:56.330
 I have it. 

00:07:51.469 --> 00:08:07.540
 Of hiking drinking baralkkeyo bosigil think well of you once again
