00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:03.880
 Sir 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.880
 HH 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 Everything used to be clear 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.649
 get the boat 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.649
 that's why 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.579
 what this future would look like 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.579
 from the second to numbers 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.419
 well-known simply the next step 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.419
 the parents always have a direct hit 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.610
 look like a car 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.150
 the parents have to 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.130
 and details there were no laws 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.130
 as the written still undefeated 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.700
 their scope for playing with shapes and constructions times great 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.360
 OK, high or low 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.490
 a good reason 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.440
 thereby rise 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.740
 or swinging 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.950
 whether for six people 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 found for it 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.330
 or just for one 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.930
 whether for the race 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.940
 Budapest travel 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.940
 allowed and what to add to the designer 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.080
 while many merchants return t-mobile the cost of something 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.960
 destroyed 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.730
 that still no account 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.210
 because with the rapidly growing number of motor vehicles also took the question 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.210
 for the right vehicle too 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.800
 for the increasingly difficult conditions 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.020
 under which the automobile of the present to do its work 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.930
 but you can be the future or something 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:10.779
 Stieger takes over Stieger can become a reality 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.440
 is before and after the race 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.749
 Fantasy and creativity in demand 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:18.749
 just like 100 years ago 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:28.870
 again nobody knows what it will look like 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.870
 the automobile in 20 or 30 years 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.629
 What we do know is that there is never more abundance of raw materials changes 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:37.559
 give 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.219
 that the need for safety and a healthy environment continue to increase 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:46.489
 that the automobile must contribute to solving this world spanning problem 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.019
 one of which is energy consumption 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.259
 which car 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.259
 OMV is fast 5 economical at the same time 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.539
 two 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.259
 Schwandorf 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.259
 after all, this result is not a law 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.649
 minimizes air resistance 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:16.389
 slightly reduced consumption 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.359
 who knows in the channel 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.359
 a custom of little energy 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.359
 in the so-called filmmaking also the second and how 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.719
 the online shop is the second of two 1 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:47.299
 Optimization of the computer in relation to desired properties 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:57.269
 unfavorable pressure distribution 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.689
 costs of stability 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.689
 excessive turbulence means increased consumption 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.400
 Here is the sum of all examinations brings a convincing result 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.650
 But that's the idea of ​​such a vehicle is convincing 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.129
 how does he feel here? 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.439
 how sure is 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.469
 until the 7th 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.099
 to be the and distances 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.099
 to ensure the highest possible reliability 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.029
 which seating position is the safest 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.819
 in an impact from the side 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.449
 also the getting in and out of Rene White sitting must be examined 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.639
 However, the real meet 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.419
 then the room layout 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.779
 the number of places 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.980
 the flexible the offer 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.980
 Christel Tychsen 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.430
 many more questions have to be answered 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.460
 that the overall size is traffic-appropriate 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.020
 how is the driving behavior this time were represented here 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:46.509
 and how is it with the city traffic 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:50.089
 Brussels AFP in the 2 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:54.109
 the idea of ​​a public transport network is not new 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.800
 and never thought through 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:16.839
 but do not find 

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:19.830
 environmentally friendly 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.119
 to back up 

00:07:21.119 --> 00:07:24.119
 and simply too expensive, of course, should Fischer 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:33.240
 but is that even possible? 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.240
 a whole car in half a day 

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:41.089
 At least it is not a dream 

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:44.479
 but a product of concrete thinking about the future 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:48.800
 one of many Daimler Benz research and development 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.300
 and in this case the UBS 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.529
 at least for depth
