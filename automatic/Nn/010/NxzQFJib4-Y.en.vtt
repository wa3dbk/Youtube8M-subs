00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
just at a pressed forward and then I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.280 
just at a pressed forward and then I
kept<00:01:05.880> chasing<00:01:06.060> him<00:01:06.330> cuz<00:01:06.479> he<00:01:06.540> got<00:01:06.689> back<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
kept chasing him cuz he got back up and

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
kept chasing him cuz he got back up and
if<00:01:07.860> somebody's<00:01:08.280> running<00:01:08.580> away<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.270> just

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
if somebody's running away you can just

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
if somebody's running away you can just
run<00:01:10.439> your<00:01:10.470> car<00:01:10.740> out<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.890> them<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.310> hit<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
run your car out to them and hit the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.390 
run your car out to them and hit the
brake<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.090> they'll<00:01:12.240> jump<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:12.810> into<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> rock

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
brake and they'll jump out into the rock

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.800 
brake and they'll jump out into the rock
so<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.610> kept<00:01:14.850> toying<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.180> him<00:01:15.390> for<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> few

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
so I just kept toying with him for a few

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.070 
so I just kept toying with him for a few
minutes<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.390> ended<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.509> trying<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.869> chase

people<00:01:19.259> around<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.070> them<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.430> run<00:01:20.729> into

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
people around and get them to run into

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.719 
people around and get them to run into
random<00:01:21.509> things<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.869> record<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.729> honestly

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
random things and record it and honestly

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399

trouble
I've<00:01:27.900> got<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.290> no<00:01:28.590> windows<00:01:28.920> left<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
I've got like no windows left in this

car<00:01:29.579> reason<00:01:30.360> road<00:01:31.520> chasing<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.610> guy<00:01:32.850> over

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
car reason road chasing this guy over

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.080 
car reason road chasing this guy over
here<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.479> through<00:01:34.290> some<00:01:34.470> luck<00:01:34.680> he<00:01:35.490> does<00:01:36.060> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
here and through some luck he does a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330 
here and through some luck he does a
front<00:01:36.420> flip<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> figured<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.950> I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
front flip but then I figured that I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.690 
front flip but then I figured that I
could<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:39.409> motorcyclists<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.470> fly<00:01:40.920> into<00:01:41.490> my

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
could get motorcyclists to fly into my

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.370 
could get motorcyclists to fly into my
car<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> convertible<00:01:42.899> new

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
car so I just get a convertible new

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.480 
car so I just get a convertible new
