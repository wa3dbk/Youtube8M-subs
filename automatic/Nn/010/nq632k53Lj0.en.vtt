00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.639
 perform backups in a way 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.639
 Periodic of the entire hard drive 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:10.639
 very important 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:19.529
 always do two here we have 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.279
 backup copies once we have 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.849
 all the files stored in a 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:31.880
 external device we can go 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:35.610
 removing some of the pc to release 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.820
 space in said pc in the case that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.570
 see things start to go wrong 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.260
 we can restore the system or where 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.039
 everything worked correctly always 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.829
 turn our system off as it should be 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.519
 giving the order to turn off our pc 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.390
 always in this way all 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:04.790
 files programs are saved from a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.300
 correct way in the location that you 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:12.540
 corresponds to each program remember that 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.650
 the process of closing the system there 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.570
 times it takes a few seconds 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.600
 you have to always have a lot of patience 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.250
 I know many people who never turn off 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.760
 the pc 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.890
 It is always good to at least turn off the PC 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.420
 once a week 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.000
 you wonder why good always 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.960
 important to reboot the system and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.920
 optimize ram memory and gain oxygen 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.220
 imagine that the pc does not turn off and 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.040
 will be hung the only way is 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.510
 pushing the switch and wait for 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:02.010
 turn off never try to turn on the pc 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.890
 if at least it has not spent 30 seconds 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.479
 Once we gave the order of 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.630
 turn off the same wait at most 30 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.330
 seconds to turn it on again and 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.480
 remember something very important realizes 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.500
 a weekly scan to the whole pc in 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.200
 Search for possible spyware Trojans virus 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.060
 and endless 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.250
 remember to always eliminate the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.540
 temporary internet files and 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.630
 all the pc uninstall applications that 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.520
 no longer going to use this is important 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:44.280
 so that the pc does not go slow or go away 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.640
 slowing down or going hanging 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.450
 allow other people to use the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.480
 same pc that you have and we clarify this 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.570
 not being an account other than the one you 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.880
 you have on the pc we would make an account 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.900
 for that person and never the same 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.180
 mind that we have our pc 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.120
 disconnect devices that you do not use 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.730
 remember that many people leave many 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.150
 connected devices since these 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.330
 devices spend resources and oxygen to 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.170
 the pc even if you do not see it are 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.880
 Spending resources and oxygen to our PC 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.010
 and finally finally turn on the cpu 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.300
 before the monitor and well I hope 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.580
 that this video 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.010
