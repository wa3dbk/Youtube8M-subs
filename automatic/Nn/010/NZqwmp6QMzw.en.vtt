while your iPhone is in a case obviously

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.390 
while your iPhone is in a case obviously
it's<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.229> depend<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> case<00:01:41.040> but

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
it's going to depend on the case but

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280 
it's going to depend on the case but
Apple<00:01:41.790> cases<00:01:42.150> are<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.630> totally<00:01:43.079> fine

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
Apple cases are going to be totally fine

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.319 
Apple cases are going to be totally fine
with<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.619> dock<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.159> relatively<00:01:44.970> thin

with this dock and relatively thin

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.749 
with this dock and relatively thin
third-party<00:01:46.140> cases<00:01:46.590> will<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.280> fine<00:01:47.520> as

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
third-party cases will be just fine as

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.789 
third-party cases will be just fine as
well<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> does<00:01:49.140> look<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.320> it's<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.770> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
well now it does look like it's going to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.429 
well now it does look like it's going to
be<00:01:50.009> easy<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.579> possibly<00:01:51.270> break<00:01:51.570> or<00:01:51.750> bend<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
be easy to possibly break or bend the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.050 
be easy to possibly break or bend the
Lightning<00:01:52.829> port<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.369> since<00:01:53.640> there's<00:01:53.850> really

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
Lightning port here since there's really

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
Lightning port here since there's really
not<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.360> lot<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.570> support<00:01:55.049> at<00:01:55.200> all<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.920> hold<00:01:56.100> up

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
not a lot of support at all to hold up

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.770 
not a lot of support at all to hold up
your<00:01:56.369> device<00:01:56.610> besides<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> Lightning<00:01:57.630> port

your device besides the Lightning port

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.899 
your device besides the Lightning port
itself<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.009> actually<00:01:59.369> pretty<00:01:59.579> strong

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
itself but it's actually pretty strong

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.280 
itself but it's actually pretty strong
it<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.149> doesn't<00:02:00.600> feel<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:00.869> it's<00:02:01.079> going

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
it really doesn't feel like it's going

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.289 
it really doesn't feel like it's going
to<00:02:01.409> break<00:02:01.710> at<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:02.219> unless<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.820> seriously

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
to break at all unless you seriously

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.690 
to break at all unless you seriously
apply<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.110> lot<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.409> downward<00:02:04.799> pressure<00:02:04.860> when

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
apply a lot of downward pressure when

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.730 
apply a lot of downward pressure when
you<00:02:05.820> plug<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.090> your<00:02:06.329> iPhone<00:02:06.420> some<00:02:07.350> critiques

would<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.940> in

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
would be that I would like to have it in

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.660 
would be that I would like to have it in
black<00:02:09.300> or<00:02:09.599> Space<00:02:10.020> Gray<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> match<00:02:10.770> my<00:02:10.979> desk<00:02:11.250> or

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
black or Space Gray to match my desk or

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.309 
black or Space Gray to match my desk or

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
even my Space Gray iPhone but

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.780 
even my Space Gray iPhone but
let's<00:02:13.439> be<00:02:13.530> honest<00:02:13.829> that's<00:02:14.249> never<00:02:14.459> going<00:02:14.670> to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
let's be honest that's never going to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.940 
let's be honest that's never going to
happen<00:02:14.879> I<00:02:15.390> also<00:02:15.870> like<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.260> weight<00:02:16.409> of<00:02:16.439> it<00:02:16.680> but

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
happen I also like the weight of it but

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.860 
happen I also like the weight of it but
you<00:02:17.099> know<00:02:17.219> I<00:02:17.249> wished<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.639> was<00:02:17.760> heavier<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.719> that

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
you know I wished it was heavier so that

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.479 
you know I wished it was heavier so that
I<00:02:18.900> wouldn't<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.499> use<00:02:19.530> two<00:02:19.920> hands<00:02:20.219> to

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
I wouldn't have to use two hands to

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.030 
I wouldn't have to use two hands to
remove<00:02:20.760> my<00:02:20.879> device<00:02:21.180> from<00:02:21.719> the<00:02:21.780> dock<00:02:22.139> so<00:02:22.829> not

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
remove my device from the dock so not

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.770 
remove my device from the dock so not
terribly<00:02:23.340> major<00:02:23.730> issues<00:02:24.209> but<00:02:24.599> worth

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
terribly major issues but worth

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.780 
terribly major issues but worth
mentioning<00:02:25.319> but<00:02:25.920> here's<00:02:26.189> the<00:02:26.340> gist<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.670> it

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
mentioning but here's the gist of it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.390 
mentioning but here's the gist of it
it's<00:02:26.999> sleek<00:02:27.329> it's<00:02:27.599> simple<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.620> official<00:02:29.219> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it's sleek it's simple it's official and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.490 
it's sleek it's simple it's official and
it<00:02:29.730> cost<00:02:29.909> 40<00:02:30.209> dollars<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.079> reason<00:02:31.379> you

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
it cost 40 dollars and the reason you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.709 
it cost 40 dollars and the reason you
can<00:02:31.650> justify<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.129> price<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.670> mostly<00:02:33.450> for

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
can justify the price is mostly for

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.629 
can justify the price is mostly for
aesthetic<00:02:34.170> purposes<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.859> mean<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.489> simple

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
aesthetic purposes I mean it's simple

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.099 
aesthetic purposes I mean it's simple
just<00:02:36.060> like<00:02:36.090> your<00:02:36.299> iPhone<00:02:36.629> and<00:02:36.810> all<00:02:36.900> your<00:02:37.019> other

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:37.109 
just like your iPhone and all your other

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.959 
just like your iPhone and all your other
Apple<00:02:37.500> products<00:02:37.859> and<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:38.730> worth

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
Apple products and that is worth

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.759 
Apple products and that is worth
something<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.719> will<00:02:40.079> say<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.500> there<00:02:40.620> are

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
something I will say that there are

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.559 
something I will say that there are
third-party<00:02:41.099> Doc's<00:02:41.669> that<00:02:41.849> do<00:02:42.090> cost<00:02:42.359> a

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
third-party Doc's that do cost a

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.420 
third-party Doc's that do cost a
fraction<00:02:42.629> of<00:02:43.169> the<00:02:43.260> price<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.980> maybe<00:02:44.159> shop

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
fraction of the price so maybe shop

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.949 
fraction of the price so maybe shop
around<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.849> see<00:02:44.999> if<00:02:45.120> one<00:02:45.269> looks<00:02:45.480> good<00:02:45.719> to<00:02:45.810> you

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
around to see if one looks good to you

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.959

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
