know from watching my saving money on
electric<00:00:24.359> video<00:00:24.689> if<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.320> did<00:00:27.140> I'd<00:00:28.140> already

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
electric video if you did I'd already

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.849 
electric video if you did I'd already
been<00:00:28.650> looking<00:00:29.010> into<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> had<00:00:30.859> already

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
been looking into that so I had already

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.100 
been looking into that so I had already
been<00:00:32.309> kind<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.820> studying<00:00:33.210> up<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.450> solar<00:00:33.809> power

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
been kind of studying up on solar power

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.400 
been kind of studying up on solar power
and<00:00:34.649> what<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.410> was

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and what you can do with it so this was

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.920 
and what you can do with it so this was
one<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.620> my<00:00:37.800> practical<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.420> ideas<00:00:39.540> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
one of my practical one of my ideas that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.420 
one of my practical one of my ideas that
I<00:00:40.020> thought<00:00:40.230> might<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.440> actual<00:00:41.040> practical

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
I thought might be actual practical

you the inside of the building and as

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.580 
you the inside of the building and as
you<00:00:58.140> walk<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:59.840> if<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.989> notice<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.410> still

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you walk in if you notice it's still

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.560 
you walk in if you notice it's still
kind<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.829> bright<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.430> that's<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.699> we

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
kind of bright in here that's because we

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.870 
kind of bright in here that's because we
got<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:06.140> full<00:01:07.140> window<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> door<00:01:08.070> but

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
got this full window in the door but

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.250 
got this full window in the door but
still<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.150> wanted<00:01:09.479> power<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.200> I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
still I wanted power out here so I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.060 
still I wanted power out here so I
bought<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.680> renergie<00:01:13.950> 100<00:01:14.610> watt<00:01:15.470> 12<00:01:16.470> volt<00:01:16.680> kit

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.890 

and<00:01:20.070> as<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.369> see<00:01:20.430> there's<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.600> comes

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
and as you can see there's the it comes

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.340 
and as you can see there's the it comes
with<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:23.990> PWM<00:01:24.990> 30<00:01:25.439> amp<00:01:25.680> charge<00:01:26.040> controller

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
with a PWM 30 amp charge controller

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.410 
with a PWM 30 amp charge controller
which<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> pulse<00:01:29.130> width<00:01:29.400> modulation<00:01:30.060> it's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
which is a pulse width modulation it's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
which is a pulse width modulation it's
not<00:01:30.600> an<00:01:30.810> MPPT<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:33.560> it's<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.799> quite<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.250> step

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
not an MPPT or it's not quite the step

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.359 
not an MPPT or it's not quite the step
up<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.850> an<00:01:35.939> MPPT<00:01:36.829> but<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.060> one<00:01:39.060> panel<00:01:40.369> going

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
up to an MPPT but this one panel going

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.249 
up to an MPPT but this one panel going
through<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.700> one<00:01:42.000> charge<00:01:42.299> controller<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.920 

then<00:01:46.259> i've

salvaged two old batteries from massage
really<00:01:52.420> have<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.690> work<00:01:52.870> it<00:01:53.290> had<00:01:53.410> been<00:01:53.560> run<00:01:53.800> dry

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
really have to work it had been run dry

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.710 
really have to work it had been run dry
I<00:01:54.390> ran<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.420> D<00:01:55.660> so<00:01:55.870> fader<00:01:56.170> on<00:01:56.290> for<00:01:57.360> five<00:01:58.360> or<00:01:58.540> six

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
I ran a D so fader on for five or six

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.850 
I ran a D so fader on for five or six
weeks<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.200> got<00:01:59.290> them<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.500> where<00:01:59.530> they<00:01:59.740> would

weeks and got them to where they would

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.680 
weeks and got them to where they would
hold<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.100> charge<00:02:00.280> they're<00:02:00.640> not<00:02:00.850> like<00:02:01.120> new<00:02:01.390> but

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
hold a charge they're not like new but

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.590 
hold a charge they're not like new but
for<00:02:02.260> what<00:02:02.410> for<00:02:03.370> all<00:02:03.430> intents<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:03.940> purposes<00:02:04.030> of

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
what I'm using it for working great so

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.560 
what I'm using it for working great so
far<00:02:07.720> they've<00:02:08.490> they<00:02:09.490> stayed<00:02:09.759> topped<00:02:10.030> off<00:02:10.240> every

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
far they've they stayed topped off every

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.410 
far they've they stayed topped off every
day<00:02:10.720> with<00:02:10.929> this<00:02:11.080> renergie<00:02:11.470> kit<00:02:12.120> but<00:02:13.120> what<00:02:13.300> I'm

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
day with this renergie kit but what I'm

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.450 
day with this renergie kit but what I'm
actually<00:02:13.570> room<00:02:13.930> with<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.320> I<00:02:14.530> know<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:15.040> haven't

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
actually room with it I know I haven't

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.220 
actually room with it I know I haven't
got<00:02:15.550> all<00:02:15.580> this<00:02:15.910> stuff<00:02:16.150> used<00:02:16.450> yet<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:17.050> just

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
got all this stuff used yet this is just

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.920 
got all this stuff used yet this is just
a<00:02:17.320> temporary<00:02:17.710> setup<00:02:18.100> because<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:19.000> thinks<00:02:19.780> work

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
a temporary setup because it thinks work

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.680 
a temporary setup because it thinks work
out<00:02:20.140> I'd<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.620> go<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.740> lot<00:02:20.980> bigger<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.660> I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
out I'd like to go a lot bigger so I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.650 
out I'd like to go a lot bigger so I
went<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:24.150> Amazon<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.800> bought<00:02:27.010> me<00:02:27.390> ten<00:02:28.390> to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
went on Amazon and I bought me ten to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.690 
went on Amazon and I bought me ten to
thirty<00:02:28.930> volt<00:02:29.230> DC<00:02:29.700> LED<00:02:30.700> lights<00:02:32.490> there's<00:02:33.490> three

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
thirty volt DC LED lights there's three

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.550 
thirty volt DC LED lights there's three
fixtures<00:02:34.209> in<00:02:34.390> here<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:34.810> just<00:02:35.200> used<00:02:36.240> two<00:02:37.560> and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
fixtures in here I just used two and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.160

once<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:38.920> got<00:02:39.040> these<00:02:39.310> installed<00:02:39.750> one<00:02:40.750> would

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
once I got these installed one would

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.130 
once I got these installed one would
have<00:02:41.290> been<00:02:41.410> more<00:02:41.709> than<00:02:41.830> enough<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.959> turn

most<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.440> time<00:03:26.620> I'm<00:03:26.890> out<00:03:27.040> there<00:03:27.250> during

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
most of the time I'm out there during

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.500 
most of the time I'm out there during
the<00:03:27.700> day<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.120> I've<00:03:28.750> got<00:03:28.900> lights<00:03:29.170> on<00:03:30.510> so

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the day and I've got lights on so

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.590 
the day and I've got lights on so
there's<00:03:31.870> an<00:03:32.080> actual<00:03:35.070> positive<00:03:36.070> use<00:03:36.360> for<00:03:37.360> solar

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
there's an actual positive use for solar

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.830 
there's an actual positive use for solar
that<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:39.030> think<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.150> can<00:03:40.330> capitalize<00:03:41.080> on<00:03:42.840> the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
that I think I can capitalize on the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.070 
that I think I can capitalize on the
reason<00:03:44.170> why<00:03:44.290> I<00:03:44.320> went<00:03:44.650> with<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:44.950> DC<00:03:45.510> lights<00:03:46.510> at

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
reason why I went with the DC lights at

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.870 
reason why I went with the DC lights at
a<00:03:47.110> 10<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.440> 30<00:03:47.650> volt<00:03:47.890> like<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.100> said<00:03:48.310> I'm<00:03:48.459> first<00:03:48.760> of

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
a 10 to 30 volt like I said I'm first of

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.220 
a 10 to 30 volt like I said I'm first of
all<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.090> want<00:03:49.299> to<00:03:49.360> see<00:03:49.510> if<00:03:49.600> they<00:03:49.720> would<00:03:49.870> run<00:03:50.049> off

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
all I want to see if they would run off

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.620 
all I want to see if they would run off
just<00:03:50.260> a<00:03:50.620> solar<00:03:50.830> panel<00:03:51.330> second<00:03:52.330> of<00:03:52.390> all<00:03:52.510> you

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
just a solar panel second of all you

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.080 
just a solar panel second of all you
don't<00:03:52.660> have<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.110> conversion<00:03:53.470> losses<00:03:54.190> that's

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
don't have the conversion losses that's

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.500 
don't have the conversion losses that's
associated<00:03:55.540> with<00:03:55.959> turning<00:03:56.889> DC<00:03:57.280> into<00:03:57.760> AC<00:03:57.970> and

associated with turning DC into AC and
then

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940
