Nick's going to demonstrate one-arm
dumbbell<00:00:29.880> snatch<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:31.019> this<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.859> do

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
dumbbell snatch I really like this we do

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.370 
dumbbell snatch I really like this we do
this<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.219> lot<00:00:32.399> anyway<00:00:33.000> even<00:00:33.210> if<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.570> can<00:00:33.870> Olympic

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
this a lot anyway even if we can Olympic

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.780 
this a lot anyway even if we can Olympic
lifts<00:00:34.590> because<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.070> think<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> things

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
lifts because I think one of the things

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.100 
lifts because I think one of the things
that<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.059> get<00:00:36.270> here<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.660> one-arm<00:00:37.050> dumbbell

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
that you get here with one-arm dumbbell

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.530 
that you get here with one-arm dumbbell
snatch<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.340> get<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.760> unilateral

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
snatch is you get that unilateral

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.840 
snatch is you get that unilateral
shoulder<00:00:39.899> stability<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.219> core

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
shoulder stability and you get core

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.910 
shoulder stability and you get core
stability<00:00:42.090> coming<00:00:42.719> through<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:43.649> segment

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
stability coming through the one segment

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.470 
stability coming through the one segment
so<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.460> there's<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.700> lot<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.059> bang<00:00:45.239> for

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
so I think there's a lot of bang for

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.240 
so I think there's a lot of bang for
your<00:00:45.570> buck<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.379> one-arm<00:00:46.710> dumbbell<00:00:46.770> snatch

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
your buck in the one-arm dumbbell snatch

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.069 
your buck in the one-arm dumbbell snatch
and<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.760> think<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.120> an<00:00:48.239> easy<00:00:48.510> exercise<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and I think it's an easy exercise to

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.410 
and I think it's an easy exercise to
learn<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.680> really<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.100> simple<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
learn it's really as simple as get the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.880 
learn it's really as simple as get the
dumbbell<00:00:51.840> between<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.230> knees<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.680> then

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
dumbbell between the knees and then

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.400 
dumbbell between the knees and then
think<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.820> always<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.329> jumps<00:00:54.719> rug<00:00:55.050> drive

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
think we always think jumps rug drive

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.229 
think we always think jumps rug drive
the<00:00:55.559> elbow<00:00:55.860> catch<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.489> dumbbell<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the elbow catch the dumbbell it's not a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.779 
the elbow catch the dumbbell it's not a
very<00:00:57.600> complicated<00:00:57.930> movement<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
very complicated movement to do the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.279 
very complicated movement to do the
other<00:00:59.969> thing<00:01:00.210> that's<00:01:00.329> nice<00:01:00.539> about<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.960> versus

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
other thing that's nice about it versus

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.979 
other thing that's nice about it versus
a<00:01:01.320> bar<00:01:01.590> snatch<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.640> get<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.879> trouble<00:01:03.059> all

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
a bar snatch if you get in trouble all

it ends up happening is you kind of turn

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.440 
it ends up happening is you kind of turn
around<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.700> drop<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> dumbbell<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.360> the

demonstrate<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.799> these<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.250> us<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
demonstrate one of these for us so the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310 
demonstrate one of these for us so the
idea<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:27.000> we're<00:01:27.720> just<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> take<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
idea here we're just going to take that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.590 
idea here we're just going to take that
medicine<00:01:28.890> ball<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.220> throw<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> height

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
medicine ball and throw it for a height

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
medicine ball and throw it for a height
with<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> idea<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.460> go<00:01:32.549> up

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
with the idea that it's going to go up

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.340 
with the idea that it's going to go up
behind<00:01:32.790> us<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.240> again<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
behind us because again we get that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
behind us because again we get that
explosive<00:01:35.220> hip<00:01:35.549> action<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.060> think<00:01:36.270> about

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
explosive hip action if we think about

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.910 
explosive hip action if we think about
what<00:01:36.689> we're<00:01:36.840> looking<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.350> from<00:01:37.530> Olympic

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
what we're looking for from Olympic

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.770 
what we're looking for from Olympic
lifting<00:01:38.220> we're<00:01:38.790> looking<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.210> explosive<00:01:39.659> hip

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
lifting we're looking for explosive hip

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.469 
lifting we're looking for explosive hip
action<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:41.430> need<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.790> load<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.180> more

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
action we know we need to load it more

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.050 
action we know we need to load it more
than<00:01:42.659> jumps<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.890> by<00:01:44.250> adding<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.579> medicine<00:01:44.939> ball

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
than jumps so by adding a medicine ball

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.730 
than jumps so by adding a medicine ball
now<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.720> some<00:01:45.869> load<00:01:46.049> boom<00:01:46.500> we're

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
now we can get some load boom we're

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.200 
now we can get some load boom we're
trying<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> move<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.340> load<00:01:47.549> obviously<00:01:48.090> we've

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
trying to move that load obviously we've

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.490 
trying to move that load obviously we've
got<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.390> lighter<00:01:48.630> load<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.049> we're<00:01:49.200> moving

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
got a lighter load that we're moving

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.530 
got a lighter load that we're moving
faster<00:01:50.040> not<00:01:51.079> ideal<00:01:52.189> but<00:01:53.189> better<00:01:53.490> last<00:01:54.210> one

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
faster not ideal but better last one

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.109 
faster not ideal but better last one
just<00:01:55.049> kind<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.070> squat<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> press<00:01:56.729> throw<00:01:56.969> an

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
just kind of a squat the press throw an

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.730 
just kind of a squat the press throw an
overhead<00:01:57.420> press<00:01:57.689> throw<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> same

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
overhead press throw this is the same

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530 
overhead press throw this is the same
idea<00:01:58.790> where<00:01:59.790> we're<00:01:59.909> just<00:01:59.939> going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.240> basically

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
idea where we're just going to basically

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.639 
idea where we're just going to basically
tell<00:02:00.780> them<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> try<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> go<00:02:01.290> up<00:02:01.380> hit<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
tell them to try to go up hit the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.230 
tell them to try to go up hit the
ceiling<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.219> four<00:02:02.670> people<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.030> you're<00:02:03.149> in

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
ceiling so this four people if you're in

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.969 
ceiling so this four people if you're in
a<00:02:03.270> situation<00:02:03.450> where<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.960> can't<00:02:04.200> push<00:02:04.710> press

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
a situation where you can't push press

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770 
a situation where you can't push press
you<00:02:05.100> can't<00:02:05.310> push<00:02:05.549> jerk<00:02:05.790> either<00:02:06.299> because<00:02:06.750> of

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
you can't push jerk either because of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.479 
you can't push jerk either because of
injury<00:02:07.170> because<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.560> facility<00:02:08.099> whatever<00:02:08.369> it

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
injury because of facility whatever it

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.400 
injury because of facility whatever it
is<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:09.060> again<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.569> get<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.110> same

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
is you again can get that same

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.910 
is you again can get that same
neurological<00:02:10.830> effect<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.580> exploding<00:02:12.180> that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
neurological effect of exploding that

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.190 
neurological effect of exploding that
load<00:02:13.250> up<00:02:13.580> these<00:02:14.420> balls<00:02:14.780> these<00:02:14.959> are<00:02:15.110> the

ball throws I would actually go with
heavier<00:02:18.860> balls<00:02:19.130> I'd<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.489> up<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.200> 14<00:02:21.200> 16<00:02:21.620> 18
