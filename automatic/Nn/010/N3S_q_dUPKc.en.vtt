many years running his brewery but I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
many years running his brewery but I
think<00:00:28.380> he<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.769> really<00:00:29.130> instrumental<00:00:29.550> in

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
think he was really instrumental in

budget<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.090> home<00:00:33.270> brewer<00:00:33.480> could<00:00:33.870> become<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
budget a home brewer could become a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.680 
budget a home brewer could become a
commercial<00:00:34.950> grower<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> he<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.660> good

realized that when I came back the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.639 
realized that when I came back the
United<00:00:54.120> States<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.750> wouldn't<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.469> these

United States I wouldn't have these

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.279 
United States I wouldn't have these
choices<00:00:56.070> anymore<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> only<00:00:57.690> way<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.989> do

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
choices anymore so the only way to do

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.340 
choices anymore so the only way to do
that<00:00:58.320> would<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> learn<00:00:59.699> to<00:01:00.359> groom<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.809> home

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that would be to learn to groom I home
