00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
important than resolution and I totally

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.880 
important than resolution and I totally
agree<00:01:20.759> with<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.080> would<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> really

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
agree with that but it would be a really

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.440 
agree with that but it would be a really
good<00:01:23.130> thing<00:01:23.189> if<00:01:23.580> they<00:01:23.729> will<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.299> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
good thing if they will actually do it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.480 
good thing if they will actually do it
at<00:01:24.630> dolls<00:01:24.840> lady<00:01:25.140> p<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.250> no<00:01:26.280> other

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the Xbox one so I do think it was it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.160 
the Xbox one so I do think it was it
will<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.880> very<00:01:33.119> important<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:33.869> will<00:01:34.020> do

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
will be very important if they will do

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.410 
will be very important if they will do
that<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.369> bet<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.850> pretty<00:01:36.329> much

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that but I'm going to bet on pretty much

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.800 
that but I'm going to bet on pretty much
all<00:01:36.570> my<00:01:36.780> money<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.350> will<00:01:37.710> most<00:01:38.159> likely<00:01:38.460> be

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
all my money that will most likely be

probably they cool you know with the dev
tools<00:01:45.720> they<00:01:46.380> probably<00:01:46.740> could<00:01:47.009> manage<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.549> do

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
