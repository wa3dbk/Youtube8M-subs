00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:12.490
 nhk is developing for practical use around 2013 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:18.430
 And hybrid cast by fusing broadcasting and the Internet 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:22.960
 It is a basic system to develop various services in the TV accommodation 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:28.490
 In this year's nhk Giken release we developed in cooperation with the manufacturer 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:34.790
 The prototype receiver and the expected service image are exhibited 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:39.410
 Well Sony then Toshiba 3rd from Panasonic Sharp Mr. Mitsubishi 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:45.310
 In the fact that Mr. Electric is that TV now commercial TV 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:48.380
 It is said that when you get the cast response to be a slightly modified form of 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:53.840
 It is called Aichi tm 5 when it says technically 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.550
 Get the latest browser and run the application on it to realize the service 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.559
 To say 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.800
 After that, it works in conjunction with a tablet-like terminal and you can enjoy various ways of enjoying it 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:09.369
 We introduce what you say 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:11.140
 Specifically, on the map, it is on which side the traveler is walking on various travel programs. 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.250
 I would like to display 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.470
 Or maybe you join a quiz show on a tablet 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.470
 You'll have Come on service visit 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.710
 Synchronized player and game information with the broadcast timeline as a linked service for sports programs 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.990
 The service to be displayed is introduced 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:38.810
 Never linked to a service that provides each player's location information 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:44.270
 Graphical presentation is possible 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.990
 The content is big, but it can be made by service providers other than broadcasters. 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.970
 It became a little very 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.030
 So get those new business players to create an application 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.960
 I will be able to do that too 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:01.159
 First, because the tablet is already also to have been spread 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:07.970
 First of all , I think that it is a shortcut to provide services from around here 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.660
 So first of all there is a way to introduce an external set top box 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.310
 I think that 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.760
 However, our goal is as an integrated television 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.160
 I want to aim for something that can be seen 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.940
 You wish 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.540
 The song that you agree with is also increasing 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.970
 In terms of the case of this year 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.070
 Is it Fuji TV or 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:34.310
 such a bs ow's like a place of even the have us with the same idea sponsorship 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:40.270
 I hope I can do it together 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.270
 I hope you can do it at All Japan if you can
