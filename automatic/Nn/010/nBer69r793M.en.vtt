00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:47.740 

okay

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.860 

the<00:00:48.230> basic<00:00:48.560> concept<00:00:48.710> is<00:00:49.130> this<00:00:49.280> right<00:00:49.880> you<00:00:50.750> get

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
the basic concept is this right you get

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.700 
the basic concept is this right you get
a<00:00:50.900> bass<00:00:51.110> drum<00:00:51.140> that's<00:00:51.500> gone<00:00:56.350> it's<00:00:57.350> not<00:00:57.470> really

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
a bass drum that's gone it's not really

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.050 
a bass drum that's gone it's not really
doing<00:00:57.830> that<00:00:58.040> but<00:00:58.220> that's<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.850> feel

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
doing that but that's the feel

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.880 
doing that but that's the feel
underneath<00:00:59.330> so<00:00:59.720> it's<00:00:59.870> like<00:01:00.020> this<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:00.380> your

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
underneath so it's like this and your

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:12.010 
underneath so it's like this and your
feet<00:01:01.100> gonna<00:01:01.310> do<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.460> same<00:01:01.670> thing<00:01:09.730> okay<00:01:11.020> to

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
feet gonna do the same thing okay to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.630 
feet gonna do the same thing okay to
that<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:12.350> can<00:01:12.470> add<00:01:12.650> a<00:01:12.680> little<00:01:12.860> bounce<00:01:13.070> up<00:01:13.370> top

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
that you can add a little bounce up top

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
kind of gliding it like this 1 2 3 1 2 1

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:07.750 
kind of gliding it like this 1 2 3 1 2 1
2<00:01:59.900> 3<00:02:00.470> 1<00:02:01.280> 2<00:02:01.310> 1<00:02:01.820> 2<00:02:02.180> 3<00:02:02.870> 1<00:02:03.470> 2<00:02:03.680> 3<00:02:04.360> 1<00:02:05.360> 2<00:02:05.810> 1<00:02:06.130> then<00:02:07.130> if<00:02:07.640> you

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
2 3 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 1 then if you

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
shoulders moving around a little bit

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.270 
shoulders moving around a little bit
just<00:02:11.120> get<00:02:11.959> kind<00:02:12.170> of<00:02:12.200> crazy<00:02:12.350> with<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.709> once<00:02:13.220> you

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.470 
just get kind of crazy with it once you
got<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.550> basic<00:02:13.880> rhythm<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.209> don't<00:02:14.330> have<00:02:14.420> to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
got that basic rhythm you don't have to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.820 
got that basic rhythm you don't have to
stick<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.019> can<00:02:15.200> do<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.320> bunch<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.590> ones

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
stick to it you can do a bunch of ones

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.770 
stick to it you can do a bunch of ones
do<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> bunch<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.489> 1<00:02:16.640> 2<00:02:16.820> however<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.540> want<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.720> do

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
it like this it could be like let's turn

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:48.090 
it like this it could be like let's turn
up<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.870> music<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.140> little<00:02:21.200> bit<00:02:22.450> all<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.510> way<00:02:23.690> up

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:03:27.610 

like<00:02:49.100> this

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.650 

that's<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.819> concept

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
that's the concept

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.600 
that's the concept
I<00:03:49.800> shouldn't<00:03:50.800> be<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:50.920> one<00:03:51.010> teaching<00:03:51.400> this

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
I shouldn't be the one teaching this
