00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.340
 four years in a row I never win it but 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.380

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.570
 I'm important always coming to the end 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.570
 it's like that one more year so we're 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.130
 very happy we want and in addition 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.980
 well we also have olivia who comes 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.600
 in the reaction assays aspect now 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.950
 expression and luckily what we say 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.480
 always with pau we are very 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.670
 calm on that side that she 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.550
 love to go today was on channel 13 with 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.489
 this is the show 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.460
 and then on idea if she is chocha and 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.690
 see the lights all the time well I like 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.899
 the opening with marcelo looked at everything 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.150
 acted with the truth that what 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.860
 we enjoyed and she what we say 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.810
 whenever she has to do 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.540
 charge that is our daughter but 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.880
 equally olivia is the priority and 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.610
 when we see that today is uncomfortable or 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.259
 that is not having a good time there we are going to 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.200
 review all the laburo we have 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.789
 meanwhile good to enjoy as 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.320
 mom this year just told me is not 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.700
 nervous then the age to not the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.460
 motherhood as I place myself in another 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.350
 side I had programs and from early in 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.660
 the channel came running I gave the tit to 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.340
 the fat one home that I came up 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.160
 the photo and the truth that I'm like 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.660
 another level I'm like dedicated to my daughter 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.119
 the most important thing to me in life is 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.530
 Olivia and obviously I'm grateful and 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:47.020
 happy to be working again in 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.990
 the 13 southern hills and the dance we are 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.240
 it seems to me that what we notice as 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.369
 we learn faster 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.500
 Paula has more experience but to me 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.170
 I get things faster and 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.090
 we stay in that this is going to be the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.320
 ballerina in quotes I'm going to do 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.239
 more than the cheeks that make the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.640
 not good rhythm now all as one of the 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.530
 disc we started with that one was 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.800
 cute the theme all this line the choreo 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.650
 it's 'difficult' to botindari that 58 came and we 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.880
 He said well let's put a choreo that 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.880
 it's fast so all rhythm 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.319
 Peter because things do not come out anymore 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.970
 easy is not costing very much 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.040
 it's costing us because it 's just 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.440
 operated on the knee then with the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.810
 extra pounds for immobility not 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.400
 I am the one from other years so do not wait 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.860
 see in the couple they saw in the last 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.370
 year of 2012 we are now parents we are 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.370
 operated 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.310
 and now it's between yesterday and the day before yesterday 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.690
 he was getting up but to go to 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.910
 the nerves of the mother 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.630
 it may be that but in general it is a 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.580
 santa sleeps pretty good and paula is 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.270
 all day on top of her we are both 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.970
 we are very close to olic and that's why 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.580

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.010
