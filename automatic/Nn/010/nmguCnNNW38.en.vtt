00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:05.620
 Hello my band in Andreas because it would be here on the system of PC 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.770
 Leinbach 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.659
 I want to show you today we can now 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.659
 and because we look forward to the tennis court 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.179
 especially not my focus 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.319
 Percentages as reported that we landed John Hutton an hour earlier 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.579
 implement and learn something new 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.070
 and does not work it is always tried again 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.850
 reported again and again that you like to come to me because I am 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.499
 actually 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:47.530
 the severe winter 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.860
 very focused 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.130
 demand 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.610
 BASF and you ring 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.060
 FÃ¼rderer them too 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.990
 and if percent 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.230
 when they make an effort 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.000
 I'm ready at any time 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Marienthal nonsense too 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.180
 as strength 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.180
 I'm actually confirmed the break 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.640
 and something in my students demand 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.490
 probably life has gone astray 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.770
 whose bringing comes 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.770
 has to give everything for one and a half hours 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.770
 at the end 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.460
 since the week or at the end of a season they are already our match winner with me 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.000
 this is done 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.180
 because they realize that their game has improved pa from renewed 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 Pop up 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.420
 the rioters on the weekend close very well 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.980
 it is quiet Zoom Greens 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.630
 that is 405 places Hermann Baumann a small one 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.620
 a pleasant atmosphere 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.930
 here on the plant and percent 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.680
 this little bit outside 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.480
 and we still have enough 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.480
 Capacity to accommodate new members 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:17.619
 I have taken over the teaching philosophy of Swiss Tennis November and 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:23.819
 the German media was the requirements for the feeling of Dennis 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.819
 playfully convey 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.279
 that motivate only kids firstly about the fun 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.089
 second, about the fun 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.209
 Singing a lot of fun 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.209
 and maybe to show the kids that one 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:45.289
 if a bit exhausting 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:46.919
 that he 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:51.269
 to achieve everything you can imagine or just more 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.549
 is possible as you imagine, of course he belongs 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.879
 Welded to and a bit of effort and the country in sport 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.699
 and percent that maybe makes them for everyday life 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.699
 Increase percentages 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.180
 They learn here in tennis without hiring a kindergarten 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.180
 those want to have time 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.149
 Sorry the guests kids there are as trainers of nba and sacks and do 

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:41.879
 and do 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.249
 the modeled ones that best threatened the two thugs 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:46.659
 from 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.359
 that was the way it used to be 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.179
 but helped well 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.319
 I would be for that to take over again 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.679
