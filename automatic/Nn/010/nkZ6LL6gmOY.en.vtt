this<00:00:00.420> is<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:01.170> new<00:00:01.319> Suzuki<00:00:01.709> Swift<00:00:02.250> now<00:00:02.610> I<00:00:02.850> know

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
this is the new Suzuki Swift now I know

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.550 
this is the new Suzuki Swift now I know
what<00:00:03.360> you're<00:00:03.480> thinking<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.080> yes<00:00:04.259> it<00:00:04.529> does

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
what you're thinking and yes it does

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.400 
what you're thinking and yes it does
look<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.190> lot<00:00:05.520> like<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.879> old<00:00:06.029> Suzuki<00:00:06.839> Swift<00:00:06.990> but

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
look a lot like the old Suzuki Swift but

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.980 
look a lot like the old Suzuki Swift but
it<00:00:07.500> is<00:00:07.710> all<00:00:07.950> new<00:00:08.250> for<00:00:08.790> starters<00:00:09.240> it's<00:00:09.540> slightly

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
it is all new for starters it's slightly

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.310 
it is all new for starters it's slightly
longer<00:00:10.320> than<00:00:10.469> before<00:00:10.679> which<00:00:11.340> means<00:00:12.320> legroom

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
longer than before which means legroom

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.820 
longer than before which means legroom
is<00:00:13.730> better<00:00:14.730> than<00:00:15.269> before<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:16.020> mean<00:00:16.410> if<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.619> look

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
is better than before I mean if you look

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.740 
is better than before I mean if you look
it's<00:00:17.640> not<00:00:17.789> bad<00:00:18.060> really<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.570> for<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
it's not bad really is it for a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.679 
it's not bad really is it for a
supermini<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.560> by<00:00:19.800> keeping<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.250> boxy<00:00:20.580> design

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
supermini and by keeping the boxy design

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.950 
supermini and by keeping the boxy design
Headroom<00:00:21.920> it's<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.039> good<00:00:23.250> as<00:00:23.400> ever

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
Headroom it's as good as ever

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.689 
Headroom it's as good as ever
what's<00:00:24.960> also<00:00:25.140> good<00:00:25.529> about<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.949> Swift<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.430> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
what's also good about the Swift is the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.120 
what's also good about the Swift is the
sheer<00:00:27.449> level<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.140> equipment<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.039> get

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
sheer level of equipment you get

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.460 
sheer level of equipment you get
standard<00:00:29.640> across<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> entire<00:00:30.510> range<00:00:30.900> for

there's<00:00:36.329> USB<00:00:37.230> interface<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.190> listen<00:00:38.340> to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
there's USB interface you can listen to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.060 
there's USB interface you can listen to
music<00:00:38.579> directly<00:00:39.420> off<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> flash<00:00:40.200> drive<00:00:40.500> also

you<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.149> height<00:00:42.690> adjustment<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.370> reach

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you get height adjustment and we reach

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.430 
you get height adjustment and we reach
adjustment<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.600> steering<00:00:46.020> wheel<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
adjustment of the steering wheel and you

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740 
adjustment of the steering wheel and you
can<00:00:46.590> also<00:00:46.710> alter<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.000> height<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
can also alter the height of the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.569 
can also alter the height of the
driver's<00:00:49.260> seat<00:00:49.289> which<00:00:49.620> means<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.160> dead

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
driver's seat which means that it's dead

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.700

this<00:00:55.710> uzuki<00:00:56.100> swifty<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.489> pretty<00:00:56.760> good<00:00:56.969> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
this uzuki swifty is pretty good to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
this uzuki swifty is pretty good to
drive<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.539> town<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> mean<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.500> gear<00:00:58.859> shift<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
drive in town I mean the gear shift the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.880 
drive in town I mean the gear shift the
steering<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.050> major<00:01:01.230> controls<00:01:01.710> they're

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
steering and the major controls they're

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.560 
steering and the major controls they're
all<00:01:02.010> nice<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.280> light<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.480> got

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
all nice and light and because it's got

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.390 
all nice and light and because it's got
a<00:01:03.629> boxy<00:01:04.229> shape<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.650> instinctively<00:01:05.189> know

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
a boxy shape you instinctively know

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.100 
a boxy shape you instinctively know
where<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> corners<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> car<00:01:06.420> are<00:01:06.630> which

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
where the corners of the car are which

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.380 
where the corners of the car are which
makes<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.439> very<00:01:07.470> easy<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> slop<00:01:08.820> through<00:01:09.090> gaps

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
makes it very easy to slop through gaps

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
makes it very easy to slop through gaps
in<00:01:09.600> traffic<00:01:11.990> also<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.470> Swift<00:01:13.740> bit<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
in traffic also the Swift bit like the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.850 
in traffic also the Swift bit like the
original<00:01:14.909> Mini<00:01:15.119> has<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.540> kind<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> wheel<00:01:16.650> at

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
original Mini has that kind of wheel at

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.770 
original Mini has that kind of wheel at
each<00:01:17.009> corner<00:01:17.430> spans<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.420> very<00:01:18.630> little

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
each corner spans with very little

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960 
each corner spans with very little
overhang<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.590> gives<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.970> go-kart

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
overhang and that gives it a go-kart

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
overhang and that gives it a go-kart
handling<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:22.110> means<00:01:22.320> when<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.830> of

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
handling that means when you get out of

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.740 
handling that means when you get out of
the<00:01:23.070> urban<00:01:23.310> environment<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.060> onto<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> twisty

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the urban environment and onto a twisty

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.280 
the urban environment and onto a twisty
road<00:01:24.930> such<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.909> it's<00:01:26.909> actually<00:01:27.420> quite<00:01:28.259> a

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
road such as this it's actually quite a

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.649 
road such as this it's actually quite a
bit<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.680> fun<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.220> trade<00:01:29.430> corners<00:01:29.880> really

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
bit of fun we can trade corners really

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.740 
bit of fun we can trade corners really
really<00:01:31.020> well<00:01:35.000> however<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> trade<00:01:36.720> off

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
really well however there is a trade off

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.390 
really well however there is a trade off
for<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.200> nimble<00:01:37.590> handling<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.189> brings

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
for that nimble handling and that brings

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.429 
for that nimble handling and that brings
me<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.880> Swift's<00:01:39.360> downsides<00:01:39.990> because

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
me on to the Swift's downsides because

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.319 
me on to the Swift's downsides because
the<00:01:40.530> suspension<00:01:40.920> can't<00:01:41.700> feel<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> little<00:01:42.119> bit

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the suspension can't feel a little bit

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.420 
the suspension can't feel a little bit
firm<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.840> means<00:01:43.020> ultimately<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:44.070> not<00:01:44.159> quite

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
firm it means ultimately it's not quite

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.350 
firm it means ultimately it's not quite
as<00:01:44.520> comfy<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:44.970> say<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.689> Hyundai<00:01:46.439> i20<00:01:47.180> yet<00:01:48.180> quite

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
as comfy as say a Hyundai i20 yet quite

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.539 
as comfy as say a Hyundai i20 yet quite
a<00:01:48.390> lot<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.689> Tyre<00:01:49.290> noise<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.979> wind<00:01:50.159> noise<00:01:50.220> as

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
a lot of Tyre noise and wind noise as

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.190 
a lot of Tyre noise and wind noise as
well<00:01:50.759> when<00:01:50.939> you're<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.780> motorway

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
well when you're going at motorway

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.980 
well when you're going at motorway
speeds<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:53.159> mean<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.640> reckon<00:01:54.060> part<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
speeds I mean I reckon part of the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.270 
speeds I mean I reckon part of the
problem<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> fact<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.130> much

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
problem is the fact that the so much

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.760 
problem is the fact that the so much
hard<00:01:56.520> brittle<00:01:56.850> plastic<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> noise<00:01:58.649> kind

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
hard brittle plastic that the noise kind

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:10.520 
hard brittle plastic that the noise kind
of<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.040> reverberates<00:01:59.939> around<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.479> cabin

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.320 

and<00:02:11.530> finally<00:02:12.190> if<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.580> follow<00:02:12.790> me<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.120> back

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and finally if you follow me to the back

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.540 
and finally if you follow me to the back
I'll<00:02:13.630> show<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:14.050> another<00:02:14.170> negative<00:02:14.550> because

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
I'll show you another negative because

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.220 
I'll show you another negative because
the<00:02:15.700> boot<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:16.210> quite<00:02:16.570> small

the boot is quite small

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.350 
the boot is quite small
even<00:02:17.620> by<00:02:17.980> supermini<00:02:18.670> standards<00:02:19.210> it's

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
even by supermini standards it's

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.550 
even by supermini standards it's
certainly<00:02:19.570> not<00:02:19.720> as<00:02:19.840> large<00:02:20.020> as<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.320> on<00:02:20.500> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
certainly not as large as that on a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.370 
certainly not as large as that on a
Renault<00:02:21.040> Clio<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.810> fold<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.200> rear
