00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.880
 asked 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.150
 Let's do it before you start doing the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.109
 Let's plug the oven to let it go 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 preheated 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.900
 I'll start by separating the egg whites 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.800
 gems are seeing that I am preparing 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.719
 here without putting it on a platter 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.450
 because the time I break the egg I already 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.410
 I feel lonely or not as rui 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.570

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.000
 clear okay durinha farm out 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.579
 liquid is that the egg is damaged 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.960
 as many goals as I do I beat the 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.340
 light snow 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:03.120
 so let's go over here the egg whites 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:01:06.739
 I now arrived at the point here snow 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.739
 now I'll book in the fridge 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.500
 Now I'm going to get our friends here. 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.010
 carrots which is the ingredient that goes into 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.010
 our cake 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.090
 I'll cut it into small pieces to 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.080
 be easier and discuss here in the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.020
 blender 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.100
 I already put cuffs I'm going to put 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:34.180
 for lady 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.909
 I'll join the oil and sugar 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.369
 all like that at once and I'll put it here 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:51.100
 in the blender to beat well 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:53.740
 carrot crop up ready I go 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.750
 pass the mixture into a bowl as 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.750
 get well here defendants can be for me 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.000
 nothing left now I will add flour only 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.039
 that the former always flour that is 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.200
 We do not have any surprise, of course. 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.250
 a move to incorporate our 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.070
 sure mix can not leave a single 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.670
 little group of flour is stir 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.799
 delicately and thus undoing the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.610
 balls of flour that have stayed 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.269

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.280

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.920
 here delicately 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.310

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.640
 reserved and now is the important part 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.950

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.769
 cuddly and will grow quite ready already 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.829
