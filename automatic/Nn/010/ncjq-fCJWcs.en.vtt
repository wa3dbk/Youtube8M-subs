00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.210
 hello everyone and a half ribera welcome 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.880
 to a new delivery of blues leaks and 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.340
 now good what I want to show you a 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.160
 little is the resource of making notes 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.810
 chromatic that can also be done in 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.550
 blues 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.870
 I was improvising but there has been a 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.940
 phrase that you have repeated twice that is 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.050
 is 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.290
 a person a little but good I do not know that 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.000
 depends a little on each one and the idea is 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.240
 they use chromatic notes to say notes 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.590
 that are not on the scale but for 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.530
 semitones so that we go 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.820
 advancing halftone so half that over 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.899
 everything is seen here not always changing 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.899
 continuous rope the same 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.619
 but changing the rope 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.730
 then first we will see a little 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.560
 that would be the chromatic scale before the 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.150
 water that can simply do that 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.210
 find things on our own 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.210
 I start in the all four fingers 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.719
 in the adopted belt fret now the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.390
 fifth I have to delay a fret and 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.550
 that same one 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.100
 five notes on the fifth 4th fret 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:59.040
 fifth sixth seventh eighth then in the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.040
 fourth equal in the third equal 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.229
 but in the second aquino with the theme 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.619
 of the pitch change between third and 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:11.569
 second that are let's say closer 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.610
 if I play this note I have to pass 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.460
 directly from this to touch four 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:21.690
 simply the second here 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.350
 we stretch little with rhythm would be 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.350
 and it goes 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.220
 then the lic 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.349
 I have done here has been 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:51.360
 this tonic of the minor as always 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.360
 almost always and I'm going from the 5th to the 8th 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.350
 the capture of three chairs then 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
 going through the moon that also 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.520
 could take with another chromatic but 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.310
 good as it has no life of its own has its 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.250
 own identity then 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.790
 behind one and behind this fifth one is 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.690
 accepted in this fifth sixth and seventh 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.690
 in fifth 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.599
 and here the chromatic theme begins 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.960
 that is to say on the fourth string I play all 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:33.490
 the notes all fingers 1 2 3 and 4 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:36.160
 a big finger one is going to act on other 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.700
 c of the fifth of the third forgiveness I touch 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.500
 fourth and fifth fret in the third and 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.920
 I drop the note on the note 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.430
 here on the seventh fret of the rope 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.430
 Well, it's like that 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.880
 and 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.240
 and 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.530
 try to touch it 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.629
 above the wheel you can not get a 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.629
 little different 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.210
 Y 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.470
 Well, this is the most important idea 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.050
 it does not read that in itself but that 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.120
 You take the idea and try things because 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.190
 you can discover different works 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.449
 with the theme of chromatisms so 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.110
 nothing I hope you liked and we 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:40.110
 we see in the next 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.810
 but
