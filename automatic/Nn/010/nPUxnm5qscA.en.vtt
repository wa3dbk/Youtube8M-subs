make<00:01:47.939> our<00:01:48.119> own<00:01:48.270> by<00:01:49.200> using<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.560> next<00:01:49.829> keyframe

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
make our own by using the next keyframe

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.889 
make our own by using the next keyframe
button<00:01:50.549> which<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
button which is just to the right of the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.560 
button which is just to the right of the
play<00:01:52.140> button<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:53.189> skip<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.000> every<00:01:54.450> other

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
play button I can skip to every other

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.000 
play button I can skip to every other
keyframe

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
keyframe

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:09.399 
keyframe
Poole<00:01:56.310> Roberts<00:01:56.820> head<00:01:57.030> down

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.839 

okay<00:02:10.409> let's<00:02:10.619> back<00:02:10.799> away<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.489> what<00:02:11.640> kind

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
okay let's back away and see what kind

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.369 
okay let's back away and see what kind
of<00:02:11.969> monster<00:02:12.450> we've<00:02:12.659> created<00:02:12.989> here<00:02:13.349> by

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
of monster we've created here by

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.459 
of monster we've created here by
previewing<00:02:14.069> our<00:02:14.219> new<00:02:14.400> animation<00:02:14.969> as<00:02:15.469> expected

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
previewing our new animation as expected

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.080 
previewing our new animation as expected
we<00:02:16.769> now<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.069> something<00:02:17.430> similar<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
we now have something similar to the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.539 
we now have something similar to the
idle<00:02:18.359> animation<00:02:18.870> but<00:02:19.409> Roberts<00:02:19.799> head<00:02:19.980> Bob's<00:02:20.310> up

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
idle animation but Roberts head Bob's up

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:21.170 
idle animation but Roberts head Bob's up
and<00:02:20.730> down

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and down

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.300 
and down
let's<00:02:21.569> click<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.930> save<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.379> button<00:02:22.409> and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
let's click the save as button and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.860 
let's click the save as button and
making<00:02:23.700> sure<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:24.000> we're<00:02:24.150> in<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.299> animations

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
making sure that we're in the animations

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.849 
making sure that we're in the animations
folder<00:02:25.079> let's<00:02:25.500> call<00:02:25.709> this<00:02:25.859> thing<00:02:26.129> nod<00:02:27.859> custom

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
folder let's call this thing nod custom

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.160 
folder let's call this thing nod custom
animation<00:02:29.459> complete<00:02:29.970> let's<00:02:30.420> bring<00:02:30.689> on<00:02:30.900> some

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
animation complete let's bring on some

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.610 
animation complete let's bring on some
scripting<00:02:31.909> to<00:02:32.909> make<00:02:33.060> custom<00:02:33.480> scripts<00:02:33.959> open<00:02:34.530> a

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
scripting to make custom scripts open a

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.789 
scripting to make custom scripts open a
text<00:02:34.950> editor<00:02:35.280> then<00:02:35.790> find<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.450> data<00:02:37.049> then

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
text editor then find the data then

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.929 
text editor then find the data then
scripts<00:02:38.459> folders<00:02:38.969> and<00:02:39.299> then<00:02:39.450> click<00:02:39.689> on<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:40.909> sks

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
scripts folders and then click on a sks

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.330 
scripts folders and then click on a sks
now<00:02:42.540> let's<00:02:42.750> swap<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.319> idle<00:02:43.620> animation<00:02:43.769> with

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
now let's swap the idle animation with

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.280 
now let's swap the idle animation with
our<00:02:44.430> nod<00:02:44.670> animation<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.540> watch<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.959> update

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
our nod animation and watch the update

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.470 
our nod animation and watch the update
so<00:02:47.040> that's<00:02:47.220> cool<00:02:47.430> but<00:02:47.669> maybe<00:02:47.819> we<00:02:48.030> only<00:02:48.209> want

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
so that's cool but maybe we only want

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.659 
so that's cool but maybe we only want
Robert<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.900> nod<00:02:49.169> when<00:02:49.439> a<00:02:49.500> key<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:49.769> pressed<00:02:50.159> so

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
Robert to nod when a key is pressed so

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.009 
Robert to nod when a key is pressed so
I'm<00:02:50.760> gonna<00:02:50.970> put<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.359> little<00:02:51.510> extra<00:02:51.659> code

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
I'm gonna put in a little extra code

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.409 
I'm gonna put in a little extra code
here<00:02:52.349> I've<00:02:53.040> created<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.639> boolean<00:02:54.000> variable

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
here I've created a boolean variable

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.750 
here I've created a boolean variable
called<00:02:54.659> nod<00:02:54.959> which<00:02:55.439> I<00:02:55.590> want<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.950> be<00:02:56.040> true<00:02:56.400> when

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
called nod which I want to be true when

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.330 
called nod which I want to be true when
the<00:02:56.879> end<00:02:57.060> key<00:02:57.299> is<00:02:57.359> down<00:02:57.659> and<00:02:58.019> false<00:02:58.950> when<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the end key is down and false when the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.640 
the end key is down and false when the
end<00:02:59.459> key<00:02:59.669> is<00:02:59.790> not<00:03:00.000> down<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.930> really<00:03:01.349> think

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
end key is not down so you really think

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.550 
end key is not down so you really think
you're<00:03:01.829> better<00:03:02.099> than<00:03:02.250> Rawat<00:03:02.909> don't<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.560> you

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
you're better than Rawat don't you you

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.740 
you're better than Rawat don't you you
 now<00:03:05.189> in<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.459> update<00:03:05.790> function<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.450> can

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
 now in the update function I can

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.240 
 now in the update function I can
use<00:03:06.840> an<00:03:06.959> if<00:03:07.139> statement<00:03:07.349> to<00:03:07.620> check<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.069> nod

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
use an if statement to check the nod

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.039 
use an if statement to check the nod
variable<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:09.030> see<00:03:09.209> whether<00:03:09.450> we<00:03:09.750> should<00:03:09.900> play

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
variable to see whether we should play

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.199 
variable to see whether we should play
the<00:03:10.200> nod<00:03:10.379> animation<00:03:11.010> or<00:03:11.159> not<00:03:11.340> it's<00:03:11.760> not<00:03:11.939> that

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
the nod animation or not it's not that

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.629 
the nod animation or not it's not that
philosophically<00:03:13.109> interesting<00:03:13.340> question<00:03:14.340> how

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
philosophically interesting question how

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.580 
philosophically interesting question how
much<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:15.000> Roberts<00:03:15.449> script<00:03:15.870> can<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.199> change

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
much of Roberts script can you change

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.610 
much of Roberts script can you change
before<00:03:17.519> he<00:03:17.609> is<00:03:17.729> no<00:03:17.970> longer<00:03:18.209> Roberts<00:03:19.109> in<00:03:19.349> when<00:03:19.530> I

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
before he is no longer Roberts in when I

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.080 
before he is no longer Roberts in when I
save<00:03:19.859> this<00:03:20.040> new<00:03:20.250> code<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.669> can<00:03:20.819> see<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
save this new code you can see the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.599 
save this new code you can see the
real-time<00:03:21.449> update<00:03:21.930> Robert<00:03:22.829> no<00:03:23.010> longer<00:03:23.370> nods

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
real-time update Robert no longer nods

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.839 
real-time update Robert no longer nods
as<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> default<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:25.040> pressing<00:03:26.040> n<00:03:26.220> does<00:03:26.519> indeed

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
as a default and pressing n does indeed

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.360 
as a default and pressing n does indeed
trigger<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.479> nod<00:03:27.780> animation<00:03:28.349> we're<00:03:29.220> not

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
trigger the nod animation we're not

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.830 
trigger the nod animation we're not
quite<00:03:29.549> done<00:03:29.609> yet<00:03:29.819> though<00:03:30.209> because<00:03:30.720> the

quite done yet though because the

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
transitions are pretty rough still look

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.789

what<00:03:33.060> happens<00:03:33.359> when<00:03:33.419> I<00:03:33.540> spam<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.349> he's<00:03:34.590> been

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
what happens when I spam and he's been

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.099 
what happens when I spam and he's been
possessed<00:03:35.040> by<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.549> devil<00:03:35.970> what<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.840> really

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
possessed by the devil what we really

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.780 
possessed by the devil what we really
need<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.470> way<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.739> blend<00:03:38.010> between<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.519> two

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
need is a way to blend between the two

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.490 
need is a way to blend between the two
animations<00:03:39.389> so<00:03:39.599> that<00:03:39.720> all<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.959> transitions

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.460 
animations so that all the transitions
are<00:03:40.650> smooth<00:03:41.599> instead<00:03:42.599> of<00:03:42.720> using<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.109> simple

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
are smooth instead of using this simple

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.619 
are smooth instead of using this simple

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
kind of like in Roberts brain right now

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.179 
kind of like in Roberts brain right now
once<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.420> we<00:04:08.540> were<00:04:08.660> like<00:04:08.810> giving<00:04:09.170> him<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.350> lot

function will add both animations
together<00:04:24.680> at<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.100> same<00:04:25.310> time<00:04:25.580> all<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:25.970> time

together at the same time all the time

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.719 
together at the same time all the time
it's<00:04:26.900> just<00:04:27.139> that<00:04:27.259> will<00:04:27.410> apply<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.800> not<00:04:28.370> amount

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
it's just that will apply the not amount

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.969 
it's just that will apply the not amount
as<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.120> weight<00:04:29.509> on<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.870> back<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.380> each<00:04:30.500> one

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
as a weight on the back to each one

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.070 
as a weight on the back to each one
while<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.699> nod<00:04:31.880> animation<00:04:32.449> will<00:04:32.600> be<00:04:32.630> weighted

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
while the nod animation will be weighted

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.529 
while the nod animation will be weighted
by<00:04:33.229> not<00:04:33.500> amount<00:04:33.860> directly<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:35.120> idle

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
by not amount directly the idle

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.960 
by not amount directly the idle
animation<00:04:36.050> should<00:04:36.259> now<00:04:36.440> be<00:04:36.650> weighted<00:04:37.039> by<00:04:37.610> one

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
animation should now be weighted by one

animation should now be weighted by one
-<00:04:38.449> not<00:04:38.750> amount<00:04:39.460> okay<00:04:40.460> let's<00:04:40.699> take<00:04:40.910> robert's

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
- not amount okay let's take robert's

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.360 
- not amount okay let's take robert's
new<00:04:41.539> reins<00:04:41.870> out<00:04:42.139> for<00:04:42.410> a<00:04:42.440> spin<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:42.830> see<00:04:43.190> how<00:04:43.310> the

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
new reins out for a spin and see how the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.060 
new reins out for a spin and see how the
transitions<00:04:44.060> look<00:04:44.270> oh<00:04:44.710> yeah<00:04:45.710> that<00:04:46.039> looks

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
transitions look oh yeah that looks

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.379 
transitions look oh yeah that looks
silky<00:04:46.699> smooth<00:04:48.099> now<00:04:49.099> even<00:04:49.460> if<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:49.699> spam<00:04:50.030> the<00:04:50.240> end

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
silky smooth now even if I spam the end

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.330 
silky smooth now even if I spam the end
key<00:04:50.660> I<00:04:50.900> still<00:04:51.590> get<00:04:51.770> pretty<00:04:51.949> smooth

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
key I still get pretty smooth

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.779 
key I still get pretty smooth
transitions<00:04:53.740> so<00:04:54.740> Robert<00:04:55.250> did<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.520> think<00:04:55.639> the

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
transitions so Robert did you think the

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.020 
transitions so Robert did you think the
Colts<00:04:56.120> were<00:04:56.180> gonna<00:04:56.360> win<00:04:56.509> the<00:04:56.599> Superbowl

Colts were gonna win the Superbowl
yeah<00:04:59.030> me<00:04:59.300> too<00:04:59.539> too<00:05:00.440> much<00:05:00.650> chitchat<00:05:01.280> could

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
yeah me too too much chitchat could

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.700 
yeah me too too much chitchat could
dilute<00:05:01.699> it<00:05:02.030> and<00:05:02.210> too<00:05:02.419> close<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.930> think<00:05:02.990> Robert

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
dilute it and too close I think Robert

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.659 
dilute it and too close I think Robert
