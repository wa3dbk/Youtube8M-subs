00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.930
 and then brothers shooting table here who is 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.539
 talking and fighting and I'm going to make a 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.590
 tutorial explaining how to do it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.150
 and the current running show 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.769
 will show you the first in the arena which is 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.809
 the dribble waka waka 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.329
 this is the simplest waka waka of 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.879
 perform needs a player of five 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.000
 stars of skill and basically 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.180
 you do it with the player then stopped 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.180
 For those who do not know this is the cavaca. 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.770
 to make the cavaca you will get the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.579
 analogue of the right will make a half 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.609
 moon 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.609
 coming from one of the left player sides 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.489
 or right when you complete this sock 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.590
 moon loosens and if analog and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.439
 the logic of the left to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.630
 where he finished the half moon, exemplifying 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.390
 if you started from the player right 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.700
 You'll get the analog from the right. 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.070
 will make the half moon until you reach the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.610
 left and then tap 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.049
 left to left 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.330
 basically this is what to do in any 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.150
 direction you have a player 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.420
 so always remember the position of the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.909
 player is always in relation to the position 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.720
 him in the field for you to play 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.470
 analog 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.470
 like this 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.220
 this is the current ahani is a difficult group 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.900
 to execute 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.540
 You have to pedal first and then 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.020
 do the job first, I'll show you 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.600
 for those who do not know how to pedal 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.040
 for those who do not know this is the 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.650
 pedaling 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.080
 I 'm doing with the player standing still 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.100
 these are the pedals to perform 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.800
 pedaling 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.680
 you will pick up on the right logic goes 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.460
 pick up from the front of the player who is going to do 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.430
 a half-moon of only 90 degrees or to 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.100
 his left or right is 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.100
 so it does to pedal with the player 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.290
 Now to make the arrangement in you go. 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.420
 give two pedals will wait for the leg 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.480
 of the player to return a little or 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.240
 You do two pedals, wait for something. 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.700
 One-thousandth of a second is very difficult for you 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.080
 Catch but when you get the hang of it. 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.959
 will understand 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.180
 Wait for this time, do the waka waka. 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.090
 the way I taught you before in the video that 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.320
 It's going to be akabane, it 's a little difficult. 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.590
 explain 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.720
 given that it is very fast but 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.300
 In time you'll get caught. 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.750
 their pedals and no longer because it is 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.690
 difficult to do with more than two pedals 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.209
 it is very difficult you do both 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.250
 I hope some time I can not speak 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.720
 the time because thousandth of a second 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.970
 You'll have to keep looking at the 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.130
 player when his leg becomes more 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.720
 or less recent with each other the leg 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.330
 who is pedaling to stay ahead with the 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.989
 another was standing there you do it 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.989
 cavaca 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.780
 to 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.740
 Claudia 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.220
 and look 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.079
 well this was the waka waka tutorial 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.479
 waka waka running 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.569
 It's like I said just now in the video 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.509
 It is very difficult to run running 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.039
 given that everything is very fast 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.870
 it all happens in a fraction of a second 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.419
 in thousandths 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.229
 really is very fast so the 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.870
 basic for you to start is has 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.780
 that's what I said the two pedals is 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.240
 much easier with just the two or 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.729
 more pedaling becomes very difficult 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.690
 The time you will have to look at the 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.650
 player and sees her leg is hot as 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.440
 already said 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.120
 the leg is pedaling the last pedal 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.800
 on the second and then run the chip 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.990
 It's normal, I explained. 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.330
 It's not difficult, just have to pay attention. 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.729
 in the player's position 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.070
 So please, if you like the video, let it 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.169
 a like to help the channel and if you 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.289
 you are watching is not enrolled if 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.340
 sign up beauty people said that 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.340
 hug, I went 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.050
 the radio
