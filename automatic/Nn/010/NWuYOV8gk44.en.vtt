tricking<00:04:54.670> it<00:04:54.730> round<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.090> catch<00:04:55.390> it<00:04:55.630> um<00:04:56.080> the

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
tricking it round to catch it um the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.290 
tricking it round to catch it um the
main<00:04:56.980> thing<00:04:57.010> you<00:04:57.220> need<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.430> remember<00:04:57.520> is<00:04:57.940> it's

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
main thing you need to remember is it's

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.930 
main thing you need to remember is it's
like<00:04:58.540> it's<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.260> fluid<00:04:59.590> movement<00:05:00.010> so<00:05:00.550> instead<00:05:00.880> of

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
like it's a fluid movement so instead of

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.400 
like it's a fluid movement so instead of
kicking<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.390> ball<00:05:01.510> up<00:05:01.690> and<00:05:01.870> then<00:05:02.110> trying<00:05:02.350> to

go around it's more that's quite if you

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.260 
go around it's more that's quite if you
see<00:05:05.050> like<00:05:05.590> what<00:05:06.190> you're<00:05:06.340> doing<00:05:06.460> there<00:05:06.790> you're
