00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
good morning on back out here at the

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.859 
good morning on back out here at the
garden<00:00:20.650> again<00:00:20.740> and<00:00:21.390> I've<00:00:22.390> had<00:00:22.570> a<00:00:22.599> few

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
garden again and I've had a few

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.740 
garden again and I've had a few
questions<00:00:23.500> about<00:00:23.949> what<00:00:24.880> I<00:00:24.910> used<00:00:25.270> to<00:00:25.390> keep<00:00:25.570> the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
questions about what I used to keep the

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.920 
questions about what I used to keep the
deer<00:00:25.900> out<00:00:26.140> of<00:00:26.259> the<00:00:26.320> garden<00:00:27.060> I've<00:00:28.060> got<00:00:28.450> kind<00:00:28.750> of

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
deer out of the garden I've got kind of

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.609 
deer out of the garden I've got kind of
a<00:00:29.130> unusual<00:00:30.130> but<00:00:30.369> effective<00:00:30.430> approach<00:00:31.590> what<00:00:32.590> I

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
a unusual but effective approach what I

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.790 
a unusual but effective approach what I
use<00:00:33.010> is<00:00:33.309> I<00:00:33.430> Drive<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.970> posts<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:34.720> just<00:00:35.470> like<00:00:35.620> I

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
use is I Drive the posts and just like I

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.390 
use is I Drive the posts and just like I
would<00:00:35.860> be<00:00:36.670> putting<00:00:36.940> up<00:00:37.090> a<00:00:37.210> regular<00:00:37.629> fence<00:00:38.400> but

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
would be putting up a regular fence but

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.540 
would be putting up a regular fence but
instead<00:00:39.760> of<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:40.030> fence

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
instead of the fence

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.710 
instead of the fence
shredded<00:00:42.629> where<00:00:43.629> you<00:00:43.809> can<00:00:43.989> see<00:00:44.230> this<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:44.970> use<00:00:45.970> 30

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
shredded where you can see this I use 30

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.869 
shredded where you can see this I use 30
pound<00:00:47.110> test<00:00:47.309> monofilament<00:00:48.309> fish<00:00:49.090> line<00:00:50.879> now

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
pound test monofilament fish line now

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.110 
pound test monofilament fish line now
what<00:00:52.270> I<00:00:52.300> recommend<00:00:52.539> doing<00:00:52.989> is<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.950> use<00:00:54.190> one

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
what I recommend doing is to use one

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.760 
what I recommend doing is to use one
strand<00:00:55.600> about<00:00:57.420> 12<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.719> 18<00:00:59.110> inches<00:00:59.289> off<00:00:59.739> the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
strand about 12 to 18 inches off the

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.040 
strand about 12 to 18 inches off the
ground<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:01.059> next<00:01:01.270> one<00:01:01.570> about<00:01:01.690> 24<00:01:02.440> inches<00:01:03.030> 36

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
ground the next one about 24 inches 36

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.700 
ground the next one about 24 inches 36
and<00:01:05.050> 48<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:06.690> just<00:01:07.690> have<00:01:07.869> two<00:01:08.080> strands<00:01:08.470> around

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
and 48 I just have two strands around

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.300 
and 48 I just have two strands around
here<00:01:09.130> right<00:01:09.369> now<00:01:09.610> but<00:01:10.539> I'll<00:01:11.500> add<00:01:11.800> a<00:01:11.830> few<00:01:11.920> more

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
here right now but I'll add a few more

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.560 
here right now but I'll add a few more
as<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.610> green<00:01:12.850> beans<00:01:13.119> come<00:01:13.450> up<00:01:15.300> but<00:01:16.300> I<00:01:16.330> had<00:01:16.539> a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
as the green beans come up but I had a

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.050 
as the green beans come up but I had a
lot<00:01:16.840> of<00:01:16.869> problems<00:01:17.350> with<00:01:17.619> deer<00:01:18.490> getting<00:01:18.820> in<00:01:18.910> the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
lot of problems with deer getting in the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.210 
lot of problems with deer getting in the
yard<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.390> begin<00:01:19.690> with<00:01:19.929> I<00:01:20.259> tried<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.740> electric

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
yard to begin with I tried the electric

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.140 
yard to begin with I tried the electric
fence<00:01:21.460> route<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:23.670> pretty<00:01:24.670> much<00:01:24.820> everything

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
fence route and pretty much everything

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.120 
fence route and pretty much everything
else<00:01:26.909> didn't<00:01:27.909> really<00:01:28.210> work<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.450> well<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
else didn't really work that well the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.160 
else didn't really work that well the
fish<00:01:30.400> line<00:01:31.560> 30<00:01:32.560> pound<00:01:32.950> test<00:01:33.630> seems<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.780> be<00:01:34.900> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
fish line 30 pound test seems to be the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.179 
fish line 30 pound test seems to be the
ideal<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:37.689> pretty<00:01:38.350> much<00:01:38.560> based<00:01:38.890> on<00:01:39.130> the

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
ideal and it's pretty much based on the

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.560 
ideal and it's pretty much based on the
the<00:01:40.090> deers<00:01:40.470> eyesight<00:01:43.680> as<00:01:44.680> they<00:01:44.979> will<00:01:45.570> they

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
the deers eyesight as they will they

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.260 
the deers eyesight as they will they
won't<00:01:46.810> see<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.970> at<00:01:48.970> that<00:01:49.590> diameter<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:52.090> they

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
won't see it at that diameter but they

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.899 
won't see it at that diameter but they
can<00:01:52.450> feel<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:52.930> and<00:01:53.200> what<00:01:54.130> happens<00:01:54.549> is<00:01:54.729> that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
can feel it and what happens is that

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.370 
can feel it and what happens is that
they<00:01:55.689> brush<00:01:56.259> against<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.130> spooks<00:01:57.549> them

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
they brush against it and spooks them

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.060 
they brush against it and spooks them
and<00:01:59.380> they<00:02:00.219> just<00:02:00.460> back<00:02:00.759> off<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.799> another<00:02:02.799> thing

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
and they just back off and another thing

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.090 
and they just back off and another thing
with<00:02:03.310> deer<00:02:03.640> is<00:02:03.820> they<00:02:04.030> won't<00:02:04.590> attempt<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.799> jump

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
with deer is they won't attempt to jump

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.150 
with deer is they won't attempt to jump
something<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.869> they<00:02:08.170> can't<00:02:08.440> see<00:02:08.649> how<00:02:08.679> high<00:02:09.130> it

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
something if they can't see how high it

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.430 
something if they can't see how high it
is<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.430> they<00:02:12.850> won't<00:02:13.000> try<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.690> jump<00:02:14.079> the<00:02:14.230> fish

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
is so they won't try to jump the fish

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.130 
is so they won't try to jump the fish
line

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.430 

try<00:02:17.800> different<00:02:18.060> size<00:02:19.060> lines<00:02:19.540> smaller<00:02:20.170> and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
try different size lines smaller and

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.670 
try different size lines smaller and
larger<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.970> what<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.210> ran<00:02:22.510> into<00:02:22.960> was<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> smaller

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
larger and what I ran into was a smaller

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.510 
larger and what I ran into was a smaller
line<00:02:24.040> they<00:02:25.000> tend<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.860> put<00:02:26.860> enough<00:02:27.070> pressure<00:02:27.280> on

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
line they tend to put enough pressure on

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.410 
line they tend to put enough pressure on
it<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.910> break<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.390> before<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.290> actually

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
it to break it before that it actually

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.850 
it to break it before that it actually
causes<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.600> resistance<00:02:32.140> for<00:02:32.380> them<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.620> feel

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
causes and resistance for them to feel

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.449 
causes and resistance for them to feel
it<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.660> with<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> larger<00:02:35.170> line<00:02:35.440> they're<00:02:36.280> able

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
it and with a larger line they're able

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.280 
it and with a larger line they're able
to<00:02:36.670> see<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:38.490> now<00:02:39.490> one<00:02:39.820> problem<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.630> people

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
to see it now one problem that people

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.630 
to see it now one problem that people
runs<00:02:41.740> into<00:02:42.190> using<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:44.250> they<00:02:45.250> said<00:02:45.520> it

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
runs into using this is they said it

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.490 
runs into using this is they said it
didn't<00:02:45.910> work<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.390> come<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.720> find<00:02:46.750> out<00:02:47.140> they

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
didn't work and come to find out they

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.090 
didn't work and come to find out they
had<00:02:47.650> tied<00:02:48.900> strips<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.050> cloth<00:02:50.260> ribbon<00:02:50.739> or

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
had tied strips of cloth ribbon or

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.920 
had tied strips of cloth ribbon or
something<00:02:51.489> on<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.640> streamers<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:55.450> mark<00:02:55.750> the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
something on it streamers to mark the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.550 
something on it streamers to mark the
wire<00:02:56.140> or<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:56.980> mark<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.340> string<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.560> that

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
wire or to mark the string and that

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.229 
wire or to mark the string and that
pretty<00:02:59.770> much<00:02:59.860> just<00:03:00.040> defeated<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.790> purpose

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
pretty much just defeated the purpose

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.000 
pretty much just defeated the purpose
because<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.720> also<00:03:01.870> showed<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.350> deer<00:03:02.709> words

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
because it also showed the deer words

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.260 
because it also showed the deer words
out<00:03:05.190> so<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:07.680> tell<00:03:08.680> them<00:03:08.830> don't<00:03:09.160> put<00:03:09.610> anything<00:03:09.850> on

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
out so I tell them don't put anything on

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.199 
out so I tell them don't put anything on
there<00:03:10.480> because<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.959> don't<00:03:11.260> want<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> deer<00:03:11.800> to

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
there because you don't want the deer to

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.000 
there because you don't want the deer to
to<00:03:13.209> see<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.600> line<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.989> lot<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.590> people<00:03:17.860> may

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
to see the line and a lot of people may

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.130 
to see the line and a lot of people may
think<00:03:18.040> well<00:03:18.550> maybe<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.570> don't<00:03:19.780> have<00:03:19.900> any

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140
