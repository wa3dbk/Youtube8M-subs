don't<00:00:15.870> worry<00:00:16.109> everything<00:00:16.619> inside<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
don't worry everything inside of the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.519 
don't worry everything inside of the
phone<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.640> still<00:00:17.820> Liquipel<00:00:18.359> however<00:00:19.050> there's

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
phone is still Liquipel however there's

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.080 
phone is still Liquipel however there's
water<00:00:19.770> inside<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.910> take

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
water inside and so it's going to take

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.970 
water inside and so it's going to take
about<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.330> day<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.630> dry<00:00:21.960> out<00:00:22.260> now<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.590> didn't<00:00:22.949> want

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
about a day to dry out now I didn't want

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.679 
about a day to dry out now I didn't want
to<00:00:23.279> weigh<00:00:23.369> today<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.850> just<00:00:24.150> unscrewed<00:00:24.539> my

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
to weigh today so I just unscrewed my

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.240 
to weigh today so I just unscrewed my
iPhone<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.230> dabbed<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.590> up<00:00:25.680> myself

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
iPhone and dabbed it up myself

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.070 
iPhone and dabbed it up myself
however<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.269> should<00:00:27.449> probably<00:00:27.779> wait<00:00:28.050> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
however you should probably wait a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.529 
however you should probably wait a
datato<00:00:28.740> before<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.130> start<00:00:29.340> using<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:30.359> phone

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
datato before you start using your phone

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.420 
datato before you start using your phone

hear<00:00:49.320> me<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.559> sounded<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.980> swimming<00:00:50.399> pool

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
hear me it sounded like a swimming pool
naturally<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.840> filled<00:00:52.050> with

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
naturally because it was filled with

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
naturally because it was filled with
water<00:00:52.440> again<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.280> went<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:53.730> dabbed<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.120> up

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
back to normal a third piece of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.979 
back to normal a third piece of
follow-up<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> home<00:01:03.480> button<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
follow-up is the home button in the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.929 
follow-up is the home button in the
sleep/wake<00:01:04.470> button<00:01:04.500> did<00:01:04.949> not<00:01:05.129> work<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:05.850> well

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
sleep/wake button did not work very well

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.179 
sleep/wake button did not work very well
as<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.240> saw<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.540> Siri<00:01:06.960> button<00:01:07.200> or<00:01:07.710> Siri<00:01:07.950> kept

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
as you saw the Siri button or Siri kept

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.500 
as you saw the Siri button or Siri kept
coming<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.670> my<00:01:08.760> video<00:01:09.000> that's<00:01:09.240> because

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
coming on in my video that's because

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510 
coming on in my video that's because
water<00:01:09.720> did<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.290> inside<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> home<00:01:11.070> button<00:01:11.430> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
water did get inside the home button and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
water did get inside the home button and
the<00:01:11.939> connection<00:01:12.390> where<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> home<00:01:12.900> button

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the connection where the home button

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
the connection where the home button
touches<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> logic<00:01:14.040> board<00:01:14.220> had<00:01:14.610> water<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.119> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
touches the logic board had water on it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.749 
touches the logic board had water on it
so<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.470> misfired<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.369> triggering

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
so it was misfired it was triggering

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.120 
so it was misfired it was triggering
because<00:01:18.119> water<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.479> conductive<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.680> what

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
because water is conductive so what

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.399 
because water is conductive so what
happened<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.630> went<00:01:21.930> inside<00:01:22.110> there

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
happened was I just went inside there

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.960 
happened was I just went inside there
damped<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> water<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> sleep/wake

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
damped up the water and the sleep/wake

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.219 
damped up the water and the sleep/wake
button<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.390> home<00:01:24.509> button<00:01:24.540> are<00:01:24.990> fine

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
button and the home button are fine

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.890 
button and the home button are fine
however<00:01:25.920> again<00:01:26.310> it'll<00:01:26.939> probably<00:01:27.299> take<00:01:27.720> two

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
however again it'll probably take two

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.450 
however again it'll probably take two
days<00:01:28.080> for<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.530> buttons<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> come<00:01:29.130> back<00:01:29.310> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
days for your buttons to come back to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.520 
days for your buttons to come back to
normal<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.119> was<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> little<00:01:30.540> bit<00:01:30.659> weird<00:01:30.840> again<00:01:31.409> I

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
normal it was a little bit weird again I

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.840 
normal it was a little bit weird again I
went<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.860> there<00:01:31.950> dabbing<00:01:32.280> up<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.490> water<00:01:32.670> and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
and it won't go in warranty so that's

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.520 
and it won't go in warranty so that's
nice<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.720> see

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
nice to see

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.730 
nice to see
probably<00:02:25.130> not<00:02:25.480> actual<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.810> probably<00:02:27.230> does<00:02:27.440> boy

probably not actual it probably does boy
your<00:02:27.980> warranty<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:28.670> should<00:02:28.880> probably<00:02:29.030> be

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
your warranty and you should probably be

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.810 
your warranty and you should probably be
honest<00:02:29.720> about<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:29.990> but<00:02:30.500> Apple<00:02:31.370> can't<00:02:31.580> tell

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
honest about that but Apple can't tell

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.280 
honest about that but Apple can't tell
that<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.270> voided<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.570> warranty<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.110> that's

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
that it voided the warranty so that's

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.510 
that it voided the warranty so that's
certainly<00:02:33.530> something<00:02:33.620> worth<00:02:34.040> noting<00:02:34.220> and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
certainly something worth noting and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.370 
certainly something worth noting and
there's<00:02:35.030> my<00:02:35.150> follow-up<00:02:35.510> for<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.870> Liquipel

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380
