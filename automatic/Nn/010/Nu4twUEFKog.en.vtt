00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.430
 well we are on the road today with the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.059
 new mazda3 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.209
 so the third generation of the model 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.980
 now has the SKYACTIV technology 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.880
 just like the other two who have them 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.839
 preceded the sixth mass 6 and the cx-5 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.949
 now the three are equipped with it 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:29.480
 very nice car 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.530
 the tough car for outdoor kobo design 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.110
 and we put in my chain in my equipment 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.270
 all the most expensive version you can get 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.300
 we really do everything a bit on it the most 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.490
 luxury version navigation on board 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.050
 parking assistance is handy because 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.630
 you were put in parking by the low 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.450
 backwards a little effort to be able to 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.470
 overseeing parking assistance is no superfluous 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.830
 luxury 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.790
 the master has a 2 liter engine 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.140
 but she is not downsizing them 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.880
 tried that with that skyactiv 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.939
 they try to be economical with technology 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.369
 let that be one thing that is certain 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.270
 the wood is light light becoming one 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.329
 segment in box design better 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.640
 aerodynamics using skyactiv technology 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.549
 ensures that fuel consumption and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.140
 a pathetic down is adjusted 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.730
 yes I drive a 16 16 what is 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.250
 have now found on average 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.820
 is really neat just a round 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:38.640
 look outside at how they are at all 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.640
 parts do behave a bit 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.100
 the 2 liters 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.480
 2 liters used 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.260
 sends wonderfully direct 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.190
 it right there 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.120
 we send 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.030
 want 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.970
 publication with the driver is real 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.970
 very much like football and car 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.700
 a poor man 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.349
 used to be 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.370
 be frugal is nice mercury finger it 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.659
 gas pedal 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.659
 comes the very little mystery 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.480
 pretty drained to the side without 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.820
 so tight shirt so delicious 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.950
 sharp edges 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.290
 I posted better 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.290
 the green I have 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.040
 well with the system and grandma most 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:49.730
 driver 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:49.730
 nothing at all for sufficient legroom 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.030
 high chair 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.699
 she sits against a hard back 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.180
 from the front seat otherwise you can 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.180
 yummy 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:09.739
 punctual treaty is sufficient 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:09.739
 main room 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.749
 cup holders 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:28.189
 the right back she then has that more 

00:05:23.579 --> 00:05:28.189
 space becomes more liters of luggage space 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.379
 trunk 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:40.489
 I photo here 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.610
 of course 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.490
 previously the cx-5 and the mass 6 were all of these 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.920
 design 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.100
 Which 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.889
 design and technology 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.460
 120 hp version 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.460
 session 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.840

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.849
 for this 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.770
 aldermen and 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.330
