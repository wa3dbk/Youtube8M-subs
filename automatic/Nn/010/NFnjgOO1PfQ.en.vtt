00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 good friends of the channel I am good animal 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.120
 today I bring you a guide of the champion 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.849
 kyle in the single top and as you know a 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.799
 pretty funny character because 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.049
 has a lot of style of play can play 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.480
 as much as hybrid as super character 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.789
 and as of time or I will explain in your 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.230
 single top function first let's 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.390
 start by explaining your skills 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070
 we started with his passive when qaeda 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.210
 is with champion this loses a 3 for 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.550
 hundred are greater than their resistance 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.769
 magic for 5% for 5 seconds 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.650
 in effect always as use up to 5 times 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.810
 let's show it when I come to Olaf 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.880
 you will see how his armor if left to dry 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.930
 it goes down you see every time you 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.730
 you see more going down 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.340
 then the next life that we have is 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.610
 the righteous blast when we throw it 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.940
 the goal is a ball that you will see now 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.130
 target receives magic damage and also what 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.110
 let's slow down you will see how it 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.260
 the champion slows down 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.180
 As you can see, it's going slower and that way it will be more 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.710
 easy footwear in the single top after 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.809
 we have the ability divine blessing 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.410
 that will not only help us a lot 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.730
 gain speed movement as you see 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.340
 increases our movement speed and 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.650
 will help us escape or fight too 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.810
 then we have a skill that is the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.430
 righteous fury that what it does is that 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.650
 our sword to the channel magic damage 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.330
 additional ie each attack is basic 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.070
 we want to give magic damage and also 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.650
 we gain rank to hit with our 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.680
 attacks you will see me right now we have 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.479
 more range and we also reduce their armor 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.430
 because it combines very well with its passive 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.080
 with stability that we do very well to 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.970
 the champions above since the 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.369
 Most often plays a very close 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.630
 body bodies with this character what 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.670
 we will do it in a distant way then we have 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.220
 the definitive one as you know if I see 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.750
 example the app starts hitting me 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.399
 threatening a lot I can throw my 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.550
 definitive and I am immune to any damage 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.380
 I could escape with my healing and 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.210
 get away 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.620
 as you have seen it is very easy very 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.410
 simple I'm going to tell you about the equipment 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.790
 I'm going back to base so you can see it 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.030
 identified exactly how it should be 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.590
 equip a street only top first 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.320
 as always we will start with boots 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.820
 speed and potions of life then you 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.130
 I personally recommend that you get caught 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.020
 durÃ¡n sword milestones by the fact 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.570
 that kan ice life attack damage and theft 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.690
 of life would win is 6% life robbery 20 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.040
 of attack damage and more 160 is comes very 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.800
 well to hold perfectly the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.390
 lines to keep the line better if 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.680
 you have problems with the swords you can 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.280
 get all three positions and you'll go 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.870
 left over 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.790
 then we will remove the strands should be 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.700
 that comes in handy for the movement 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.020
 improved and the speed attack then the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.940
 first object that we lived from pineapple would be 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.380
 the infinite because the infinite like 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.740
 we are going to make an of town 'only 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.300
 all good more than we choose as a tps 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.610
 that needs to hurt and how we have 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.620
 range unlike the others 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.420
 I tango tank going up will 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.010
 hit critics a lot of attack damage 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.920
 thanks our life 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.690
 and we will keep at a distance then you 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.030
 I recommend that you get a scepter 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.850
 vampiric to steal life from our 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.600
 rivals and better endure later in the 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.310
 600 credits 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.320
 The following way I recommend you more 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.730
 personally that you make attack already 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.700
 that we play the distance they are not going to 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.380
 catch a lot in iu and others we can catch 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.500
 for example, the dancer 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.060
 spectral as you know not to know if the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.790
 attack or be of critical impact that 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.440
 It comes very well with critics and 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.880
 movement speed then also 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.460
 we can catch the last words 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.320
 as you know the last words gives us 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.200
 the penetration of the mature and it goes very well 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.629
 with our passive 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.620
 then we would see the black blade the 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.709
 assessment fee and well because 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.700
 also reduces armor when we have 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.989
 last black words that you can 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.700
 invest process 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.610
 black that the last one is for you can 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.680
 do you will see that the enemies do not 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.209
 have armor in the tanks and go to 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.860
 kill any very objective 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.530
 quickly 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.720
 then sometimes you can catch these four 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.950
 objects plus the boots that are five the 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.960
 last object that I always recommend 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.550
 in the bloodthirsty as are the 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.620
 bloodthirsty we will win a lot of life 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.840
 we will hold the lines very well and 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.030
 so it's going to be very easy to win the 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.320
 departure to our rivals now we are going to 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.830
 talk about what skill sequence 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.890
 we have to do at level 1 we will raise the 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.450
 righteous fury and it's going to be just not 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.700
 will serve to go up to level 1 by the 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.959
 fact that we hit at range does not interest 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.750
 only to be able to stick to rank 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.640
 our rivals at level 2 we will raise the 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.740
 blast skill righteous and it's going to be 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.930
 The first thing we are going to prioritize is the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.060
 next reason with this skill 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.100
 we are going to slow down the objectives and not 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.500
 it will be much easier to hunt down rivals 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.180
 then at level 3 we will raise the blessing 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.000
 divine only for the following reason 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.919
 it interests you to move only more 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.330
 fast once it's worth only we'll go up 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.250
 once to move faster after 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.110
 and you will tell me that then that 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.960
 second second price will 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.780
 prioritize the justicial fury to hit 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.430
 more additional damage while we have to 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.289
 the enemies set apart as you know 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.300
 also the righteous 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.559
 when we arrive with the Canary Islands and we do 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.589
 damage in area and it will not come very well 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:04.539
 then the definitive one will be the intervention 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:06.699
 as you know from lesson will be respected 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.039
 always its definitive then how is it 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.990
 precisely explained it goes up level 1 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.449
 the second thing we will do this what 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.129
 we will think first of all and this level 4 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.499
 I will forgive him at level 3 of we will go up 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.539
 as always the effective will be respected 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:22.389

 what it takes to fall and the combo 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.990
 it's quite simple the combo is the one 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:31.990
 no mystery is to hunt enemy with 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.209
 the one that hit him with the e and finally that 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.189
 put put to escape or to enter 

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.360
 combat when we are in the middle of 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.789
 combat we can go to the intervention 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.080
 to save us or to also give 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.969
 return to combat is to say if both 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.800
 are waiting at the same time you can create 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.319
 intervention in the middle of the battle for 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.259
