and in this tutorial we're going to be

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.570 
and in this tutorial we're going to be
taking<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.880> look<00:00:09.000> at<00:00:09.269> windows<00:00:09.809> forms<00:00:10.260> now<00:00:10.860> I'm

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
taking a look at windows forms now I'm

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.980 
taking a look at windows forms now I'm
sure<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.000> all<00:00:12.120> been<00:00:12.300> waiting<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.630> really<00:00:12.660> long

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
sure you all been waiting a really long

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.350 
sure you all been waiting a really long
time<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.830> windows<00:00:14.250> forms<00:00:14.670> tutorial<00:00:15.150> and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
time for the windows forms tutorial and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.480 
time for the windows forms tutorial and
I<00:00:16.109> felt<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.619> was<00:00:16.740> better<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.039> start<00:00:17.250> from<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
I felt it was better to start from the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.790 
I felt it was better to start from the
console<00:00:17.880> level<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.480> all<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> code

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
console level so that all of the code

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.609 
console level so that all of the code
generated<00:00:20.310> generated<00:00:21.090> by<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.300> windows<00:00:22.289> forms

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
generated generated by the windows forms

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.859 
generated generated by the windows forms
applications<00:00:23.220> project<00:00:23.730> wouldn't<00:00:24.390> confuse

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
applications project wouldn't confuse

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.920 
applications project wouldn't confuse
you<00:00:25.189> so<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.460> from<00:00:26.640> now<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:26.880> we're<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.869> to

make<00:00:28.080> all<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> our<00:00:28.529> applications<00:00:29.160> with

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
make all of our applications with

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.880 
make all of our applications with

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
basically what Visual Basic does is when

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.210 
basically what Visual Basic does is when
you<00:01:26.490> add<00:01:26.990> stuff<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.290> window<00:01:28.590> or<00:01:28.829> resize

the window it automatically generates

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.340 
the window it automatically generates
code<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.979> designer<00:01:32.400> file<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.420> creates<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
code in a designer file that creates the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.170 
code in a designer file that creates the
buttons<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.100> list<00:01:35.400> or<00:01:35.610> whatever<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.970> want

value now you'd never want to leave this
as<00:02:52.470> button<00:02:52.860> one<00:02:53.070> because<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.790> could<00:02:53.910> confuse

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
as button one because that could confuse

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.570 
as button one because that could confuse
you<00:02:54.510> later<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:55.530> you're<00:02:55.800> making<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
you later on when you're making the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.130 
you later on when you're making the
program<00:02:56.790> bigger<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.390> adding<00:02:57.660> more<00:02:57.750> code<00:02:57.989> to

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
program bigger and adding more code to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.540 
program bigger and adding more code to
it<00:02:58.260> you'll<00:02:58.350> be<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:59.030> what's<00:03:00.030> button<00:03:00.390> 1<00:03:00.600> where

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
it you'll be like what's button 1 where

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.979 
it you'll be like what's button 1 where
where<00:03:02.550> is<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.760> what<00:03:03.239> does<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.390> say<00:03:03.660> what<00:03:03.870> does

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
where is it what does it say what does

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.840 
where is it what does it say what does
it<00:03:04.019> do<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:05.040> we're<00:03:05.190> just<00:03:05.220> going<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.489> change<00:03:05.730> the

it do so we're just going to change the
text<00:03:06.090> value<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.569> this<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:07.080> button<00:03:07.709> another

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
text value of this to button another

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.120 
text value of this to button another
text<00:03:08.670> value<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.090> name<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.600> this<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:10.769> button

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
text value the name of this to button

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.670 
text value the name of this to button
say<00:03:11.430> hello<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.540> whenever<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:12.989> access<00:03:13.470> this

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
say hello so whenever we access this

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.190 
say hello so whenever we access this
button<00:03:14.069> from<00:03:14.280> our<00:03:14.400> code<00:03:14.640> we'll<00:03:15.540> know<00:03:15.870> what<00:03:16.080> it

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
button from our code we'll know what it

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.910 
button from our code we'll know what it
is<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.650> what<00:03:16.860> it<00:03:16.980> does<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:19.320> access<00:03:19.709> the

is and what it does so to access the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.860 
is and what it does so to access the
code<00:03:20.100> for<00:03:20.430> our<00:03:20.459> form<00:03:20.820> 1<00:03:21.030> we<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.630> just<00:03:21.750> go<00:03:21.840> ahead

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
code for our form 1 we can just go ahead

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.650 
code for our form 1 we can just go ahead
and<00:03:22.260> double<00:03:22.709> click<00:03:22.890> on<00:03:23.190> form<00:03:23.519> 1<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.600> can

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
and double click on form 1 and you can

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.390 
and double click on form 1 and you can
see<00:03:24.780> here<00:03:25.230> let<00:03:25.500> me<00:03:25.560> close<00:03:25.709> out<00:03:25.860> of<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.040> toolbox

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
see here let me close out of the toolbox

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.680 
see here let me close out of the toolbox
that<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:27.600> creates<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.880> sub<00:03:29.880> right<00:03:30.150> here<00:03:30.329> for<00:03:30.570> us

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
that it creates a sub right here for us

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.020 
that it creates a sub right here for us
that<00:03:31.410> is<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.070> form<00:03:32.370> 1<00:03:32.549> load

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
that is the form 1 load

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.449 
that is the form 1 load
so<00:03:33.480> whenever<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.930> form<00:03:34.170> 1<00:03:34.380> is<00:03:34.620> open<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.370> it

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
so whenever the form 1 is open and it

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.180 
so whenever the form 1 is open and it
has<00:03:35.610> loaded<00:03:35.880> then<00:03:36.600> go<00:03:36.780> ahead<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.200> do<00:03:37.950> what's

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
has loaded then go ahead and do what's

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.069 
has loaded then go ahead and do what's
inside<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.579> this<00:03:38.790> son<00:03:39.090> now<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.840> can<00:03:39.959> see

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
inside of this son now you can see

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.170 
inside of this son now you can see
there's<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.320> bunch<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.799> stuff<00:03:41.010> here<00:03:41.310> you

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
there's a bunch of stuff here you

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.150 
there's a bunch of stuff here you
probably<00:03:42.359> don't<00:03:42.660> understand<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.470> don't

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
probably don't understand that I don't

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.590 
probably don't understand that I don't
expect<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.670> to<00:03:44.700> understand<00:03:45.150> that<00:03:45.209> yet<00:03:45.450> but
