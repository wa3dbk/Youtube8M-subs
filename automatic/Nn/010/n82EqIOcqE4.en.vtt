00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.610
 Hello dear samodelyshchiki 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.849
 many of you have come across such 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:13.929
 problems when and before great ceases 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:18.070
 raise the pump operates like Hitch 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:21.790
 not rising one of the reasons which 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:26.650
 it happens when it comes across 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:28.630
 market between the drain valve and its 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.840
 saddle ie drain valve 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.190
 represents such a detail means it 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.859
 the piston and the valve itself i have it 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.659
 the locking surface which is adjacent to 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:48.159
 light and mote or hair falls 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:51.640
 it is here and so on the distributor 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:53.679
 this valve is right under this 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.329
 stub and means and 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:01:02.729
 this is a stub which is exactly this 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.049
 back end means to 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.299
 prevent this problem i you 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.930
 I propose to make one very simple 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:14.799
 a device that is very guise 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.079
 It makes your life easier then this is 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.590
 the top hole is the drain line 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:25.570
 on which she dresses 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 this angle with the tube so I mean to you 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.600
 I propose to modify it a little bit 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.390
 there is in this squares need to drill 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.579
 hole with a diameter of 10 millimeters and 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.979
 it is desirable to cut in it a thread 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:49.509
 small 10 step 1 further means to bring 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:52.810
 here tick and drive the thread further 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:59.399
 it means all this to complement it 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:01.890
 rod which is made from bar 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.659
 10 millimeters and at one end 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.679
 thread is cut all this is selected 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.950
 empirically further when Gadget 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.150
 welded thread carved 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:20.280
 this stock still forgot on the one hand 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:25.390
 here they drank a hole under the screwdriver 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:34.060
 further we screw this rod into this 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:43.860
 square and fasten it on your 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:43.860
 distributors mean its length and 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:54.340
 measured from top surface to 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:03:02.280
 the emphasis in the valve the essence of the problem is that 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:05.250
 means when you work need means when 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.650
 the engine is running and the pump is spinning 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.760
 take a screwdriver and just plain this 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.620
 return the stem all the way and compress the spring 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.430
 to valve 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.470
 walked away from c2 just a stream of oil 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.950
 this is just a speck that got 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:28.030
 between valve seat and valve seat 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.420
 it is washed out further you turn away from 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.060
 everything 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.780
 there is a gap between the stem and the valve 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.970
 and everything returns to its original position 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.190
 then usually the system 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.290
 again coming to work 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:50.579
 state also here after need means 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:53.560
 screw the lock-on and the gap between 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:56.680
 welded nut and mean which 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.560
 locknut anything sealed by 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.639
 climb uplay or rezinochkoy because 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.489
 when working in this highway there is at least 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:09.669
 slight but pressure and if that 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.859
 the seal will not do in this place will 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.430
 oozing oil 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:17.260
 well that's all wish you good luck 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.970
 I hope that this advice you very much 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.889
 make life easier hydraulics usually 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.969
 work refuse we do not need 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.460
 This device allows you to quickly 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:34.469
 restore its performance not 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:38.099
 disassembling and not flush the hydraulic system 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:38.099
 Thanks for attention
