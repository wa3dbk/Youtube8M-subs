going to cause a whole new wave for halo

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.160 
going to cause a whole new wave for halo
right<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> don't<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.719> people<00:01:54.990> play

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
right I don't know what people play

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.749 
right I don't know what people play
online<00:01:55.350> anymore<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.009> spent<00:01:56.280> most<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.609> my<00:01:56.670> time

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
online anymore I spent most of my time

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.080 
online anymore I spent most of my time
playing<00:01:57.329> reach<00:01:57.719> online<00:01:58.369> in<00:01:59.369> terms<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.789> halo

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
playing reach online in terms of halo

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.419 
playing reach online in terms of halo
but<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.360> feel<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.740> I'm<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.189> spending

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
but I feel like I'm going to be spending

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.330 
but I feel like I'm going to be spending
a<00:02:02.700> lot<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:03.179> time<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.929> halo<00:02:04.259> 2<00:02:04.319> multiplayer<00:02:04.859> and

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
a lot of time and halo 2 multiplayer and

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.980 
a lot of time and halo 2 multiplayer and
it<00:02:05.609> wouldn't<00:02:05.850> surprise<00:02:05.969> me<00:02:06.209> if<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.689> rest<00:02:06.869> of

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it wouldn't surprise me if the rest of

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:16.090 
it wouldn't surprise me if the rest of
the<00:02:07.049> world<00:02:07.200> does<00:02:07.259> something<00:02:07.740> similar

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.630 

unfortunately<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.130> guess<00:02:17.310> that's<00:02:17.490> all<00:02:17.610> I

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
unfortunately I guess that's all I

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.250 
unfortunately I guess that's all I
really<00:02:17.790> have<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.060> say<00:02:18.300> about<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:18.930> it's

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
really have to say about that it's it's

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.590 
really have to say about that it's it's
halo<00:02:19.620> 2<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.160> prettier<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.700> I'm<00:02:21.060> happy<00:02:21.510> about

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
halo 2 but prettier and I'm happy about

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.550 
halo 2 but prettier and I'm happy about
that<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:23.310> Halo<00:02:23.790> fans<00:02:24.030> will<00:02:24.450> probably<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:25.200> just

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
that so Halo fans will probably be just

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.590 
that so Halo fans will probably be just
as<00:02:25.770> happy<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:26.550> definitely<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> lot<00:02:27.450> to
