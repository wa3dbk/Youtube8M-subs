00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
out and you see Judy when I was running

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.330 
out and you see Judy when I was running
this<00:03:40.450> to<00:03:40.690> give<00:03:40.840> like<00:03:41.049> a<00:03:41.079> more<00:03:41.350> permanent<00:03:41.709> curl

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
this to give like a more permanent curl

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.729 
this to give like a more permanent curl
to<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.670> hair<00:03:42.940> I<00:03:43.209> put<00:03:44.200> I<00:03:45.450> Flatiron<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:47.019> or<00:03:47.260> put

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
to the hair I put I Flatiron it or put

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.819 
to the hair I put I Flatiron it or put
you<00:03:47.920> know<00:03:48.040> so<00:03:48.280> put<00:03:48.489> some<00:03:49.060> heat<00:03:49.329> onto<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.650> hair

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
you know so put some heat onto the hair

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.390 
you know so put some heat onto the hair
first<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.370> then<00:03:51.579> I<00:03:51.730> put<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.510> rod<00:03:53.160> rods<00:03:54.160> on

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
first and then I put the rod rods on

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.930 
first and then I put the rod rods on
there<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.510> guess<00:03:55.720> you'll<00:03:56.109> have<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.440> more

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
there so I guess you'll have a more

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.990 
there so I guess you'll have a more
permanent<00:03:57.940> curl<00:03:58.769> well<00:03:59.769> as<00:04:00.600> best

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
