00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.560
 Roman seemed what your weekend 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.190
 that's a lot of training 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.570
 very good workout 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.710
 with I do not hurt too much 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.000
 recovery 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.730
 balneo g1 who docks 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.080
 me there it's really access up 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.900
 Friday 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.350
 separation 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.350
 100% 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.210
 it's quite intensive 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.559
 you feel that fatigue anyway 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.969
 I have a little tired but what is there 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.289
 is that the goal is getting closer 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.460
 now I am more calm week 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.740
 so that's not it's not there that I have 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.260
 begins to 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.579
 to crack and then then also the euphoria 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.409
 also from 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.690
 the aunt of the clause that makes it 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.010
 pass it well 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.430
 it is true that it is hard but I say to myself 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.430
 five days 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:08.100
 I'm going to go to the forest 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.420
 what do you mean 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:34.330
 fourth is good what is he going 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:34.330
 find in Corsican then zay 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.970
 Monday that's what I say it's the 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.680
 hot pleasure session 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.710
 normally there is music for 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.570
 the time my family compared to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.370
 sessions in France is still the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:18.960
 sitting the cool session here and here 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:21.390
 so there ok it's good it's not so cool 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.600
 than that but I have more hard of my week 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.550
 as it's still my job when 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.680
 even we are not there for him but it's 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:46.069
 clear 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:50.120
 ok we also know actually if the meaning 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.120
 well and that quietly 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.680
 here is the canvas it is not always a 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.680
 paragliding opposition 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.630
 thériault 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.160
 I have the impression 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.940
 it's a little more patient 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:58.510
 the 12 10 and europe 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.510
 I was thinking 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.300
 sipartech that is looming rather 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.880
 shareholders very short with very 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.840
 little recule so here are two blocks 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.840
 13 minutes 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:22.320
 the jme the bandana so normally that 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:25.040
 heats up is that's the sentence 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.389
 of the day that's when Roman and the bandana 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.760
 okay okay 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:35.050
 it's going to heat a fashion I'm trying 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:39.760
 to introduce him his part not yet 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:44.250
 exchange rate and that customers face 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.250
 a little warrior on the thigh 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.949
 well placed 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:26.570
 well before life we ​​can feel 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:28.490
 seven days alone is quite 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.210
 good pictures no no I do not have these 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.360
 qualities you I stayed placed that 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.360
 given 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.390
 although the training berne did a 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.980
 good day it was a day too 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.770
 where we were able to share so 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.169
 it was good that after that we continue 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.349
 still not loose training anything and 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.770
 still the beautiful beautiful sessions to come 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.889
 so 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.319
 there must he rest who take the 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.479
 recovery time and then he gets 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.430
 quietly preparing for the deadline 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:04.840
 supreme our supreme goal 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.639
 here we will see well so one day the 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.099
 A word from the end is a day 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.360
 plus a day even closer to the 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.100
 european championships coming 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.110
 now 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.270
 in 13 days so here I give an appointment 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.970

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.380

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.680
 surprise a good result here it was 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.680
 The final word 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.050
 we are in the tent 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:38.650
 hope is always reborn surprise 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.650
 chef's surprise 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:52.050
 the series audition that becomes funny 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:55.230

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.360
 warming up web as well as I have a little 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:01.080
 penis training actually be 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.090
 music one motivates a little in that one 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.550
 it reminds me of the human being 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.580
 julie the holiday break a ball in 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.580
 the air 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.540
 that motivates 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.150
 it's a message to Benjamin you can 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.529
 to pass the biggest defeat in 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.679
 my head 

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:24.159

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:24.159
