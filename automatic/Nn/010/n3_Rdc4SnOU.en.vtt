00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.320 

we<00:00:01.319> were<00:00:01.530> doing<00:00:01.920> work<00:00:02.129> in<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.429> yard<00:00:02.580> so<00:00:03.300> I

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
we were doing work in the yard so I

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.870 
we were doing work in the yard so I
decided<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:04.049> make<00:00:04.080> a<00:00:04.230> trellis<00:00:09.950> we<00:00:10.950> cut<00:00:11.219> back<00:00:11.519> a

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
decided to make a trellis we cut back a

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.780 
decided to make a trellis we cut back a
lot<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.420> bushes<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:12.870> our<00:00:13.139> yard<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.790> this

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
lot of the bushes in our yard and this

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.910 
lot of the bushes in our yard and this
produced<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.480> lot<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.660> very<00:00:15.990> long<00:00:16.320> straight

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
produced a lot of very long straight

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.160 
produced a lot of very long straight
branches

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.580 

I<00:00:20.880> chose<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.150> longest<00:00:22.690> and<00:00:22.930> straightest

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
I chose the longest and straightest

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.070 
I chose the longest and straightest
branches<00:00:24.160> and<00:00:24.369> cut<00:00:25.060> off<00:00:25.240> all<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.779> little

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
branches and cut off all the little

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.560 
branches and cut off all the little
extra<00:00:26.680> twigs<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.550> leaves

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.430 

I<00:00:30.949> first<00:00:31.949> laid<00:00:32.250> out<00:00:32.460> before<00:00:32.810> longest<00:00:33.810> branches

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
I first laid out before longest branches

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.610 
I first laid out before longest branches
to<00:00:34.980> make<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> rectangular<00:00:35.910> frame<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:37.320> I

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
to make a rectangular frame then I

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.130 
to make a rectangular frame then I
arranged<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.850> rest<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> branches<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.020> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
arranged the rest of the branches in a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.300 
arranged the rest of the branches in a
crisscross<00:00:40.470> pattern

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.310 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.080 

I<00:00:44.750> cut<00:00:45.750> pieces<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.410> twine<00:00:46.620> about<00:00:47.310> arm's<00:00:47.970> length

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
I cut pieces of twine about arm's length

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.010 
I cut pieces of twine about arm's length
and<00:00:48.630> soaked<00:00:49.500> them<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.860> water<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.240> that<00:00:51.480> after<00:00:51.990> I

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and soaked them in water so that after I

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.800 
and soaked them in water so that after I
tied<00:00:52.410> them<00:00:52.680> they<00:00:53.280> would<00:00:53.430> expand<00:00:53.970> a<00:00:54.210> little<00:00:54.240> as

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
tied them they would expand a little as

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.600 
tied them they would expand a little as
they<00:00:55.050> dried<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.740> be<00:00:56.130> tighter

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.380 

I<00:00:58.840> first<00:00:59.840> tied<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.500> corner<00:01:00.920> pieces<00:01:01.360> then<00:01:02.360> I

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
I first tied the corner pieces then I

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.020 
I first tied the corner pieces then I
made<00:01:02.750> sure<00:01:02.780> all<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.740> branches<00:01:04.100> had<00:01:05.000> a

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
made sure all of the branches had a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.860 
made sure all of the branches had a
cross<00:01:05.420> at<00:01:05.870> even<00:01:06.650> intervals<00:01:06.830> I<00:01:07.550> had<00:01:08.330> two<00:01:08.600> pieces

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
cross at even intervals I had two pieces

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.070 
cross at even intervals I had two pieces
that<00:01:09.800> had<00:01:09.980> no<00:01:10.310> other<00:01:10.580> stick<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:11.630> cross

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.920 

tying<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> little<00:01:17.160> bit<00:01:17.310> difficult<00:01:17.550> I<00:01:18.150> laid

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
tying was a little bit difficult I laid

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.860 
tying was a little bit difficult I laid
the<00:01:19.110> string<00:01:19.410> under<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.160> branches

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
the string under all the branches

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.980 
the string under all the branches
crossed<00:01:21.870> it<00:01:22.230> over<00:01:22.880> tied<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.090> pull<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.600> tight

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
crossed it over tied it pull it tight

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.320 
crossed it over tied it pull it tight
and<00:01:25.260> then<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.130> wrapped<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.700> around<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and then I wrapped it around the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.870 
and then I wrapped it around the
opposite<00:01:27.930> side<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> branches<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.220> did

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
opposite side of the branches and did

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.690 
opposite side of the branches and did
the<00:01:30.000> same<00:01:30.030> thing<00:01:30.300> I<00:01:30.810> did<00:01:31.620> this<00:01:32.010> so<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the same thing I did this so that the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.940 
the same thing I did this so that the
string<00:01:32.910> would<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.420> around<00:01:33.570> each<00:01:34.140> set<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
string would go around each set of the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.570 
string would go around each set of the
branches<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.900> end<00:01:37.080> I<00:01:37.410> double-knotted<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
branches at the end I double-knotted it

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.570 
branches at the end I double-knotted it
to<00:01:38.910> make<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.210> really<00:01:39.570> tight

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.240 

so<00:01:45.580> when<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.000> was<00:01:46.270> finished<00:01:46.720> with<00:01:46.870> tying<00:01:47.770> it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
so when I was finished with tying it

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.280 
so when I was finished with tying it
looks<00:01:48.729> something<00:01:48.940> like<00:01:49.150> this<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.990> string

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
looks something like this the string

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.260 
looks something like this the string
wrapped<00:01:50.560> around<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:51.100> branches<00:01:51.310> in<00:01:51.850> several

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
wrapped around the branches in several

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.240 
wrapped around the branches in several
different<00:01:52.420> directions<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.350> made<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:53.950> really

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
different directions and made a really

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.109 
different directions and made a really
nice<00:01:54.700> tight<00:01:55.270> connection

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.709 

twine<00:02:01.119> has<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:01.689> very<00:02:02.110> rough<00:02:02.490> texture<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.729> when

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
twine has a very rough texture and when

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.190 
twine has a very rough texture and when
it<00:02:04.840> was<00:02:04.869> wet<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.560> made<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.310> even<00:02:06.689> rougher<00:02:07.689> on<00:02:07.899> my

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
it was wet it made it even rougher on my

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.630 
it was wet it made it even rougher on my
hands<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.280> got<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.580> few<00:02:10.000> blisters

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.760 

maybe<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.730> didn't<00:02:15.090> have<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:16.170> every<00:02:16.530> time

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
maybe I didn't have to but every time

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.280 
maybe I didn't have to but every time
two<00:02:17.130> sticks<00:02:17.520> crossed<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.270> tied<00:02:18.870> them<00:02:19.080> with

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
two sticks crossed I tied them with

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.830 
two sticks crossed I tied them with
string<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.860> make<00:02:20.010> my<00:02:20.220> trellis<00:02:20.610> stronger<00:02:21.090> then

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
string to make my trellis stronger then

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.920 
string to make my trellis stronger then
I<00:02:22.110> trimmed<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:23.010> ends<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.640> string<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.270> cut

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
I trimmed the ends of the string and cut

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.080 
I trimmed the ends of the string and cut
off<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.350> parts<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.010> branches<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:26.730> stuck

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
off the parts of the branches that stuck

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.530 
off the parts of the branches that stuck
out<00:02:27.270> over<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.750> edges

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.960 

my<00:02:31.540> finished<00:02:32.019> trellis<00:02:32.590> now<00:02:32.860> leans<00:02:33.250> up<00:02:33.519> against

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
my finished trellis now leans up against

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.330 
my finished trellis now leans up against
a<00:02:34.060> wall<00:02:34.269> in<00:02:34.599> front<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.930> our<00:02:35.019> house<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.530> it's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
a wall in front of our house and it's

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.620 
a wall in front of our house and it's
waiting<00:02:36.730> for<00:02:37.000> me<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.510> plant<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.049> vine<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.470> it
