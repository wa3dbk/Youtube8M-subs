00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
this glitch um you can actually do this

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.720 
this glitch um you can actually do this
on<00:00:33.360> solo<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.710> have<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.890> hit<00:00:35.129> their<00:00:35.340> hands

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
on solo you just have to hit their hands

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.439 
on solo you just have to hit their hands
I<00:00:35.879> had<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.629> same<00:00:36.989> idea<00:00:37.440> at<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.129> point<00:00:38.400> but<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
I had the same idea at one point but I

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.630 
I had the same idea at one point but I
don't<00:00:40.379> know<00:00:40.440> never<00:00:40.710> really<00:00:41.040> got<00:00:41.190> around<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
don't know never really got around to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.410 
don't know never really got around to
doing<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.670> mean<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.910> didn't

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
doing it just because I mean I didn't

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.479 
doing it just because I mean I didn't
think<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> could<00:00:45.960> hit<00:00:46.380> their<00:00:46.560> hands<00:00:46.920> but

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
think that I could hit their hands but

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.380 
think that I could hit their hands but
thanks<00:00:47.880> for<00:00:48.030> trying<00:00:48.059> HD<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.200> um<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:51.180> yeah

thanks for trying HD you can um so yeah

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.420 
thanks for trying HD you can um so yeah
you<00:00:51.450> can<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> any<00:00:52.230> round<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.920> want<00:00:53.190> with

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you can get to any round you want with

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.630 
you can get to any round you want with
this<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.960> really<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.620> should<00:00:55.890> probably<00:00:56.130> like

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
this and really you should probably like

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.040 
this and really you should probably like
at<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.270> maximum<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.670> might<00:01:00.030> end<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.719> going

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
at the maximum you might end up going

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290 
at the maximum you might end up going
through<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.710> your<00:01:02.010> shots<00:01:02.309> but<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.640> really

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
through all of your shots but I really

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.150 
through all of your shots but I really
doubt<00:01:03.540> it<00:01:03.770> just<00:01:04.770> because<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.930> kind<00:01:07.800> of<00:01:07.890> easy

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
doubt it just because it is kind of easy

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.580 
doubt it just because it is kind of easy
to<00:01:08.460> hit<00:01:08.610> them<00:01:08.910> if<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:09.899> pile<00:01:10.170> up<00:01:10.380> there

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
to hit them if they all pile up there

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
to hit them if they all pile up there
the<00:01:10.800> only<00:01:10.890> problem<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.580> encountered<00:01:11.700> was

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the only problem that I encountered was

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.649 
the only problem that I encountered was
that<00:01:12.539> they<00:01:13.140> didn't<00:01:13.440> pile<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.310> at<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:15.240> exact

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that they didn't pile up at that exact

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.170 
that they didn't pile up at that exact
spot<00:01:16.250> after<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.640> killed<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.799> jumpers<00:01:20.180> anyways

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
spot after I killed the jumpers anyways

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.609 
spot after I killed the jumpers anyways
i'm<00:01:21.420> going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.630> show<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:22.020> happens<00:01:22.440> with

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
i don't know why it was a pretty stupid

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.640 
i don't know why it was a pretty stupid

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
more zombies for more chances that

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.940 
more zombies for more chances that
there's<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.290> hand<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.799> your

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you need to aim at there will be it like

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.120 
you need to aim at there will be it like
a<00:01:42.509> little<00:01:42.750> hand<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> window<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.830> you<00:01:43.979> need

to<00:01:44.280> hit<00:01:44.400> that<00:01:45.830> anyways<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:49.110> jumpers<00:01:49.920> will

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to hit that anyways so the jumpers will

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.770 
to hit that anyways so the jumpers will
only<00:01:50.369> pile<00:01:50.670> up<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> ledge<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.570> won't
