00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
now attach the wheels again like I said

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.569 
now attach the wheels again like I said
before<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.900> would<00:01:37.409> prefer<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.799> these<00:01:38.220> wheels

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
before I would prefer that these wheels

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.460 
before I would prefer that these wheels
be<00:01:38.850> instead<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.329> dark<00:01:39.600> green<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
be instead of dark green like this a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.990 
be instead of dark green like this a
regular<00:01:40.740> green<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.340> should<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.729> lime

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
regular green this should be like lime

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
regular green this should be like lime
green<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> rest<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.140> color<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
green like the rest of the color but you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.950 
green like the rest of the color but you
know<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.130> can't<00:01:44.939> find<00:01:45.149> any<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.540> I'm<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.869> to

know I can't find any so I'm going to
attach<00:01:46.140> these<00:01:46.399> one<00:01:47.399> there<00:01:48.380> one<00:01:49.380> there<00:01:50.060> flip<00:01:51.060> it

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
attach these one there one there flip it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.910 
attach these one there one there flip it
over

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
over

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.580 
over
one<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.450> there

now<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.850> rod<00:01:57.149> system<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.200> unlike

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
now the rod system for this unlike

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.590 
now the rod system for this unlike
Thomas<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.310> Tank<00:01:59.460> Engine<00:01:59.640> is<00:02:00.000> much<00:02:00.180> easier

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
Thomas the Tank Engine is much easier

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.410 
Thomas the Tank Engine is much easier
take<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.649> these<00:02:01.740> Technic<00:02:02.430> pieces<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.149> you

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
take one of these Technic pieces and you

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.740 
take one of these Technic pieces and you
just<00:02:03.659> slide<00:02:03.990> them<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.860> edge<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.509> rods

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
just slide them on the edge of the rods

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.850 
just slide them on the edge of the rods
and<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.409> sticks<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.829> one<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:09.590> one<00:02:10.590> like

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
and it sticks on one like that one like

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.350 
and it sticks on one like that one like
that<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.370> then<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.790> got<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> two<00:02:12.180> little

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
that and then you got the two little

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.410 
that and then you got the two little
wheel<00:02:12.569> system

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
wheel system

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.839 
wheel system
now<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.900> back<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:14.920> optional<00:02:15.459> really

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
now for the back this is optional really

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.339 
now for the back this is optional really
but<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.060> thought<00:02:16.360> it'd<00:02:16.540> be<00:02:16.569> cool<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.050> try<00:02:17.200> it

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
but I thought it'd be cool to try it

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.490 
but I thought it'd be cool to try it
take<00:02:17.739> two<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.280> these<00:02:18.550> red<00:02:19.390> headlamp<00:02:19.989> pieces

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
take two of these red headlamp pieces

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.160 
take two of these red headlamp pieces
and<00:02:20.680> put<00:02:21.040> them<00:02:21.069> upside<00:02:21.760> down<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:23.110> that

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
and put them upside down just like that

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.570 
and put them upside down just like that
one<00:02:23.680> there<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.739> one<00:02:27.630> here<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.230> then<00:02:29.980> two

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
one there and one here and then two

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.820 
one there and one here and then two
little<00:02:30.940> black<00:02:31.180> studs<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:31.840> represent<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
little black studs that represent the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
little black studs that represent the
buffers<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.590> engine<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.220> thought<00:02:36.580> it'd<00:02:36.760> be

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
buffers of the engine I thought it'd be

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.690 
buffers of the engine I thought it'd be
fun<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.360> try<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.810> now<00:02:38.470> for<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.800> front<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.430> use

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
fun to try that now for the front I use

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.750 
fun to try that now for the front I use
the<00:02:39.880> slightly<00:02:40.120> different

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.250 
green 1 by 2 plate touch it to that
plate<00:04:22.500> then<00:04:23.500> another<00:04:23.979> red<00:04:24.460> 1<00:04:25.330> by<00:04:25.450> 2<00:04:25.510> this<00:04:25.870> is

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
plate then another red 1 by 2 this is

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.640 
plate then another red 1 by 2 this is
the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.520 
the
is<00:04:26.770> uh<00:04:27.210> simulating<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.360> stripes<00:04:28.840> on<00:04:29.199> the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
is uh simulating the stripes on the

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.580 
is uh simulating the stripes on the
engine<00:04:30.570> it's<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.630> good<00:04:31.750> representation<00:04:32.139> I

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
engine it's a good representation I

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.100 
engine it's a good representation I
think<00:04:32.860> then<00:04:33.430> it<00:04:33.550> 1x2<00:04:33.910> green<00:04:34.449> play<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:34.870> just<00:04:34.990> do

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
think then it 1x2 green play and just do

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.990 
think then it 1x2 green play and just do
it<00:04:35.139> every<00:04:35.410> other<00:04:35.710> piece<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.669> then<00:04:36.759> another
