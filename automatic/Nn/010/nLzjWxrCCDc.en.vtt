00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.980
 Hi, it 's a pleasure being with you and with you. 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.130
 the girls aÃ­do things of woman 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.130
 even more to talk about economics and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.859
 really a problem when people 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.930
 Open the fax guard, right here in the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.520
 Brazil, we call it a wardrobe. 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.769
 people opened the wardrobe facts and have no 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.220
 nothing to wear but not guard 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.140
 fact is empty it is not full and there 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.670
 you talk to my god like what happens 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.430
 if anyone needs to help me 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.840
 So, to help people I'll call the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.090
 pareto 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.710
 you may have never heard of 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 But I assure you that from 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.140
 Today you will not forget him anymore. 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.629
 who is pareto he created a principle 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.660
 widely used in the so-called economy 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.770
 principle of pareto or pareto law that 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.360
 this law 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.170
 this law says that 80% of 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.780
 consequences come from 20% of the causes 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.270
 You say to Patricia it got worse because I 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.220
 I did not understand anything that has to do with 8020 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.530
 with my wardrobe it's all about 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.619
 with your wardrobe because second 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.549
 80% of the time you use 20% of the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.590
 your clothes 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.680
 that is, the proportion may not even be 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.259
 very much this but what it represents 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.890
 this is the following most of the time 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.840
 you wear the same clothes ever and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.520
 This happens to all of us. 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.909
 Then you ask but why does it happen? 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 That's because when the woman is going to do 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.250
 she buys much more with the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.320
 emotional than rational as what 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.810
 Did you mean and you go there? 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.939
 shopping separates front of a store and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.780
 Do you see a piece you like there? 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.210
 very 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.930
 then you like you buy what you 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.600
 liked 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.860
 only you do not use rational you do not 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.200
 think so 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.180
 does this piece match with the other 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.310
 things that I have in my wardrobe facts 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.090
 will I actually use will it be that 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.430
 mix me and you do not take many 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.129
 things in consideration do you like yourself 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.890
 buy some things here I separated the 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.250
 my wardrobe facts to show 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.560
 You guys, how have I done to optimize? 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.930
 My wardrobe so I will not stay 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.830
 more in those 80 20 but that I can use 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.750
 for longer - pieces which means that 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.520
 I'm going to spend less 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.440
 So that's why it's all about the 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.100
 principle of pareto with our guard 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.450
 facts 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.820
 I'll give you a very expensive example. 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.650
 traffic we always hear is 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.000
 when you talk about the economy everybody 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.820
 Say you have to have a wardrobe 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.750
 with the basic parts and this is true 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.080
 so so good white shirts a good 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.260
 Black pants a straight skirt is a skirt 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.330
 black pencil a tube in a dress 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.930
 You're always going to use one 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.450
 black blazer like the one here flat 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.370
 You'll always need this blazer. 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.440
 so what I did here in this case 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.850
 This is a piece that I invested more 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.420
 money in her 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.430
 There you speak, Patricia, you 're talking. 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.800
 What are you talking about? 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.680
 spend more money is not this is that 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.209
 This piece is with me and will remain. 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.760
 in my wardrobe for a long time 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.769
 so it's worth spending a little more 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.620
 money on it because it will last 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:26.269
 more I will use yet another example is 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:30.320
 this one here these pieces here is a fact 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:37.250
 white is a pair of pants with a white blazer 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:39.950
 that I bought in 2004 is ten years old 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.780
 that I have this fact here and I use 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.390
 whenever I need because after all 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.220
 beads a white pants a white blazer 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.140
 You do not have to have several then it's worth it. 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.540
 sorry you spend a little more and 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.910
 You have a hard time and it 's going to last 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.739
 so much time that neither is this but that lasts 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.670
 a little more then this is good 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.799
 cool 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.630
 Another thing that I do is this way I see 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.920
 if the parts are in accordance with the 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.170
 my style 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.120
 I do not understand very fashion not for 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.950
 This is not giving you fashion tips. 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.030
 giving you examples of what I do in my 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.100
 wardrobe 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.799
 so how do i understand a lot so that 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.940
 I try to do is follow a certain 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.010
 style 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.560
 so I like geometric like you 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.989
 You are seeing here I'm from roads 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.240
 I like the cubic meter my pants 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.500
 here is a geometric 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.710
 the polka dots here then I always seek 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.750
 more for this segment of geometric 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.370
 I really like what these are 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.490
 little balls here 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.810
 I really like how much I like 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.840
 flowers 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.940
 so look this party represents a good one 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.910
 style that I like because she has 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.509
 geometric she has floral and she has 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.400
 popular 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:53.539
 so I'm looking for parts that are 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.729
 in this style so that I do not 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.860
 put them in my wardrobe always 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.630
 to vote in one way or another 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.750
 one important thing you should 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.360
 also consider the versatility of 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.699
 its parts, it's not because you go in a 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.530
 party you need to buy that 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.699
 party dress you will wear a 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.849
 since this one for example is a dress 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:21.080
 that you normally use to work ok 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:23.419
 is a basic dress or basic off white 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.340
 but according to a party, I can go with 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.320
 Because he looks at what I can do. 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.469
 I got lost here 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.159
 I think I can put a 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.889
 top 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:36.050
 the cardigan has a party face then my 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.130
 dress has already turned into a 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:43.449
 party dress, I can too 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:46.430
 Here knowledge if used with 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.770
 another dress you see a dress 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.900
 normal black that I can use in 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.599
 any occasion right? 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.669
 but if I put here again cardigan 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.830
 I already have other clothes 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.190
 so this is cool when you go 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.380
 Do these shopping for you to think 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.599
 always think about what you need 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.729
 and do not go out buying everything you see 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.819
 from the front as I have a guard 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:13.669
 most basic clothing I invest in the color of 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.069
 accessories so I like to have bags 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.409
 that have a stronger color I like 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:21.680
 much of this here for example because it is 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:24.380
 A klamt is alright but if I open it here 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.280
 She also has a pair of panties too. 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.050
 I can use it as an ordinary bag, right? 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.940
 and another thing that I also really like 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.750
 To do this here is a black cardigan. 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.650
 Normal right winter because it is 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.710
 this skin 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.400
 here but this leaves is stuck here with 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:45.259
 buttons I can take and turn another 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.750
 I practically do not need a cardigan. 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:50.810
 going out with him only in winter counts a lot 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:53.479
 because the skin will only combine with the 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:56.120
 winter, then these are the tips I 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:58.490
 I wanted to let you guys think, girls. 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.530
 before you buy and for sure you will 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.539
 optimize your guard there much more 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.539
 okay a kiss to you is even more
