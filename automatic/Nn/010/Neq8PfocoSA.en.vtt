00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
easiest flies to tie that's why we have

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.150 
easiest flies to tie that's why we have
it<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:26.510> our<00:02:26.600> beginner<00:02:26.930> series<00:02:27.260> we're<00:02:28.010> just

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
it in our beginner series we're just

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.830 
it in our beginner series we're just
going<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.340> continue<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.970> wrap<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.330> up<00:02:29.450> towards

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
three strands of it well we're gonna do

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.320 
three strands of it well we're gonna do
we're<00:03:18.250> gonna<00:03:18.310> hold<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:18.700> down<00:03:18.820> on<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.150> head

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
we're gonna hold it down on the head

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.570 
we're gonna hold it down on the head
here<00:03:19.540> make<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.780> couple<00:03:20.170> couple<00:03:21.040> loops<00:03:21.220> around

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
here make a couple couple loops around

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.160 
here make a couple couple loops around
there<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.760> couple<00:03:21.880> soft<00:03:22.240> loops<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:22.930> get<00:03:23.050> it

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
there a couple soft loops just to get it

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.330 
there a couple soft loops just to get it
tied<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:25.410> then<00:03:26.410> this<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.740> kind<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:27.040> brittle

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
tied in and then this is kind of brittle

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.340 
tied in and then this is kind of brittle
stuff<00:03:27.640> it's<00:03:27.850> really<00:03:28.360> easy<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.690> break<00:03:28.990> so<00:03:29.290> you

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
stuff it's really easy to break so you

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.560 
stuff it's really easy to break so you
want<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.620> be<00:03:29.680> careful<00:03:29.920> with<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:31.090> trim<00:03:31.360> this

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
want to be careful with it to trim this

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.990 
want to be careful with it to trim this
just<00:03:32.290> grab<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.500> hold<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.860> it<00:03:32.980> pick<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.400> off<00:03:33.550> it's

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
just grab a hold of it pick it off it's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.670 
just grab a hold of it pick it off it's
really<00:03:34.300> easy<00:03:35.850> wrap<00:03:36.850> it<00:03:37.060> down<00:03:37.240> there<00:03:37.680> now

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
really easy wrap it down there now

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.680 
really easy wrap it down there now
because<00:03:39.070> as<00:03:39.430> you<00:03:39.580> saw<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:39.970> was<00:03:40.030> very<00:03:40.300> brittle

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
because as you saw it was very brittle

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.660 
because as you saw it was very brittle
one<00:03:41.020> way<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.260> make<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.680> stuff<00:03:41.950> stronger<00:03:42.520> is

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
one way to make this stuff stronger is

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.560 
one way to make this stuff stronger is
to<00:03:43.450> wrap<00:03:43.720> it<00:03:43.900> around<00:03:43.990> your<00:03:44.380> thread<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:45.570> I'm

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
to wrap it around your thread and I'm

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.210 
to wrap it around your thread and I'm
just<00:03:46.750> gonna<00:03:46.870> twist<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.350> around<00:03:47.590> my<00:03:47.920> thread

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
just gonna twist this around my thread

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.160 
just gonna twist this around my thread
and<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.580> makes<00:03:48.910> like<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.150> rope<00:03:49.450> effect<00:03:49.870> and

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
and it makes like a rope effect and

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.199 
and it makes like a rope effect and
it'll<00:03:50.470> make<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.830> lot<00:03:51.010> stronger<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:52.030> wrap

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
it'll make it a lot stronger to wrap

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:59.729 
it'll make it a lot stronger to wrap
with<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.160> lot<00:03:54.310> more<00:03:54.340> durable<00:03:58.530> just<00:03:59.530> make<00:03:59.709> a

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
with and a lot more durable just make a

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.500 
with and a lot more durable just make a
couple<00:04:00.040> wraps<00:04:00.400> there<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:03.300> then<00:04:04.300> I'm<00:04:04.420> gonna

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
couple wraps there and then I'm gonna

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.590 
couple wraps there and then I'm gonna
pinch<00:04:04.840> off<00:04:05.019> the<00:04:05.200> thread<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.650> I'm<00:04:05.800> just<00:04:05.980> gonna

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
pinch off the thread and I'm just gonna

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.570 
pinch off the thread and I'm just gonna
wrap<00:04:07.600> this<00:04:07.810> around<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.500> make<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.040> nice<00:04:09.310> little

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
wrap this around and make a nice little

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.599
