00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.699
 we have a mac app store page 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.380
 we elect some information 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.100
 first we see that the price is of 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.370
 about 180 euros so a little bit yesterday 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.740
 in the photography category and not by chance 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.600

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.170
 the photo leasing well this 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.080
 application practically adds 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.810
 small filters if desired and can modify 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.260
 also details and often not too much 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.060
 for example that I know a bird and it flies 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.470
 in front of the lens it is so and can 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.479
 eliminate in a very simple way e 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.429
 fast 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:09.579
 this this application also reads 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:11.619
 video formats including mp4 mp3 move e 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:16.450
 others after editing 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:18.280
 we can export it in hd or e in hd 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.600
 4th provero 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.100
 and this operation also allows the 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.470
 cropping the rotation of the images e 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.190
 a very fast zynga including the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.750
 clipping the length of the video e 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.420
 this for kraft cinema 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.930
 for system files or sticks 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.510
 10.9 successive 4 gb of ram 8 for whom 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.370
 wanted to work on 4k graphics card 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.650
 compatible an open cl graphics card 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.690
 intel hd 3000 or later 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.420
 256 megabytes of drama recommended in gb 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.520
 for 49 and 500 megabytes of space up 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.960
 disk 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.560
 they ask for 500 megabytes 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.870
 although this actually weighs 5.8 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.550
 megabytes because what else do you lease to 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.350
 of 4k videos and so it is very heavy 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.030
 you are now given to download it 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.100
 link that puts in the description that will be 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.740

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.909
 and since it weighs 75 megabytes it will do 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.640
 in fact the nine minutes are very fast 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.790

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.090
