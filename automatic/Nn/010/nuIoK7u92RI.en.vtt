00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.090
 the one that makes a sun not sighted channel 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.550
 I am losing with the kings and possible 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.870
 this background caloric video there is 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.379
 bands there so good they will have a 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.030
 extinction gameplay 'firstly that 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.210
 nothing that I bring you of how to do the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.710
 achievement trophy architect ok that there 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.869
 some who does not know anything or do 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 although it 's too easy ok 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.789
 well, the achievement says that we have 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.609
 we have to build all the planes 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.349
 in made in extreme normal and they will say 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.340
 I did all the plans up in one 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.300
 game that first that clarifies something there 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.150
 three tesla traps ok and the most there 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.130
 two planes if I remember well but good 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.120
 look, let's check it 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.120
 text plans 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:57.400
 but quickie and we are going to take 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:59.240
 well and rather know that an artist 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.810
 cable 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.810
 you do not know what 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.150
 ok and when we created it as put by 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.080
 example here this is the tesla trap 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.420
 has advanced and so good come if 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.000
 they saw us because I did it very fast 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.310
 to do another I'm going to do another one that is the 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.780
 advanced test trap we are going to 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.110
 grab these are from the people 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.380
 well as I said there are traps of tesla 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.380
 okay 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:46.990
 mic ok and we put it here to do 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.420
 this we are going to tell them there are three traps of 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.360
 tesla ok let's grab this an Indian 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.820
 minimum close the first is the simple 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.009
 the second is the median and the other the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.170
 advanced that you already know those names what 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.990
 The band says what they already do 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.000
 a good stop you the truth and we are going to 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.600
 take this box 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.600
 cable 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:15.740
 and manipulated so that this little house that 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.920
 tells us the liquid battery and good as 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.180
 will see there says press x to believe no 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.770
 tan cheat of tesla media ok 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.830
 This is going to be the average and nothing else 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.660
 the simple ok would be missing and the truth is 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.270
 they are very similar but remember that the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.740
 another test trap had three and the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.620
 advanced has q 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.690
 no no no no no no no I'm confused this is 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.180
 the average and the other we create advanced that 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.550
 the advanced one has three the average 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.830
 have these are both and the simple 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.060
 nothing else has one but nevertheless 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.250
 these three traps 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.930
 who do the same stop however 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.260
 last longer and then we created this because 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.660
 they would miss the other that they can 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.220
 go out giving me the traps of tesla ok 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.980
 they can leave the simple first 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.540
 then the advanced stuff like that but have 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.460
 well in mind that they have to create the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.920
 three then to give them also the 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.200
 they have to create the four times 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.970
 what to sell making it venom 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.700
 electricity that is undoubtedly the most 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.610
 powerful call of duty goes the bird not 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.360
 me original that is the normal violin 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.990
 the vein of fire and the one of the shoulder if it is 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.880
 ok to shoot that as 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.330
 machine gun or things like that not those 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.520
 enemies and certainly also makes you a 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.980
 I have to stop but we have to remember 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.660
 already once we had done 4 - no 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.650
 matter if they have done it in other 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.590
 games 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.840
 will give them the achievement that they will say and the 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.959
 other planes as generally one the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.939
 does in the games already know that if not 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.980
 they have done them then do the me them 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.829
 I'd say the first one make the bomb 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.140
 homemade and the adhesive flare and then 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.970
 follow with the plans of tesla ok and 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.909
 remember make sure you have the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.650
 of medium and big girl like who 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.750
 he says he lets me say it like that in 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.290
 simplify and well 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.440
 that would be all already know how to create ballasts of 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.970
 fabric create the three less and create the 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.769
 adhesive flare and trap ism and pump 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.720
 homemade pump ok and so will you release the 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.639
 ok ok I hope it's cleared 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.680
 some doubts because there are some that I 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.289
 they are asking on facebook and even 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.090
 friends who are telling me how to 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.000
 they get this achievement and the truth that 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.250
 this information was released by unamuno 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.300
 friends or is my clan leader called x 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.970
 in 17 and it looks good thank you 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.099
 a lot because I also did not have in 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.729
 account of how to do it because nothing else 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:51.700
 he said he builds all the planes 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:54.310
 build and then thank you very much 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.550
 Well , see you in other videos 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.550
