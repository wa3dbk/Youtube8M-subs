here<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.700> have<00:00:06.060> my<00:00:06.240> tool<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.259> how<00:00:07.680> it

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
here I have my tool and this is how it

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.040 
here I have my tool and this is how it
kind<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.220> off<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.550> bolt<00:00:08.760> still<00:00:09.179> folded<00:00:09.780> in

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
kind of is off the bolt still folded in

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.070 
kind of is off the bolt still folded in
half<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.860> you're<00:00:11.429> going<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.639> go<00:00:11.849> up<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.570> where

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
half and you're going to go up to where

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.620 
half and you're going to go up to where
the<00:00:13.230> crease<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.219> make<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> casing<00:00:15.089> by<00:00:15.360> just

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the crease is and make a casing by just

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.439 
the crease is and make a casing by just
sewing<00:00:16.049> an<00:00:16.289> inch<00:00:16.920> wide<00:00:17.220> seam<00:00:17.550> along<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.240> edge

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
sewing an inch wide seam along the edge

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.900 
sewing an inch wide seam along the edge
here<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:20.039> way<00:00:20.130> across<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.820> entire

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
here all the way across the entire

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.779 
here all the way across the entire
length<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.380> fabric<00:00:22.560> now<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.519> have

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
length of the fabric now that you have

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.790 
length of the fabric now that you have
all<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:24.990> you're<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.439> take<00:00:25.619> your

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
all of this so you're going to take your

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.980 
all of this so you're going to take your
elastic<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.670> cut<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.269> length<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.779> your

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
elastic and cut it the length of your

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.679 
elastic and cut it the length of your
waist<00:00:28.050> measurement<00:00:28.820> insert<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:30.000> lastic

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
waist measurement insert your lastic

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.830 
waist measurement insert your lastic
through<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.830> casing

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
through the casing

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.350 
through the casing
I'm<00:00:33.840> using<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.770> tool<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.700> use<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
I'm using a tool but you can use a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.440 
I'm using a tool but you can use a
safety<00:00:36.930> pin<00:00:37.640> once<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.850> other<00:00:39.030> end<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
safety pin once the other end of the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.020 
safety pin once the other end of the
lastic<00:00:39.930> gets<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> edge<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.700> want<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
lastic gets to the edge here you want to

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.790 
lastic gets to the edge here you want to
pin<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.510> place<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.230> doesn't<00:00:43.260> slide

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
pin it in place so it doesn't slide

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
pin it in place so it doesn't slide
through<00:00:44.160> as<00:00:44.700> you're<00:00:44.969> feeding<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.780> rest<00:00:45.960> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
through as you're feeding the rest of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.069 
through as you're feeding the rest of
the<00:00:46.680> elastic<00:00:47.399> through<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> casing<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.750> take

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the elastic through the casing now take

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.010 
the elastic through the casing now take
the<00:00:49.289> two<00:00:49.469> ends<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.280> sew<00:00:51.180> them<00:00:51.360> together<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the two ends and sew them together you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.830 
the two ends and sew them together you
can<00:00:52.140> overlap<00:00:52.559> them<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.890> little<00:00:53.250> bit<00:00:53.399> or<00:00:53.840> put

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
can overlap them a little bit or put

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.500 
can overlap them a little bit or put
them<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.170> next<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.559> each<00:00:55.710> other<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.510> zigzag

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
them right next to each other and zigzag

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.260 
them right next to each other and zigzag
in<00:00:57.750> between<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.350> SIG's<00:00:59.010> are<00:00:59.190> between<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> two

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
in between I SIG's are between the two

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.599 
in between I SIG's are between the two
back<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.660> forth<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.960> few<00:01:00.989> times<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:02.550> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
back and forth a few times so now you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.380 
back and forth a few times so now you
have<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.149> section<00:01:03.840> where<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.500> open<00:01:05.390> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
have this section where it's open so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.950 
have this section where it's open so
you're<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> separate<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.470> two<00:01:07.650> layers

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
you're going to separate the two layers

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.109 
you're going to separate the two layers
so<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.439> layer<00:01:10.830> together<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.700> sew<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
so one layer together just sew all the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.719 
so one layer together just sew all the
way<00:01:12.270> down<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:13.350> okay<00:01:13.680> if<00:01:13.830> it's<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.100> even<00:01:14.610> at

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
way down it's okay if it's not even at

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.550 
way down it's okay if it's not even at
the<00:01:14.880> bottom<00:01:15.060> we're<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:15.990> trimming<00:01:16.380> it

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the bottom we're going to be trimming it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.550 
the bottom we're going to be trimming it
later<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.490> take<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.060> two<00:01:18.119> layers<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.200> then

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
later and take these two layers and then

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.340 
later and take these two layers and then
just<00:01:20.310> sew<00:01:20.580> them<00:01:20.790> together<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.450> well<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.110> it's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
just sew them together as well so it's

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.160 
just sew them together as well so it's
all<00:01:22.619> one<00:01:23.009> continuous<00:01:23.670> piece<00:01:24.330> here's<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:25.080> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
all one continuous piece here's what it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.270 
all one continuous piece here's what it
looks<00:01:25.350> like<00:01:26.119> once<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.299> been<00:01:27.479> sewn<00:01:27.750> together

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
looks like once it's been sewn together

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.090 
looks like once it's been sewn together
doesn't<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.610> pretty<00:01:29.909> or<00:01:30.270> neat

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
doesn't have to be pretty or neat

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.160 
doesn't have to be pretty or neat
because<00:01:32.100> after<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.210> petticoat<00:01:33.479> now

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
because after all it's a petticoat now

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.190 
because after all it's a petticoat now
as<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:36.180> evenly<00:01:36.689> spaced

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
as you can see this is not evenly spaced

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.460 
as you can see this is not evenly spaced
around<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:38.090> elastic<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.750> you're<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.290> going

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
around the elastic so you're just going

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
around the elastic so you're just going
to<00:01:40.530> space<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.189> evenly<00:01:42.150> all<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.540> way

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
to space it out evenly all the way

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.350 
to space it out evenly all the way
around<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:44.040> nice<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.430> easy<00:01:44.640> even<00:01:44.939> so

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
around so it's nice and easy even so

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.410 
around so it's nice and easy even so
there's<00:01:45.540> no<00:01:45.720> gaps<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.409> anything<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.240> is
