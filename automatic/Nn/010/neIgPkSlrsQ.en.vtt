00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello how are you the spring villas 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.640
 in today's video I bring you several 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.470
 ideas phrases hydrating masks 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.179
 for all skin types not os 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.639
 you worry about having the oily skin of the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.380
 dry skin that are totally natural and 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.929
 that come perfect for this time of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.609
 heat and the aggression of the sun the sea and the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.650
 pool all those things then we're going 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.600
 scratching the skin I bring you an idea for 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.090
 the hair an idea for the face and an idea 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.369
 for the skin and we go directly to see 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.250
 how it is done when going for the mask 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.600
 special, we're going to need strawberry and yogurt 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.670
 natural 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.230
 what we are going to do is wash the strawberries 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.560
 and remove it on top of this 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.560
 way 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.540
 then we are going to cut them into pieces 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.310
 small and with a fork we are going to do 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.590
 a puree 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.870
 add the yogurt and stir everything 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.190
 very well to apply we take away the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.620
 hair of the face that is perfectly 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.360
 clean and we do it this way in 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.880
 circles like giving the masajitos for 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.890
 that penetrates well in the skin we are going to 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.450
 leave applied for 10 minutes and this 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.990
 Mask serves to combat fat 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.000
 and the brightness 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.960
 When that time has passed, we wash the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.960
 face with abundant water 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.650
 for the mask of the legs we're going 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.820
 to need a ripe avocado and once 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.770
 case the honey pot that I've 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.270
 confused we're going to need oil from 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.850
 olive there is a little bit of aloe 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.430
 You will see perfect if we do not worry 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.590
 to cut the avocado in half 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.180
 we are going to remove the bone and with half it will be 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.180
 enough let's make a puree 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.110
 and we add a tablespoon of oil 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.390
 olive 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.050
 then if you have cleaned the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.050
 aloe vera leaf 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.060
 and we add to the puree that we are going to 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.560
 remove everything very well and we 're going to 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 apply on the legs and leave to act 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.670
 for about 20 minutes or so 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.710
 the texture that has a little 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.840
 unpleasant I do not want to cheat but 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.430
 I also tell you that they work super well 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.110
 also we will apply a 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.630
 small massage so that it penetrates well in 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.909
 skin and I recommend that you take a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.679
 little bit of the sun you listen to music and that 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.009
 relaxes and while the mask makes its 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.009
 work 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.710
 when that time has passed you 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.590
 we talked with abundant water and seen 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.150
 perfect legs and finally for 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.590
 the hair mask we are going to need 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.790
 egg 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.400
 olive oil 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.470
 and honey 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.260
 let's separate the white from the yolk 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.940
 we stay with the yolk and add a 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.060
 or two tablespoons of olive oil and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.770
 a spoonful of honey 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.770
 the Romans all movement 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.800
 and we apply it on the wet hair of 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.840
 half toes so we do not miss 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.940
 oil the drawer this mask gives 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.530
 shine and repair when we have finished 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.630
 we pick up our hair and leave it 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.730
 act for about 15 minutes 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.380
 then we wash it with our shampoo 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.090
 usual couple of months and we will 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.480
 get the shiny hair for this 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.050
 summer 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.970
 I have to say that of the legs 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.129
 disgusting and disgusting but it serves a lot 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.959
 then it 's like then you have to 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.250
 try it to understand it tell me in the 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.959
