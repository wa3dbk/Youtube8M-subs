the part and then go up and down that

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.210 
the part and then go up and down that
where<00:04:25.960> you're<00:04:26.110> dealing<00:04:26.260> with<00:04:26.410> two<00:04:26.680> rows<00:04:26.920> at

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
systematically then you'll hit all areas

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.570 
systematically then you'll hit all areas
