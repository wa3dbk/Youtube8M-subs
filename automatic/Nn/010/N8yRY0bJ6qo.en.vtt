00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.029
 good morning everyone and welcome back again 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.340
 once in my lab in the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.090
 last lesson we saw what they are 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.820
 the statistics 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.090
 this time we will learn together from what 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.900
 they are influenced and how to optimize them 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.629
 without further delay 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.519
 let's start with the second part of the uil 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:50.150
 or the pokémon competitive video game 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:52.010
 lesson number two the statistics 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.309
 statistics are based on four 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.260
 statistical elements basic nature points 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.780
 base and individual values 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.829
 each of these raises or low each 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.620
 statistics 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.350
 let's see them briefly together 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.990
 basic statistics indicate how high it is 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.200
 a statistic and change from species to 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.450
 species 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.939
 these values ​​can be found on sites 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.520
 and dedicated wikis and can be used 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.950
 to make comparisons for example looking 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.259
 the basic statistics we can see that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.070
 an electrode will always be faster than 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.100
 a raid nature is a bit character 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.590
 of your pokémon each nature raises one 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.929
 statistic and lowers another then 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.479
 it is important to always check it first 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.610
 to train a pokémon on many sites there 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.020
 are lists with all natures but yes 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.649
 can see the effect even in the game 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.649
 same 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.909
 in the statistics screen 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.979
 usually it has a blue writing 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.689
 this is the one that is lowered 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.740
 from nature there is also another 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.869
 written in red 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.869
 this is the one that is raised by 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.579
 nature all clear so far now 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.000
 then the most complicated part begins 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.340
 caution 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.520
 the basic points also called points 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.350
 training or ev from English are gods 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.050
 points that you earn by fighting 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.869
 against other pokémon or training 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.820
 with the virtual super training after 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.190
 a battle every pokémon he has 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.680
 participated earns basic points in 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.220
 one or more statistics the more points there are 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.630
 in a statistic the higher it becomes 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.070
 you can check the base points of the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.870
 your pokemon watching his 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.760
 summary enel samp but there is attention 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.370
 maximum base points 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.730
 once reached the pokémon takes it 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.170
 more then the suggestion is this 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.569
 choose the two best statistics 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.879
 for your pokémon and enhanced al 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.439
 maximum with the south and if you are wrong or 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.900
 you have already badly trained yours 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.030
 pokémon just use a restore bag 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.440
 to remove all the basic points like this 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.360
 you can start all over again and 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.480
 optimize training 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.329
 only the individual values ​​are missing what 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.209
 these are the ones we talk about together 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.060
 next lesson then and stay with us 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:09.030
 and don't miss the next part of the 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.030
 guide or competitive video game 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.400
 people 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.400
 Yup
