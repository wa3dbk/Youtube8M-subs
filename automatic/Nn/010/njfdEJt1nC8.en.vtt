00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.729
 vehicle with which you want to participate 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.900
 in this race I recommend you 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.330
 choose one 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.410
 at speed and that is very stable in 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.840

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.370
 good to start what the race does not 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.200
 when I say 32 or only good then 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.970
 obviously you accelerate so that it comes out 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.360
 shoot what is the vehicle and good 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.340
 easy as they jumped to certain ramps 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.770
 that are going to put you on the road so 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.290
 try to jump carefully and make them 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.550
 then in the shortest possible time what 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.830
 it's this race so obviously 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.450
 he has more respect that he forgave but hey 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.250

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.090
 how can you see and well I what 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.790

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.350
 very very little money but money no no 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.750
 is what we care about what matters to us 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.360
 it's the experience so the experience 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.860
 It's not very good, it gives us two thousand 635 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.979
 and that I think is one of the most 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.900
 gives you now credit before 2,500 2,600 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.000
 euros and is very very good but good 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.470
