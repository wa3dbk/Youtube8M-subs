00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello how about good friends in this video 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.460
 I will try to explain some 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.160
 little tricks for 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.950
 that the best your sound in a 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.139
 recording studio and now you're going on 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.830
 home or if you go to a studio 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.520
 professional as it is in this case many 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.590
 Sometimes you will have seen that some 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.669
 guitarists wear a kind of rubber 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:32.079
 of the hair put on the guitar equal one 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:37.809
 as big as it is but in my opinion 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:42.469
 a big hair shape and also with 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.660
 enough hair help more for the function 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.539
 that has a good finite so that 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.839
 some will ask you what is it for 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:53.239
 that rubber band good because at the time 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.220
 to record or at the time of playing in 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.550
 direct is a little more complex 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.180
 this hair gum what helps is to 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.340
 cover all the imperfections that 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.450
 occur when we play many notes 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.570
 and when going from one string to another we leave 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.660
 on a loose string and therefore it 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.020
 create unwanted noise they are therefore 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.520
 can demonstrate the 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.990
 difference between playing with the rubber of 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.990
 hair and without it 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.750
 is that some rope is crying 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.799
 let's do the same now with the rubber 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.799
 of proposal for you to see 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.909
 which the strings are completely 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:54.149
 covered and so do not sound notes of the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.960
 guitar that should not sound 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.850
 well that's a little trick that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.700
 some of you will have seen enough in others 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.299
 videos from youtube but the second trick 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.489
 and also no less important is that the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.910
 plectrum that you use me in this case 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:17.640
 he used this series because all three of 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.630
 youtube and the plectrum note that if it's how much 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.530
 newer be 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.319
 the more point you have 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.040
 will help you when playing many 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.040
 notes in a row 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.280
 one 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:37.690
 at the time of doing let's say scales very 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.230
 fast the rounded nap plectrum is very 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.140
 easy that we fail or that we do not accept 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.240
 when pressing any of the notes of 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.950
 that scale 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:52.030
 so good those two tips that you 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.880
 Today I give you the hair gum and the barb 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.040
 that is completely new or quite 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.000
 new and good, well, see you in the 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.150
 next video I hope you have 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.150
