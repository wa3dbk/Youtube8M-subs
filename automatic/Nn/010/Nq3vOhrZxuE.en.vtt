off there is a pointy side and a square

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.320 
off there is a pointy side and a square
side<00:01:09.780> are<00:01:10.020> numbered<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.650> two<00:01:11.010> three<00:01:11.490> four

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330

five<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.250> six<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.210> take<00:01:15.390> number<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
five and six so we take number one and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
five and six so we take number one and
we<00:01:16.799> slide<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.520> through<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.830> stick<00:01:20.330> to<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> end

we slide it through the stick to the end

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.810 
we slide it through the stick to the end
like<00:01:21.840> that

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
like that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.609 
like that

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
okay then we take number two same thing

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:52.490 
okay then we take number two same thing
slide<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.770> through<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.130> stick<00:01:51.079> okay<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.350> there

slide it through the stick okay so there

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.030 
slide it through the stick okay so there
is<00:01:52.590> method<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> madness<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.799> tree

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
is method to the madness that the tree

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.410 
is method to the madness that the tree
gets<00:01:56.630> incrementally<00:01:57.630> smaller<00:01:58.079> or<00:01:59.240> larger<00:02:00.240> as

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
gets incrementally smaller or larger as

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.569 
gets incrementally smaller or larger as
it<00:02:01.200> um<00:02:02.899> goes<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.259> top<00:02:04.439> or<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.130> goes<00:02:05.280> down

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
it um goes to the top or it goes down

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.570 
it um goes to the top or it goes down
and<00:02:05.990> smaller<00:02:06.990> when<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.200> go<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:07.560> okay<00:02:08.220> number

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
and smaller when you go up okay number

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.150 
and smaller when you go up okay number
one<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.390> want<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.720> fill<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.050> water<00:02:10.229> to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
one you want to fill the water to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.400 
one you want to fill the water to
there's<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.640> water<00:02:11.940> line<00:02:12.180> right<00:02:12.540> there

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
there's a water line right there

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.490 
there's a water line right there
that<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.130> fill<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.820> water<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.610> line

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
that so fill the water to that line

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:27.860 
that so fill the water to that line
packet<00:02:19.500> number<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:22.460> it's<00:02:23.460> green<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.660> it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
packet number one and it's green and it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.390 
packet number one and it's green and it
smells<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.790> artificial<00:02:29.790> grape<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:31.190> bit<00:02:32.190> and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
smells like artificial grape a bit and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.440 
smells like artificial grape a bit and
it<00:02:33.360> says<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.750> use<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.410> stir<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:37.820> okay<00:02:38.820> so

it says to use this to stir it okay so

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.920 
it says to use this to stir it okay so
once<00:02:40.850> number<00:02:41.850> one<00:02:42.030> powder<00:02:42.300> has<00:02:42.600> been<00:02:42.750> well

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
once number one powder has been well

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.500 
once number one powder has been well
dissolved<00:02:43.290> into<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.830> liquid<00:02:44.360> what<00:02:45.360> we're

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
dissolved into the liquid what we're

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.590 
dissolved into the liquid what we're
going<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.690> do<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.230> add<00:02:46.890> packet<00:02:47.580> number<00:02:49.370> two<00:02:50.600> to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
going to do is add packet number two to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.730 
going to do is add packet number two to
the<00:02:51.750> other<00:02:52.490> tray<00:02:57.140> spread<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.290> out<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.530> little

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
the other tray spread that out a little

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.570 
the other tray spread that out a little
bit<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.630> there's<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.690> little<00:03:01.050> divot<00:03:01.920> over<00:03:02.370> here

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
bit is there's a little divot over here

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.800 
bit is there's a little divot over here
on<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.850> tray<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:04.650> rest<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.250> tree<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
on the tray and you rest the tree on the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.110 
on the tray and you rest the tree on the
top<00:03:06.960> of<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.170> divot<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.920> then<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.850> slowly

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
top of that divot and then you slowly

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.050 
top of that divot and then you slowly
twirl<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.230> get<00:03:10.410> all<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.280> little

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
twirl it to get all of the little

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.480 
twirl it to get all of the little
branches<00:03:12.330> wet<00:03:12.900> with<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.560> solution<00:03:13.890> then<00:03:14.460> you

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
branches wet with this solution then you

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.700 
branches wet with this solution then you
take<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.060> other<00:03:15.300> tray<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.900> then<00:03:16.560> you

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
take it to the other tray and then you

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.680 
take it to the other tray and then you
swirl<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.280> into<00:03:18.260> that<00:03:19.260> tray<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.510> then<00:03:21.510> what

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
swirl it into that tray and then what

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.610 
swirl it into that tray and then what
happens<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:23.570> turns<00:03:24.570> into<00:03:24.810> little<00:03:25.200> gummies

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
happens is it turns into little gummies

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.650 
happens is it turns into little gummies
on<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.980> ends<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.490> branches<00:03:26.670> can<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.510> see

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
on the ends of the branches can you see

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.350 
on the ends of the branches can you see
that<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.860> then<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.100> go<00:03:29.220> back<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.490> forth<00:03:29.760> get

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
that so then you go back and forth get

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:38.290 
that so then you go back and forth get
it<00:03:30.480> wet<00:03:31.700> then<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.970> go<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.350> powder<00:03:35.990> and

gummy gummy and that's what tastes like
I<00:05:55.280> mean<00:05:56.280> that's<00:05:56.400> what<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.700> texture<00:05:56.970> is<00:05:57.120> like

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
I mean that's what the texture is like

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.589 
I mean that's what the texture is like
it's<00:05:59.550> um<00:05:59.820> very<00:06:00.120> slimy

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
it's um very slimy

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.520 
it's um very slimy
and<00:06:01.169> kind<00:06:01.410> of<00:06:01.500> chewy<00:06:01.680> and<00:06:02.150> um<00:06:03.380> but<00:06:04.380> this

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
and kind of chewy and um but this

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.650 
and kind of chewy and um but this
topping<00:06:04.979> stuff<00:06:05.190> is<00:06:05.310> really<00:06:05.550> quite<00:06:05.760> good

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
topping stuff is really quite good

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.440 
topping stuff is really quite good
it's<00:06:07.320> very<00:06:07.650> tart<00:06:08.039> it<00:06:08.700> does<00:06:08.880> just<00:06:08.910> that<00:06:09.150> great

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
it's very tart it does just that great

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.430 
it's very tart it does just that great
but<00:06:09.690> not<00:06:09.960> not<00:06:10.289> so<00:06:10.500> strong<00:06:11.960> and<00:06:12.960> the<00:06:13.169> little

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
but not not so strong and the little

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.310 
but not not so strong and the little
balls<00:06:13.620> are<00:06:13.919> are<00:06:14.430> fun<00:06:14.849> to<00:06:14.970> eat<00:06:15.150> because<00:06:16.020> you<00:06:16.169> can

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
balls are are fun to eat because you can

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.170 
balls are are fun to eat because you can
pluck<00:06:16.560> them<00:06:16.740> off<00:06:16.860> and<00:06:17.280> I<00:06:17.849> think<00:06:17.910> there's

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
pluck them off and I think there's

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.430 
pluck them off and I think there's
enough<00:06:18.419> mixture<00:06:18.930> that<00:06:19.050> you<00:06:19.169> could<00:06:19.320> probably

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
enough mixture that you could probably

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.080 
enough mixture that you could probably
make<00:06:19.740> to<00:06:19.950> trees<00:06:20.220> to<00:06:20.430> get<00:06:21.270> eat<00:06:21.510> one<00:06:21.750> and<00:06:22.320> then

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
make to trees to get eat one and then

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.969 
make to trees to get eat one and then
continue<00:06:24.090> and<00:06:24.120> make<00:06:24.360> another<00:06:24.650> this<00:06:25.650> was

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
continue and make another this was

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.279 
continue and make another this was
really<00:06:26.340> fun<00:06:26.550> to<00:06:26.789> make<00:06:27.000> so<00:06:27.210> you<00:06:27.570> guys<00:06:27.720> see<00:06:28.050> this

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.430 
really fun to make so you guys see this
I<00:06:29.130> would<00:06:29.580> recommend<00:06:30.000> it<00:06:30.120> just<00:06:30.330> for<00:06:30.570> it's<00:06:30.750> just

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
I would recommend it just for it's just

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.779 
I would recommend it just for it's just
pure<00:06:31.770> fun<00:06:33.080> fun<00:06:34.080> Ness<00:06:34.320> of<00:06:34.469> it<00:06:34.590> all<00:06:34.740> but<00:06:35.700> the

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
pure fun fun Ness of it all but the

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.550 
pure fun fun Ness of it all but the
taste<00:06:35.969> is<00:06:36.180> you<00:06:36.390> know<00:06:36.510> it's<00:06:36.810> pretty<00:06:37.110> similar<00:06:37.380> I

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
taste is you know it's pretty similar I

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.170 
taste is you know it's pretty similar I
think<00:06:37.860> they<00:06:37.919> use<00:06:38.070> the<00:06:38.099> same<00:06:38.400> coming

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
think they use the same coming

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.020 
think they use the same coming
from<00:06:39.919> gelatin<00:06:40.919> powders<00:06:41.400> that<00:06:41.430> they<00:06:41.699> use<00:06:41.850> in

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
from gelatin powders that they use in

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.140 
from gelatin powders that they use in
some<00:06:42.180> of<00:06:42.210> the<00:06:42.360> other<00:06:42.509> kids<00:06:42.840> so<00:06:43.740> the<00:06:44.639> texture<00:06:45.090> is

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
some of the other kids so the texture is

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.159 
some of the other kids so the texture is
not<00:06:45.300> that<00:06:45.479> surprising<00:06:46.009> very<00:06:47.009> similar<00:06:47.460> to<00:06:47.729> the

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130
