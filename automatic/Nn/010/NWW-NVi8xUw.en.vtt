00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
command blocks driving this contraption

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.080 
command blocks driving this contraption
and<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:07.950> see<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.549> move<00:01:08.790> my<00:01:09.060> mouse

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and as you can see as I move my mouse

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.570 
and as you can see as I move my mouse
around<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:10.020> will<00:01:10.260> aim<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.799> will<00:01:10.950> follow<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
around this will aim it will follow and

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.530 
around this will aim it will follow and
it<00:01:12.360> works<00:01:12.630> exactly<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.650> way<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.250> normal<00:01:15.210> game

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
it works exactly the way the normal game

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
it works exactly the way the normal game
but<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.200> played<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> flash<00:01:16.799> version<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.460> it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
but if you played a flash version of it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.450 
but if you played a flash version of it
so<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.450> aim<00:01:18.869> where<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.890> bubble<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> go

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
so I aim where I want the bubble to go

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.450 
so I aim where I want the bubble to go
and<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.790> click<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.390> fire<00:01:21.810> Dolf<00:01:22.110> pretty<00:01:23.100> simple

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and I click to fire Dolf pretty simple

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.730 
and I click to fire Dolf pretty simple
right<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.780> these<00:01:24.930> white<00:01:25.439> boxes

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.520 
get eliminated as well and you get even
more<00:01:51.180> points<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.140> get<00:01:52.290> 10

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
more points for that so you get 10

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.200 
more points for that so you get 10
points<00:01:52.740> per<00:01:53.100> bubble<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.610> eliminate<00:01:54.030> by

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
points per bubble you eliminate by

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.179 
points per bubble you eliminate by
matching<00:01:54.420> them<00:01:54.720> up<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.500> hundred<00:01:55.829> points

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
matching them up and a hundred points

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.819 
matching them up and a hundred points
for<00:01:56.250> bubble<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:57.329> eliminate<00:01:58.079> by<00:01:58.229> leaving<00:01:58.710> them

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
for bubble you eliminate by leaving them

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.370 
for bubble you eliminate by leaving them
hanging<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.310> midair<00:01:59.700> so<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.240> got<00:02:00.509> 140

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
hanging in midair so you see I got 140

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.039 
hanging in midair so you see I got 140
there<00:02:01.560> 100<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.340> floating<00:02:02.670> bubble<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.270> 40

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
there 100 for the floating bubble and 40

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.130 
there 100 for the floating bubble and 40
for<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.409> four<00:02:04.740> different<00:02:05.100> bubbles<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.990> can

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
for the four different bubbles and I can

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.350 
for the four different bubbles and I can
just<00:02:07.320> keep<00:02:07.469> playing<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
just keep playing like this and the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.699 
just keep playing like this and the
objective<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> game<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.259> course<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.619> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
objective of the game of course is to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.110 
objective of the game of course is to
clear<00:02:10.950> off<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.190> board<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.610> get<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:11.910> much

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
clear off the board and get as much

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.860 
clear off the board and get as much
score<00:02:12.599> as<00:02:12.810> possible<00:02:13.349> and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
score as possible and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.090 
score as possible and
the<00:02:14.110> process

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
the process

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.150 
the process
you<00:02:17.060> can<00:02:17.180> also<00:02:17.300> see<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:17.750> lose<00:02:18.170> one<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
you can also see that I lose one of the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.640 
you can also see that I lose one of the
white<00:02:19.640> boxes<00:02:20.180> whenever<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:20.810> shoot<00:02:21.440> off<00:02:21.620> a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
white boxes whenever I shoot off a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.620 
white boxes whenever I shoot off a
bubble<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.070> doesn't<00:02:22.670> end<00:02:22.880> up<00:02:23.060> matching<00:02:23.240> with

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
bubble that doesn't end up matching with

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.620 
bubble that doesn't end up matching with
three<00:02:23.900> or<00:02:24.110> more<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.800> now<00:02:25.040> I'm<00:02:25.130> done<00:02:25.280> two<00:02:25.820> spares

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
three or more so now I'm done two spares

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.490 
three or more so now I'm done two spares
one<00:02:27.170> spare<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.610> now<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.510> have<00:02:29.780> no<00:02:29.960> spares<00:02:30.290> at

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
one spare and now I have no spares at

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.520 
one spare and now I have no spares at
all<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:30.980> now<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.760> have<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.150> blue<00:02:32.530> bubble

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
all so now I have this blue bubble

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.470 
all so now I have this blue bubble
coming<00:02:33.740> up<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.220> there's<00:02:34.520> no<00:02:34.700> place<00:02:35.060> for<00:02:35.240> me<00:02:35.330> to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
coming up and there's no place for me to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.030 
coming up and there's no place for me to
put<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.750> blue<00:02:36.020> bubble<00:02:36.230> where<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.680> would<00:02:36.830> match

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
put a blue bubble where it would match

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.660 
put a blue bubble where it would match
up<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.550> I'm<00:02:37.880> going<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.420> make<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.810> mistake<00:02:39.170> here

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
up so I'm going to make a mistake here

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.630 
up so I'm going to make a mistake here
and<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:41.000> going<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.480> trigger<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:43.070> fault

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
and it's going to trigger the fault

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.740 
and it's going to trigger the fault
mechanism<00:02:44.270> which<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:45.320> get<00:02:45.770> more<00:02:46.160> bubbles<00:02:46.790> so

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
mechanism which is I get more bubbles so

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.600 
mechanism which is I get more bubbles so
easy<00:02:48.110> all<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.440> bubbles<00:02:48.560> move<00:02:48.890> down<00:02:49.100> one<00:02:49.340> step

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
easy all the bubbles move down one step

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.330 
easy all the bubbles move down one step
and<00:02:49.850> then<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.750> get<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.230> row<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.710> new<00:02:51.860> bubbles<00:02:52.190> up

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and then I get a row of new bubbles up

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.770 
and then I get a row of new bubbles up
top<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.820> they're<00:02:52.940> all<00:02:53.060> gonna<00:02:53.210> have<00:02:53.360> random

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
top and they're all gonna have random

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.320 
top and they're all gonna have random
colors<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.290> then<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.410> get<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.710> keep<00:02:54.830> playing<00:02:55.330> so

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
colors and then I get to keep playing so

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.450 
colors and then I get to keep playing so
let<00:02:56.630> me<00:02:56.720> keep<00:02:56.930> eliminating<00:02:57.320> some<00:02:57.890> here<00:02:58.250> and

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
let me keep eliminating some here and

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.300 
let me keep eliminating some here and
this<00:02:58.580> difficult<00:02:59.240> situation<00:02:59.270> for<00:03:00.080> me<00:03:00.230> but<00:03:00.650> I

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
this difficult situation for me but I

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.440 
this difficult situation for me but I
can<00:03:02.030> do<00:03:02.480> this<00:03:02.720> corner<00:03:03.200> and<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.940> can<00:03:04.970> also<00:03:05.210> show

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
can do this corner and I can also show

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.480 
can do this corner and I can also show
off<00:03:05.630> that<00:03:05.840> if<00:03:05.990> you<00:03:06.170> hit<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.590> wall<00:03:06.860> here<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:07.460> I

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
off that if you hit the wall here so I

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.890 
off that if you hit the wall here so I
can<00:03:07.730> shoot<00:03:07.940> this<00:03:08.120> direction<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.870> will

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
can shoot this direction and it will

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.300 
can shoot this direction and it will
bounce<00:03:09.200> off<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.490> will<00:03:10.580> place<00:03:10.790> there

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
bounce off and it will place there

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.479 
bounce off and it will place there
you<00:03:13.000> can<00:03:13.120> also<00:03:13.270> see<00:03:13.569> that<00:03:13.599> I<00:03:14.230> have<00:03:14.590> no<00:03:14.890> mistakes

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
you can also see that I have no mistakes

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.610 
you can also see that I have no mistakes
available<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.090> know<00:03:16.120> spares<00:03:16.780> now<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.410> that's

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
available I know spares now and that's

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.190 
available I know spares now and that's
actually<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> random<00:03:18.700> factor<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.330> get<00:03:19.510> zero<00:03:20.080> to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
actually a random factor you get zero to

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.190 
actually a random factor you get zero to
five<00:03:20.709> new<00:03:21.220> attempts<00:03:21.849> every<00:03:22.120> time<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:22.660> make<00:03:22.959> a

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
five new attempts every time you make a

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.790 
five new attempts every time you make a
fault

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
fault

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.300 
fault
let<00:03:24.610> me<00:03:24.700> try<00:03:24.940> here<00:03:25.599> No<00:03:26.020> so<00:03:26.830> now<00:03:26.950> you<00:03:27.010> see<00:03:27.160> now<00:03:27.280> I

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
let me try here No so now you see now I

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.110 
let me try here No so now you see now I
got<00:03:27.640> one

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
got one

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.180 
got one
you<00:03:28.690> also<00:03:28.810> can<00:03:29.110> note<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.530> can<00:03:29.650> see<00:03:29.890> on

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
you also can note that you can see on

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.979 
you also can note that you can see on
the<00:03:30.370> bottom<00:03:30.550> there<00:03:30.849> which<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.269> your<00:03:31.630> next

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
the bottom there which is your next

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.500 
the bottom there which is your next
bubble<00:03:32.620> so<00:03:32.920> your<00:03:33.519> next<00:03:33.790> bubble<00:03:34.000> color<00:03:34.360> is

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
bubble so your next bubble color is

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.720 
bubble so your next bubble color is
always<00:03:34.660> known<00:03:35.019> so<00:03:35.319> you<00:03:35.410> can<00:03:35.680> make<00:03:36.040> some

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
always known so you can make some

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.690 
always known so you can make some
strategic<00:03:37.540> decisions<00:03:37.900> knowing<00:03:38.830> what<00:03:39.370> will

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
strategic decisions knowing what will

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.509 
strategic decisions knowing what will
happen<00:03:40.090> next<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:40.890> eventually<00:03:41.890> you're<00:03:42.340> going

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
happen next so eventually you're going

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.130 
happen next so eventually you're going
to<00:03:42.610> as<00:03:43.030> you<00:03:43.060> play<00:03:43.420> this<00:03:43.630> you're<00:03:43.900> going<00:03:44.050> to

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
to as you play this you're going to

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.620 
to as you play this you're going to
eliminate<00:03:44.530> one<00:03:45.190> color<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:46.000> bubbles<00:03:46.420> that's

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
eliminate one color of bubbles that's

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.750 
eliminate one color of bubbles that's
the<00:03:46.690> first<00:03:46.930> step<00:03:47.170> towards<00:03:47.650> getting<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.430> board

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
the first step towards getting the board

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.300 
the first step towards getting the board
clear<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.569> that<00:03:49.900> has<00:03:50.049> two<00:03:50.260> effects<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:50.950> one

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
clear and that has two effects so one

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.800 
clear and that has two effects so one
thing<00:03:51.489> is<00:03:51.519> you<00:03:51.790> are<00:03:51.819> not<00:03:51.940> going<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.450> get<00:03:52.569> any

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
thing is you are not going to get any

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.770 
thing is you are not going to get any
new<00:03:52.930> random<00:03:53.590> bubbles<00:03:54.549> of<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.850> color<00:03:55.120> up<00:03:55.510> top

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
new random bubbles of that color up top

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.780 
new random bubbles of that color up top
even<00:03:56.080> when<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.290> get<00:03:56.440> cue<00:03:56.680> rose<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:57.130> the

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
even when you get cue rose and the

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.220 
even when you get cue rose and the
second<00:03:58.239> thing<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.480> happens<00:03:58.930> is<00:03:59.049> that<00:03:59.170> you

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
second thing that happens is that you

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.250 
second thing that happens is that you
can<00:03:59.470> get<00:03:59.920> more<00:04:00.280> Rose<00:04:00.790> so<00:04:01.599> if<00:04:01.930> you've

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
can get more Rose so if you've

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.130 
can get more Rose so if you've
eliminated<00:04:02.530> one<00:04:03.069> color<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.730> get<00:04:03.940> one<00:04:04.390> extra

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
eliminated one color you get one extra

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.830 
eliminated one color you get one extra
row<00:04:05.170> every<00:04:05.650> time<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:06.250> make<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.519> fault<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.120> if

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
row every time you make a fault and if

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.110 
row every time you make a fault and if
you've<00:04:08.019> eliminated<00:04:08.200> two<00:04:08.769> colors<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:09.610> get<00:04:09.849> two

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
you've eliminated two colors you get two

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.410 
you've eliminated two colors you get two
extra<00:04:10.450> Rose<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.019> on<00:04:11.250> now<00:04:12.250> obviously<00:04:12.700> you

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
extra Rose and so on now obviously you

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.910 
extra Rose and so on now obviously you
can<00:04:13.450> also<00:04:13.780> loose<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.200> game<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.680> can<00:04:14.799> see

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
can also loose the game and you can see

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.860 
can also loose the game and you can see
yes<00:04:15.069> these<00:04:15.370> bubbles<00:04:15.849> are<00:04:16.000> falling<00:04:16.450> down<00:04:16.630> I'm

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
yes these bubbles are falling down I'm

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.539 
yes these bubbles are falling down I'm
getting<00:04:17.109> closer<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.440> closer<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:18.340> bottom

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
getting closer and closer to the bottom

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.750 
getting closer and closer to the bottom
and<00:04:18.959> now<00:04:19.959> my<00:04:20.440> bubble<00:04:20.979> is<00:04:21.100> all<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.609> way<00:04:21.729> down

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
and now my bubble is all the way down

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.580 
and now my bubble is all the way down
here<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.419> actually<00:04:22.450> belongs<00:04:23.140> to<00:04:23.320> some

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
here and that actually belongs to some

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.279 
here and that actually belongs to some
of<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.890> angles<00:04:24.370> for<00:04:24.610> me<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:24.970> it's<00:04:25.600> getting

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
of the angles for me so it's getting

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.140 
of the angles for me so it's getting
more<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:26.770> more<00:04:26.950> hard<00:04:27.160> to<00:04:27.460> sort<00:04:27.700> of<00:04:27.760> clear<00:04:28.000> out

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
more and more hard to sort of clear out

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.630 
more and more hard to sort of clear out
my<00:04:28.300> situation<00:04:28.510> here<00:04:29.080> so<00:04:29.229> you<00:04:30.130> can<00:04:30.400> see<00:04:30.520> I've

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
my situation here so you can see I've

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.090 
my situation here so you can see I've
kind<00:04:30.970> of<00:04:31.030> lost<00:04:31.330> access<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.289> left<00:04:32.650> side<00:04:32.919> of

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
kind of lost access to the left side of

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.520 
kind of lost access to the left side of
the<00:04:33.190> board<00:04:33.430> here<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:34.360> I've<00:04:34.600> down<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.140> one

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
the board here and I've down to one

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.750 
the board here and I've down to one
mistake<00:04:35.979> allowed

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
mistake allowed

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.230 
mistake allowed
so<00:04:37.950> let's<00:04:38.950> mean<00:04:39.100> you<00:04:39.160> place<00:04:39.460> this<00:04:39.700> over<00:04:40.000> here

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
so let's mean you place this over here

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.779 
so let's mean you place this over here
and<00:04:40.419> I<00:04:40.630> have<00:04:40.750> one<00:04:40.780> yellow<00:04:41.560> bubble<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.490> can<00:04:42.639> try

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
and I have one yellow bubble I can try

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.360 
and I have one yellow bubble I can try
to<00:04:42.850> sort<00:04:43.120> of<00:04:43.180> get<00:04:43.389> that<00:04:43.419> up<00:04:43.750> here<00:04:44.080> but<00:04:44.440> if<00:04:45.250> I

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
to sort of get that up here but if I

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.430 
to sort of get that up here but if I
fail<00:04:45.610> my<00:04:46.150> bubbles<00:04:46.479> fall<00:04:46.660> off<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.960> board<00:04:47.110> and

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
fail my bubbles fall off the board and

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.400 
fail my bubbles fall off the board and
that's<00:04:47.830> game<00:04:48.280> over<00:04:48.760> I<00:04:48.970> end<00:04:49.450> up<00:04:49.570> at<00:04:49.690> 600<00:04:50.200> points

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
that's game over I end up at 600 points

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.830 
that's game over I end up at 600 points
and<00:04:50.770> starting<00:04:51.550> over<00:04:51.639> is<00:04:51.910> quick<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.419> easy<00:04:52.630> you

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
and starting over is quick and easy you

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.650 
and starting over is quick and easy you
just<00:04:53.289> click<00:04:53.620> again<00:04:53.979> and<00:04:54.300> then<00:04:55.300> you<00:04:55.360> get<00:04:55.510> to

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
just click again and then you get to

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.390 
just click again and then you get to
wait<00:04:55.840> for<00:04:56.229> a<00:04:56.260> bit<00:04:56.380> while<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:57.130> board

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
wait for a bit while the board

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.980 
wait for a bit while the board
randomizes<00:04:58.330> up

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
randomizes up

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.340 
randomizes up
anyway<00:05:00.889> let's<00:05:01.280> switch<00:05:01.819> over<00:05:02.030> into<00:05:02.720> creative

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
anyway let's switch over into creative

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.770 
anyway let's switch over into creative
mode<00:05:03.380> here<00:05:03.830> for<00:05:04.069> a<00:05:04.100> bit<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.490> let<00:05:05.449> me<00:05:05.569> show<00:05:05.720> you

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
mode here for a bit and let me show you

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.950 
mode here for a bit and let me show you
some<00:05:06.620> other<00:05:06.830> stuff<00:05:06.860> that<00:05:07.069> makes<00:05:07.400> this<00:05:07.550> tick<00:05:07.960> so

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
some other stuff that makes this tick so

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.020 
some other stuff that makes this tick so
there<00:05:09.560> are<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:09.919> bunch<00:05:10.220> of<00:05:10.370> command<00:05:10.610> looks<00:05:10.729> here

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
there are a bunch of command looks here

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.719 
there are a bunch of command looks here
and<00:05:11.569> this<00:05:12.110> big<00:05:12.289> tower<00:05:12.530> of<00:05:12.830> generated<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.520> once

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
and this big tower of generated and once

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.370 
and this big tower of generated and once
most<00:05:13.970> of<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.210> other<00:05:14.330> ones<00:05:14.449> are<00:05:14.660> actually<00:05:14.810> hand

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
most of the other ones are actually hand

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.580 
most of the other ones are actually hand
written<00:05:15.919> and<00:05:16.250> it's<00:05:17.120> pretty<00:05:17.810> much<00:05:17.930> all<00:05:18.110> the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
written and it's pretty much all the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.320 
written and it's pretty much all the
complexities<00:05:19.250> if<00:05:19.400> this<00:05:19.520> are<00:05:19.729> about<00:05:19.940> handling

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
complexities if this are about handling

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.529 
complexities if this are about handling
the<00:05:20.479> mouse<00:05:20.630> input<00:05:20.930> on<00:05:21.530> the<00:05:22.009> board<00:05:22.220> so<00:05:22.550> we<00:05:23.389> have

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
the mouse input on the board so we have

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.480 
the mouse input on the board so we have
a<00:05:23.569> bunch<00:05:23.810> of<00:05:23.960> these<00:05:24.349> kind<00:05:24.710> of<00:05:24.770> ones<00:05:25.009> that<00:05:25.220> take

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
a bunch of these kind of ones that take

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.719 
a bunch of these kind of ones that take
the<00:05:25.880> player<00:05:26.300> angle<00:05:27.340> towards<00:05:28.340> the<00:05:28.490> board

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
the player angle towards the board

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.730 
the player angle towards the board
because<00:05:29.000> you're<00:05:29.180> always<00:05:29.360> on<00:05:29.539> this<00:05:29.990> one<00:05:30.349> block

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
because you're always on this one block

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.010 
because you're always on this one block
here<00:05:31.099> so<00:05:31.759> we<00:05:31.910> picked<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.210> angle<00:05:32.599> towards<00:05:32.900> the

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
here so we picked the angle towards the

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.779 
here so we picked the angle towards the
board<00:05:33.229> and<00:05:33.500> that<00:05:33.740> lets<00:05:33.949> us<00:05:34.070> do<00:05:34.310> some<00:05:34.550> math<00:05:34.759> to

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
board and that lets us do some math to

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.510 
board and that lets us do some math to
figure<00:05:35.300> out<00:05:35.570> what<00:05:36.080> sort<00:05:37.009> of<00:05:37.070> what<00:05:37.250> your

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
figure out what sort of what your

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.029 
figure out what sort of what your
coordinate<00:05:38.120> on<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.690> board<00:05:38.930> is<00:05:39.199> actually

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
coordinate on the board is actually

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.400 
coordinate on the board is actually
pointing<00:05:40.430> at<00:05:40.699> so<00:05:41.330> your<00:05:41.750> mouse<00:05:42.080> cursor

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
pointing at so your mouse cursor

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.980 
pointing at so your mouse cursor
position<00:05:43.130> if<00:05:43.280> you<00:05:43.400> will<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.729> then<00:05:44.300> let's<00:05:44.840> just

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
position if you will and then let's just

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.170 
position if you will and then let's just
do<00:05:45.320> another<00:05:45.349> bunch<00:05:45.919> of<00:05:46.070> fancy<00:05:46.460> math<00:05:46.699> to<00:05:47.060> figure

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
do another bunch of fancy math to figure

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.010 
do another bunch of fancy math to figure
out<00:05:47.360> your<00:05:47.539> angle<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:49.389> bottom<00:05:50.389> of<00:05:50.599> the

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
out your angle to the bottom of the

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.170 
out your angle to the bottom of the
board<00:05:51.229> where<00:05:51.650> your<00:05:51.949> bubble<00:05:52.340> originates<00:05:52.940> so

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
board where your bubble originates so

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.320 
board where your bubble originates so
that<00:05:53.389> lets<00:05:53.599> us<00:05:53.720> do<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.259> pointer<00:05:55.130> and<00:05:55.330> also

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
that lets us do the pointer and also

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.850 
that lets us do the pointer and also
send<00:05:56.690> off<00:05:56.870> your<00:05:56.900> bubble<00:05:57.349> in<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:57.590> correct

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
send off your bubble in the correct

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.879 
send off your bubble in the correct
direction<00:05:58.039> and<00:05:59.139> that's<00:06:00.139> actually<00:06:00.380> with<00:06:00.740> all

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
direction and that's actually with all

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.430 
direction and that's actually with all
of<00:06:01.069> this<00:06:01.190> stuff<00:06:01.819> with<00:06:02.000> a<00:06:02.030> tower<00:06:02.750> and<00:06:03.080> these

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
of this stuff with a tower and these

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.260 
of this stuff with a tower and these
ones<00:06:03.830> are<00:06:04.009> the<00:06:04.039> generated<00:06:04.639> ones<00:06:04.849> so<00:06:05.030> let<00:06:05.180> me

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
ones are the generated ones so let me

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.680 
ones are the generated ones so let me
show<00:06:05.479> you<00:06:05.539> here<00:06:06.050> whoops<00:06:07.039> so<00:06:07.970> you<00:06:08.419> have<00:06:08.570> the

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
show you here whoops so you have the

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.310 
show you here whoops so you have the
angle<00:06:08.870> here<00:06:09.380> and<00:06:10.419> this<00:06:11.419> tower<00:06:11.659> let<00:06:12.199> me

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
angle here and this tower let me

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.760 
angle here and this tower let me
actually<00:06:13.240> so<00:06:14.240> there's<00:06:14.539> a<00:06:14.810> hundred<00:06:15.530> and<00:06:15.680> eighty

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
actually so there's a hundred and eighty

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.800 
actually so there's a hundred and eighty
degrees<00:06:16.159> pretty<00:06:16.460> much<00:06:16.610> right<00:06:16.880> you<00:06:17.240> can<00:06:17.389> aim

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
degrees pretty much right you can aim

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.909 
degrees pretty much right you can aim
far<00:06:18.650> low<00:06:19.130> here<00:06:20.120> and<00:06:20.469> then<00:06:21.469> there's<00:06:21.650> a<00:06:21.740> whole

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
far low here and then there's a whole

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.700 
far low here and then there's a whole
big<00:06:22.310> like<00:06:22.639> half<00:06:22.820> circle<00:06:23.240> up<00:06:23.659> to<00:06:23.719> over<00:06:24.259> here<00:06:24.560> and

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
big like half circle up to over here and

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.249 
big like half circle up to over here and
that's<00:06:24.919> pretty<00:06:25.340> much<00:06:25.460> 180<00:06:26.090> degrees<00:06:26.479> a<00:06:26.750> little

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:27.259 
that's pretty much 180 degrees a little

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:28.990 
that's pretty much 180 degrees a little
bit<00:06:27.500> fewer<00:06:27.889> because<00:06:28.070> you<00:06:28.250> can't<00:06:28.430> aim<00:06:28.669> directly

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
bit fewer because you can't aim directly

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.409 
bit fewer because you can't aim directly
to<00:06:29.539> the<00:06:29.659> side<00:06:29.870> but<00:06:30.820> pretty<00:06:31.820> much<00:06:31.880> what<00:06:32.000> ends<00:06:32.330> up

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
to the side but pretty much what ends up

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.800 
to the side but pretty much what ends up
happening<00:06:32.630> is<00:06:32.990> that<00:06:33.020> one<00:06:33.469> of<00:06:33.500> these<00:06:33.979> rows<00:06:34.810> gets

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
happening is that one of these rows gets

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.740 
happening is that one of these rows gets
triggered<00:06:36.469> so<00:06:37.009> there's<00:06:37.219> pretty<00:06:37.820> much<00:06:37.909> 180<00:06:38.570> of

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
triggered so there's pretty much 180 of

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.110 
triggered so there's pretty much 180 of
these<00:06:38.900> and<00:06:39.250> what's<00:06:40.250> going<00:06:40.490> to<00:06:40.610> happen<00:06:41.000> is

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
these and what's going to happen is

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.300 
these and what's going to happen is
we're<00:06:41.330> gonna<00:06:41.449> pick<00:06:41.900> depending<00:06:42.560> on<00:06:42.680> where<00:06:42.949> you

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
we're gonna pick depending on where you

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.510 
we're gonna pick depending on where you
look<00:06:43.520> on<00:06:43.699> the<00:06:43.820> board<00:06:44.380> one<00:06:45.380> of<00:06:45.620> these<00:06:45.889> to<00:06:46.099> run<00:06:46.280> so

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
look on the board one of these to run so

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.700 
look on the board one of these to run so
there's<00:06:46.759> tons<00:06:46.969> of<00:06:47.270> commands<00:06:47.750> here<00:06:47.960> but

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
there's tons of commands here but

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.209 
there's tons of commands here but
there's<00:06:49.400> only<00:06:50.060> one<00:06:50.750> of<00:06:51.020> them<00:06:51.409> each<00:06:51.650> tick

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:52.219 
there's only one of them each tick

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:54.790 
there's only one of them each tick
that's<00:06:52.699> going<00:06:53.000> to<00:06:53.090> execute<00:06:53.380> so<00:06:54.380> they<00:06:54.500> handle

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
that's going to execute so they handle

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.350 
that's going to execute so they handle
making<00:06:55.219> sure<00:06:55.340> the<00:06:55.490> pointer<00:06:55.849> points<00:06:56.180> in<00:06:56.270> the

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
making sure the pointer points in the

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.120 
making sure the pointer points in the
right<00:06:56.509> direction<00:06:56.659> and<00:06:57.080> the<00:06:57.229> tea<00:06:57.440> bubble

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
right direction and the tea bubble

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.180 
right direction and the tea bubble
travels<00:06:58.940> the<00:06:59.180> right<00:06:59.360> direction<00:06:59.659> and<00:07:00.229> then<00:07:01.159> of

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
travels the right direction and then of

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.620 
travels the right direction and then of
course<00:07:01.490> there's<00:07:01.699> some<00:07:01.789> game<00:07:02.000> logic<00:07:02.240> stuff

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
course there's some game logic stuff

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.209 
course there's some game logic stuff
around<00:07:03.020> that<00:07:03.259> but<00:07:03.440> I'm<00:07:03.590> not<00:07:03.770> going<00:07:03.979> to<00:07:04.099> go

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:04.219 
around that but I'm not going to go

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:05.620 
around that but I'm not going to go
through<00:07:04.460> it<00:07:04.550> all<00:07:04.699> because<00:07:05.090> it<00:07:05.120> would<00:07:05.360> take

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:05.630 
through it all because it would take

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.439 
through it all because it would take
forever<00:07:06.430> if<00:07:07.430> you're<00:07:07.639> interested<00:07:08.060> in<00:07:08.150> any

forever if you're interested in any

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:10.060 
forever if you're interested in any

certain aspect of this let me know and

certain aspect of this let me know and
I'll<00:07:10.219> happily<00:07:10.550> explain<00:07:11.240> it<00:07:11.360> more<00:07:11.659> to<00:07:11.900> you<00:07:12.110> in<00:07:12.349> a
