00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.690 
side there's those little two holes
right<00:03:24.780> there<00:03:25.079> not<00:03:25.470> them<00:03:25.829> not<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.579> in<00:03:26.639> the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
right there not them not the one in the

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.180 
right there not them not the one in the
middle<00:03:26.790> that's<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.239> screw<00:03:27.540> but<00:03:28.380> one<00:03:28.980> of<00:03:29.100> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
middle that's the screw but one of the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.990 
middle that's the screw but one of the
hinges<00:03:29.579> broke<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:30.590> at<00:03:31.590> least<00:03:31.799> it's<00:03:32.160> easy<00:03:32.700> to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
hinges broke so at least it's easy to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.500 
hinges broke so at least it's easy to
get<00:03:33.090> pop<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:33.750> open<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.799> have<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:34.950> DS

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
get pop this open if you have a DS

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.509 
get pop this open if you have a DS
stylus<00:03:36.510> guess<00:03:37.410> I'd<00:03:37.620> say<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.130> where<00:03:38.340> it

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
stylus guess I'd say this is where it

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.300 
stylus guess I'd say this is where it
fits<00:03:38.849> perfectly<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:40.319> put<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.130> there

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
fits perfectly just put that in there

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:49.659 
fits perfectly just put that in there
and<00:03:43.010> lift<00:03:44.010> up<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.400> screen<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:48.780> got<00:03:49.290> that

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
and lift up the screen and you got that

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.979 
and lift up the screen and you got that
and<00:03:50.669> you'd<00:03:51.090> probably<00:03:51.299> do<00:03:51.599> that<00:03:51.780> for

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
and you'd probably do that for

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.990 
and you'd probably do that for
modifications<00:03:52.889> or<00:03:53.099> just<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.609> get<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.790> other

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
modifications or just to get to other

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.349 
modifications or just to get to other
parts<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:55.440> technically<00:03:55.919> want<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.310> keep<00:03:56.519> one

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
parts you technically want to keep one

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:04.129 
parts you technically want to keep one
on<00:03:57.389> though<00:03:57.870> or<00:03:58.169> else<00:04:01.280> or<00:04:02.280> else<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:03.299> part<00:04:03.810> the

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
on though or else or else this part the

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.470 
on though or else or else this part the
screen<00:04:04.440> will<00:04:04.650> get<00:04:04.829> busted<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.519> just<00:04:05.669> slip

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
screen will get busted so you just slip

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.210 
screen will get busted so you just slip
that<00:04:06.810> there<00:04:07.260> push<00:04:08.250> good<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:09.889> hopefully<00:04:10.889> if

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
that there push good and hopefully if

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.810 
that there push good and hopefully if
you<00:04:11.340> do<00:04:11.489> have<00:04:11.700> both<00:04:11.940> hinges<00:04:12.680> yeah<00:04:13.680> so<00:04:14.400> that's

you do have both hinges yeah so that's

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.410 
you do have both hinges yeah so that's
