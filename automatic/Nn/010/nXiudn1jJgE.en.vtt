00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.840
 good afternoon dear colleagues benefit with 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.630
 you consultant pavel from the shop world 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.119
 models for beard 8 6 today we 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.800
 tell you about metal tracks 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.879
 whom we again came in big 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.980
 quantity from company silently no further 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.110
 than yesterday our store arrived very 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.320
 large batch of metal tracks 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.629
 working on various models 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.519
 armored vehicles firm free 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.620
 different in that it does enough 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.120
 current news and quite enough 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.170
 consistently releases those things that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.170
 always needed 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.899
 example tracks natively t-34 panther this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.329
 most popular anytime 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.640
 models but besides this came to us 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.500
 completely bare things for example trucks on 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.119
 the latest innovations technology 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.190
 we have it t-90 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.710
 bmp-1 t-64 and t-80 are those models that 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.179
 came out literally during the last 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 of the year 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.970
 what are metal tracks in principle 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.179
 then pay attention to this model 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.210
 isu-152 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.790
 from the dragon firm quite a requirement but 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.950
 the general model itself is not particularly 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.990
 the skull represents but the most interesting in 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.340
 she in my opinion is what is on her 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.590
 metal tracks are metal 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.610
 trucks 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.960
 greatly added to the model 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.729
 realism and entertainment 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.860
 you can always make it very beautiful and 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.799
 realistic slack if it occurs 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.399
 be spent on yourself the whole undercarriage 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.810
 can be defacto working and 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.430
 it can be very interesting 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.189
 effect of color that is, pay 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.409
 attention to the soup for super classic works 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.000
 with metal waste is very convenient not 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.430
 using a dry brush actually with 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.460
 using sandpaper on painted 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.560
 Trakom visited this effect wiped Stu 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.359
 because it is not a paint register 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.130
 real metal is so white here 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:13.350
 metal I know probably most likely 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.870
 it will beat the tin once assuming but 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.209
 grinding it turns out very cool then 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.250
 there is to everyone who is engaged in ddt 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.620
 quite seriously, you can 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.780
 claim plus to all trucks which 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.329
 lie in sets for example vinyl or 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.850
 plastic what quality they are quite 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.590
 dances match as desired 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.280
 Actually with these fears I work 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.690
 now you a little bit 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.599
 demonstrator art on the box we have lifi 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.299
 cool two two and two and three sachets in 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.560
 which which separately 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.209
 metal trucking beyond that 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.489
 wire of different diameters depends on 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.440
 size of cancer by which we 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.560
 as a matter of fact we collect the worker 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.970
 chains how is it going now 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.470
 demonstrate what we need first 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.610
 mini drill mini drill with drill 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.579
 suitable diameter me here trucks on 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:12.420
 so you are 7 2 respectively given 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.090
 a small instruction is written 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.150
 what you need here is a drill diameter of 0 5 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.879
 turned it over and take a special one from the set 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.640
 drake what we do next further we 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:30.829
 take through the amount of one piece 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.579
 for example and here here in the hole 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:37.049
 we drill through the instructions 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.650
 implemented boldly with us here is not very 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.650
 good but 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.650
 everyone has good things in store 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.480
 sharpened rhyme drills you with on you 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:04:01.380
 attack your own and ream 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:04:03.600
 hole in different serial but 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.450
 the essence of this does not change in any 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.310
 case will have to drill a little 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.190
 metal about metal in principle then light it 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:17.489
 easy because you have created a robot 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.710
 meditative processes on one chain like 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.950
 point the finger leaves somewhere in 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:26.689
 area successful work 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:34.789
 something 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:34.789
 we drilled square and connect 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.629
 chain workers will then have to wire 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.419
 already 5 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.700
 cut the piece we need 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.290
 by hands 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:06.020
 put it between these saga pins 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.969
 in the hole as a gateway here 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:15.139
 it turns out 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:16.729
 actually be a deduction circuit by 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.000
 the same principle we proceed further 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.550
 going with us and 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.330
 protect this way the amount 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.120
 tract individually from each system 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.400
 what works with tracks 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.020
 large modern tanks to 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.740
 small let walnuts good 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.750
 units 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:39.380
 completely changed and in fact when 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.669
 on the collected is sent and we fill 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.360
 neatly over here that's worthless 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:50.880
 glue this way we have these 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.199
 the goal itself is fixed 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.820
 keep mobility due to this 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:58.199
 it turns out the worker here personally personally 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.669
 already done it repeatedly 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.780
 and quite quite pleased with receiving checks 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.340
 after about the same model 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.070
 mental disseminations are popular 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.440
 basic yes there tracks named real 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.530
 does not seem to be using such a thing 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:17.520
 we sell models realism yes 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.770
 do not forget that after all the quality of casting 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.960
 lovely st very good road a little 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.199
 probably need to clean anyway sun 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.360
 through from metallic wallpaper to 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.300
 principle process is simple 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.849
 just a captured knife teaching them depth 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.949
 ink result which is very good 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:38.430
 texture casting essentially this type 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:41.580
 also nod really played 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:44.880
 I actually wanted to tell you 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.190
 come to us I think that we have 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.590
 soon 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.900
 Actually tell all show there 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.280
 we will find you the desired option 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.510
 Yes, the price immediately say such things 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.790
 appropriate but as it shows 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.030
 practice is to arrange that is on ordinary 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.960
 good dragon scale model panthers 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.350
 you canâ€™t spend money on a truck 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.240
 unequivocally and the result will not force itself 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:14.490
 wait a long time 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:17.970
 thank you very much never come to us 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.970
 it turns out a new formation
