 m 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.509
 m 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.330
 years 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.810
 at 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.890
 hahaha 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.890
 m 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.110
 it's a 19th frame that I fully 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.570
 stripping its feeding a piece so 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.479
 I already started to worship 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.310
 I did the stuffing in the corners 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 and after all that is my ornament 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.220
 I am imprints of a paste 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.060
 dental in which I words for 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.210
 restore the small pieces that we 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.210
 lack 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.990
 the little part cma mold and we get it out 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.310
 of the mold go still flexible and after one 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.230
 will stick it hot with glue 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.770
 at the poles painted white meudon the 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.770
 pause before running out 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.370
 after with a small purse we hold 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.370
 the excess of the collar 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.630
 the piece to harden these are after 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.360
 small jobs will reparlera undo 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.860
 goes on his executioner of the year though the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.690
 piece and will last art working all 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.710
 types the fdj ti the fassois give back 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.710
 still cicadas 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.229
 so once all the impressions 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.759
 finish all refined this framework there is going 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.880
 to be completely brown then to the leaf 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.880
 Golden 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.239
 who started in 87 as an apprentice 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.969
 in a society that brings not ready 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.280
 ten employees they made 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:42.510
 frames all that was beautiful adore 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.469
 it explains the extent to lenders 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.450
 gossipers framer joiner all that 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.739
 so I learned within this 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.269
 society there in 87 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.700
 which allowed me to learn with 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.859
 old to learn that piles of 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.520
 different things 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.160
 no no the techniques 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.330
 former 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.330
 their minds objects 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.130
 in fact we really respected the way 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.650
 which was done in the Baroque period 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.510
 work the same way so to see 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.370
 anyway at the fitting level the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.780
 same effects since all products 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.849
 that I use are eligible in found 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.470
 whether it's the white rabbit school the 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.450
 funny and casts all that is the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.830
 same and same thing so when we have them 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.540
 glue together they react everything to 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.270
 does the same way at the level of 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.160
 passages of refining he segalis 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.130
 perfectly making it possible to have 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.380
 scheer restores is almost invisible 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.380
 when finished with patinas 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.450
 we 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.710
 at the level of the colors of gold we had a 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.020
 color palette that allows us to 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.600
 in restoration to have the colors 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.610
 of gold depending on the object as a 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.430
 store technically in gilding we go 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.169
 stay in the same technical night as 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.180
 what they could do at the 17th 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.550
 even before the Egyptians all this 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.700
 the mortuary masks and and gilded a goal 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.200
 School was also held by the order 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.310
 maybe even thicker 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.210
 maybe it's possible but 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.680
 technically nothing has changed after so 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.020
 I do things very modern 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.740
 I'm going golden on resin options in 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.710
 plexiglass 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.160
 the techniques used are totally 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.160
 different 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.720
 I have a big clientele of 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.510

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.600
 of paintings of designers galleries 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:11.180
 architects are modern things 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.250

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.290

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.740
