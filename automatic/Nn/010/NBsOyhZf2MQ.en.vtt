he looked at the Chael Sonnen fight and
says<00:04:22.940> hey<00:04:23.120> maybe<00:04:23.360> i<00:04:23.450> should<00:04:23.660> look<00:04:23.810> through<00:04:24.020> the

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.510 
fighter in the world and that's my thing
I<00:04:42.970> think<00:04:43.180> I<00:04:43.300> think<00:04:43.600> it's<00:04:43.720> going<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:43.930> be<00:04:43.990> a

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
I think I think it's going to be a

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.650 
I think I think it's going to be a
exciting<00:04:45.520> two<00:04:45.670> rounds<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.210> I<00:04:46.270> think<00:04:46.510> it's

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
exciting two rounds and I think it's

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.830 
exciting two rounds and I think it's
going<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.930> be<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.110> war<00:04:47.830> of<00:04:47.890> attrition<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:48.840> a

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
going to be a war of attrition and a

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.540 
going to be a war of attrition and a
knockout<00:04:50.380> by<00:04:50.530> Anderson<00:04:50.890> Silva<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.400> third

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
knockout by Anderson Silva the third

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.100 
knockout by Anderson Silva the third
round<00:04:51.760> well<00:04:52.030> I<00:04:52.150> think<00:04:52.270> it<00:04:52.570> is<00:04:52.600> going<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:52.990> be<00:04:53.080> a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
round well I think it is going to be a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.020 
round well I think it is going to be a
very<00:04:53.170> interesting<00:04:53.740> fight<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.610> think<00:04:54.940> that

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
very interesting fight I think that

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.420 
very interesting fight I think that
seeing<00:04:55.510> Anderson<00:04:56.020> Silva<00:04:56.290> come<00:04:56.530> back<00:04:56.830> after

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
seeing Anderson Silva come back after

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.310 
seeing Anderson Silva come back after
his<00:04:57.730> fight<00:04:58.030> against<00:04:58.360> chill<00:04:58.540> son<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:58.930> yes<00:04:59.140> he

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
his fight against chill son and yes he

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.650 
his fight against chill son and yes he
did<00:04:59.500> win<00:04:59.830> in<00:05:00.040> the<00:05:00.130> last<00:05:00.340> round<00:05:01.030> there<00:05:01.360> but<00:05:01.540> he

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
did win in the last round there but he

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.480 
did win in the last round there but he
was<00:05:01.780> getting<00:05:02.050> dominated<00:05:02.530> there<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.130> I<00:05:03.310> think

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
was getting dominated there and I think

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.790 
was getting dominated there and I think
he<00:05:03.610> has<00:05:03.730> something<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.120> prove<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:05.200> now<00:05:05.740> of

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
he has something to prove that now of

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.680 
he has something to prove that now of
course<00:05:05.860> Chael<00:05:06.310> Sonnen<00:05:06.520> later<00:05:06.850> got<00:05:07.090> found<00:05:07.390> with

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
course Chael Sonnen later got found with

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.900 
course Chael Sonnen later got found with
steroids<00:05:08.380> in<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.560> system<00:05:08.920> and<00:05:09.100> that<00:05:09.130> but<00:05:09.880> i

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
steroids in the system and that but i

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.390 
steroids in the system and that but i
still<00:05:10.210> think<00:05:10.570> Security<00:05:11.230> fraud<00:05:11.440> well<00:05:12.130> there<00:05:12.280> is

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
still think Security fraud well there is

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.490 
still think Security fraud well there is
that<00:05:12.430> as<00:05:12.760> well<00:05:12.790> but<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.570> think<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:14.170> was<00:05:14.260> more

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
that as well but I think it was more

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.440 
that as well but I think it was more
just<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:15.010> overall<00:05:15.310> performance<00:05:16.000> that

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
just the overall performance that

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.409 
just the overall performance that
Anderson<00:05:16.870> Silva<00:05:17.140> wants<00:05:17.470> to<00:05:17.850> get<00:05:18.850> this<00:05:19.090> fight

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
Anderson Silva wants to get this fight

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.180 
Anderson Silva wants to get this fight
under<00:05:19.780> his<00:05:19.870> belt<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:20.169> we<00:05:20.260> can<00:05:20.410> have<00:05:20.560> this<00:05:20.860> might

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
under his belt so we can have this might

another belt that he has owned in the
UFC<00:05:35.530> this<00:05:36.340> one<00:05:36.580> I<00:05:36.610> like<00:05:36.970> Silva<00:05:37.450> I<00:05:37.570> like<00:05:37.750> him<00:05:37.930> in

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
UFC this one I like Silva I like him in

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.480 
UFC this one I like Silva I like him in
the<00:05:38.110> second<00:05:38.530> round<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:38.800> still<00:05:39.040> like<00:05:39.220> him<00:05:39.370> by

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
the second round I still like him by

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.770 
the second round I still like him by
knockout<00:05:39.940> I<00:05:39.970> think<00:05:40.210> this<00:05:40.300> is<00:05:40.360> going<00:05:40.540> to<00:05:40.600> be<00:05:40.750> a

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
knockout I think this is going to be a

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.590 
knockout I think this is going to be a
really<00:05:41.410> exciting<00:05:41.890> fight<00:05:42.240> something<00:05:43.240> that<00:05:43.479> we

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
really exciting fight something that we

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.100 
really exciting fight something that we
haven't<00:05:43.780> seen<00:05:44.110> from<00:05:44.710> Silva<00:05:45.330> consistently<00:05:46.330> but

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
haven't seen from Silva consistently but

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.110 
haven't seen from Silva consistently but

the level of their competition I think
that's<00:05:58.270> kind<00:05:58.600> of<00:05:58.720> depending<00:05:59.410> on<00:05:59.410> your

that's kind of depending on your

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.710 
that's kind of depending on your
fighting<00:05:59.979> style<00:06:00.160> that's<00:06:00.760> the<00:06:01.180> performance

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
fighting style that's the performance

you're going to get out of anderson
silva<00:06:03.760> and<00:06:03.820> i<00:06:03.910> think<00:06:04.090> that's<00:06:04.270> one<00:06:04.750> of<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:04.900> big

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
silva and i think that's one of the big

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.500 
silva and i think that's one of the big
issues<00:06:05.080> that<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:06.460> Dana<00:06:06.729> White<00:06:06.970> has<00:06:07.090> had<00:06:07.300> and

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
issues that the Dana White has had and

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.510 
issues that the Dana White has had and
that's<00:06:07.570> you<00:06:08.380> know<00:06:08.410> with<00:06:08.740> Anderson<00:06:09.340> and<00:06:09.490> I

that's you know with Anderson and I

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.340 
that's you know with Anderson and I
think<00:06:09.729> that's<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:10.090> reason<00:06:10.270> that<00:06:10.479> guys<00:06:11.169> like

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
think that's the reason that guys like

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.900 
think that's the reason that guys like
you<00:06:11.530> shun<00:06:11.680> economy<00:06:12.130> haven't<00:06:12.580> gotten<00:06:12.729> an

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
opportunity guys that maybe are a little

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.400 
opportunity guys that maybe are a little
