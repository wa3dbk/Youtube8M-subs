00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
so now if I can and the next step is to

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:24.130 
so now if I can and the next step is to
let<00:02:13.910> out<00:02:14.150> all<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.930> air<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:23.330> then<00:02:23.810> we<00:02:23.990> move

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
let out all of the air and then we move

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.940 
let out all of the air and then we move

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
on to the punter a packet okay so now

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.820 
on to the punter a packet okay so now
we've<00:02:28.100> located<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:29.030> puncture<00:02:29.990> little<00:02:30.680> hole

poncho just rub it down for about 30

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.960 
poncho just rub it down for about 30
seconds<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.830> minute<00:02:54.160> okay<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.940> next

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
seconds to a minute okay and the next

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.430 
seconds to a minute okay and the next
step<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:57.770> get<00:02:58.010> some<00:02:58.370> rubber<00:02:59.209> solution<00:03:00.110> glue

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
step you get some rubber solution glue

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:08.050 
step you get some rubber solution glue
right<00:03:01.250> here<00:03:02.080> just<00:03:03.080> put<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.470> on<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.800> area

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.990 

okay<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.739> then<00:03:11.750> from<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.870> patches<00:03:14.000> find

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
okay and then from the patches find

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.210 
okay and then from the patches find
yourself<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:16.519> rub<00:03:17.519> rubber<00:03:18.209> patch<00:03:22.010> now<00:03:23.010> this

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
yourself a rub rubber patch now this

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.039 
yourself a rub rubber patch now this
stage<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.760> can<00:03:24.060> actually<00:03:24.209> just<00:03:24.510> blow<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:24.900> this

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
stage you can actually just blow on this

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:33.020 
stage you can actually just blow on this
just<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.440> quicken<00:03:25.799> up<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.269> drying<00:03:32.030> actually

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
just to quicken up the drying actually

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.539 
just to quicken up the drying actually
takes<00:03:33.239> about<00:03:33.450> four<00:03:33.810> minutes<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.440> dry<00:03:36.470> now

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
takes about four minutes to dry now

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.520 
takes about four minutes to dry now
whilst<00:03:38.549> that<00:03:38.790> sort<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:39.989> little<00:03:40.260> bit<00:03:40.349> dry

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
whilst that sort of is a little bit dry

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.630 
whilst that sort of is a little bit dry
we<00:03:40.650> can<00:03:40.799> just<00:03:40.920> put<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.459> top<00:03:41.670> there

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.280 

okay<00:03:47.640> just<00:03:47.790> hold<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.420> down<00:03:48.720> press<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.260> down

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
okay just hold that down press it down

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.920 
okay just hold that down press it down
really<00:03:49.739> hard<00:03:51.170> now<00:03:52.170> at<00:03:52.319> this<00:03:52.470> stage<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:53.930> thought

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
really hard now at this stage I thought

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.649 
really hard now at this stage I thought
it<00:03:54.989> might<00:03:55.109> be<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.379> good<00:03:55.500> idea<00:03:55.620> to<00:03:56.299> put<00:03:57.299> this<00:03:57.450> in

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
it might be a good idea to put this in

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.979 
it might be a good idea to put this in
like<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.870> clamp<00:03:58.319> or<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.829> vice<00:03:59.340> just<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.180> hold<00:04:00.810> it

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
like a clamp or a vice just to hold it

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.809 
like a clamp or a vice just to hold it
down<00:04:01.140> for<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.620> next<00:04:01.769> sort<00:04:02.159> of<00:04:02.250> five<00:04:02.459> minutes

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
down for the next sort of five minutes

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:19.140 
down for the next sort of five minutes
so<00:04:03.659> that's<00:04:03.840> what<00:04:03.959> we're<00:04:04.109> going<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.319> do<00:04:04.470> now
