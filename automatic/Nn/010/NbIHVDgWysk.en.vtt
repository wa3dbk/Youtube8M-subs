the stability for the table pop these
into<00:00:53.139> place<00:00:53.409> like<00:00:53.589> so<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:59.170> that's<00:00:59.440> as<00:00:59.620> if<00:00:59.949> we

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
into place like so and that's as if we

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.160 
into place like so and that's as if we
spin<00:01:00.339> it<00:01:00.370> around<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.629> can<00:01:01.690> see<00:01:01.899> that<00:01:01.929> it's

stable you can also see there is more
fabric<00:01:19.180> at<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.270> bottom<00:01:19.600> for<00:01:19.720> another<00:01:19.930> shelf

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
fabric at the bottom for another shelf

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.130 
fabric at the bottom for another shelf
that<00:01:20.320> we<00:01:20.500> need<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.120> top<00:01:22.300> section<00:01:22.720> all<00:01:22.990> we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
that we need so the top section all we

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.180 
that we need so the top section all we
do<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:24.400> just<00:01:24.970> take<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.440> frames<00:01:26.680> here<00:01:26.950> and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
do is just take the the frames here and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.820 
do is just take the the frames here and
when<00:01:27.940> we<00:01:27.970> look<00:01:28.180> closely<00:01:28.390> at<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:29.260> top<00:01:29.410> here<00:01:29.680> we

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
when we look closely at the top here we

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
when we look closely at the top here we
can<00:01:29.950> see<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.220> there's<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.400> couple<00:01:30.550> of<00:01:30.700> holes

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
can see that there's a couple of holes

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.120 
can see that there's a couple of holes
just<00:01:31.690> in<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.870> top<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.320> they<00:01:32.470> correspond<00:01:33.010> to

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
just in the top and they correspond to

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.300 
just in the top and they correspond to
the<00:01:33.460> grippers<00:01:33.790> on<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.720> frame<00:01:34.960> you<00:01:35.200> just<00:01:36.010> pop

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
the grippers on the frame you just pop

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.390 
the grippers on the frame you just pop
them<00:01:36.430> into<00:01:36.610> place<00:01:36.910> like<00:01:37.540> so<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:39.070> drop<00:01:39.280> that

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
them into place like so you drop that

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.950 
them into place like so you drop that
one<00:01:39.550> in<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:41.290> we<00:01:41.410> do<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.680> on<00:01:41.770> both<00:01:41.920> sides<00:01:42.220> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
one in if we do that on both sides that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.690 
one in if we do that on both sides that
gives<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.860> edges<00:01:45.190> of<00:01:45.370> your<00:01:46.110> tabletop<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
gives you the edges of your tabletop you

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.450 
gives you the edges of your tabletop you
just<00:01:51.909> think<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.450> pop<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.320> into<00:01:53.620> place<00:01:53.890> just

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
just think that pop that into place just

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.540 
just think that pop that into place just

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
and what we have is a section which of

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.030 
and what we have is a section which of
six<00:02:00.790> in<00:02:01.120> between<00:02:01.480> here<00:02:01.690> at<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.620> end<00:02:02.770> we<00:02:02.890> have
