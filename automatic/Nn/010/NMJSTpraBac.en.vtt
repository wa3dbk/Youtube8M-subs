00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.270
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.790
 marakasi you watch the show chic 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.490
 position issue 56 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.889
 first location is on 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.760
 reworked map of northern 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.939
 squared g3 and you need a quick 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.220
 tank preferably with a strong tower also 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.250
 you should be pushed here enough 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.590
 I think of one ally to find 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.840
 anyone not a problem and this place 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.079
 very curious here you can do 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.940
 many useful things worth noting that 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.700
 here there is such a small bump 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.160
 which allows you to hide the case and 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.399
 tank tower thanks for this map 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.250
 deed well and from here you shoot it 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.920
 direction where enemies most often attack 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.460
 that is, there is always someone to shoot and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.980
 This of course is an obvious plus as well you 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.640
 it will be difficult to punch if your tank 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.829
 strong tower well and in general you are 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.339
 here you can completely hide 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.530
 tank and this is of course very cool but there is 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.170
 big drawback and it lies in 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.380
 that is likely here and takes out Orton 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.240
 therefore, this position is only valid if 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.920
 she's not here 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.049
 next one I'm very strong too 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.619
 I like it on the map 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.650
 tundra squared b2 and here it is necessary 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.380
 need a smart tank to come here 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.860
 at the same time without the help of allies that is very 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.560
 even well, well, it is desirable to have an exact 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.340
 and piercing gun to shoot 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.229
 effectively from afar and this position 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.000
 great for a sniper from here you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.520
 be able to shoot through extensive 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.920
 territory besides to enemies is pretty 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.159
 long distance therefore light up once 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.049
 it will be difficult but if it is still a light bulb 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.600
 light up then you can hide behind 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.030
 a small mountain of disadvantages is worth 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.640
 note that if opponents will not 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.100
 they will not be substituted then you 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.280
 maybe just stay here and not 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.860
 cause damage which of course will upset 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.959
 any 100 you 100 also a disadvantage 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.360
 we can assume that you shoot at 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.060
 someone else's light and therefore you are given 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.849
 to this 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.590
 same experience but in principle for cardboard 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.080
 tank is a minor flaw 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.819
 because he is better off 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.670
 somewhere in a safe place and 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.750
 shoot the enemy from afar 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.800
 realize your exact and penetrative 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.769
 weapon and I think tactics for such 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.310
 tanks excellent next point goes on 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.650
 a steppe map in j3 square and better there 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.470
 just ride a fast tank with a good one 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.530
 disguise for example on hellcat and well or 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.540
 on some other similar tanks from here 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.569
 you can shoot through 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.030
 territory but at the same time when the light is great 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.239
 a chance of being dealt a lot at once 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.730
 damage and it's certainly dangerous also this 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.580
 place is perfect for defa square 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.610
 edge one where opponents can attack 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.730
 you can hide your body and you will 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.069
 pull out the towers here and of course 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.440
 it is worth remembering that on the center of the enemy 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.299
 no one should be ready for you to be 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.250
 just keep shooting because 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.500
 the distance here is small and the chance 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.959
 shine high in such a case 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.880
 Overall, this place is ambiguous with one 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.829
 parties here can be good at shooting with 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.510
 the other can be very dangerous 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:32.170
 then we have a dot on the map hidden 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.239
 village squared b 9 and best 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.590
 go there on a fast tank with strong 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.989
 the tower for example on the t-62a stand next to 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.690
 this stone and here you can at the expense of it 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.389
 great tank tower well 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.030
 Naturally there are many opponents and you 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:51.250
 You can well pamper this one 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.340
 the stone allows you to completely hide your 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.010
 tank so as not to risk once again well 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.709
 Naturally you will be pierced here very 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.350
 hard and every shot which 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.109
 opponents will do for you is not no strikes 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.139
 your allies will give you the opportunity 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.940
 shoot them deal damage to everything 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.940
 why should I add that here you are 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.340
 shoot at your light it means 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.549
 what gives you a decent amount of experience 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.400
 it's always good and of the minuses 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.830
 note that here and takes out Orton probably 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.990
 better not to go here if the arts are many and 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.539
 given too dangerous and 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.759
 and it is also worth noting that if 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.650
 opponents will not go to this flank or 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:35.889
 they will just be there and paint somewhere 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.620
 tone the usefulness of this place is greatly 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.599
 reduced and so is it a personal point which 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.819
 allows you to go and well 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.669
 And it's always fun. 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:49.120
 next is the point on lasville map 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.699
 squared q 0 and here you can go almost to 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.630
 any heavy tank that is strong 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:57.819
 you must break the sides here 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:01.360
 fences become like this and 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:04.599
 you can tank here with a tower and also 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.360
 the very same opponent 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:09.639
 it will be difficult to damage you and you 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.270
 You can calmly shoot at them and 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.940
 go to reload shelter tactics 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.340
 interesting for a heavy tank well 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.220
 suitable from the pros is also worth noting 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.740
 that he lacks art well and you 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.900
 hold back enemies here they are there 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.360
 will shoot with you wait for you 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.240
 thus during this time your allies 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.940
 may go to the enemies in the rear and you 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.130
 you can safely disassemble them well and 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.280
 this is all friends thank you so much 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.690
