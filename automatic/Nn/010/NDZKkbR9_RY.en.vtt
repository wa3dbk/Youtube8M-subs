00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
Sun yeah I'm sort of new to just started

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.120 
Sun yeah I'm sort of new to just started
so<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:37.970> also<00:01:38.330> I<00:01:38.600> want<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.470> ask<00:01:39.619> what<00:01:39.950> is

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
so and also I want to ask what is

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.370 
so and also I want to ask what is
because<00:01:41.119> I<00:01:41.209> can<00:01:41.390> make<00:01:41.509> into<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.899> gun<00:01:42.170> hammer

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
because I can make into a gun hammer

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.340 
because I can make into a gun hammer
flow<00:01:42.679> type<00:01:42.979> as<00:01:43.130> well<00:01:43.539> this<00:01:44.539> thing<00:01:45.909> yeah<00:01:46.909> so<00:01:47.569> but

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
flow type as well this thing yeah so but

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.020 
flow type as well this thing yeah so but
I'm<00:01:48.560> thinking<00:01:49.009> it's<00:01:49.130> weaker<00:01:49.490> because<00:01:49.880> the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
I'm thinking it's weaker because the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.460 
I'm thinking it's weaker because the
only<00:01:50.270> has<00:01:50.360> 5%<00:01:51.369> e2s<00:01:52.369> fire<00:01:52.610> attribute<00:01:52.879> of<00:01:53.470> 300

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
only has 5% e2s fire attribute of 300

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.130 
only has 5% e2s fire attribute of 300
does<00:01:55.160> that<00:01:55.310> mean<00:01:55.459> it<00:01:55.580> adds<00:01:55.729> fire<00:01:56.060> damage<00:01:56.539> or<00:01:56.810> is

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
does that mean it adds fire damage or is

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.430 
does that mean it adds fire damage or is
it<00:01:57.319> what<00:01:57.649> does<00:01:57.709> that<00:01:57.830> mean<00:01:58.450> if<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.599> adds<00:01:59.840> fire

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
it what does that mean if it adds fire
