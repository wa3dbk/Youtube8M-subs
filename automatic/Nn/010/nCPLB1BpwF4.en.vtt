quality<00:00:54.840> base<00:00:55.460> for<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> twin<00:00:56.760> board<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
quality base for a twin board are you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.069 
quality base for a twin board are you
looking<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.789> 7,500<00:00:59.789> sintered<00:01:00.510> base<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.960> this

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
looking at 7,500 sintered base on this

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.960 
looking at 7,500 sintered base on this
one<00:01:02.690> definitely<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.989> very<00:01:04.320> fast

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
one definitely going to be very fast

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.429 
one definitely going to be very fast
it's<00:01:05.970> gonna<00:01:06.090> require<00:01:06.270> some<00:01:06.689> waxing<00:01:07.140> more<00:01:07.260> so

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
it's gonna require some waxing more so

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.130 
it's gonna require some waxing more so
than<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.979> know<00:01:08.100> your<00:01:08.280> $300.00<00:01:08.850> twin<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.990> an

than you know your $300.00 twin with an
extruded<00:01:10.560> base<00:01:10.740> wood<00:01:11.090> but<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.600> only<00:01:13.110> gonna

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
extruded base wood but it is only gonna

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.990 
extruded base wood but it is only gonna
get<00:01:13.530> faster<00:01:13.920> throughout<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> life<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> and

get faster throughout the life of it and
you<00:01:15.600> definitely<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> speed<00:01:16.350> payout<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
you definitely get the speed payout you

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.600 
you definitely get the speed payout you
know<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.060> more<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.570> relaxing<00:01:19.290> up

from there
you've<00:01:21.330> got<00:01:22.280> sidewall<00:01:23.280> construction<00:01:23.540> DC<00:01:24.540> does

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you've got sidewall construction DC does

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.539 
you've got sidewall construction DC does
it<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:24.960> all<00:01:25.140> their<00:01:25.320> boards<00:01:25.680> everybody's<00:01:26.250> doing

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
it on all their boards everybody's doing

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.370 
it on all their boards everybody's doing
it<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.140> makes<00:01:28.290> it

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
it you have to do it it just makes it

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.469 
it you have to do it it just makes it
more<00:01:28.500> durable<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:29.579> better<00:01:29.790> edge<00:01:30.000> bite<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
more durable got better edge bite and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.840 
more durable got better edge bite and
icy<00:01:30.689> hard<00:01:30.900> pack<00:01:31.110> conditions<00:01:31.640> this<00:01:32.640> one's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
icy hard pack conditions this one's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.789 
icy hard pack conditions this one's
definitely<00:01:33.420> got<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.049> blunt<00:01:34.350> nose<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
definitely got a kind of blunt nose and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.310 
definitely got a kind of blunt nose and
tail<00:01:34.950> shape<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.049> saves<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
tail shape going on to it saves in the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.710 
tail shape going on to it saves in the
swing<00:01:37.590> weight<00:01:37.909> you<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:39.090> need<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> extra

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
swing weight you don't need that extra

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.020 
swing weight you don't need that extra
material<00:01:39.990> there<00:01:40.500> unless<00:01:41.490> you're<00:01:41.670> really

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
material there unless you're really

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.730 
material there unless you're really
rocking<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:42.899> three<00:01:43.350> foot<00:01:43.560> deep

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
rocking like you know three foot deep

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.109 
rocking like you know three foot deep
powder<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> probably<00:01:44.729> got<00:01:44.939> another

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
powder but then you probably got another

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.289 
powder but then you probably got another
board<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:46.369> other<00:01:47.369> than<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
board for that other than that the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.569

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
radius to flat on the nose and the tail

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.609 
radius to flat on the nose and the tail
puts<00:01:50.970> all<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> curvature<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.530> this

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
puts all the curvature right in this

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.740 
puts all the curvature right in this
region<00:01:52.829> right<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.189> runs<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.180> flat<00:01:54.420> coming

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
region right here runs it flat coming
