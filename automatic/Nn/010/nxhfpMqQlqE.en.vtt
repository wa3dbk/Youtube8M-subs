familiar<00:01:43.380> with<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.950> magic<00:01:44.340> wand<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.939> we

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
familiar with the magic wand that we

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.960 
familiar with the magic wand that we
jokingly<00:01:45.450> call<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.810> tragic<00:01:46.259> wand<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:47.399> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
jokingly call the tragic wand because it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490 
jokingly call the tragic wand because it
doesn't<00:01:48.270> quite<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:48.990> want<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.320> all

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
doesn't quite do what we want to do all

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.840 
doesn't quite do what we want to do all
the<00:01:49.619> time<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.040> let's<00:01:50.369> use<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> quick

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the time but let's use the quick

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.450 
the time but let's use the quick
selection<00:01:51.030> tool<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.560> simply<00:01:53.070> allows

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
selection tool and so this simply allows

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.719 
selection tool and so this simply allows
us<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.149> paint<00:01:54.450> over<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.950> area<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.460> want<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
us to paint over the area we want to

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.510 
us to paint over the area we want to
remove<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.960> as<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.439> select<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.009> you'll<00:01:59.310> see

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
remove so as I select that you'll see

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.160 
remove so as I select that you'll see
the<00:01:59.700> little<00:01:59.729> marching<00:02:00.299> ants<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.899> around

the little marching ants going around
this<00:02:01.439> has<00:02:01.619> selected<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.280> area<00:02:02.549> very<00:02:02.610> easily

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210

now I'm going to go down here to this
lower<00:02:05.369> green<00:02:05.729> area<00:02:06.210> now<00:02:06.960> there's<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.200> lot<00:02:07.710> of

and that will deselect you'll notice

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.720 
and that will deselect you'll notice
that<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.350> background<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:44.100> no<00:02:44.250> longer<00:02:44.460> there

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
that the background is no longer there

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.100 
that the background is no longer there
but<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.420> checkerboard<00:02:46.050> pattern

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
but we have this checkerboard pattern

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.140 
but we have this checkerboard pattern
well<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.100> Photoshop<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.820> checkerboard

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
well in Photoshop this checkerboard

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.940 
well in Photoshop this checkerboard
pattern<00:02:48.410> basically<00:02:49.410> represents

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
pattern basically represents

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.220 
pattern basically represents
transparency<00:02:50.850> there's<00:02:51.090> actually<00:02:51.600> no<00:02:51.750> pixels

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
transparency there's actually no pixels

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.530 
transparency there's actually no pixels
there<00:02:52.550> so<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> next<00:02:53.850> thing<00:02:54.030> we<00:02:54.180> want<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.450> do

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
there so the next thing we want to do

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.660 
there so the next thing we want to do
now<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.720> we've<00:02:54.960> removed<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.500> background<00:02:56.100> we

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
now that we have this all I see is the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.530 
now that we have this all I see is the
brick<00:03:34.740> wall<00:03:34.980> if<00:03:35.310> we<00:03:35.490> take<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.670> closer<00:03:36.000> look<00:03:36.150> at

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
brick wall if we take a closer look at

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.170 
brick wall if we take a closer look at
your<00:03:37.530> layer<00:03:37.830> palette<00:03:38.280> over<00:03:38.490> here<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.880> notice

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
your layer palette over here you notice

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.540 
your layer palette over here you notice
our<00:03:39.330> new<00:03:39.360> layer<00:03:39.750> called<00:03:40.500> layer<00:03:40.770> 1<00:03:41.160> let's

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
our new layer called layer 1 let's

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.260 
our new layer called layer 1 let's
rename<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.930> let's<00:03:43.230> call<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.640> brick<00:03:44.640> wall

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
rename that and let's call it brick wall

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.780 
rename that and let's call it brick wall
and<00:03:45.709> will<00:03:46.709> notice<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.160> brick<00:03:47.370> wall<00:03:47.610> is

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
and will notice that the brick wall is

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.540 
and will notice that the brick wall is
on<00:03:47.910> top<00:03:48.270> so<00:03:48.690> basically<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.350> way<00:03:49.380> layers<00:03:49.740> work

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
on top so basically the way layers work

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.000 
on top so basically the way layers work
if<00:03:51.330> whatever<00:03:51.750> layer<00:03:52.050> is<00:03:52.200> on<00:03:52.350> top<00:03:52.380> will<00:03:52.770> cover

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
if whatever layer is on top will cover

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.250 
if whatever layer is on top will cover
up<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.400> layer<00:03:53.550> below<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.940> so<00:03:54.720> I'm<00:03:54.990> just<00:03:55.140> going

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
up the layer below it so I'm just going

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.310 
up the layer below it so I'm just going
to<00:03:55.350> click<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.680> drag<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:56.070> layer<00:03:56.610> down<00:03:57.320> one

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
to click and drag that layer down one

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.480 
to click and drag that layer down one
layer<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.920> now<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.730> have<00:04:00.120> our<00:04:00.650> our<00:04:01.650> two<00:04:01.950> muscle

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
layer and now I have our our two muscle

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.480 
layer and now I have our our two muscle
men<00:04:02.700> sitting<00:04:03.120> over<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.600> brick<00:04:03.780> wall<00:04:04.020> so

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
men sitting over the brick wall so

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.949 
men sitting over the brick wall so
that's<00:04:05.490> simple<00:04:05.940> there's<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.450> number<00:04:06.630> of<00:04:06.750> other

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
that's simple there's a number of other

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.870 
that's simple there's a number of other
ways<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.200> do<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.530> but<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:07.980> figure<00:04:08.430> these<00:04:08.610> are

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
ways to do it but I figure these are

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.060 
ways to do it but I figure these are
some<00:04:09.090> great<00:04:09.360> tools<00:04:09.690> always<00:04:10.560> knowing<00:04:10.739> how<00:04:10.980> to

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
some great tools always knowing how to

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.580 
some great tools always knowing how to
select<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.700> understanding<00:04:12.209> layers<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:13.320> is

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
select and understanding layers that is

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.530 
select and understanding layers that is
transferable<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.489> so<00:04:14.760> many<00:04:14.880> other<00:04:15.209> things

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540
