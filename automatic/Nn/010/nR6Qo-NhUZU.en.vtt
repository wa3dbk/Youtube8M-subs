to<00:02:03.240> help<00:02:03.450> reduce<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.130> can<00:02:05.280> wear<00:02:05.399> gloves

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
to help reduce this you can wear gloves

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.029 
to help reduce this you can wear gloves
or<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.689> could<00:02:06.899> probably<00:02:07.320> wear<00:02:07.619> some<00:02:07.860> long
