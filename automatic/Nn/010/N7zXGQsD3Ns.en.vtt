00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the force usable picking so you pick

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.090 
the force usable picking so you pick
lightly<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.390> cleans<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.860> heavy

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
lightly it cleans up and you think heavy

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.260 
lightly it cleans up and you think heavy
it<00:00:39.000> gets<00:00:39.690> three<00:00:39.960> dirty<00:00:40.200> pretty<00:00:40.350> quickly<00:00:41.270> also

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270

any change the volume controls or tone

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.560 
any change the volume controls or tone
controls<00:00:45.890> will<00:00:46.890> really<00:00:47.070> affect<00:00:47.370> how<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
controls will really affect how that

you're<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.640> playing<00:01:02.880> video<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:04.250> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
you're in a playing video is that you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
you're in a playing video is that you
can<00:01:06.860> use<00:01:07.860> line<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.370> which<00:01:09.150> will<00:01:09.300> use<00:01:09.720> this

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
can use line out which will use this

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.920 
can use line out which will use this
almost<00:01:10.440> as<00:01:10.620> a<00:01:10.650> pedal<00:01:11.100> like<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.460> preamp<00:01:11.940> so<00:01:12.870> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
almost as a pedal like a preamp so it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.450 
almost as a pedal like a preamp so it
comes<00:01:13.110> through<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> Greta<00:01:13.710> app<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.280> you'll

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
comes through the Greta app and you'll

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.899 
comes through the Greta app and you'll
see<00:01:14.670> us<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:15.000> into<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.390> line<00:01:15.570> 6<00:01:15.960> amp<00:01:16.170> over<00:01:16.500> there

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
see us go into the line 6 amp over there

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.219 
see us go into the line 6 amp over there
so<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.210> app<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.720> go<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:18.930> loud<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.200> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
so this app can really go as loud as you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.260 
so this app can really go as loud as you
want<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.740> put<00:01:20.070> through<00:01:20.310> any<00:01:20.520> old<00:01:20.909> app<00:01:21.120> you

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
want just put through any old app you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.469 
want just put through any old app you
have<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.930> clean<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.799> it'll<00:01:23.760> work<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.390> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
have on clean and it'll work like a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.920 
have on clean and it'll work like a
piece<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.080> will<00:01:25.260> amplify<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.520> tube<00:01:26.930> through

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
piece it will amplify the tube through

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.550 
piece it will amplify the tube through
tube<00:01:28.200> sound<00:01:28.440> through<00:01:28.950> any<00:01:29.659> non<00:01:30.659> tube<00:01:31.020> amp<00:01:31.229> or
