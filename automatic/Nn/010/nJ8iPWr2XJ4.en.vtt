00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.090
 real height 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.090

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.760

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.860
 it does not matter what you do half but 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.470
 that you do it from the heart of delivery 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.600
 love and again more than not do it for 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.970
 money for personal recognition by 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.590
 a false self-esteem all the things that 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.360
 what really matters is passion 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.240
 with the love with which he shares 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.210
 things to share is the opposite of selfishness 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.250
 then for me this after that is 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.350
 to share is to open your heart so that 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.870
