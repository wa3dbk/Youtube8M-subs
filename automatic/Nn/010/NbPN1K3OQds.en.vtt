00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.000
 hello this month let's talk about the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.610
 turn with ormieres or provide but 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.250
 especially tight so here we have a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.810
 rut at t bell that's pretty tight 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.310
 which we are going to work on the phase of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.619
 braking 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.760
 the middle of the turn and the exit where we 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.760
 put back the feet on which stone 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.220
 so we will work the first 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.079
 cornering stage is braking so 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.580
 it's a portion that's often enough 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.350
 short 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.150
 so it's going to start from here we're going 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.320
 start having your finger on the brake 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.760
 here so here is the part where we 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.440
 take really hard because we have 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.150
 still right was always entitled in 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.790
 his turn so we can start 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.129
 after the strong enough and from here 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.510
 we sit and keep carmes the finger 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.489
 on the brake we release the rear brake 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.879
 and we keep his job we have to keep 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.350
 the finger on it not braked but keep 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.720
 a pressure on the wheel that remains 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.510
 well plated in order from here 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.430
 we will sit down and stretch his leg to 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.860
 keep a security 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.200
 so we have to be there enough legs 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.260
 tense and foot especially so much better than 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.770
 your leg can lick the floor so we 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.080
 will stay in this position so far 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.880
 and from here we will give his 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.200
 foot on which stone the earliest 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.500
 possible to have an action and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.510
 control his bike and from the moment 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.159
 where we open the guys are cowardly offers himself 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.740
 before so the movement is pretty much 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.990
 so we 're laughing we release the brake 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.429
 before and we stay pretty in the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.390
 perfect turn it would be that there is 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.000
 no brutality 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.130
 so no elbow on a trip and we get 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.969
 really gives a lot of gas when you're 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.609
 law 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.249
 so we gently re-accelerate heroes to the 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.249
 full acceleration is done roughly 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.249
 right here 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.280
 the big brakes in full shape keeps 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.280
 job 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.329
 braking here at home the gard 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.930
 good here now we're going to talk 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.430
 of the turn after horner we're going 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.260
 start with the braking phase too 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.489
 this time it is really going to happen the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.569
 right because just now it was 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.280
 on an angle so we'll get right 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.780
 so far this time we will keep the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.849
 foot on the brake a little later to 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.000
 keep the bike well grounded for 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.430
 beat the n have from the east until then we 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.860
 remains as much as possible and since then on 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.989
 hold his feet out his leg here for a 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.810
 shorter moment than just now and 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.220
 we are recovering from there we go 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.069
 tighten a little bit the turn on the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.290
 exit we put the foot on the hold 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.730
 feet while forcing to have more 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.239
 possible traction is indeed the 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.239
 bigger possible 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.920
 to be in denmark 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.920
 robert 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:35.360
 but every week so there this shot 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.820
 we will make the internal journey to 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.530
 brothers so finally we'll be arriving 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.690
 really more straight compared to 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.090
 the other of the heart we will drive with the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.710
 motorcycle we stay up the longest 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.590
 possible also we sit here for 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.910
 even stabilize that motorcycle at the same time 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.310
 rear brake to lock the wheel there 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.620
 must slightly breed for not that the 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.960
 moto call and we make a small gesture 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.850
 like that to rotate to nothing he has 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.420
 once we are in the axis we put 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.500
 feet on the feet in accelerates 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.100
 so here the two techniques are good 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.040
 different 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.810
 there is one where we will no longer seek a 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.180
 rolled his turn left over on English 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.030
 very long time which gives more 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.190
 risk losing the front because we have 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.480
 did not sleep yesterday to run away 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.880
 and then to the second technique where we 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.040
 really gets right up to the last 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.350
 moment braked and there we will put a shot 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.000
 rear brake to rotate their 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.900
 share yesterday and go back to the lax and so 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.730
 stopped these two different techniques 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.230
 interior scenes we spend a lot 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.560
 less time on the angle or not the 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.570
 everything and therefore less chance of falling 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.750
 after that it's up to you to see what 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.510
 technical show choose which movie with 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.800
 one of the two so I'll go there 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.240
 show the difference between 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.690
 the outside of the bend 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.430
 and then inside so you have judge 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.220
 by you the difference between 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.670
 two passages and it will be up to you 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.670
 your choice
