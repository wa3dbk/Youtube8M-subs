00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
trying to either gain speed you give up

trying to either gain speed you give up
the<00:01:58.740> power<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.219> power<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> speed

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the power or power it's it's the speed
