this out of the way and focus on the
battery<00:01:33.960> itself<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.799> right<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.240> is

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
battery itself for right now here it is

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.840 
battery itself for right now here it is
it<00:01:36.810> has<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.350> rubberized<00:01:37.920> coating<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
it has like a rubberized coating so it

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.300 
it has like a rubberized coating so it
feels<00:01:39.030> quite<00:01:39.390> durable<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:40.470> not<00:01:40.650> too<00:01:40.890> large

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
feels quite durable it's not too large

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.670 
feels quite durable it's not too large
obviously<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.299> bigger<00:01:42.479> than<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.720> normal<00:01:43.170> you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
obviously it's bigger than a normal you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.499 
obviously it's bigger than a normal you
know<00:01:43.799> smaller<00:01:44.250> mobile<00:01:44.610> battery<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.360> it's

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
know smaller mobile battery but it's

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
car and the port for that is hidden

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.069 
car and the port for that is hidden
under<00:03:43.280> this<00:03:43.459> rubberized<00:03:43.820> flap<00:03:44.390> right<00:03:44.690> here

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
under this rubberized flap right here

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.360 
under this rubberized flap right here
and<00:03:45.260> that's<00:03:45.680> where<00:03:45.890> you'll<00:03:46.010> need<00:03:46.160> those

and that's where you'll need those

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.740 
and that's where you'll need those
jumper<00:03:46.760> cables<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.359> showed<00:03:47.570> you<00:03:47.720> earlier

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
jumper cables that I showed you earlier

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.080 
jumper cables that I showed you earlier
they<00:03:48.410> are<00:03:48.440> right<00:03:48.769> here<00:03:49.100> so<00:03:49.579> basically<00:03:49.730> you

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
they are right here so basically you

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.270 
they are right here so basically you
take<00:03:50.299> this<00:03:50.480> connector<00:03:51.079> it<00:03:51.650> only<00:03:51.799> goes<00:03:52.040> in<00:03:52.250> one

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
take this connector it only goes in one

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.030 
take this connector it only goes in one
way<00:03:52.549> plug<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.660> into<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.140> port<00:03:54.440> here<00:03:54.709> on<00:03:54.859> the

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
way plug it into the port here on the

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.830 
way plug it into the port here on the
side<00:03:55.280> making<00:03:55.700> sure<00:03:55.910> obviously<00:03:56.420> you've<00:03:56.540> got<00:03:56.569> it

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
side making sure obviously you've got it

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.500 
side making sure obviously you've got it
the<00:03:56.930> right<00:03:57.079> way<00:03:57.319> and<00:03:57.700> then<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.850> connect<00:03:59.239> the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
the right way and then you connect the

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.440 
the right way and then you connect the
cables<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.769> your<00:04:00.920> device<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.090> battery

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
cables to your device to the battery

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.449 
cables to your device to the battery
inside<00:04:02.840> your<00:04:03.049> car<00:04:03.350> going<00:04:03.859> to<00:04:03.950> make<00:04:04.160> sure<00:04:04.340> you

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
this video I have a car jumpstart kit in

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.590 
this video I have a car jumpstart kit in
my<00:04:49.620> wife's<00:04:49.919> car<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:50.910> will<00:04:51.090> say<00:04:51.300> it's<00:04:51.450> about

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
my wife's car and I will say it's about

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.110 
my wife's car and I will say it's about
twenty<00:04:52.020> times<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.470> size<00:04:52.710> of<00:04:52.919> this<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.400> weighs

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
twenty times the size of this and weighs

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.240 
twenty times the size of this and weighs
about<00:04:54.360> twenty<00:04:54.810> times<00:04:55.050> as<00:04:55.260> much<00:04:55.500> so<00:04:56.100> it's

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
about twenty times as much so it's

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.159
