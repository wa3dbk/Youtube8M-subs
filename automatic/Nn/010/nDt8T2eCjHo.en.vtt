ride<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.860> bike<00:04:01.040> really<00:04:01.310> well<00:04:01.580> so<00:04:01.940> I<00:04:02.180> think<00:04:02.570> I

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
ride the bike really well so I think I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.690 
ride the bike really well so I think I
think<00:04:03.410> both<00:04:03.620> classes<00:04:04.130> are<00:04:04.280> going<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.490> make<00:04:04.670> for

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
think both classes are going to make for

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.360 
think both classes are going to make for
some<00:04:05.090> good<00:04:05.240> racing<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.070> hopefully<00:04:07.070> it<00:04:07.190> keeps

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
some good racing and hopefully it keeps

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.550 
some good racing and hopefully it keeps
the<00:04:07.580> fans<00:04:07.850> around<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.270> watch<00:04:08.510> quite<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.930> bit<00:04:09.140> I

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
the fans around the watch quite a bit I

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.680 
the fans around the watch quite a bit I
think<00:04:10.400> it's<00:04:10.580> going<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.910> make<00:04:11.120> things<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.630> little

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
think it's going to make things a little

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.170 
think it's going to make things a little
easier<00:04:12.310> it's<00:04:13.310> going<00:04:13.490> to<00:04:13.580> be<00:04:13.670> fun<00:04:13.880> because<00:04:14.000> I

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
easier it's going to be fun because I

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.910 
easier it's going to be fun because I

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.250 
saying top nine out of the main event
from<00:04:22.730> each<00:04:22.970> coast<00:04:23.270> or<00:04:23.630> going<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.840> go<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.050> the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
from each coast or going to go to the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.050 
from each coast or going to go to the
shootout<00:04:24.710> and<00:04:24.980> then<00:04:25.640> they're<00:04:25.760> going<00:04:25.850> to<00:04:25.940> have

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
shootout and then they're going to have

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.570 
shootout and then they're going to have
a<00:04:26.120> LCQ<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.110> I<00:04:27.320> mean<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:27.800> think<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:28.160> could<00:04:28.340> be<00:04:28.550> a

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
a LCQ so I mean I think it could be a

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.880 
a LCQ so I mean I think it could be a
really<00:04:29.330> good<00:04:29.480> knife<00:04:29.720> for<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.170> or<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.560> could<00:04:30.860> be

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
really good knife for you or it could be

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.730 
really good knife for you or it could be
a<00:04:31.040> really<00:04:31.280> bad<00:04:31.550> night<00:04:31.850> but<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:33.080> go<00:04:33.260> there<00:04:33.500> and

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
a really bad night but to go there and

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.670 
a really bad night but to go there and
try<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.670> win<00:04:34.910> both<00:04:35.150> of<00:04:35.420> them<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:36.560> know

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
try and win both of them and you know

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.920 
try and win both of them and you know
maybe<00:04:37.070> get<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> championship<00:04:37.610> out<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.390> it<00:04:38.510> would

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
maybe get a championship out of it would

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.350 
maybe get a championship out of it would
would<00:04:39.680> be<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:40.100> really<00:04:40.430> good<00:04:40.700> feeling<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.270> I
