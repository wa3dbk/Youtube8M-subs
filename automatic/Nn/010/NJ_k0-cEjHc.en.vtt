00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.100
 sure you are many who do not have 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:08.170
 thought of acquiring this ultimate software 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.450
 edition and finally if you are going to do it 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.400
 and well you know that news 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.530
 We also gave here in the channel that 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.750
 we will be given the opportunity to be able 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.480
 play the whole saga in mode 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.060
 backward compatibility if we acquire 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.980
 this ultimate edition because the truth is 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.539
 that I think is an incentive more than 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.599
 meaningful to get us with the 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.919
 good title well attention because 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.929
 Microsoft seems to be betting a lot 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.690
 for this saga that has a lot of interest in 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.610
 that we play the whole saga before the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.060
 arrival of the fourth delivery and attention 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.030
 because the collection and microsoft us 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.520
 present a new creation video 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.350
 of gears of war ultimate edition this 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.760
 remastering the original game of the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.310
 saga that is also going to launch very 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.100
 soon on xbox one on the 25th of this same 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.410
 month August 25 later by the way 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.170
 this ultimate edition of gears of war 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.150
 it will also appear on pc in the video that 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.150
 we are seeing what they want to show is 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.760
 all the work that has been done to 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.360
 improve the appearance of the different 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.120
 characters from 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.760
 gears of war and the truth is that as 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.500
 You can see in the images, yes 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.660
 yes it shows that they are working on 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.910
 it shows some improvement in the 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.390
 faces in the aspect of the characters 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.340
 and you always look for that if you keep all 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.560
 the essence of the original design of the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.210
 first installment of the saga that by 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.970
 true to this day I'm still playing 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.190
 that first installment on xbox 360 and I 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.460
 it still looks like a game honestly 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.770
 but let's go a game of those of these 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.080
 that you say they age very well that 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.330
 let's say it looks like it came out 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.340
 maybe three years but not all years 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.440
 what he has done since that first 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.210
 good delivery throughout the video 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.100
 several members of the study as you are 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.710
 observing tell what have been the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 objectives and allow you to see lots of 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.180
 sequences of the game the truth is that it is 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.860
 a more than interesting document about 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.350
 everything for lovers of the saga gears of 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.750
 war the improvement I think it's more than 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.940
 palpable we see images on xbox 360 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.759
 then we see them in xbox one we see which one 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.200
 has been that evolution is nothing more than a 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.269
 comparative video so it's true that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.549
 it's a video where you want to show 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.310
 clearly that evolution that purity and 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:21.739
 cleaning that the characters show in 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.390
 the version of xbox one enjoy with 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.100
 them guys and girls and it's already very 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.500
 little bit so that it arrives on August 25 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.920
 and you can enjoy this piece of 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.720
 title of this true remastering 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.720
 of the first gears of wars
