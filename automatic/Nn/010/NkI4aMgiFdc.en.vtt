00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.070
 and 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.440
 hello how are you all good because 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.160
 I'm here another day and today I'm going to 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.940
 bring another tweet this time it's wifi 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.540
 booster this tweet what it does is that the 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.960
 is that when we search for a Wi-Fi network 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.200
 flame increase the power and then 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.510
 because the local says more networks and we are 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.020
 look for 5 well after installing this 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.050
 the power will increase and then in 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.970
 instead of 5, you will find many more 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.550
 I do not know why this limitation has guys 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.620
 but the iphone or the ipad or good is 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.020
 same has the limitation is I do not know by 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.330
 what and good then installing this 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.390
 we can access many more networks of 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.190
 then I see that it is something useful and good 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.740
 I wanted to teach you for 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.730
 install it then let's install it 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.730
 let's go to cydia 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.390
 we wait for it to open 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.460
 and we are going to go to manage 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.150
 we enter sources 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.750
 and we're going to add a repository giving it 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.060
 to edit and add then here 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.000
 we write the address of the repository 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.820
 and we can add source for 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.730
 repository that we are going to be today is and 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.390
 jacques repo and we'll have to put 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.320
 then the address http two points 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.110
 jacks repo dotcom bar 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.729
 so then you put it age is 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.860
 add source and I will install the 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.860
 repository we do this so that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.810
 we can download the free clicks 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.460
 because they are worth money in this way because 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.130
 we download them for free 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.520
 well, once it 's installed, let's go 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.520
 to go find 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.930
 and let's find the tweet wifi booster 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.930
 we wrote it 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.480
 now let's look 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.379
 we wait for it to load 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.540
 and we actually get three 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.600
 repositories is worth in this case we are going to 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.910
 install the hudson repo is worth it 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.040
 I have installed as you see I have 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.970
 the v is green means 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.380
 that a is installed well we give it and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.320
 we go under the whole and we look at it 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.270
 try repository hacks in repo that 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.480
 let's not get confused and go to another 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.450
 because if you do not charge us for the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.550
 tweet nadal and look at that good then 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.710
 then once the center is there 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.020
 dais to install to me I get modified 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.150
 because I already have it installed, it's worth 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.770
 then you give it to install and there's the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.680
 you see 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.439
 then once installed 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.780
 already directly because every time 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:15.609
 look for a good network open the settings 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.609
 to search internet 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.030
 you see 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.690
 and they will look for you more 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.780
 and look for you wings 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.670
 the wi-fi networks in this case to me only 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.070
 the vodafone came out, now I get the 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.680
 another after having installed the tweet 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.020
 It's worth as the lower signals 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.360
 before this the tweet because we do not 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.720
 detects goes this way then we 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.030
 detects signals with more power 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.100
 Well, this has been today's tweet 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.760
 I hope you liked any 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.940
 thing you have the blog to look at everything more 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.970

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.310
