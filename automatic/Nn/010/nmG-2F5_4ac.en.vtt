00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.990 
packaging on both of them is pretty much
the<00:02:33.430> same<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:34.870> far<00:02:35.200> as<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.410> can<00:02:35.470> tell<00:02:35.770> so<00:02:36.610> just<00:02:36.880> as

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
the same as far as I can tell so just as

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.510 
the same as far as I can tell so just as
scandalize<00:02:37.510> except<00:02:37.900> one<00:02:38.230> tip<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.800> just<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
scandalize except one tip is just the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.820 
scandalize except one tip is just the
precision<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.300> one<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.810> slant<00:02:41.260> thick<00:02:41.620> and

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
precision and one is the slant thick and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.260 
precision and one is the slant thick and
thin<00:02:42.010> which<00:02:42.190> i<00:02:42.280> showed<00:02:42.490> you<00:02:42.520> guys<00:02:42.640> last<00:02:43.090> week

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
I'll put that video below I did use this

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.250 
I'll put that video below I did use this
eyeliner<00:02:45.940> again<00:02:46.390> last<00:02:46.570> night<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.110> will

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
eyeliner again last night and I will

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.830 
eyeliner again last night and I will
tell<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.590> guys<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.910> payoff<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.720> it

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
tell you guys that the payoff of it

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.660 
tell you guys that the payoff of it
still<00:02:50.200> isn't<00:02:50.380> really<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.770> great<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:51.640> I

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
still isn't really that great but I

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.670 
still isn't really that great but I
think<00:02:52.030> it's<00:02:52.150> still<00:02:52.510> an<00:02:52.690> OK<00:02:52.989> liner<00:02:53.230> just<00:02:53.590> to

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
think it's still an OK liner just to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.350 
think it's still an OK liner just to
throw<00:02:53.860> on<00:02:54.040> if<00:02:54.190> you're<00:02:54.370> going<00:02:54.790> doing<00:02:55.060> errands

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
throw on if you're going doing errands

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.610 
throw on if you're going doing errands
quick<00:02:55.600> in<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.780> morning<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.290> don't<00:02:56.440> want

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
quick in the morning and you don't want

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.470 
quick in the morning and you don't want

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
creepy van going down my street

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.330 
creepy van going down my street
I<00:03:07.440> mean<00:03:08.440> basically<00:03:08.920> they<00:03:09.100> are<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.250> same

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
I mean basically they are the same

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.800 
I mean basically they are the same
packaging<00:03:09.910> they're<00:03:10.090> just<00:03:10.270> different<00:03:10.390> types

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
packaging they're just different types

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.590 
packaging they're just different types
of<00:03:10.959> eyeliners<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.160> packaging<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
of eyeliners so the packaging is the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.330 
of eyeliners so the packaging is the
same<00:03:13.959> as<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.410> other<00:03:14.590> one<00:03:14.830> I'm<00:03:14.920> just<00:03:14.980> going<00:03:15.310> to

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:01.280 

hmm

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.809 

I<00:04:01.349> have<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.280> say<00:04:02.549> it's<00:04:02.790> pretty<00:04:03.510> much<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.290> same

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
I have to say it's pretty much the same

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.110 
I have to say it's pretty much the same
kind<00:04:05.819> of<00:04:06.030> smoothness<00:04:06.840> as<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.290> other<00:04:07.469> one<00:04:08.120> but

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
kind of smoothness as the other one but

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.179 
kind of smoothness as the other one but
it's<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.450> lot<00:04:09.659> darker<00:04:09.930> as<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.260> guys<00:04:10.500> can<00:04:10.739> see

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
it's a lot darker as you guys can see

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.280 
it's a lot darker as you guys can see
don't<00:04:11.969> judge<00:04:12.209> me<00:04:12.239> I'm<00:04:12.540> not<00:04:12.659> good<00:04:12.930> at<00:04:13.019> putting

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
don't judge me I'm not good at putting

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.229 
don't judge me I'm not good at putting
my<00:04:13.500> eyeliner<00:04:13.859> on<00:04:14.069> this<00:04:14.219> way<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:17.000> think<00:04:18.000> that<00:04:18.150> was

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
my eyeliner on this way I think that was

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.860 
my eyeliner on this way I think that was
kind<00:04:18.419> of<00:04:18.479> obvious<00:04:18.600> my<00:04:19.049> last<00:04:19.289> video<00:04:19.560> as<00:04:19.739> well

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
kind of obvious my last video as well

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.540 
kind of obvious my last video as well
and<00:04:21.870> there's<00:04:22.710> now<00:04:22.979> really<00:04:23.759> like<00:04:24.060> splotchy

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
and there's now really like splotchy

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.480 
and there's now really like splotchy
spots<00:04:26.550> in<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.389> either<00:04:27.979> what<00:04:28.979> I<00:04:29.009> mean<00:04:29.280> by<00:04:29.460> that

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
spots in it either what I mean by that

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.310 
spots in it either what I mean by that
is<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.210> other<00:04:30.389> eyeliner<00:04:30.930> was<00:04:31.199> very<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:33.199> lot<00:04:34.199> of

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
is the other eyeliner was very a lot of

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.620 
is the other eyeliner was very a lot of
splotches<00:04:35.009> in<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.820> it<00:04:39.000> wasn't<00:04:39.360> really<00:04:39.389> a

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
splotches in it so it wasn't really a

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.890 
splotches in it so it wasn't really a
nice<00:04:39.870> crisp<00:04:40.380> line<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:41.160> was<00:04:41.250> kind<00:04:41.520> of<00:04:41.550> like<00:04:41.900> not

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
nice crisp line it was kind of like not

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.749 
nice crisp line it was kind of like not
really<00:04:43.169> that<00:04:43.380> pigmented<00:04:43.949> so<00:04:44.190> that's<00:04:44.430> what

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
really that pigmented so that's what

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.860 
really that pigmented so that's what
that<00:04:44.789> eye<00:04:44.970> looks<00:04:45.479> like<00:04:45.720> it's<00:04:45.960> kind<00:04:46.199> of<00:04:46.289> bad

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
that eye looks like it's kind of bad

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.499

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
pigmented than the other one is so I

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.990 
pigmented than the other one is so I
don't<00:06:02.100> even<00:06:02.190> think<00:06:02.430> I<00:06:02.490> need<00:06:02.640> to<00:06:02.670> do<00:06:02.790> battle

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
don't even think I need to do battle

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.760 
don't even think I need to do battle
video<00:06:03.360> between<00:06:03.540> these<00:06:03.810> because<00:06:04.080> it's<00:06:04.230> so<00:06:04.530> far

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
video between these because it's so far

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.400 
video between these because it's so far
it's<00:06:04.890> pretty<00:06:04.950> obvious<00:06:05.490> that<00:06:05.670> I<00:06:06.260> think<00:06:07.260> the

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
it's pretty obvious that I think the

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.380 
it's pretty obvious that I think the
precision<00:06:07.920> micro<00:06:08.370> eyeliner<00:06:08.760> is<00:06:08.910> a<00:06:08.970> lot<00:06:09.150> better

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
precision micro eyeliner is a lot better

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.150 
precision micro eyeliner is a lot better
than<00:06:09.480> the<00:06:09.720> thick<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.020> thin<00:06:10.110> one<00:06:10.410> I<00:06:10.560> will<00:06:10.920> let
