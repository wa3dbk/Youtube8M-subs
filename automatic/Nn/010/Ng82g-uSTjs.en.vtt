00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.130
 in the family of monoblock frames some frames have been studied with 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.710
 specificities yet different for specific activities 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.960
 this is the case of triathlon track frames and against the clock the point 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.900
 common to these three disciplines are go to dynamism stability and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.380
 extra stiffness 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.279
 the last of its frames and 496 developed in close collaboration 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.810
 with the French Cycling Federation and who won nine 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.660
 medals at the last olympic games of athens in the 196 triathlon case 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.250
 it is a very specific product of course for the very Atlanticist but from 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.250
 of the track technology you have to know that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.640
 on the velodromes we do not need comfort there we are on roads 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.380
 paved so we adapted the track technology with a maximum of 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.860
 comfort 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.270
 there are two types of products in triathlon 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.270
 a rage but very traditional product for 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.989
 to be a dancer uphill seems to touch the room 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.750
 and then downhill to have maximum stability to attack the turns 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.790
 and at the same time we need a very specific product is being 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.640
 much flatter course a little hilly which is long course 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.930
 lower this item from 4 to 96 triathlon 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.870
 when at 196 million a position the son of that advance an angle of 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.190
 type of that of 76 degrees 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 end up at the triathlon be happy to have a maximum 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.109
 by pedaling since 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.109
 it is placed directly above the bottom bracket 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.290
 then the 496 it also has incomparable aerodynamics 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.380
 the know-how of setting for the theater is very important 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.400
 especially on courses 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.240
 small Bayonne hand of 180 km 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.609
 maybe a lot better dynamics on a bike 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.769
 it's also saving a lot for the third discipline, which is the 

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:55.479
 running then the 4 96 triathlon he also has a source at citic 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.640
 since it is integrated of the deportees 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.190
 it brings maximum safety and stability to triathlon 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.960
 you have to know that this force that allows you to stay 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.840
 very long aerodynamic position on the extensions and 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.410
 in courses% and very windy see sinuous this stability makes it the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.060
 difference compared to other types of bikes we triathletes 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.120
 must get up and relayed in their mom is thanks to the forms 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.220
 oversized the 496 offers exceptional rigidity ouattara at a 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.450
 speed of 30 or 40 kilometers hour it will bring 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.329
 maximum efficiency is the maximum here is the 496 it's really the guarantee of 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.829
 thrills 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.419
 rigidity and aerodynamics are the key words of this importance 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.009
 because it visited the 496 must meet the requirements of the trackers 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.889
 the powers must exceed 1500 m that's why we use 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.889
 leguillaume of a carbon fiber available 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:54.409
 we arrive at exceptional values ​​twice as much as 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.009
 the aerodynamic route was studied in a shaped wind tunnel 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.409
 digital at first and then real 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.650
 the study wheel arches have been optimized to reduce the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.169
 laforge turbulence bring them bring them it's a real advantage 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:12.150
 we were able to win in the end 2% of cx is the equivalent of 50 hundredths of 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.269
 second to the kilometer it's capital 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.769
 as many disciplines where the medals refers to the hundredths mylene of 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:18.569
 close second 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.009
 finally we got custody of 400 grams its together which is rare to 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.949
 this national level
