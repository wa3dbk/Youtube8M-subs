00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Good people, I'm with another area and already 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.680
 Another part of the piece is already sanded. 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.740
 sanded 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.650
 I applied the extra strong in 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.049
 set with the soft wool beret on that 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.750
 area that I had commented on 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.029
 previously beauty and now I am 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.640
 making use of the extra strong of the line 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.490
 supreme in conjunction with the other side of the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.789
 wool beret and beauty I stayed in this area 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.579
 why on the bottom vote forcing 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.500
 ninja 3 in 1 of the supreme line also in 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.110
 set with sv of the tongue to see if 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.530
 they are capable together and 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.690
 remove sanding risk p 3 mil 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.989
 alexandre zÃ¡kia beauty are spreading 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.559
 compound it is a little more liquid than 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.390
 that the extra strong compound of the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.190
 Conventional is right, I'm done. 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.280
 passing a little more composed by 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.020
 good morning 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.660
 good staff any difference from this 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.520
 composed of conventional compound is it 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.159
 it's a little easier you apply it 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.159
 leaves the surface -'re blurry 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.780
 it has already opened the brightness and surface already 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.150
 at the moment of application are you 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.430
 It hardly needs cleaning. 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.470
 with microfiber then unlike the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.180
 that leaves some snow on the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.280
 surface you have that is 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.560
 applying degreasing and cleaning with 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.659
 microfiber and beauty the degree of 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.220
 his abrasiveness is very similar to 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.860
 to be the same're 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.780
 however it creates a little less than 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.810
 hologram in conjunction with this good in ii 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.829
 b read so it is a very good compound 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.350
 OK 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.229
 I enjoyed being using him 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.570
 in conjunction with the soft oi ns band 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.460
 She's in the mud. She got a 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.140
 very cool result a very cut 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.149
 fast is a level of finishing 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.740
 very cool hays you need to clean 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.140
 ask me right in the sequence is right 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.969
 operating the machine in a cutting rotation 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.939
 is between 1400 1600 rp beauty and now 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.489
 I'll be leaving there for the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.830
 3-in-1 ninja application that is the 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.770
 ns multiplier in conjunction with 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.990
 the berets 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.270
 phil super see the cast beauty to see 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.160
 If I'm going to be able to refine it 's a 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.470
 sanding together with these 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.870
 I'm composing there and doing a test 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.640
 It's hard to see how far the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.790
 product and the extent to which the beret 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.440
 though well I know that it is very versatile 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.460
 this product shares the same 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.460
 way and beauty 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.220
 Good folks before that you guys are 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.810
 seeing the result there is the cut with 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.550
 this strong is the supreme line versus the 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.600
 cut with this strong line 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.480
 conventional is right 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.560
 now has an overview of the part there 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.980
 Are you seeing the area that I still 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.650
 I'm applying the product to 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.770
 area that has been applied the extra strong 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.210
 supreme line and now the area where I 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.540
 I have this strong conventional line 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:54.500
 note that the surface has light 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.870
 ha ha ha ha It's true, I still do not 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.820
 I wiped the surface there I did not wash 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.500
 I did nothing yet I just applied the 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.110
 product in this area that you are seeing 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.670
 there as a reflector and you can see the 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:11.500
 difference is the post-application of a 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.500
 product of another is right
