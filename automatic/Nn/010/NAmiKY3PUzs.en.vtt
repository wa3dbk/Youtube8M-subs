00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.990
 hello everyone I'm really 195 yo 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.309
 we are in the new tutorial of the rest and 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.990
 good guys in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:10.240
 teach something very useful and that surely 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.820
 you will like many of you and it is 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.310
 how to do this on wifi in minecraft 1.8 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.260
 and good guys before talking more about 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.360
 this I would like to show you how 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.640
 It works, then, as you can see here 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.740
 I have a new switch bat from the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.560
 1.8 used in the blocks of es line 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.630
 ok and here I have placed a tri web to 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.810
 of a block next to bat sign 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.420
 so if I put a three wire here 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.100
 nothing should happen but as you see 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.040
 when I put it on, update the bat 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.290
 switch that the signal to this dispenser that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.960
 he threw a firework worth and this 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.120
 it works being creative 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.120
 being in survival also works 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.310
 and we can say it as many times as 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.150
 we want 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.460
 and well this has has a range of 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.280
 up to 42 what is it worth as you can see 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.110
 here every red marquita means 10 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.830
 blocks so you can tell what's worth 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.840
 which are 42 blocks and if I come here and 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.090
 placed a 3 wire as you see there it goes to 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.370
 update the bat switch and well this 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.560
 It also works through all kinds of 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.800
 blocks worth good almost all now what 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.890
 I will explain why the rest do not spencer with 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.420
 three entities do not dry more means 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.420
 blocks ok let's try it 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.560
 As you can see, it works also well 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.260
 guys how does this work you will be 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.210
 thinking you so good so 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.090
 I can investigate and what I do 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.290
 I think it works is because like those 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:45.670
 you know in 3d we can hook the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.060
 with thread to a maximum of 43 I think 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.730
 41 blocks I do not know about 40 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.560
 blocks are then when we 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.050
 we place a three wire in front of another 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.520
 it detects in that radius that is the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.400
 maximum that can place us the and 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.410
 you need it if there is another one of these hooks 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.600
 placed opposite in the position that 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.290
 it should be valid then when 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.899
 detects that hook is updated vale 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.390
 common trying to check if the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.970
 thread placed and that update is the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.940
 which causes this current block of the bat 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.400
 switch and you can update this dispense 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.840
 ok that's what I got 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.610
 find out so far you can 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.980
 I'm wrong because I can not read 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.650
 the code is worth it but that's what to me 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.250
 I find it works the only problem 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.930
 is 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.180
 It can pierce us through all 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.280
 the blocks less than other trick white 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.600
 what's in the way is worth it if I 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.790
 I set a sad trigger as it is 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.770
 update but if I now placed one 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.030
 here behind, not as you see, it's not going to 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.090
 recognize then if I place here a 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.280
 trip wire is worth the way in which 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.070
 I should put it back here as 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.840
 You see, it does not work either, it 's something that 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.160
 He still could not explain but hey 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.080
 I suppose it will be because from this 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.730
 house and another on the road and you should not 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.319
 check it because it could not be 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.450
 hooked 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.450
 so good guys this works 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.909
 now from the 18th it's because in 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.290
 previous versions from the 15 that 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.200
 I think it was the one that the three 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.599
 wire or the 13 I do not remember vale already existed 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.299
 this bug but previously for example 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:22.060
 the 17th I was testing quite the 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.859
 white trick here next to a bat 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.189
 switch already used updates of 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:31.419
 blocks rando that means that 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:33.489
 just as wheat grows so random 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.980
 this could give updates 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.900
 randomly at any time 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.689
 but that has been corrected now 18 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.669
 therefore this makes it very very 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.879
 useful is worth it because we can use it 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:47.849
 to activate rest when we want and without 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:50.819
 have to be afraid to update 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.219
 randomly it's worth then 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.170
 you could say that this I have 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:58.499
 discovered me but it's really not like that 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.420
 because there are already videos of people doing 

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:03.599
 things with the three wire long before 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.370
 but they're worth 18 for now it seems that 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.439
 nobody has realized that they no longer cause 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.030
 more block updates and it 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:13.069
 you can use for this kind of thing 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.659
 ok then I have here some 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.060
 examples of why it can be used 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.310
 this is how you see here I have a 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.889
 2 x 2 door that I can open 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.939
 and close to my liking here too 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.349
 works with 3 x 3 doors 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:31.090
 they are doors that works a base of 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.950
 levers 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.460
 and this one too 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.170
 it's something more complicated and good here 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.380
 we have a door that works based 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.099
 button with pulses 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.439
 this is a door 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:54.639
 sz speed and vale is a friend of mine who 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:54.639
 He speaks English and also works 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.240
 the bets were testing 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.210
 precisely in this door to take out 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:08.030
 this is why the door is cool 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.819
 and good as this is here as you are 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.190
 seeing voucher here I have placed the tri wire 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.259
 and here right opposite another three wire that 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.940
 update this block that is 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.889
 updating the piston of the bat switch 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.169
 this is a bat suite that acts as a 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.789
 lever is that as you see if you look 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.360
 in this block 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:29.580
 every time I update here it's worth 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.580
 the block retracts 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.740
 that is, going forward or backward 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.900
 we can also use another type of bat 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.090
 suites like this one that is pulsed 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.440
 for this type of doors that you eat 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.220
 every time I activate it in what 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.600
 come up here and come back vale is very 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.040
 easy to make vale 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.980
 you can place with 10 bad suites that 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.410
 you like for example these 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.470
 which are super easy for the 18th 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:59.100
 and with it's line blocks there are many others and 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.430
 Well I hope you have a use 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.410
 to give this what 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.320
 that is not this sure insurance there 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.020
 many uses for this I do not know if 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.030
 I could automate using it 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.860
 that's not because it's the only way that 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.170
 detect is placing it by hand the 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.970
 white trick but good who knows if 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.610
 anyone ever discover how 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.170
 do it so good I hope guys that 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.630
 tell me you tell me in the 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.750
 comments what use do you think you give to 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.850
 this or if you liked it if not and if 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.560
 you have something really cool that you can 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.880
 do with this that you send it to me 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.820
 twitter that I'll leave it here in the 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.140
 description of the video and well then those 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.780
 guys, if you liked the video 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.970
 I would appreciate it if you would like and that 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.390
 comment and josh subscribe if you are not 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.390
