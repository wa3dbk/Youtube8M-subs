00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.250
 like our interface a 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.250
 with communion 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.580
 used for the day sometime 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.210
 used for a month 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.130
 not in it 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.900
 knows 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.320
 for the sake of being built here 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.449
 line where 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.360
 it is visible as when each application 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.670
 starts to use 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.450
 and credits 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.180
 but we show 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.430
 a minute when yes you suck starts and 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.560
 when dots this ends 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.520
 we certainly show how much each 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.580
 application to use and how many dates 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.570
 we made free with our 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.570
 compression on our cloud 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.420
 we have a very good company exactly 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.730
 video 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.710
 unique technology we 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.340
 first who 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.080
 represent offended 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.080
 Russia in the market for users 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.829
 here you can see here I use the application in 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.580
 it is a provision could 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.990
 best to you 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.990
 some music videos 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.710
 this is the video that I would watch 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.430
 or place like 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.000
 35 minutes did not look you do 70 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.000
 megabyte 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.690
 but with the help of our Russia there 665 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.420
 megabytes free 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.659
 and it's just for him 5 megabytes of mine 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.039
 of this plan 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.039
 this time is a very convenient way 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.030
 the camera will help users 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.630
 understand how it is spent on and how 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.630
 smartphones 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.350
 but you can look at 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.940
 look of each application and here 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.070
 it's clear that some applications 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.840
 use the date when the user does not 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.240
 I know 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.520
 a little bit anyway they ask 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.700
 permissions 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.680
 and during that time it accumulates and it 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.220
 may cost 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.610
 some money 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.970
 our add it shows you 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.570
 we give you control of it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.490
 c blocking this application 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.260
 it remained to be allowed only to surrender to 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.180
 wai fay 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.390
 so we teach users what 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.260
 will lose 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.319
 and give control 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.760
 and of course there is another kind which 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.190
 shows 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.710
 what happens 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.730
 with date for month 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.410
 and and she sorts all applications by 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.490
 date used volts 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.500
 or 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.500
 quantity connect our application 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.819
 here you can see that I use different videos 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.440
 you have a very beer type lime app 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.260
 good asked 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.010
 you can still look at it all 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.010
 interesting 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.540
 we measure how much each yes you suck 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.980
 goes on here it all adds up 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.560
 here you can see that all my application 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.680
 together connected to the internet for three 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.680
 o'clock 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.270
 myself akin 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.380
 im average 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.990
 attachment 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.860
 got 80 percent declare using 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.860
 our asked there
