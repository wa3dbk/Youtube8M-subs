00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.500 
raise the bag a little bit here we're
gonna<00:03:53.480> show<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:54.670> how<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.879> flow<00:03:56.090> control

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
gonna show you how that flow control

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.780 
gonna show you how that flow control
works<00:03:57.220> as<00:03:58.220> soon<00:03:58.370> as<00:03:58.489> I<00:03:58.610> turn<00:03:58.819> it<00:03:58.849> on<00:04:00.610> field<00:04:01.610> will

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
works as soon as I turn it on field will

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.559 
works as soon as I turn it on field will
start<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.090> come<00:04:02.239> down<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.629> tube<00:04:03.110> and<00:04:04.450> start<00:04:05.450> to

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
start to come down the tube and start to

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.369 
start to come down the tube and start to
drip<00:04:07.269> drip<00:04:08.269> out<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:10.180> through<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.390> end<00:04:12.049> of<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
drip drip out the through the end of the

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:21.969 
drip drip out the through the end of the
tube<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:13.060> hope<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.239> can<00:04:14.420> see<00:04:14.599> it<00:04:14.690> dripping<00:04:20.979> yeah

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
tube I hope you can see it dripping yeah

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.909 
tube I hope you can see it dripping yeah
we<00:04:22.400> got<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.700> flow<00:04:22.970> here<00:04:23.440> we'll<00:04:24.440> fill<00:04:24.680> that<00:04:24.860> up

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
we got the flow here we'll fill that up

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.710 
we got the flow here we'll fill that up
a<00:04:26.139> little<00:04:27.139> bit<00:04:27.410> as<00:04:27.950> you<00:04:28.910> know<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.240> star<00:04:29.510> like

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
a little bit as you know the star like

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.500 
a little bit as you know the star like
to<00:04:29.900> take<00:04:30.110> one<00:04:30.290> ounce<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.710> fuel<00:04:34.240> let<00:04:35.240> me<00:04:35.330> see

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
to take one ounce of fuel let me see

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.659 
to take one ounce of fuel let me see
that<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:37.460> I'll<00:04:37.820> start<00:04:38.120> to<00:04:38.270> control<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:39.669> fuel

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
that and I'll start to control that fuel

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:48.869 
that and I'll start to control that fuel
right<00:04:43.539> you<00:04:44.539> could<00:04:44.720> see<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.050> right

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:56.189 

now<00:04:49.389> this<00:04:49.569> IV<00:04:50.319> bag<00:04:50.559> is<00:04:50.770> made<00:04:50.979> so<00:04:51.369> that<00:04:54.990> easy<00:04:55.990> to

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
now this IV bag is made so that easy to

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:01.829 
now this IV bag is made so that easy to
control<00:04:56.439> the<00:04:56.679> rate<00:04:58.770> okay<00:04:59.770> once<00:04:59.979> the<00:05:00.689> once<00:05:01.689> it

00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:01.839 
control the rate okay once the once it

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:06.239 
control the rate okay once the once it
still<00:05:02.050> has<00:05:03.899> fuel<00:05:04.899> in<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.229> you<00:05:05.349> can<00:05:05.529> place<00:05:06.039> it

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:06.249 
still has fuel in it you can place it

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:13.139 
still has fuel in it you can place it
down<00:05:06.429> in<00:05:06.699> there<00:05:06.849> like<00:05:07.029> so<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:11.729> we<00:05:12.729> make<00:05:12.969> that

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:13.149 
down in there like so and we make that

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:17.010 
down in there like so and we make that
little<00:05:13.300> baby<00:05:13.599> up<00:05:15.509> let<00:05:16.509> me<00:05:16.599> get<00:05:16.719> a<00:05:16.749> black

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
little baby up let me get a black

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:28.370 
little baby up let me get a black
background<00:05:17.709> and<00:05:18.479> in<00:05:19.479> there<00:05:19.689> for<00:05:19.959> you

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.090 

now<00:05:29.010> with<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.310> stove<00:05:30.470> the<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:34.530> tube<00:05:34.770> is<00:05:34.980> out

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
now with the stove the the tube is out

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.120 
now with the stove the the tube is out
of<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.340> flame<00:05:36.530> so<00:05:37.530> it's<00:05:37.650> not<00:05:37.770> going<00:05:37.890> to<00:05:38.010> get

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
of the flame so it's not going to get

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:46.580 
of the flame so it's not going to get
hot<00:05:41.720> down<00:05:42.720> below<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.170> flame<00:05:43.440> level<00:05:45.590> it's

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
hot down below the flame level it's

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.370 
hot down below the flame level it's
gonna<00:05:46.740> remain<00:05:47.040> cool<00:05:50.930> increase<00:05:51.930> that<00:05:52.140> flow

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
gonna remain cool increase that flow

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:01.520 
gonna remain cool increase that flow
rate

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.070 

still<00:06:02.250> was<00:06:02.370> not<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.580> saturation<00:06:03.270> point<00:06:03.450> yet<00:06:06.080> it

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
still was not a saturation point yet it

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.750 
still was not a saturation point yet it
will<00:06:07.290> get<00:06:07.650> up<00:06:07.770> high<00:06:07.980> as<00:06:08.400> its<00:06:08.820> regulated<00:06:09.540> so

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
will get up high as its regulated so

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.630 
will get up high as its regulated so
easy<00:06:11.760> flow<00:06:12.090> control<00:06:15.620> as<00:06:16.620> I<00:06:16.860> said<00:06:17.100> before<00:06:17.430> these

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
easy flow control as I said before these

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.090 
easy flow control as I said before these
