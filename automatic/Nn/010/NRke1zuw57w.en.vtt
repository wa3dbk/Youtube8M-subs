00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.770

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.350
 how did you feel and what is 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.000
 you think of the jump is not great 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.550
 atmosphere already pleasantly surprised 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.210
 it was full it wanted the customers 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.980
 super receptive really open to all 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.220
 the musical styles that we played more this 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.240
 evening is really really 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.240
 super first rise 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.970
 no 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:31.270
 in addition the gauchos 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.720
 wayne state lately that came out 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.909
 there have been quite a few, too, you have 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.040
 everywhere in Morocco especially marrakech etc 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.410
 with a lot of diversity here there was the 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.850
 series of sexy vibe and hubert sus 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.980
 clubbing there we just out versus 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.709
 clubbing with taylor and didier iams 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.770
 also one of our colleagues the dj bac on 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.880
 Paris and this is the last joint project 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.880
 to release these versus clubbing 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.310
 that's what happened tonight 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.299
 people were super receptive 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.040
 here we really felt that they were 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.180
 there to party and they did it 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.400
 what simply 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.799
 without them I would not do what we 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.540
 does every weekend in the clubs if he 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.450
 there is no real atmosphere and if people 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.760
 are not already ambiance is coming to do 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.629
 the party it would be super complicated but 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.159
 when the two get married 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.489
 we manage to make evenings like we have 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.489
 done tonight 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.819
 never
