00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
as you get better he can go to aluminum

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
as you get better he can go to aluminum
brass<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.789> steel<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.810> what<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.240> let's

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
brass and steel and what not but let's

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.169 
brass and steel and what not but let's
do<00:00:27.420> some<00:00:27.660> some<00:00:28.310> turning<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.609> lathe<00:00:29.789> today

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
do some some turning on the lathe today

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.429 
do some some turning on the lathe today
so<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.510> first<00:00:30.539> thing<00:00:30.840> we're<00:00:30.929> going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.109> do<00:00:31.260> is

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
uh mount up this piece of stock here

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.450 
uh mount up this piece of stock here
okay<00:00:36.410> then<00:00:37.410> we're<00:00:37.530> gonna<00:00:39.950> we're<00:00:40.950> gonna<00:00:41.040> face

okay then we're gonna we're gonna face

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.450 
okay then we're gonna we're gonna face
it<00:00:41.670> off<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:43.680> first<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:43.950> we're<00:00:44.129> going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.280> do

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
it off the first thing we're going to do

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.619 
it off the first thing we're going to do
is<00:00:44.610> put<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.140> just<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.320> regular<00:00:46.739> carbide

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
is put in a just a regular carbide

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.840 
is put in a just a regular carbide
over-the-counter<00:00:48.629> bit<00:00:49.399> zoom<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> little

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
over-the-counter bit zoom in a little

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.340 
over-the-counter bit zoom in a little
bit<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.300> maybe<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.079> better

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
bit so maybe you can see a little better

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.750 
bit so maybe you can see a little better
and<00:00:53.960> we'll<00:00:54.960> turn<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.440> speed<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> little<00:00:55.800> bit

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
and we'll turn up the speed a little bit

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:09.370 
and we'll turn up the speed a little bit
come<00:00:58.239> in<00:00:58.359> here<00:00:58.980> sure<00:00:59.980> everything's<00:01:00.339> tight

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.310

okay

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.050 
okay
we'll<00:01:11.530> do<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.710> again

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
we'll do it again

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.030 
we'll do it again
it's<00:01:13.570> time<00:01:13.780> to<00:01:13.930> lock<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.290> carriage<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:14.860> we'll

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
it's time to lock the carriage so we'll

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.910 
it's time to lock the carriage so we'll
come<00:01:15.280> back<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:16.060> was<00:01:16.150> just<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.450> rough<00:01:16.690> it<00:01:16.840> up

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920

let's<00:02:15.820> do<00:02:16.000> some<00:02:16.210> Sena<00:02:16.480> drilling

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
let's do some Sena drilling

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.670 
let's do some Sena drilling
okay<00:02:18.859> this<00:02:19.040> is<00:02:19.189> a<00:02:19.219> spa<00:02:20.150> trail<00:02:20.650> unlike<00:02:21.650> a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
okay this is a spa trail unlike a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.770 
okay this is a spa trail unlike a
regular<00:02:22.069> center<00:02:22.639> drill<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:23.060> can<00:02:23.120> see<00:02:23.389> this<00:02:23.569> is

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
regular center drill you can see this is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.280 
regular center drill you can see this is
a<00:02:23.810> ninety<00:02:24.590> degree<00:02:24.680> spot<00:02:25.189> drill<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.989> like

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
a ninety degree spot drill and I like

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.809 
a ninety degree spot drill and I like
these<00:02:27.499> these<00:02:27.709> work<00:02:27.950> really<00:02:27.980> good<00:02:28.400> it's<00:02:28.579> in<00:02:28.700> an

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
these these work really good it's in an

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.110 
these these work really good it's in an
end<00:02:29.209> mill<00:02:29.569> attachment<00:02:30.639> this<00:02:31.639> way<00:02:31.819> I<00:02:31.879> could

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
end mill attachment this way I could

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.360 
end mill attachment this way I could
just<00:02:32.299> feed<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.659> right<00:02:32.870> in

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
just feed it right in
