00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
little flowers and I absolutely love it

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.330

and<00:04:09.600> it's<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.170> halter<00:04:10.410> so<00:04:10.740> that<00:04:10.860> covers<00:04:11.160> like

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
and it's a halter so that covers like

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.880 
and it's a halter so that covers like
most<00:04:11.670> your<00:04:11.910> body<00:04:12.150> which<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.020> really<00:04:13.350> like<00:04:13.590> and

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
most your body which I really like and

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.099 
most your body which I really like and

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
so I got this and I think it was like

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.740 
so I got this and I think it was like
$28<00:04:17.070> but<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.579> was<00:04:17.790> completely<00:04:18.299> worth<00:04:18.419> it

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
$28 but it was completely worth it

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.599 
$28 but it was completely worth it
because<00:04:18.959> it's<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.470> music<00:04:19.769> festival<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:20.370> I
