hi<00:00:04.680> so<00:00:05.250> we're<00:00:05.580> working<00:00:05.700> with<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.180> LMU<00:00:06.390> man

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:06.689 
hi so we're working with the LMU man

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:08.570 
hi so we're working with the LMU man
battery<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.200> previous<00:00:07.589> video<00:00:07.770> now<00:00:08.160> I'm<00:00:08.309> told

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
battery of a previous video now I'm told

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.610 
battery of a previous video now I'm told
people<00:00:09.480> watch<00:00:09.629> this<00:00:09.840> channel<00:00:10.110> because<00:00:10.500> they

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
people watch this channel because they

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.080 
people watch this channel because they
want<00:00:10.770> to<00:00:10.799> see<00:00:11.010> breakthroughs<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.880> think

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
want to see breakthroughs and I think

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.669 
want to see breakthroughs and I think
that's<00:00:12.240> really<00:00:12.389> candid<00:00:12.719> essentially<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.500> sort

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
that's really candid essentially it sort

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.919 
that's really candid essentially it sort
of<00:00:13.740> flattering<00:00:14.120> but<00:00:15.120> here<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.450> something<00:00:15.690> I

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
of flattering but here is something I

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.420 
of flattering but here is something I
actually<00:00:16.020> think<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.619> real<00:00:16.860> breakthrough

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
actually think is a real breakthrough

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.849 
actually think is a real breakthrough
now<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.330> aluminium<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:18.960> our<00:00:19.080> battery<00:00:19.529> is

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
now this aluminium in our battery is

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.679 
now this aluminium in our battery is
usually<00:00:20.310> seen<00:00:20.460> as<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.640> primary<00:00:21.119> battery<00:00:21.510> that

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
usually seen as a primary battery that

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.120 
usually seen as a primary battery that
is<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.900> use<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.260> throw<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.529> away<00:00:22.619> because<00:00:22.949> it

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
is you use it throw it away because it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.529 
is you use it throw it away because it
can't<00:00:23.430> be<00:00:23.550> recharged

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
can't be recharged

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.420 
can't be recharged
now<00:00:24.900> I've<00:00:25.050> discharge<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.740> battery<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:26.189> point

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
now I've discharge the battery to point

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.220 
now I've discharge the battery to point
for<00:00:26.730> faults<00:00:27.240> as<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.080> meter

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
for faults as you can see on the meter

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.169 
for faults as you can see on the meter
there<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.890> I've<00:00:29.039> got<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.699> bench<00:00:29.939> top

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
there what I've got here is a bench top

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.600 
there what I've got here is a bench top
supply<00:00:30.720> we're<00:00:31.439> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.710> do<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.129> connect<00:00:32.460> up

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
supply we're going to do is connect up

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.180 
supply we're going to do is connect up
the<00:00:32.730> electric<00:00:33.120> tooth<00:00:33.239> desktop<00:00:33.780> supplied<00:00:34.230> it's

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the electric tooth desktop supplied it's

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.160 
the electric tooth desktop supplied it's
the<00:00:35.339> DC<00:00:35.699> supply<00:00:36.030> incidentally<00:00:38.780> it's<00:00:39.780> turning

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the DC supply incidentally it's turning

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.210 
the DC supply incidentally it's turning
on<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.670> back<00:00:41.670> 12<00:00:42.120> volts<00:00:42.510> through<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:43.220> I've

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
on and back 12 volts through there I've

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.979 
on and back 12 volts through there I've
got<00:00:44.400> it<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.580> at<00:00:44.790> 12<00:00:45.059> volts<00:00:45.420> I'm<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> leave

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
got it on at 12 volts I'm going to leave

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.439 
got it on at 12 volts I'm going to leave
it<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.350> bit<00:00:46.729> so<00:00:47.729> I<00:00:47.790> gave<00:00:47.970> it<00:00:48.089> five<00:00:48.269> minutes

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
it for a bit so I gave it five minutes

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.390 
it for a bit so I gave it five minutes
on<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.869> charger<00:00:49.350> I've<00:00:49.530> connected<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.100> back<00:00:50.250> up

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
on the charger I've connected it back up

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.539 
on the charger I've connected it back up
to<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.519> meters<00:00:50.970> now<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.299> can<00:00:51.659> see<00:00:51.869> it<00:00:52.019> reading

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
to the meters now you can see it reading

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.299 
to the meters now you can see it reading
1.2<00:00:53.549> volts<00:00:53.960> 1.2<00:00:54.960> volts<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.440> actually<00:00:55.769> at<00:00:56.010> where

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
1.2 volts 1.2 volts is actually at where

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
1.2 volts 1.2 volts is actually at where
around<00:00:56.549> the<00:00:56.729> new<00:00:56.879> cell<00:00:57.150> should<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.750> it'll

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
around the new cell should be it'll

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.770 
around the new cell should be it'll
probably<00:00:58.500> go<00:00:58.739> huh<00:00:58.979> I've<00:00:59.640> cycled<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.449> through

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
probably go huh I've cycled this through

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740 
probably go huh I've cycled this through
between<00:01:01.019> 1.2<00:01:01.680> 0.4<00:01:02.369> volts<00:01:02.430> 10<00:01:02.939> times<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
between 1.2 0.4 volts 10 times now and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.719 
between 1.2 0.4 volts 10 times now and
it's<00:01:03.869> still<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.320> strong<00:01:04.519> obviously<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.640> be

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it's still going strong obviously to be

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
it's still going strong obviously to be
a<00:01:05.760> real<00:01:06.000> rechargeable<00:01:06.750> battery<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.320> need<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
a real rechargeable battery I need to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.770 
a real rechargeable battery I need to
cycle<00:01:08.160> it<00:01:08.400> through<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.910> thousand<00:01:09.510> times

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
cycle it through like a thousand times

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.290 
cycle it through like a thousand times
or<00:01:10.320> sometimes<00:01:10.800> just<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.120> is

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
or sometimes just you know there it is

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.330 
or sometimes just you know there it is
only<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.960> milliamp<00:01:13.470> readings<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.010> still

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
only at milliamp readings that still

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.080 
only at milliamp readings that still
reading<00:01:14.700> point<00:01:15.030> two<00:01:15.920> amps<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.790> been<00:01:17.940> rich

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
reading point two amps so it's been rich

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.970 
reading point two amps so it's been rich
as<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.450> said<00:01:18.690> ten<00:01:18.870> times<00:01:19.110> still<00:01:19.410> really<00:01:19.710> point

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
as I said ten times still really point

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.860 
as I said ten times still really point
to<00:01:20.160> apps<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.390> point<00:01:21.630> to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
electrolyte we need to cycle test

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.960 
electrolyte we need to cycle test
that<00:01:50.620> I<00:01:50.650> said<00:01:50.920> pretty<00:01:51.070> through<00:01:51.370> its<00:01:51.520> thousand

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
that I said pretty through its thousand

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.790 
that I said pretty through its thousand
cycles<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.690> make<00:01:52.810> sure<00:01:53.020> that<00:01:53.170> will<00:01:53.320> charge<00:01:53.590> and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
cycles to make sure that will charge and

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.220 
cycles to make sure that will charge and
recharge<00:01:54.280> put<00:01:54.970> under<00:01:55.210> some<00:01:55.360> load<00:01:55.570> conditions

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
recharge put under some load conditions

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.770 
recharge put under some load conditions
and<00:01:56.440> so<00:01:56.620> on<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.460> fair<00:01:57.670> bit<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.880> actual<00:01:58.480> real

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
and so on so the fair bit of actual real

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.540 
and so on so the fair bit of actual real
testing<00:01:59.350> doing<00:01:59.830> that<00:02:00.040> before<00:02:00.400> it<00:02:00.460> would

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
testing doing that before it would

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.510 
testing doing that before it would
become<00:02:00.910> a<00:02:00.940> product<00:02:01.360> but<00:02:02.200> it's<00:02:02.770> very<00:02:03.160> very

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
become a product but it's very very

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.330 
become a product but it's very very
promising<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.390> stage<00:02:04.690> it's<00:02:04.990> at<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:05.710> this

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
promising of the stage it's at and this

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.950 
promising of the stage it's at and this
is<00:02:06.490> something<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:06.850> might<00:02:07.180> actually<00:02:07.390> do

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
is something that might actually do

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.850 
is something that might actually do
something<00:02:08.229> within<00:02:08.649> those<00:02:08.979> terms<00:02:09.490> so<00:02:10.860> if

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
something within those terms so if

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.620 
something within those terms so if
you're<00:02:12.310> innocently<00:02:12.760> we're<00:02:12.940> right<00:02:13.090> over<00:02:13.300> there

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
you're innocently we're right over there

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.250 
you're innocently we're right over there
is<00:02:13.750> cool

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
is cool

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.990 
is cool
so<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.530> hope<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.860> enjoyed<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.610> thank<00:02:15.850> you

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
so I hope you enjoyed it and thank you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.540 
so I hope you enjoyed it and thank you
for<00:02:16.180> watching
