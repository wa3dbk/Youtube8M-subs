00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.170
 good evening girls so sorry for the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.009
 light because it's evening and I 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.599
 really wanted to make this video because 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.310
 I was preparing dinner 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.470
 I thought it was a good idea 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.330
 to show you something good it's 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.670
 vegetarian but it does not matter because 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.439
 sometimes it feels good not to eat 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.150
 that meat is to accompany our 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.170
 dishes with a vegetarian stuff so I 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.420
 shows you what am I preparing 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.679
 for tonight here it is peas 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.540
 most of us do not like small 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.670
 peas and I personally like it 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.710
 this recipe I prefer the type has like 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.219
 that instead of eating them in bad gaal 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.250
 Algerian so that's it here and I 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.440
 cut an onion into small squares not 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.920
 very small not very big here and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.860
 here I cut two small carrots not 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.649
 very small as normal as elsewhere two 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.489
 carrots and onions and there I have a small 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.890
 bowl of peas needs it too 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.899
 some olive oil and for 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.210
 spices then salt pepper 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.950
 here is cumin and there a little bit of 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.600
 cinnamon some people who like 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.540
 add a little sugar but for 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.880
 me it will go without sugar so in a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.610
 stove I'm going to heat a whole 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.830
 little bit of olive oil that's not it 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:28.400
 a little bit here on soft fire and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.400
 m g I will put everything what 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.939
 I will put my onions and my 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.939
 carrots 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:53.960
 I use the coach and it's not easy 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.140
 so here I am going to leave a tiny 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.450
 simmer before adding spices 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.860
 and the peas and after of course there 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.360
 need water in this recipe I 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.340
 forgot to read but hey I think 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.799
 everyone on the back 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.950
 I need so here it is also necessary 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:14.209
 very important thing you have to put in 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.590
 cover your stove because I have 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.000
 the impression that this recipe there I 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.110
 the kitchen can with a little bit of 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.360
 pressure 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.700
 so we'll put that aside and we 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.530
 will leave that to me t1 very little I 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.620
 will just put the salt because the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.110
 salt it's healthy foods become 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.799
 more softer here I'll add a 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.799
 little bit of 7 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.070
 and I'm going to simmer a little good I 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.160
 come from there him but that's fine 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.160
 normal 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.810
 here are the little ones as soon as the wood that it 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.290
 a little bit but I hope you have 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.180
 completely especially onions 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.390
 have it endorsed or two golden months because 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:20.390
 that the purpose of the roof classes then to the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:26.230
 pressure but not with 2003 then there I 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.230
 I'm going to put my peas 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.510
 not easy 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.680
 here I put my peas 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.030
 and here I add but spiced a little water 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.480
 so I'm going to add a little bit 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.910
 more salt I like well preserved and 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.500
 not sweet I know that every 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.500
 ingredients that I put there are a little 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:15.270
 saying sweet go go if the pepper 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.270
 black a little cinnamon 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.110
 and 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.680
 dumas it does not hurt to add 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.470
 climate so here I put pretty much a 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.750
 whole sector 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.750
 and here I am, I mix everything 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.770
 and I add a little water not 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.120
 too much but a little bit after I 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.110
 add as you go 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.620
 if I drink 2 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.620
 it's done 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:18.870
 practice about a glass of water I 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:23.069
 mix and there i'll cover everything and 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:27.150
 simmer on fire saying means 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:29.280
 it depends on your of your 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.889
 pan or the utensil you 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.900
 use if you see that it dries too much 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:38.490
 quickly diminished and a little bit fire 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:41.490
 like that it will take time to be 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.520
 cooked and after you can remove the 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.430
 covered and after let the water dry 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.740
 who glued daughter back then 10 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.270
 minutes about ten minutes yes a 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.719
 little more 7 12 minutes 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.960
 I noticed that my vegetables do not have 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:06:01.560
 still does not smell cooked yet 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.650
 but I miss it a little bit more 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.900
 of water I will add about a half 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.930
 glass of water and after I flew a 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:16.970
 little more than ten minutes again and I 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:20.819
 reverify so here it is there I cover 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:24.419
 after I recheck like that I'm sure 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:27.180
 that it does not matter that these are the 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:29.610
 girls so here I checked the vegetables 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.940
 they are well taken to know it 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.940
 just try to crush that be 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.979
 the tiles all well the little ones 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.800
 peas he easily crashes and as he 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:42.000
 stay a little bit more water 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.180
 when I'm going to do that is I'm going 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.330
 raise the temperature a bit but I 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.370
 I'm not going to put the cover back 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:56.280
 just leave that way the time that 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:58.830
 the water evaporates but everything will be ready in 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.180
 not even 5 minutes so that's good 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.180
 appetite girls because jo
