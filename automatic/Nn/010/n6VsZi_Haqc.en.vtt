hi<00:00:08.160> today<00:00:08.730> alpha<00:00:09.179> we're<00:00:09.389> gonna<00:00:09.539> have<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.719> look

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
hi today alpha we're gonna have a look

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.779 
hi today alpha we're gonna have a look
at<00:00:12.289> of<00:00:13.289> doing<00:00:13.589> something<00:00:13.829> with<00:00:14.039> this<00:00:14.459> cutting

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:14.789 
at of doing something with this cutting

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.350 
at of doing something with this cutting
of<00:00:15.350> a<00:00:16.350> one<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.740> my<00:00:16.860> big<00:00:17.100> Chinese<00:00:17.310> Elms<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
of a one of my big Chinese Elms that of

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.870 
of a one of my big Chinese Elms that of
last<00:00:18.630> year<00:00:18.950> as<00:00:19.950> you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.190> see<00:00:20.400> it's<00:00:20.670> growing

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
last year as you can see it's growing

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.630 
last year as you can see it's growing
pretty<00:00:21.120> strongly<00:00:22.100> but<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.340> bit<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.550> an

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
pretty strongly but it's a bit of an

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.700 
pretty strongly but it's a bit of an
awkward<00:00:24.000> shape<00:00:24.030> there's<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.020> there's<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.680> big

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
awkward shape there's a there's a big

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.830 
awkward shape there's a there's a big
thick<00:00:26.220> branch<00:00:26.580> coming<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.450> of<00:00:27.600> the<00:00:27.690> bottom

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
thick branch coming out of the bottom

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.860 
thick branch coming out of the bottom
here<00:00:28.140> as<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.530> see<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:30.360> the<00:00:30.630> roots

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:30.870 
here as you can see that and the roots

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.580 
here as you can see that and the roots
are<00:00:31.650> actually<00:00:32.180> underneath<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.570> main<00:00:33.900> this

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
are actually underneath this main this

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.410 
are actually underneath this main this
main<00:00:34.920> piece<00:00:35.220> here<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.230> could<00:00:38.150> possibly<00:00:39.150> just

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
main piece here so I could possibly just

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.319 
main piece here so I could possibly just
take<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.840> off<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.790> concentrate<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:41.820> grow<00:00:42.150> in

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
take that off and concentrate on grow in

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.190 
take that off and concentrate on grow in
this<00:00:43.070> but<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.160> found<00:00:44.400> a<00:00:44.520> piece<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.270> dead<00:00:46.020> wood

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
this but I found a piece of of dead wood

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.000 
this but I found a piece of of dead wood
without<00:00:46.829> lying<00:00:47.280> around<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.560> thought<00:00:49.739> I'll

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
without lying around so I thought I'll

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.090 
without lying around so I thought I'll
see<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.930> create<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.020> bit<00:00:52.290> of<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.530> wrap

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
see if I can create a bit of a wrap

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.790 
see if I can create a bit of a wrap
around<00:00:53.390> or<00:00:54.390> tanuki<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.590> with<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.670> piece

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
around or tanuki and with that piece

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.440 
around or tanuki and with that piece
I've<00:00:58.800> polished<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.370> adjusted<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.940> piece<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
I've polished and adjusted this piece of

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.830 
I've polished and adjusted this piece of
of<00:01:01.410> dead<00:01:01.680> wood<00:01:01.829> slightly<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.880> accommodate<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
of dead wood slightly to accommodate the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.640 
of dead wood slightly to accommodate the
plant<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.610> are<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:06.229> allowed<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.260> cut<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
plant and are now allowed to cut the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
plant and are now allowed to cut the
channels<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:09.180> receive<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.690> various

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
channels and to receive the various

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
channels and to receive the various
branches<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:11.400> make<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.850> bulk<00:01:12.450> of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
branches that will make up the bulk of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.219 
branches that will make up the bulk of
the<00:01:12.810> trunk<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:14.390> started<00:01:15.390> cutting<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the trunk I started cutting the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.950 
the trunk I started cutting the
preliminary<00:01:17.070> channels<00:01:17.460> now<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.750> are

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
preliminary channels now this these are

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.820 
preliminary channels now this these are
the<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.640> way<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.150> these<00:01:21.470> branches<00:01:22.470> will<00:01:22.799> be

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the the way that these branches will be

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.550 
the the way that these branches will be
running<00:01:23.280> along<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.840> at<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.049> piece<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.409> dead

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
running along this at this piece of dead

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
running along this at this piece of dead
wood<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> main<00:01:26.909> branch<00:01:27.270> coming<00:01:27.720> up

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
wood with the main branch coming up

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.760 
wood with the main branch coming up
along<00:01:28.290> here

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
along here

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.480 
along here
and<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> top<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.780> I've<00:01:31.159> made<00:01:32.159> sure<00:01:32.220> to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
and up to the top now I've made sure to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.910 
and up to the top now I've made sure to
follow<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.210> natural<00:01:33.420> growth<00:01:33.990> pattern<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
follow the natural growth pattern that

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.240 
follow the natural growth pattern that
this<00:01:35.100> wood<00:01:35.369> shows<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.530> final<00:01:37.950> tree

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
this wood shows so that the final tree

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.550 
this wood shows so that the final tree
looks<00:01:38.790> realistic<00:01:39.210> against<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.380> dead

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
looks realistic against the the dead

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.999 
looks realistic against the the dead
wood<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.630> channels<00:01:43.439> were<00:01:43.590> cut<00:01:43.830> with

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
wood now the the channels were cut with

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.649 
wood now the the channels were cut with
this<00:01:44.189> small<00:01:44.659> rotary<00:01:45.659> cutting<00:01:45.869> tool<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:47.659> what

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
this small rotary cutting tool here what

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.920 
this small rotary cutting tool here what
I'm<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.259> next<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.830> use<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> small

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
I'm going to do next is use a small

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.740 
I'm going to do next is use a small
round<00:01:51.930> head<00:01:52.229> cutter<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.640> smooth<00:01:54.000> out<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
round head cutter to just smooth out the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.819 
round head cutter to just smooth out the
edges<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:56.090> slightly<00:01:57.090> undercut<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.810> edges<00:01:58.170> so

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
edges and slightly undercut the edges so

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.550 
edges and slightly undercut the edges so
whereas<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.369> tree<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> branches<00:02:00.840> expand

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
whereas the tree and the branches expand

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.679 
whereas the tree and the branches expand
within<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.070> channels<00:02:02.490> they're<00:02:03.240> forced<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
within the channels they're forced to

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.990 
within the channels they're forced to
they're<00:02:04.110> wedged<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.950> then<00:02:05.430> forced<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
they're wedged in and then forced to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.020 
they're wedged in and then forced to
grow<00:02:06.210> over<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.659> sides<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.860> channel<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
grow over the sides of the channel and

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.820 
grow over the sides of the channel and
tie<00:02:09.390> tightly<00:02:10.229> into<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
tie tightly into the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:19.759 
tie tightly into the
good<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.780> excuse<00:02:13.290> for<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.530> noise

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.039 

those<00:02:20.280> tunnels<00:02:20.609> have<00:02:20.879> been<00:02:21.060> smoothed<00:02:21.420> out<00:02:21.659> the

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
those tunnels have been smoothed out the

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.160 
those tunnels have been smoothed out the
slightly<00:02:22.349> deeper<00:02:22.620> now<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:24.090> might<00:02:24.599> still<00:02:24.930> need

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
slightly deeper now I might still need

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.559 
slightly deeper now I might still need
to<00:02:25.379> adjust<00:02:25.469> these<00:02:25.890> slightly<00:02:26.489> depending<00:02:27.299> on

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
to adjust these slightly depending on

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.059 
to adjust these slightly depending on
the<00:02:27.689> thickness<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:28.109> the<00:02:28.170> branches<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.920> we're

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
the thickness of the branches that we're

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.910 
the thickness of the branches that we're
running<00:02:29.189> in<00:02:29.459> them<00:02:30.230> but<00:02:31.230> they're<00:02:31.379> in<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.709> in

the<00:02:32.069> correct<00:02:32.310> positions<00:02:32.760> now<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.689> the<00:02:33.930> way

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
the correct positions now is the way

the correct positions now is the way
these<00:02:34.319> these<00:02:34.709> branches<00:02:35.189> will<00:02:35.340> follow<00:02:35.609> and

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
these these branches will follow and

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.459 
these these branches will follow and
then<00:02:36.030> naturally<00:02:36.389> grow<00:02:36.569> out<00:02:36.780> from<00:02:37.079> there

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
then naturally grow out from there

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.309 
then naturally grow out from there
I'm<00:02:38.129> now<00:02:38.370> going<00:02:38.579> to<00:02:38.700> go<00:02:38.879> and<00:02:39.060> see<00:02:39.810> if<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.049> can<00:02:40.200> so

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
I'm now going to go and see if I can so

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.860 
I'm now going to go and see if I can so
as<00:02:40.409> you<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.620> see<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.099> have<00:02:41.819> now<00:02:42.060> approximated

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
as you can see I have now approximated

little bit of carving on the Deadwood to
just<00:04:44.730> give<00:04:45.060> a<00:04:45.090> little<00:04:45.270> bit<00:04:45.480> more<00:04:45.690> character<00:04:46.640> so

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
just give a little bit more character so

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.160 
just give a little bit more character so
I<00:04:47.670> hope<00:04:47.790> you've<00:04:48.000> enjoyed<00:04:48.300> that
