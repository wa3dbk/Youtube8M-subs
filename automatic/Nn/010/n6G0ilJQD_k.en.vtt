00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.450
 hello everyone so the teammate of the team enters the fire 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.019
 cameron 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:09.139
 to build 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:10.539
 so 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.129
 the coc 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.699
 russian rick 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.689
 topical 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.550
 these changes will recognize who was ranked 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.499
 we can champion their news 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.460
 soro 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.659
 not at all 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.659
 after the quarterback holder 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.770
 m 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.020
 although these attacks 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.710
 engine 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.450
 we listen to the radio 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.990
 lightweight 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.950
 even if clear of 75 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.920
 located high the clean site 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.050
 so hat 3 to May 26 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.330
 I will try to arrange pop 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.290
 according to him 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.700
 w9 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.890
 but m from the resumption year rather good I find myself 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.080
 even with a wrc 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.750
 p otherwise I rely on them that the settings are pretty much a context 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.440
 the group aures 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.270
 after moultes 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.370
 on road at James Bond times but it's better floats a word from his 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.840
 About 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 then in the var the other competitions 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.980
 cicada and this woman 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.230
 it's a beautiful course 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.370
 On the other hand 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.659
 Too small 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.130
 and we are upwind 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 it should be a clean guarantee 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.250
 Why 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.260
 I'm all ears the debate is open fraudsters 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.549
 what 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.549
 belga 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.639
 allawi 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.559
 basle and in the camp of montreuil-bellay 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.559
 the young lady 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.809
 she 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.069
 he is 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.729
 nothing 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.729
 it is true
