00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.270
 I approach the microphone plus you have in 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.860
 general ham allowed to modify 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.990
 to improve my teaching in the 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.260
 to the extent that I have at my disposal 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.570
 various media interactive sometimes video 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.580
 it boosts teaching in the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.870
 the uniscal digital university there is a 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.910
 interactive tool that allows you 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.370
 to understand these concepts of 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.360
 temporal representation when I 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.320
 move up I increase 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.940
 the amplitude of the signal 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.160
 when one is on the bench of a 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.930
 amphitheater we take notes on 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.629
 listen to the neck we try to understand it 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.120
 I invite you to go again 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.299
 courses on digital universities 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.739
 themes 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:07.260
 but once you are at home you have 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.260
 want to deepen to review points 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.109
 for students this is the way to 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.359
 them to train to see others 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:18.530
 points of view and deepen their 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.880
 knowledge about cases this field 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.679
 you will very quickly change 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.729
 see said to get to the bottom of things from 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.679
 includes more 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.600
 and then to actually get a little bit in 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.610
 interaction with the short and live it 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.990
 because the digital side of 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.090
 resource documents that are 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.640
 diffused allows to actually interact 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.890
 with the current is the umd 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.739
 these are a few thousand resources 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.780
 pedagogical activities are complementary 

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:47.380
 not in competition with the courts 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.270
 existing 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.700
 it's a digital tool that is 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.630
 available to all everywhere at any 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.799
 time of day and night 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.869
 from any place to 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:01.600
 condition to have of course a connection 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:03.939
 internet and especially the zero digit 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.640
 it's the freedom for the student 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:10.050
 to study when he wants when he 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.050
 wants and in excellent conditions 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.910
 it allows students who are also 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.110
 employee or they will meet 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.600
 some difficulties in their 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.490
 trajectory of being able to access 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:34.710
 high quality complementary content 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:36.700
 actually he ran aground the g2 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.650
 besides the fact that it favors 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.780
 actually equal opportunities 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.710
 with students it gives a more 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:51.430
 great flexibility in the organization 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:54.910
 pedagogical a greater wealth of 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.450
 century indeed these crises have done with 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.640
 the units 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.230
 we have a guarantee that the resources 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.580
 which we are going to access are really 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.680
 reliable resources 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.580
 content is covered by committees 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.350
 scientists 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.470
 it's important for the end user 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.930
 that is to say the student the role of a 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.510
 unity is to coordinate a set of 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.770
 body of course obviously we avoid 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.520
 redundancies we are going in the direction of the 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:22.120
 quality of consistency the indexing of 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.910
 resources makes it possible to find 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.310
 among these tens of thousands of 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.290
 resources pretty quickly those that 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.030
 we are looking for 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.840
 the student to guarantee to find 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.400
 six months a year later the resource 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.690
 since the resources remain very 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.690
 a long time on the mnt 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.670
 we are going to see mostly documents 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.650
 on their behavior the approach 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.470
 pedagogical remains clean to the teacher 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.870
 and often we talk about a support 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.730
 existing it is reclaimed for 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.650
 able to develop a course with 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.050
 students we have in front of us for 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.450
 teachers there are a number 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.410
 more to participate in the creation of 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.270
 content in digital universities 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.370
 thematic is to be able to be at the 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.380
 author of its content and at the same time 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.000
 time actors of creation and of 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.350
 broadcasting of this content on a 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.640
 national device and mutualized me I 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.139
 I'm more interested everything 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.250
 median filtering low pass filter 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.760
 I do not know course of the first 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.710
 years among the many things that 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.729
 my lets discover the units I 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.740
 think we can quote the chain 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:31.060
 editorial scenario we have to 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.130
 we created the resources we 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.800
 depositors on media such as rio 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.389
 ax which allows to exchange and render 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.389
 interoperable the entire device 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:47.229
 if it sets up a device 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.090
 performing with a wide participation 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.590
 to the production of content in the 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.310
 part of a digital universities 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:57.810
 thematic at that time the university 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.810
 can be financially successful 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.070
 units are also a tool for 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.750
 valorization of our universities in 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.810
 the international they allow 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.930
 to form a student audience 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.210
 very wide very diverse 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.610
 at the planetary scale it is a tool 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.789
 exceptionally of dissemination of the 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.789
 know
