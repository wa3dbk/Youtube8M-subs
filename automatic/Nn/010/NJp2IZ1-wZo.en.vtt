00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 I want to give to your attention 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.340
 automatic to switch on the breathing or 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.750
 low beam headlights 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.570
 my case dipped headlights so 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.060
 automation works from the speed sensor 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.080
 that is, when the car rusheva there light 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.600
 turned off there are two LEDs 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.080
 indicators 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.399
 yellow and this green lights up 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.050
 if the car is drowned out you are yellow 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.370
 means that automation is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.840
 standby mode 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.120
 if we turn on the ignition that is yellow 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.329
 will constantly talk about green 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.800
 indicates that it is on and silent 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:56.239
 or dipped by showing headlights that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.239
 off off and 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.090
 we start the car 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.520
 the indicator is constantly on all off 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.650
 the LED is still off 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.090
 under 14 years old 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.090
 no shoulder yet 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.290
 roasting here personally 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.540
 the green LED lights up 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.179
 He speaks 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.400
 if we were driving in a car and stopped then 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.060
 one car is not 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.569
 it's after three minutes of ether or neighbor 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.200
 headlights 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:30.569
 will turn off but if we break it again 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.569
 turns on if the car is already 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.840
 there will be two three beeps 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.709
 but 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.500
 low or low beam headlights will still 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.380
 work 20 seconds polite 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.250
 backlight 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.250
 went car 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:18.530
 the green LED goes out and goes out 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:21.290
 automatics went into the spirit mode even if 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.290
 we drove the car 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:29.270
 so dipped headlights we us 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.440
 need or victor we need to enable 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.190
 main beam or dimensions 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.770
 if we enable both riths to develop by 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.790
 the rules should be turned off if we 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:45.150
 turn on shave it breathing 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:49.800

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:54.390
 turned off automatic goes back to 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:59.900
