00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.750
 everyone said to themselves what is a 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.250
 hole for a new video on gta 5 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.250

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.769
 show how to have the taxi car 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.300
 on gta 5 online so first of all you 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.019
 you have to go to your phone 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.949
 and the internet to help traveling 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.200
 transport and go into the in this 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.300
 car shop so under stern 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.330
 address super self so sorry for the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.560
 pronunciation and you go into the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.020
 sports category 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.080
 this is the third one and there you buy the 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.430
 bnf feldzer actors 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.680
 so here's once you did 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.460
 that you go to the custom and we find 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.140
 immediately for the rest of the video 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.990
 so it's good we are at the custom so we 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.520
 will go right back 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:07.670

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:11.020
 fender sportyou so I like is the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.290
 shielding the brakes I put everything to the bottom 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:19.220
 and mustache we could put the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.600
 mustache so on spoiler for nothing 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.890
 I personally do not go 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.560
 put that on the original car 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.600
 does not come and there also behind where we 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.950
 can put it like that but tonight 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.360
 auxerre of origin is also that of the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.610
 how do anyway 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.310
 we will try to com to do the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.460
 best likeness possible 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.990
 background engine then well on the wings 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.630
 aeration and I did not like it horns slap 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.290
 on slaps lighting series backgrounds 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:52.040
 farc I like of course after the plate where 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:57.010
 the soul was black so painting is 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:02.000
 rather a metallic metallized white 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:05.260
 white view langil and we will try to 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.260
 to tackle with 1 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.510
 yeah that's more it's rather sand in 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:17.220
 young gir created for me that makes 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.650
 even more white so apparently that's it 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.160
 so after there is the roof there at the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.370

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.640
