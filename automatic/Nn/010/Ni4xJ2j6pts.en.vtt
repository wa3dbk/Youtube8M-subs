up<00:01:00.840> ah<00:01:03.379> should<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.500> made<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.890> wood

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
up ah should have made that out of wood

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.230 
up ah should have made that out of wood
probably<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.689> best<00:01:06.720> idea

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.020 

via<00:01:10.869> um<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
via um it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.050 
via um it
it's<00:01:15.630> basically<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:17.100> way<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.430> command

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
it's basically just a way to command

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.660 
it's basically just a way to command
lightning<00:01:18.510> and<00:01:18.690> it's<00:01:19.110> very<00:01:20.010> degree<00:01:20.549> it's

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
lightning and it's very degree it's

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.740 
lightning and it's very degree it's
extremely<00:01:21.390> quickly<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> hundred

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
extremely quickly so it's not a hundred

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.590 
extremely quickly so it's not a hundred
percent<00:01:24.869> practical<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.729> pretty<00:01:27.330> damn

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
percent practical but it's pretty damn

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.370 
percent practical but it's pretty damn
fun<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.530> believe<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.729> made<00:01:29.940> out<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.380> two

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
fun I believe it's made out of two

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.389 
fun I believe it's made out of two
glowstone<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:33.710> this<00:01:34.710> steak<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
glowstone in and this steak like a

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.969 
glowstone in and this steak like a
normal<00:01:35.729> sword<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.960> totally<00:01:37.350> sure<00:01:37.409> though<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
