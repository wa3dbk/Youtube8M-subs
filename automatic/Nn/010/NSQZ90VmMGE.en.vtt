00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.929
 Hello everyone, we will disassemble 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.300
 songs of the group spank letters and so the first 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.419
 parts of vasilyev just takes chords and 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.980
 holds down by itself which should 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:38.620
 study just down and read the text 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:48.390
 nothing complicated in principle yes our first 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:48.390
 chord and I am 0122 second port d 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:01:01.050
 1320 5 6 does not mean 3 Farsi jacket 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:04.010
 0 1 2 3 5 6 does not sound 4 courts such that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.010
 strange fm 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:13.430
 001 3 5 6 does not sound and everything ends 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.430
 curt again 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.149
 let's not be like that 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.850
 In the context, I will read Vasilyev once and 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:26.439
 you believe the idea is nothing complicated and so 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:29.979
 rather than not catch you flew in 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:33.539
 July night on the Gulf of Riga is not 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:36.640
 have you seen these magic or 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.770
 exactly nice to touch 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.979
 by hands 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.780
 sand on which is scattered to the landscape 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.490
 unchanging here for centuries I'm sorry well and 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.250
 so then you get the idea 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.959
 nothing complicated just spend a mink 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:59.819
 down each of the chords and sing like that 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:02.590
 now go to the next part 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.310
 where he starts to play the fight that is 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.170
 late at night and here it all begins 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.410
 the most interesting and interesting 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.360
 is how many shares 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.599
 he plays each of the chords 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.019
 to understand this let's listen and 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:23.640
 calculate the place you also think so 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:31.350
 feel this one this one and so 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:39.819
 times two three times two three four times two 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:47.209
 times two times two times two three times two 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:51.550
 four times two times two times two well and so 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.050
 further that is you noticed am3 chord 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:59.269
 gave three quarters 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:05.360
 d 4 quarters four shares f8 2 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:07.959
 This one is also strange in the second and last m2 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.110
 after which the root changes but everything 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:17.209
 loops over for and again 3 4 2 2 2 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.829
 and so on this broken size is necessary 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.620
 feel so advise you 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.110
 read along with the original entry then 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.660
 have include song letter and stupid 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.239
 count with him how much he is 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.180
 chord and plays and when you first time 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.870
 you will play too, consider it real 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.260
 helps 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.090
 now let's deal with the fight and so 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.569
 chord fight 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.569
 one 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.580
 again 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.920
 but 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.349
 down down up 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.550
 remove index down 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.550
 add me up 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.440
 well, the last time 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.570
 go to chord d 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.900
 and down down up down up down 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.889
 down i 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.889
 there is light in it 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.660
 well, the last time 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.690
 then go to care dor f match 7 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:06.140
 down down up if I'm down down up 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.140
 down up 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.030
 go here this fm. strange will 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.949
 exactly the same 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.949
 down down down down up 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:35.020
 and last 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:38.190
 and m which is played a little differently you are not with 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.280
 remove your index finger 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.870
 add veins 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.849
 you are not out 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.229
 add up 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.469
 of 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.469
 get together 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.280
 one more time 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.970
 not last time 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.669
 now let's slowly from the beginning 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:17.629
 On all occult we will walk since 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.629
 naturally 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.870
 and 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:02.770
 and so on, I think the idea is clear on 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:05.310
 this whole hell song at the end is just 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.310
 leave 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:13.020
 sound and let it fade out 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:15.500
 the whole song we just took it apart 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.669
 It was an analysis of the song group spleen letter 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.310
