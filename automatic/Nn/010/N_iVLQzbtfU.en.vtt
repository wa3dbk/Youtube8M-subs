00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:27.520
 but no 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.520
 walking while the why 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.809
 when in front of the rock, pay attention to 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.610
 alternative music to the revolution and 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.170
 I say mother nature nor have they existed 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.830
 maybe when he is always in himself I think 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.740
 I am different but I am like that I am that 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.400
 country in which it is a priority of the happy 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:15.090
 and I say mom 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.800
 Natural, I may be different but 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.890
 I am here 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.890
 yes 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:30.220
 among the few blacks or that there is nothing 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:33.159
 because that leads the software adding 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.320
 one was that you are the era that in 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.590
 loneliness 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.280
 I do not have more resources than the heart does not 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.500
 there is nothing better than being in your land and 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.360
 software when love was not that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.360
 relaunch but not 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.740
 this 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.799
 because when I sat down but aimlessly 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.799
 but looking forward 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.720
 that they can not stop them and with the mother 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.110
 with which to shoot me 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.709
 in front of the mirror 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.629
 and I say mother natural stations 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.690
 maybe when better than then that 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.959
 I am different but I am like that 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.060
 I am from the country where I will be 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:58.890
 happy and I say more 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:02.690
 and nature together you may think that 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.690
 I am different but I am here 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.690
 Y 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.030
 relaxes tomatoes or contiguous 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:19.250
 there is nothing better than being at home 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:23.660
 you have to offer the lowest one so that 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.660
 tonnage where are we going 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:31.420
 there is nothing better than being at home 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:34.420
 entire software is a day that drips the 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.420
 mind 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.970
 and 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.170
 t 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.660
 and rock none of this has been the song 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.660
 whole and now I'm going to proceed to 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.120
 teach you how to play and nothing for 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.490
 I hope it does not get too heavy but 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.830
 is the song are three the first of 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.220
 they are the biggest that I for this 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.230
 song to give you the rhythm of the rule 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.890
 I touch 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.769
 I take off fret in the position of fa that 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.500
 for which 6 beginners of country is 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.480
 more is played on the first fret 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:21.730
 squeezing with the index 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.470
 all the strings on the first fret 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.500
 with the middle finger the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.880
 third string on the second fret 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.980
 any ring is tightened the fifth 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.640
 Rope on the third fret with the finger 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.350
 little finger 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.600
 the fourth string is tightened in the third 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.630
 fret 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.370
 well and nothing that I play in the fifth 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.740
 I put the same position that is the 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.340
 greater simply because it gives a touch 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.920
 sharper and to touch him, it's a lot 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.050
 better all romances and nothing the way 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.040
 usual to touch the a is is necessary to leave 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.430
 to the second fret 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.440
 with the index finger press the fourth 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.600
 rope with the middle finger squeeze the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.800
 third string and which should speak 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.800
 tighten the second rope 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.950
 and a little bit more serious but for the 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.950
 beginners to be able to play Latin 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.600
 this is the first the first chord of 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.300
 second chords the me 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.020
 that is touched pressing with the index the 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.080
 third string on the first fret 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.370
 with the middle finger you have to press in 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.960
 the fifth string on the second fret and 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.610
 with the ring finger you have to press the 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.810
 Rope door on the second fret 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.810
 It also sounds like this to me 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:39.290
 and finally the lowest sustained fa 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.890
 that for minor sustained nothing you have to 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:46.009
 position ourselves in the accord elephant what 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:49.309
 we move to the second fret 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:52.749
 and we take the middle finger off his finger 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:52.749
 heart that is squeezing the vital 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.380
 and this held less once once 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.610
 that teach you what are the chords of 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.770
 the song now the important thing is to know 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.380
 keep the rhythm of the hand well 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.560
 strumming that particularly 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.320
 on the reverse what we are touching then 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.090
 it's a little harder than touching 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.630
 other styles of music because say a 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.820
 little the way to touch it 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.790
 and we go in the complicated ones I'm not 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.590
 no that I am 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.140
 and what has been achieved with practice 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.200
 that I encourage you to try 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.630
 You'll see how you know 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.900
 the first one exposes the accordÃ© of the greater 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.900
 OK 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.960
 and what I do in this song 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.110
 particularly is 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.850
 the first strum side down 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.180
 tightening the ropes but nevertheless 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:44.220
 the second also down what 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.530
 I do is keep the position of the 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.460
 fingers in the chord but without tightening the 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.180
 ropes 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.699
 that is to say I make a tap worth as 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:07:00.569
 tear but without tightening the strings 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:07:03.630
 it would be treading and the fingers as you notice that 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:05.819
 when squeezed and when not and then already 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:11.550
 third strum would be up and 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:14.280
 squeezing would stay that way and then already if 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:19.590
 we continue with the rest of the rhythm 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:22.520
 it would be again 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:29.740
 and go up and down 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:29.740
 and we change 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:50.660
 Y 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:54.380
 I give this this wine and we prove that 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.000
 I already tell you the strumming hand because it's the 

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.260
 most important playing reggae because it's 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.100
 the one that gives you the rhythm that you can 

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:03.710
 change at any time 

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.710
 and nothing, I hope you liked it 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:09.249
 the tutorial this how to play the 

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:10.959
 song and nothing 

00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:12.579
 and I encourage you to prove it 

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:14.619
 try and if you have any questions 

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:16.509
 Well, you tell me around here 

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:18.719
 comments so nothing a greeting to 

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:18.719
 everyone
