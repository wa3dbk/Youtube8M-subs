good<00:03:53.310> cable<00:03:53.880> management<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:55.220> basically<00:03:56.220> we

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
good cable management that basically we

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.220 
good cable management that basically we
can<00:03:56.579> see<00:03:56.850> there's<00:03:57.630> at<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.810> back<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
can see there's at the back of the

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.410 
can see there's at the back of the
century<00:03:58.680> down<00:03:59.459> here<00:03:59.730> you've<00:03:59.910> got<00:04:00.030> these<00:04:00.150> green

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
don't put that one on just at the moment

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.920 
don't put that one on just at the moment
one<00:04:38.370> thing<00:04:38.580> will<00:04:38.700> go<00:04:38.820> are<00:04:38.910> left<00:04:39.060> over<00:04:39.240> I'm<00:04:39.750> not

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
is you do get these sensor heat sensors

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.800 
is you do get these sensor heat sensors
and<00:04:46.500> they<00:04:47.190> come<00:04:47.430> with<00:04:47.550> up<00:04:47.669> sticky<00:04:48.030> pads<00:04:48.240> so<00:04:48.720> you

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
and they come with up sticky pads so you

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.690 
and they come with up sticky pads so you
can<00:04:48.960> route<00:04:49.139> these<00:04:49.260> round<00:04:49.620> put<00:04:50.370> them<00:04:50.490> on<00:04:50.580> your

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
can route these round put them on your

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.340 
can route these round put them on your
processor<00:04:51.090> your<00:04:51.300> graphics<00:04:51.630> card<00:04:51.930> or<00:04:52.050> whatever

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
processor your graphics card or whatever

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.800 
processor your graphics card or whatever
you<00:04:52.470> want<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.680> check<00:04:52.919> the<00:04:53.310> heat<00:04:53.660> just<00:04:54.660> the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
you want to check the heat just the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.420 
you want to check the heat just the
ambient<00:04:55.640> temperature<00:04:56.640> of<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:58.140> case<00:04:58.349> so<00:04:58.919> it's

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
ambient temperature of the case so it's

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.550 
ambient temperature of the case so it's
got<00:04:59.580> these<00:04:59.700> and<00:05:00.150> you

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
got these and you

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.350 
got these and you
you<00:05:00.620> see<00:05:00.830> they're<00:05:01.010> all<00:05:01.130> on<00:05:01.550> one<00:05:01.910> like<00:05:02.060> ribbon

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
you see they're all on one like ribbon

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.990 
you see they're all on one like ribbon
cable<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:02.900> you<00:05:03.860> could<00:05:04.040> literally<00:05:04.340> just<00:05:04.669> split

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
cable and you could literally just split

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.290 
cable and you could literally just split
them<00:05:05.180> back<00:05:06.010> to<00:05:07.010> whatever<00:05:07.160> you<00:05:07.400> want<00:05:07.610> whatever

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
them back to whatever you want whatever

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.330 
them back to whatever you want whatever
length<00:05:08.480> you<00:05:08.600> want<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:09.020> that's<00:05:09.889> the<00:05:09.980> next<00:05:10.130> job

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
length you want and that's the next job

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.659 
length you want and that's the next job

this<00:05:36.800> is<00:05:36.979> Emmerich's<00:05:37.400> saying<00:05:38.360> over<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:38.870> out

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.590 

actually<00:05:43.580> not<00:05:43.730> quite<00:05:43.880> over<00:05:44.090> an<00:05:44.270> hour<00:05:44.390> I

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
actually not quite over an hour I

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.050 
actually not quite over an hour I
thought<00:05:45.220> at<00:05:46.220> least<00:05:46.370> I<00:05:46.550> could<00:05:46.580> do<00:05:46.820> is<00:05:46.850> actually

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
thought at least I could do is actually

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.170 
thought at least I could do is actually
show<00:05:47.450> you<00:05:47.510> actually<00:05:48.050> working<00:05:48.260> which<00:05:48.860> is<00:05:49.180> it's

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
show you actually working which is it's

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.820 
show you actually working which is it's
quite<00:05:50.270> sweet<00:05:50.660> it's<00:05:50.900> like<00:05:50.960> similar<00:05:51.440> Starship

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
Enterprise you can see I've got it in

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.510 
Enterprise you can see I've got it in
the<00:05:55.940> half<00:05:56.150> case<00:05:56.420> all<00:05:56.660> black<00:05:57.190> it's<00:05:58.190> not<00:05:58.490> a

the half case all black it's not a

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.460 
the half case all black it's not a
brushed<00:05:58.880> steel<00:05:59.270> metal<00:05:59.900> the<00:06:00.770> actual<00:06:04.000> monitor

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
brushed steel metal the actual monitor

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.210 
brushed steel metal the actual monitor
and<00:06:06.470> here<00:06:06.650> you<00:06:06.710> have<00:06:06.890> it<00:06:07.010> all<00:06:07.400> working<00:06:08.980> the<00:06:09.980> top

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
and here you have it all working the top

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:18.280 
and here you have it all working the top
there<00:06:10.460> showing<00:06:10.850> that<00:06:11.000> I've<00:06:11.210> got<00:06:11.390> there<00:06:17.290> the

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
there showing that I've got there the

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
fan revs:802rpm solve yep in them

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.980 
fan revs:802rpm solve yep in them
because<00:06:23.900> they're<00:06:24.020> a<00:06:24.050> little<00:06:24.200> bit<00:06:24.380> low<00:06:25.990> with

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
because they're a little bit low with

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.470 
because they're a little bit low with
the<00:06:27.110> settings
