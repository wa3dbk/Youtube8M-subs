00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:30.570 

basically<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.420> finished<00:03:23.750> product<00:03:24.200> is<00:03:24.409> a

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.580 

banner<00:03:31.580> it's<00:03:32.420> probably<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.870> best<00:03:33.019> footlong

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
banner it's probably the best footlong

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:42.850 
banner it's probably the best footlong
maybe<00:03:34.310> foot-and-a-half<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:40.250> strain<00:03:41.799> is<00:03:42.799> a

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
maybe foot-and-a-half the strain is a

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.520 
maybe foot-and-a-half the strain is a
rubber<00:03:43.220> band<00:03:46.360> this<00:03:47.360> was<00:03:47.599> thanks<00:03:48.110> to<00:03:48.349> another

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
rubber band this was thanks to another

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.059 
rubber band this was thanks to another
YouTube<00:03:49.190> video<00:03:49.670> that<00:03:50.349> showed<00:03:51.349> the<00:03:51.860> rubber

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
YouTube video that showed the rubber

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.559 
YouTube video that showed the rubber
band<00:03:52.340> was<00:03:52.579> safer<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:54.879> kids<00:03:55.879> who<00:03:55.970> got<00:03:56.120> caught<00:03:56.299> on

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
band was safer to kids who got caught on

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.020 
band was safer to kids who got caught on
a<00:03:56.599> tree<00:03:56.629> or<00:03:56.989> something

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
a tree or something

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:06.550 
a tree or something
basically<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:01.430> drop<00:04:01.670> module<00:04:05.349> when<00:04:06.349> the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
basically the drop module when the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.599 
basically the drop module when the
batteries<00:04:06.950> plugged<00:04:07.250> in<00:04:09.099> okay<00:04:10.690> it<00:04:11.690> will<00:04:11.870> be

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
batteries plugged in okay it will be

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.270 
batteries plugged in okay it will be
strong<00:04:13.609> enough<00:04:13.819> to<00:04:13.970> hold<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:14.510> thing<00:04:15.280> okay

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
strong enough to hold that thing okay

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.640 
strong enough to hold that thing okay
and<00:04:16.699> then<00:04:16.850> it'll<00:04:17.090> just<00:04:17.120> hang<00:04:17.900> like<00:04:18.139> that<00:04:18.169> as

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
and then it'll just hang like that as

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.360 
and then it'll just hang like that as
the<00:04:19.280> plane<00:04:21.760> as<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.789> plane<00:04:23.060> goes<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:24.220> then<00:04:25.220> of

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
the plane as a plane goes and then of

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:38.100 
the plane as a plane goes and then of
course<00:04:26.889> when<00:04:27.889> the<00:04:28.190> drop<00:04:28.430> module<00:04:28.880> is<00:04:29.030> released

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.300 

then<00:04:40.230> there<00:04:41.230> goes<00:04:41.440> your<00:04:41.470> banner<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:45.100> whole

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
then there goes your banner the whole

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:51.870 
then there goes your banner the whole
