start rolling the dough split some

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.870 
start rolling the dough split some
around<00:04:22.890> this<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.550> that's<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.360> just<00:04:24.600> start<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
around this and that's it just start and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.750 
around this and that's it just start and
it<00:04:26.880> could<00:04:27.060> be<00:04:27.240> as<00:04:27.450> rustic<00:04:28.050> as<00:04:28.110> possible<00:04:28.980> okay

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
over it because this has a tendency to

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.340
