up<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.240> fourth<00:01:47.479> section<00:01:48.130> but<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.250> river

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
up the fourth section but the river

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.999 
up the fourth section but the river
crested<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.119> start<00:01:50.360> going<00:01:50.509> back<00:01:50.780> down<00:01:51.020> didn't

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
crested and start going back down didn't

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
have to but this is the edge and I think

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.320 
have to but this is the edge and I think
it's<00:01:56.270> done<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.689> third<00:01:57.170> step<00:01:57.560> from<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.950> top

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
it's done the third step from the top

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.529 
it's done the third step from the top
even<00:01:59.330> with<00:01:59.479> it<00:02:00.729> it's<00:02:01.729> just<00:02:01.909> horrible

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
even with it it's just horrible

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.120 
even with it it's just horrible
I<00:02:03.250> hope<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.789> snow<00:02:05.000> melts<00:02:05.360> very<00:02:05.689> slowly<00:02:06.140> and

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
I hope the snow melts very slowly and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.859 
I hope the snow melts very slowly and
the<00:02:07.310> river<00:02:07.580> goes<00:02:07.759> down<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.269> it<00:02:08.390> doesn't<00:02:08.720> come

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
the river goes down and it doesn't come

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
other side of those trees way out there

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.899 
other side of those trees way out there
and<00:03:46.329> we<00:03:46.569> used<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.959> live<00:03:47.170> in<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.379> house<00:03:47.590> that's<00:03:48.549> it

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
and we used to live in a house that's it

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:51.660 
and we used to live in a house that's it
in<00:03:49.150> that<00:03:49.389> empty<00:03:49.599> lot<00:03:49.750> right<00:03:50.170> there<00:03:50.409> we<00:03:51.370> lived

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
in that empty lot right there we lived

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.789 
in that empty lot right there we lived
there<00:03:51.940> until<00:03:52.209> probably<00:03:52.629> I<00:03:52.959> was<00:03:53.230> in<00:03:53.409> maybe<00:03:53.680> the

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
there until probably I was in maybe the

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.540 
there until probably I was in maybe the
third<00:03:54.190> grade<00:03:54.549> or<00:03:54.760> so

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
third grade or so

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.510 
third grade or so
I<00:03:57.350> had<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.380> lot<00:03:58.590> of<00:03:58.620> fun<00:03:58.860> times<00:03:59.040> when<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.430> was

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
I had a lot of fun times when I was

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.370 
I had a lot of fun times when I was
little<00:03:59.760> down<00:03:59.910> on<00:04:00.030> these<00:04:00.210> streets

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.170 

and<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:05.950> figured<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.400> river<00:04:06.580> would<00:04:06.820> be<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:06.970> lot

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
and I figured the river would be a lot

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.170 
and I figured the river would be a lot
higher<00:04:07.600> than<00:04:07.870> what<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.200> is<00:04:08.320> there<00:04:09.000> but<00:04:10.000> it's

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
higher than what it is there but it's

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.390 
higher than what it is there but it's
not<00:04:10.390> doing<00:04:10.750> too<00:04:10.900> bad<00:04:13.620> it'll<00:04:14.620> probably<00:04:14.860> crest

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
not doing too bad it'll probably crest

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.590 
not doing too bad it'll probably crest
and<00:04:15.670> go<00:04:15.760> down<00:04:15.970> tonight

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600
