very<00:02:50.690> fine<00:02:51.440> grit<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.430> what<00:02:53.210> that's<00:02:53.390> going<00:02:53.540> to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
very fine grit and what that's going to

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.800 
very fine grit and what that's going to
do<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:54.110> it's<00:02:54.410> going<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.620> clean<00:02:55.040> up<00:02:55.250> all<00:02:55.810> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
do is it's going to clean up all the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.050 
do is it's going to clean up all the
excess<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:58.540> excess<00:02:59.540> paint<00:02:59.980> that's<00:03:00.980> on<00:03:01.130> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
excess of excess paint that's on the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.210 
excess of excess paint that's on the
surface<00:03:02.530> revealing<00:03:03.530> all<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.820> letters<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:06.220> it

surface revealing all the letters and it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.440 
surface revealing all the letters and it
cleans<00:03:07.520> up<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:08.030> edge<00:03:08.330> around<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.260> M<00:03:10.450> hi

everyone<00:03:11.840> it's<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.080> morning<00:03:12.380> after<00:03:13.120> applying

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
everyone it's the morning after applying

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.650 
everyone it's the morning after applying
the<00:03:14.300> paint<00:03:14.570> to<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.320> badge<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:17.239> morning

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
the paint to the badge and this morning

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.140 
the paint to the badge and this morning
what<00:03:17.810> I've<00:03:17.930> done<00:03:18.140> is<00:03:18.620> I've<00:03:19.459> used<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
what I've done is I've used the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.610 
what I've done is I've used the
sandpaper<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.520> this<00:03:22.520> sandpaper<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.620> really

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
sandpaper and this sandpaper is really

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.490 
sandpaper and this sandpaper is really
really<00:03:24.860> thin<00:03:25.220> it's<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:25.790> thinner<00:03:26.690> than<00:03:26.810> what

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
really thin it's it's thinner than what

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.640 
really thin it's it's thinner than what
would<00:03:27.709> be<00:03:27.830> a<00:03:27.860> traditional<00:03:28.520> wet<00:03:28.790> sandpaper<00:03:29.650> you

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
would be a traditional wet sandpaper you

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.570 
would be a traditional wet sandpaper you
can<00:03:30.830> barely<00:03:31.100> feel<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.880> texture<00:03:32.420> of<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:34.280> grit

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
can barely feel the texture of the grit

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.510 
can barely feel the texture of the grit
and<00:03:35.020> this<00:03:36.020> is<00:03:36.200> used<00:03:36.500> in<00:03:36.830> modeling

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
and this is used in modeling

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.250 
and this is used in modeling
applications<00:03:38.239> when<00:03:38.450> you're<00:03:38.570> building<00:03:38.750> models

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
applications when you're building models

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.729 
applications when you're building models
and<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.860> need<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.220> clean<00:03:40.730> small<00:03:41.239> parts<00:03:41.660> up<00:03:41.870> and

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
and you need to clean small parts up and

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.530 
and you need to clean small parts up and
what<00:03:43.250> I've<00:03:43.340> done<00:03:43.610> is<00:03:44.110> applied<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:46.820> sandpaper

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
what I've done is applied the sandpaper

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.890 
what I've done is applied the sandpaper
on<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.840> surface<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:48.470> given<00:03:49.010> small<00:03:49.900> strokes

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
on the surface and given small strokes

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.630 
on the surface and given small strokes
just<00:03:51.760> enough<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:53.600> clear<00:03:53.989> away<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.260> paint<00:03:54.709> from

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
just enough to clear away the paint from

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.660 
just enough to clear away the paint from
the<00:03:55.760> top<00:03:55.970> surface<00:03:56.920> exposing<00:03:57.920> all<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.280> letters

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
the top surface exposing all the letters

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.990 
the top surface exposing all the letters
and<00:03:59.920> cleaning<00:04:00.920> up<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:01.220> edges<00:04:01.640> now

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
and cleaning up the edges now

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.490 
and cleaning up the edges now
unfortunately<00:04:03.790> since<00:04:04.790> this<00:04:05.510> is<00:04:05.720> such<00:04:06.079> a<00:04:06.109> fine

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
unfortunately since this is such a fine

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.330 
unfortunately since this is such a fine
grit<00:04:07.160> paper<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:09.170> aluminum

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
grit paper the the aluminum

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.220 
grit paper the the aluminum
is<00:04:10.400> is<00:04:11.239> a<00:04:11.360> very<00:04:11.750> fine<00:04:12.230> dust<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:13.870> what<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:14.989> ended

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
is is a very fine dust and what it ended

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.080 
is is a very fine dust and what it ended
up<00:04:15.379> doing<00:04:15.709> was<00:04:16.040> getting<00:04:16.340> on<00:04:16.669> top<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.930> white

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
up doing was getting on top of the white

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.640 
up doing was getting on top of the white
so<00:04:20.090> what<00:04:20.269> I'm<00:04:20.359> gonna<00:04:20.479> go<00:04:20.750> ahead<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.019> do<00:04:21.290> is<00:04:21.470> I'm

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is I'm

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.260 
so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is I'm
going<00:04:21.889> to<00:04:22.479> wash<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.720> badge<00:04:24.729> with<00:04:25.729> some<00:04:26.030> soap

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
going to wash the badge with some soap

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.820 
going to wash the badge with some soap
and<00:04:26.479> water<00:04:26.690> just<00:04:27.139> clean<00:04:27.560> up<00:04:27.669> any<00:04:28.669> excess

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
and water just clean up any excess

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.990 
and water just clean up any excess
residue<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:33.440> may<00:04:33.680> exist<00:04:34.190> on<00:04:34.580> top<00:04:34.820> of<00:04:34.940> the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
residue that may exist on top of the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.719 
residue that may exist on top of the
badge<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.600> then<00:04:36.020> I'm<00:04:36.139> going<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.550> just<00:04:37.550> apply

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
badge and then I'm going to just apply

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.280 
badge and then I'm going to just apply
the<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.720> white<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:38.990> very<00:04:39.260> fine<00:04:39.919> coat<00:04:40.250> of<00:04:40.490> white

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
the the white a very fine coat of white

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.980 
the the white a very fine coat of white
to<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.470> badge<00:04:43.120> but<00:04:44.120> you'll<00:04:44.300> get<00:04:44.479> a<00:04:44.540> general

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
to the badge but you'll get a general

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.820 
to the badge but you'll get a general
idea<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.520> how<00:04:47.229> it'll<00:04:48.229> come<00:04:48.560> out<00:04:48.740> once<00:04:49.220> done<00:04:50.830> if

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
idea of how it'll come out once done if

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.830 
idea of how it'll come out once done if
I<00:04:51.979> had<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.280> do<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.520> again<00:04:52.850> I'd<00:04:53.090> probably<00:04:53.330> do

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
I had to do it again I'd probably do

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.280 
I had to do it again I'd probably do
everything<00:04:54.740> without<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.370> white<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.290> then

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
everything without the white and then

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.650 
everything without the white and then
leave<00:04:57.650> since<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.340> white<00:04:58.580> is<00:04:58.760> a<00:04:58.790> larger<00:04:59.270> area

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
leave since the white is a larger area

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.830 
leave since the white is a larger area
it's<00:04:59.810> a<00:04:59.900> little<00:05:00.139> easier<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:01.060> to<00:05:02.060> get<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.570> paint

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
it's a little easier to to get the paint

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.050 
it's a little easier to to get the paint
in<00:05:03.139> place<00:05:03.830> I'd<00:05:04.639> probably<00:05:04.910> do<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:05.500> afterwards

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
in place I'd probably do that afterwards

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.930 
in place I'd probably do that afterwards
but<00:05:08.060> nonetheless<00:05:08.300> it's<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:09.520> comes<00:05:10.520> out<00:05:10.639> really

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
but nonetheless it's a comes out really

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.330 
but nonetheless it's a comes out really
nice<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:14.200> it's<00:05:15.200> another<00:05:15.470> step<00:05:15.800> towards

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
nice and it's another step towards

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.600 
nice and it's another step towards
getting<00:05:16.850> this<00:05:17.060> back<00:05:17.330> this<00:05:17.900> bike<00:05:18.500> back<00:05:18.830> to<00:05:19.130> its

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
getting this back this bike back to its

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.550 
getting this back this bike back to its
original<00:05:19.760> state

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
original state

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.150 
original state
or<00:05:21.560> at<00:05:21.710> least<00:05:21.889> as<00:05:22.039> close<00:05:22.070> as<00:05:22.430> possible<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:22.940> it

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
or at least as close as possible to it

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.680 
or at least as close as possible to it
now<00:05:25.160> one<00:05:25.490> of<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.669> other<00:05:25.700> things<00:05:26.270> that<00:05:26.360> I'll

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
now one of the other things that I'll

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.170 
now one of the other things that I'll
probably<00:05:26.930> move<00:05:27.320> on<00:05:27.590> to<00:05:27.860> is<00:05:28.160> going<00:05:28.520> to<00:05:28.669> be<00:05:28.849> the

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
probably move on to is going to be the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.620 
probably move on to is going to be the
