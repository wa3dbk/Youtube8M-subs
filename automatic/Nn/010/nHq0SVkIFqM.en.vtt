cameras on both of these devices and

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:32.299 
cameras on both of these devices and
we've<00:00:30.809> got<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.989> decent<00:00:31.169> amount<00:00:31.559> of<00:00:31.589> light<00:00:31.829> now

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
we've got a decent amount of light now

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.340 
we've got a decent amount of light now
one<00:00:32.460> thing<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.609> know<00:00:32.820> right<00:00:33.030> away<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.539> that<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
one thing to know right away is that the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.770 
one thing to know right away is that the
s4<00:00:34.710> has<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:35.190> 1080p<00:00:35.820> front-facing<00:00:36.359> camera

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
s4 has a 1080p front-facing camera

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.529 
s4 has a 1080p front-facing camera
whereas<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> Lumia<00:00:37.859> 95<00:00:38.309> only<00:00:38.640> has<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.789> 720p

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
whereas the Lumia 95 only has a 720p

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.779 
whereas the Lumia 95 only has a 720p
front<00:00:39.870> facing<00:00:40.140> camera<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.589> you<00:00:40.980> may<00:00:41.309> notice<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
front facing camera so you may notice a

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.119 
front facing camera so you may notice a
difference<00:00:42.149> straightaway<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.410> anyway<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:43.980> hit

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
difference straightaway so anyway do hit

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.860 
difference straightaway so anyway do hit
that<00:00:44.160> thumbs<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.609> and<00:00:44.760> let's<00:00:45.300> go<00:00:45.449> outside<00:00:45.629> and

that thumbs up and let's go outside and
attach<00:00:46.499> the<00:00:46.679> rear<00:00:46.890> facing<00:00:47.100> cameras<00:00:47.489> as<00:00:47.640> well

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
attach the rear facing cameras as well

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.930 
attach the rear facing cameras as well
so<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:48.899> outdoors<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:49.710> now<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
pretty decent day out sides we've got

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:55.489 
pretty decent day out sides we've got
plenty<00:00:52.589> of<00:00:52.739> light<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.780> this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:55.199> sort<00:00:55.440> of

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:55.499 
plenty of light and this is the sort of

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:57.619 
plenty of light and this is the sort of
quality<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.159> expect<00:00:56.730> from<00:00:57.179> both<00:00:57.600> of

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
quality that you can expect from both of

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
quality that you can expect from both of
the<00:00:57.929> cameras<00:00:58.289> here<00:00:58.530> here<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.159> some<00:00:59.429> flowers

the cameras here here are some flowers

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.549 
the cameras here here are some flowers
we've<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.480> got<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.659> bit<00:01:00.839> of<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.989> variation<00:01:01.289> in

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
we've just got a bit of a variation in

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.399 
we've just got a bit of a variation in
colors<00:01:01.980> we've<00:01:02.159> got<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.519> red<00:01:02.819> ones<00:01:03.290> here<00:01:04.290> at

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
colors we've got some red ones here at

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.249 
colors we've got some red ones here at
the<00:01:04.500> bottom<00:01:05.450> that<00:01:06.450> here's<00:01:06.720> some<00:01:06.930> yellow<00:01:07.170> ones

the bottom that here's some yellow ones

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.950 
the bottom that here's some yellow ones

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
here hopefully this gives you a bit of a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.230 
here hopefully this gives you a bit of a
better<00:01:10.259> idea<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.860> terms<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.640> differences

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
better idea in terms of the differences

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.560 
better idea in terms of the differences
here<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.710> now<00:01:13.860> indoors<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
here so we are now indoors with the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.530 
here so we are now indoors with the
samsung<00:01:15.960> galaxy<00:01:15.990> s4<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.189> we're<00:01:17.939> forming<00:01:18.299> in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
samsung galaxy s4 and we're forming in

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.469 
samsung galaxy s4 and we're forming in
pretty<00:01:19.079> low<00:01:19.469> light<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.969> to<00:01:21.090> test<00:01:21.329> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
pretty low light and just to test the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.289 
pretty low light and just to test the
focusing<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.439> low-light<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.490> seems<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> be

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
focusing in low-light it seems to be

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.440 
focusing in low-light it seems to be
pretty<00:01:24.600> decent<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.680> autofocus<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:26.579> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
pretty decent the autofocus on the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.950 
pretty decent the autofocus on the
camera<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.770> as<00:01:29.039> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.659> although<00:01:30.659> the

camera here as you can see although the

picture<00:01:31.170> quality<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.310> does<00:01:32.939> seem<00:01:33.450> pretty

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
picture quality on here does seem pretty

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.980 
picture quality on here does seem pretty
dull<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.649> we<00:01:34.710> are<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.850> Lumia<00:01:36.450> 925

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
it looks much better we'll find out

here now the one thing that you do have
to<00:02:51.650> bear<00:02:51.860> in<00:02:51.980> mind<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.310> that<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.580> s4<00:02:52.910> has<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.300> 13

to bear in mind is that the s4 has a 13
megapixel<00:02:54.230> camera<00:02:54.260> whereas<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.550> Lumia<00:02:56.060> 95

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
camera so you're gonna have a larger

image<00:03:31.400> quality<00:03:31.579> I<00:03:31.790> would<00:03:31.970> say<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.810> Lumia

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
image quality I would say the Lumia

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.900 
image quality I would say the Lumia
again<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.739> little<00:03:33.950> bit<00:03:34.040> warmer<00:03:34.400> compared<00:03:34.850> to

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
again a little bit warmer compared to

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.840 
again a little bit warmer compared to
the<00:03:35.299> cooler<00:03:35.570> tones<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.200> s4<00:03:37.070> I<00:03:37.250> think<00:03:37.730> this

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
the cooler tones of the s4 I think this

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.120 
the cooler tones of the s4 I think this
would<00:03:38.030> depend<00:03:38.450> on<00:03:38.750> personal<00:03:39.320> preference<00:03:39.769> but

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
would depend on personal preference but

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.310 
would depend on personal preference but
quite<00:03:40.970> similar<00:03:41.329> in<00:03:41.390> terms<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.780> detail<00:03:41.989> and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
quite similar in terms of detail and

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.880 
quite similar in terms of detail and
image<00:03:42.470> quality

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
image quality

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.340

brilliant<00:03:56.209> job<00:03:56.390> in<00:03:56.690> terms<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.079> the<00:03:57.170> detail

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
brilliant job in terms of the detail

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.130 
brilliant job in terms of the detail
also<00:03:58.100> like<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.519> depth<00:03:58.760> of<00:03:58.910> field<00:03:59.180> focused<00:03:59.930> in

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
also like the depth of field focused in

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.319 
also like the depth of field focused in
on<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.709> chicken<00:04:01.100> now<00:04:01.370> both<00:04:01.519> of<00:04:01.549> these<00:04:01.760> was<00:04:02.060> set

on auto white balance so if you look at

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.160 
on auto white balance so if you look at
the<00:04:04.010> plate<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.549> can<00:04:04.850> see<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.090> s4<00:04:05.480> is<00:04:05.690> doing<00:04:06.049> a

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
much better job in terms of the auto

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.610 
much better job in terms of the auto
white<00:04:08.000> balance<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.329> you've<00:04:08.570> got<00:04:08.810> more<00:04:09.320> of<00:04:09.500> an

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.640

that<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.459> Lumia<00:04:19.789> 95<00:04:20.329> is<00:04:20.570> doing<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.200> better<00:04:21.349> job

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
that the Lumia 95 is doing a better job

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.250 
that the Lumia 95 is doing a better job
of<00:04:21.799> low-light<00:04:22.400> as<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:23.150> was<00:04:23.270> doing<00:04:23.570> with<00:04:23.900> the

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.390 
accurate color tones now the Lumia 95 I
was<00:04:50.719> expecting<00:04:51.199> it<00:04:51.319> to<00:04:51.349> do<00:04:51.650> better<00:04:51.979> because

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
was expecting it to do better because

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.089 
was expecting it to do better because
it's<00:04:52.580> got<00:04:52.729> a<00:04:52.759> dual<00:04:53.030> LED<00:04:53.449> flash<00:04:53.479> but<00:04:54.439> very

it's got a dual LED flash but very

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.010 
it's got a dual LED flash but very
yellowy<00:04:55.520> tint<00:04:55.969> there<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.449> it's<00:04:56.569> looking

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
yellowy tint there and it's looking

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.659 
yellowy tint there and it's looking
quite<00:04:57.139> muggy<00:04:57.409> so<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:57.680> don't<00:04:57.979> like<00:04:58.189> that<00:04:58.400> to

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
quite muggy so I don't like that to

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.550 
quite muggy so I don't like that to
summarize<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.300> would<00:04:59.509> say<00:04:59.659> in<00:04:59.750> good<00:04:59.960> light<00:05:00.199> the

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
summarize I would say in good light the

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.439 
summarize I would say in good light the
s4<00:05:01.009> does<00:05:01.219> take<00:05:01.490> better<00:05:01.729> images<00:05:02.150> you've<00:05:02.300> got

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
s4 does take better images you've got

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.290 
s4 does take better images you've got
more<00:05:02.629> detail<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:03.289> a<00:05:03.770> better<00:05:03.979> color<00:05:04.310> tones<00:05:04.610> and

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
more detail and a better color tones and

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.029 
more detail and a better color tones and
in<00:05:05.419> terms<00:05:05.599> of<00:05:05.750> video<00:05:06.020> in<00:05:06.169> good<00:05:06.349> light<00:05:06.560> I<00:05:06.740> think

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
in terms of video in good light I think

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.770 
in terms of video in good light I think
they<00:05:07.310> are<00:05:07.430> pretty<00:05:07.729> even<00:05:08.150> both<00:05:08.539> of<00:05:08.569> these

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
they are pretty even both of these

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.409 
they are pretty even both of these
cameras<00:05:09.199> here<00:05:09.560> but<00:05:09.979> in<00:05:10.159> low-light<00:05:10.699> there<00:05:11.270> is

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
cameras here but in low-light there is

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.930 
cameras here but in low-light there is
no<00:05:11.629> doubt<00:05:11.900> that<00:05:12.139> the<00:05:12.259> Lumia<00:05:12.680> is<00:05:12.860> miles<00:05:13.580> better

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
no doubt that the Lumia is miles better

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.930 
no doubt that the Lumia is miles better
especially<00:05:14.479> in<00:05:14.900> video<00:05:15.020> as<00:05:15.379> you<00:05:15.979> saw<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.580> Lumia

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
especially in video as you saw the Lumia

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.240 
especially in video as you saw the Lumia
does<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.330> great<00:05:17.719> job<00:05:17.779> in<00:05:18.229> low-light<00:05:18.800> so<00:05:19.039> if<00:05:19.159> you

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
does a great job in low-light so if you

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.339 
does a great job in low-light so if you
are<00:05:19.370> looking<00:05:19.639> for<00:05:19.819> a<00:05:19.849> low-light<00:05:20.300> shooter<00:05:20.750> then

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
are looking for a low-light shooter then

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.159 
are looking for a low-light shooter then
your<00:05:21.560> Lumia<00:05:21.860> 95<00:05:22.460> is<00:05:22.699> a<00:05:23.090> great<00:05:23.360> option<00:05:23.599> in<00:05:24.110> terms

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
your Lumia 95 is a great option in terms

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.499 
your Lumia 95 is a great option in terms
of<00:05:24.439> the<00:05:24.560> front-facing<00:05:25.009> cameras<00:05:25.490> at<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:25.759> s4

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
of the front-facing cameras at the s4

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.899 
of the front-facing cameras at the s4
definitely<00:05:27.020> better<00:05:27.229> I<00:05:27.379> would<00:05:27.560> say<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:28.400> Lumia

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
definitely better I would say the Lumia

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.670 
definitely better I would say the Lumia
just<00:05:29.150> did<00:05:29.270> a<00:05:29.300> very<00:05:29.629> very<00:05:29.870> bad<00:05:30.080> job<00:05:30.409> any

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
just did a very very bad job any

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.619 
just did a very very bad job any
although<00:05:31.099> the<00:05:31.310> rear-facing<00:05:31.639> camera<00:05:32.180> on<00:05:32.389> the

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
although the rear-facing camera on the

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.499 
although the rear-facing camera on the
Lumia<00:05:33.229> 95<00:05:33.830> is<00:05:34.129> pretty<00:05:34.699> good<00:05:34.879> the<00:05:35.060> front-facing

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
Lumia 95 is pretty good the front-facing

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:37.629 
Lumia 95 is pretty good the front-facing
camera<00:05:36.050> was<00:05:36.229> a<00:05:36.379> very<00:05:36.680> very<00:05:36.919> disappointing<00:05:37.550> in

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
camera was a very very disappointing in

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.360 
camera was a very very disappointing in
my<00:05:37.759> opinion<00:05:38.120> I<00:05:38.300> also<00:05:38.779> preferred<00:05:39.229> the<00:05:39.650> audio<00:05:40.129> of

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
my opinion I also preferred the audio of

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.540 
my opinion I also preferred the audio of
the<00:05:41.000> s4<00:05:41.690> that's<00:05:42.199> mainly<00:05:42.440> because<00:05:42.650> it's<00:05:43.219> got

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
the s4 that's mainly because it's got

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.029 
the s4 that's mainly because it's got
stereo<00:05:43.909> sound<00:05:44.270> compared<00:05:44.839> to<00:05:44.930> mono<00:05:45.440> sound<00:05:45.740> on

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
stereo sound compared to mono sound on

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.409 
stereo sound compared to mono sound on
the<00:05:46.279> Lumia<00:05:46.580> 925

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
the Lumia 925

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.659 
the Lumia 925
so<00:05:47.810> the<00:05:47.960> alumini<00:05:48.349> 95<00:05:48.680> only<00:05:48.919> has<00:05:49.099> a<00:05:49.129> single

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
so the alumini 95 only has a single

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.640 
so the alumini 95 only has a single
channel<00:05:49.940> of<00:05:50.060> audio<00:05:50.150> whereas<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.080> s4<00:05:51.440> has<00:05:51.589> a

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
channel of audio whereas the s4 has a

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.829 
channel of audio whereas the s4 has a
dual<00:05:52.009> channels<00:05:52.400> of<00:05:52.610> audio<00:05:53.089> that's<00:05:53.629> what<00:05:53.810> I

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:53.839 
dual channels of audio that's what I

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.230 
dual channels of audio that's what I
think<00:05:54.080> anyway<00:05:54.169> what<00:05:54.830> do<00:05:55.009> you<00:05:55.099> think<00:05:55.460> do<00:05:56.029> drop
