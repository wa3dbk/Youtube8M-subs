as you can tell on this side I'm wearing

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.880 
as you can tell on this side I'm wearing
the<00:02:17.489> older<00:02:17.940> formula<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:19.080> lighter<00:02:19.709> and

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
the older formula and it's lighter and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.390 
the older formula and it's lighter and
it<00:02:20.280> has<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.519> bit<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.720> pinky<00:02:22.260> or<00:02:22.379> shade<00:02:22.860> than

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
it has a bit of a pinky or shade than

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.630 
it has a bit of a pinky or shade than
the<00:02:23.580> older<00:02:23.940> one<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.420> mean<00:02:25.319> then<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.709> newer<00:02:25.920> one

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.270 

don't<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:32.819> if<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.299> tell<00:02:33.569> but<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.950> sure

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
don't know if you can tell but I sure

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.270 
don't know if you can tell but I sure
can<00:02:35.580> unfortunately<00:02:36.140> although<00:02:37.140> they<00:02:37.680> are<00:02:37.860> very

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
can unfortunately although they are very

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.789 
can unfortunately although they are very
similar<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.819> color<00:02:39.269> when<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.260> apply<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.560> on

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
similar in color when you apply it on

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.430 
similar in color when you apply it on
your<00:02:40.830> lips<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.430> still<00:02:41.879> like<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.810> original

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
your lips I still like the original

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.650 
your lips I still like the original
shade<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> lot<00:02:44.160> better<00:02:44.549> just<00:02:45.180> because<00:02:45.329> it<00:02:45.630> looks

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
shade a lot better just because it looks

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.150 
shade a lot better just because it looks
a<00:02:46.140> lot<00:02:46.349> more<00:02:46.650> natural<00:02:47.239> it's<00:02:48.239> not<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.860> deep<00:02:49.860> as

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
a lot more natural it's not as deep as

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.000 
a lot more natural it's not as deep as
this<00:02:50.459> one<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.120> just<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:52.230> loved<00:02:52.739> this

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
this one and I just I just loved this

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.270 
this one and I just I just loved this
color<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.910> also<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> swatch<00:02:55.140> on<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:56.130> back

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
color I also have a swatch on the back

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.729 
color I also have a swatch on the back
of<00:02:56.430> my<00:02:56.549> hand<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:57.329> is<00:02:57.629> the<00:02:57.660> older<00:02:58.110> formula

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
of my hand this is the older formula

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.390 
of my hand this is the older formula
versus<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.849> one<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.349> a<00:03:01.379> newer<00:03:01.680> formula

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
versus this one this is a newer formula

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.619 
versus this one this is a newer formula
so<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.769> guess<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:05.400> newer<00:03:05.610> formulas<00:03:06.360> are

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
so I guess the newer formulas are

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.190 
so I guess the newer formulas are
getting<00:03:06.989> darker<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:08.340> Lolita<00:03:08.989> but<00:03:09.989> some

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
getting darker like Lolita but some

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.619 
getting darker like Lolita but some
people<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.769> newer<00:03:10.950> formula<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.849> Lolita

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
people like the newer formula of Lolita

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.410 
people like the newer formula of Lolita
so<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.019> guess<00:03:13.290> it's<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.739> kind<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.610> win-win<00:03:14.879> but

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
so I guess it's a kind of a win-win but

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.710 
so I guess it's a kind of a win-win but
I<00:03:15.450> wish<00:03:15.690> they<00:03:15.930> kept<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.980> original<00:03:17.450> color<00:03:18.450> is

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
I wish they kept the original color is

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.539 
I wish they kept the original color is
double-dare<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.769> described<00:03:20.280> as<00:03:20.519> a

from<00:04:26.500> what<00:04:26.710> I've<00:04:26.860> noticed<00:04:27.130> with<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.670> new

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
from what I've noticed with the new

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.870 
from what I've noticed with the new
formula<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.720> does<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.860> doesn't<00:04:30.220> go<00:04:30.340> on<00:04:30.580> as

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
formula it does it doesn't go on as

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.100 
formula it does it doesn't go on as
opaque<00:04:31.420> as<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.840> older<00:04:32.200> formula<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.850> you

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
opaque as the older formula so you

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.540 
opaque as the older formula so you
sometimes<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.410> have<00:04:35.560> to<00:04:35.680> do<00:04:35.830> more<00:04:36.040> than<00:04:36.250> one

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
sometimes you have to do more than one

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.270 
sometimes you have to do more than one
swipe<00:04:36.970> on<00:04:37.330> your<00:04:37.630> lips<00:04:37.900> so<00:04:38.230> that's<00:04:38.710> about<00:04:38.980> all<00:04:39.160> I

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
could say about these new colors the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.680 
could say about these new colors the
smell<00:04:43.140> is<00:04:44.140> just<00:04:44.730> there's<00:04:45.730> not<00:04:45.970> really<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.330> scent
