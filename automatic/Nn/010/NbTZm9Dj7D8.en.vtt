00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.140
 basic 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.350
 as you can see are these 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.190
 and the creators the hatcheries approach 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.190
 all thus decorate 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.979
 after the mating of dragons 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.979
 hybrids 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.280
 and the information goes 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.709
 that more of the farms 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.350
 about the dragons against the behavior of 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.430
 each as the dragon can see the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.120
 voice is that you love us 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.120
 to see what else 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.709
 There is also something else about gold 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.930
 as once more advice on the 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.080
 resources that I want you most interested in 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.670
 this page was this the tournaments 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.720
 we have already know that they are the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.430
 tournaments in dragon city 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.670
 and it's good that on this page you 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.460
 emit the weaknesses of the dragons 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.740
 for example here we go down and here it says 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.010
 the weaknesses good the elements 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.010
 opposites 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.990
 fire with soft ice with electricity 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.390
 Earth with metal arrived with darkness 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.170
 what they do from this page is this 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.210
 table that you see here 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.540
 what good in this table tells you 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.850
 the weaknesses of each dragon for 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.550
 example if I attack 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.640
 to a metal dragon with an attack of 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.370
 I'm not going to lower anything because in 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.040
 zero as you can see the table 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.760
 the green boxes that you can see are 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.980
 the critical damages the red boxes are 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.040
 attacks that have no effect that 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.050
 they practically do not lose any life and 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.410
 the attacks with the number one color 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.620
 normal attacks are yellow and so 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.300
 Well what is this table was this what 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.900
