00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.450
 and top welcome you after a little 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.710
 vacation drive or it turned out small 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.540
 and in fact usually before the season 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.689
 football players are accustomed to relax at least 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.490
 month on vacation flew like one 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.009
 day as if just finished yesterday 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.830
 already met at the meeting again 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.510
 nice passed everyone glad to see 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.180
 Well, unfortunately, of course, the holiday is out 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.739
 small as he spent but started 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.710
 a few days was in moscow and then 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.930
 sat down in cyprus with friends and then again 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.960
 came on standing here for three days stayed at 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.480
 everything quickly flew in general for 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.489
 Russian footballer started the season in 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.230
 July is probably far from 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.420
 well-established fact 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.789
 is it possible to change the head now 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.090
 it is already 8 spring tribute it is all the same 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.730
 as before as well as between 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.949
 Circles break was small therefore 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.660
 not yet rebuilt yes I think and not 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.660
 rebuild as before and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.570
 it just remains the game changes circles 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.460
 also the same has already happened 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.799
 psychological move away from unsuccessful 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.630
 ending of the season yes and now at first 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.810
 5 days was hard, too, how hard 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.979
 rested and here is such a literally 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.960
 a week after the last game in 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.500
 more or less moved away well gone and fine and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.020
 already better than an hour he feels he 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.610
 turned a whole number of football players and here with 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.470
 Andrei Voronin you during training 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.350
 communicated so warmly how they accepted him 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.360
 myself glad his return but I'm glad 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.619
 the return was well received because 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:48.780
 this is a great player by nature leader i 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.299
 I think he will help the team rumors 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.790
 About Arthur Yusupova I will respond to them 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.070
 somehow this bar so you know but 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.140
 yes i was in cyprus 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.509
 did not go news wanted unlike 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.430
 football has not read anything they do not 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.549
 friends began to write only pam lazy 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.549
 did not write a draft Spartak my perros about 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:13.200
 hear this and even comment on the meaning 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:16.890
 I think there is no that no specifics and not 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.930
 would go there first 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.660
 training immediately so for half an hour on 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.050
 a crisis 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.600
 looking honestly thought it would be worse yet 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.970
 it moves very well and so it seems 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.850
 some technique still remains 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.500
 therefore and still very good atmosphere 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.410
 we are happy to see each other 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.150
 it may therefore be even easier 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.080
 perceived training 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.660
 Switzerland go whether there 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.330
 someday, and if the trip does not expect that 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.090
 no increase but the trip is necessary 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.530
 to get back in shape and approach the season 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.720
 already in good condition 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.850
 Hopefully the season will not start as 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.850
 past these great luck
