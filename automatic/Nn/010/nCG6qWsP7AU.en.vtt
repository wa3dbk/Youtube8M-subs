can open sample data file to get get you

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.990 
can open sample data file to get get you
familiar<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.309> open<00:00:47.700> existing

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
familiar with it you can open existing

file<00:00:48.329> view<00:00:48.539> have<00:00:48.719> or<00:00:48.989> start<00:00:49.440> from<00:00:49.559> scratch<00:00:49.770> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
file view have or start from scratch so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.439 
file view have or start from scratch so
i<00:00:50.399> already<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:52.710> sample<00:00:53.160> data<00:00:53.910> open

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
i already have the sample data open

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.569 
i already have the sample data open
you'll<00:00:54.780> notice<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.199> has<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.379> very<00:00:55.620> similar<00:00:55.980> Mac

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you'll notice it has a very similar Mac

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.650 
you'll notice it has a very similar Mac
look<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.480> most<00:00:58.579> software<00:00:59.579> has<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.120> guess<00:01:00.180> it's

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
look that most software has I guess it's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.930 
look that most software has I guess it's
I<00:01:00.989> guess<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.710> should<00:01:01.890> give<00:01:01.980> credit<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.370> itunes

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
I guess we should give credit to itunes

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.939 
I guess we should give credit to itunes
for<00:01:03.180> giving<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:04.890> your

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
for giving this so you get all your

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.440 
for giving this so you get all your
stuff<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> left<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> it's<00:01:06.150> pretty<00:01:06.299> much

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
stuff on the left and it's pretty much

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.210 
stuff on the left and it's pretty much
working<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.930> context<00:01:07.530> project<00:01:07.950> tax

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
working out in the context project tax

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.780 
working out in the context project tax

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
documents and then relationship context

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
documents and then relationship context
so<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.119> break<00:01:15.390> things<00:01:15.659> down<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:15.900> other

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
so you can break things down into other

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.370 
so you can break things down into other
things<00:01:17.330> you're<00:01:18.330> different<00:01:18.750> categories<00:01:19.290> in

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
things you're different categories in

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.080 
things you're different categories in
your<00:01:19.560> address<00:01:19.710> book<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.430> smart<00:01:20.850> groups

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
your address book and then smart groups

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.960 
your address book and then smart groups
but<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.259> one<00:01:22.470> area<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.920> want<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> focus<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.640> here

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
but the one area I want to focus on here

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.499 
but the one area I want to focus on here
for<00:01:24.210> us<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.990> projects<00:01:25.799> tab<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.939> think<00:01:27.420> this

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
for us is this projects tab I think this

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.789 
for us is this projects tab I think this
is<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> most<00:01:27.810> interesting<00:01:28.439> thing<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
is the most interesting thing and

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.649 
is the most interesting thing and
probably<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.220> best<00:01:29.490> feature<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
probably the best feature that it has in

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.300 
probably the best feature that it has in
the<00:01:30.689> app<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.530> other<00:01:31.650> ones<00:01:31.860> are<00:01:31.979> sort<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.250> like

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the app the other ones are sort of like

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
the app the other ones are sort of like
you<00:01:32.579> already<00:01:32.759> know<00:01:33.030> all<00:01:33.210> about<00:01:33.500> these<00:01:34.500> but

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
you already know all about these but

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.990 
you already know all about these but
this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> where<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.460> brings<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.790> all<00:01:35.850> together

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
this is where it brings it all together

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.630 
this is where it brings it all together
so<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:36.869> happens<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.430> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
so what happens here is you have this is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.170 
so what happens here is you have this is
a<00:01:38.670> project<00:01:38.970> called<00:01:39.500> Morris<00:01:40.500> okay<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:42.000> has

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
a project called Morris okay it's it has

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.940 
a project called Morris okay it's it has
a<00:01:42.210> start<00:01:42.600> date<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:42.899> end<00:01:43.200> date<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:43.710> got<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
a start date and end date it's got a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.429 
a start date and end date it's got a
three-level<00:01:44.610> priority<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:46.049> would<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.259> where

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
three-level priority this would be where

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.929 
three-level priority this would be where
the<00:01:46.560> objectives<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.130> descriptions<00:01:47.670> these

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the objectives and descriptions these

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.460 
the objectives and descriptions these
are<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.210> context<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.780> are<00:01:48.930> associated<00:01:49.200> with

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
are the context that are associated with

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.289 
are the context that are associated with
the<00:01:49.619> project<00:01:49.799> these<00:01:50.549> are<00:01:50.759> different<00:01:50.909> events

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the project these are different events

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.929 
the project these are different events
that<00:01:51.390> would<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.689> bookmarks<00:01:52.850> associated<00:01:53.850> with

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
that would be bookmarks associated with

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.149 
that would be bookmarks associated with
the<00:01:54.060> task<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:54.920> different<00:01:55.920> things<00:01:56.070> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the task and then different things you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.010 
the task and then different things you
need<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.640> get<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> test<00:01:57.119> done<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.630> some

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
need to do to get the test done and some

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.709 
need to do to get the test done and some
notes<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.729> it's<00:01:59.729> also<00:01:59.939> broken<00:02:00.299> down<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.570> the
