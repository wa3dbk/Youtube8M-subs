00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.250
 in panama opened the franchise fire of 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.379
 brazil a rodicio style steakhouse 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.179
 with select cuts of meat that are 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.580
 presented at the table by a parade of 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.040
 gauchos trained to perform these 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.839
 cuts are all carefully 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.440
 selected and simmered 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.690
 with the unique touch that gives the coal 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.420
 in addition to his cuts angus chicken lamb 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.510
 pork and sausages has a bar 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.860
 with a variety of salads but 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.660
 what makes Brazil fail is the 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.820
 ideal place to share with family and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.530
 with friends is that if you are intolerant to 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.810
 gluten you do not have to deprive yourself of coming and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.420
 enjoy everything that is here 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.670
 kitchen is made from cassava and there is no 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.050
 possibility of cross contamination and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.220
 so we could verify it when 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.050
 we visited the restaurant 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.240
 well I am now in the kitchen of 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.640
 fire brasil i am with july which is the 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.770
 Chef, he is going to talk to us a little bit about 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.990
 the ingredients that are used and for 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.850
 what are gluten free july tell us 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.230
 talk a little about the ingredients 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.810
 what are you going to use for example for this 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.400
 dish and describes not a little the process or 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.400
 be ready here what we have the base 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.770
 Main are whole milk eggs 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.590
 important cold mind that reduces the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.440
 gluten programming since it is a 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.770
 protein that develops in environments 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.260
 warm and dry in humidity here 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.619
 fully use what flour 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.560
 Cassava better known as 100% flour 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:30.869
 barley wheat-free yucca 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.659
 cereals that reproduce this protein 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.250
 simply 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.310
 the eggs 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.470
 then we give him the milk we throw him a 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.410
 pinch of salt the pinch of salt for what 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.840
 serves reduces the percentage and the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.690
 reproduction of the gluten we watch say 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.440
 that is like a free hand 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.860
 exactly would be the exact word 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.960
 then debated in an 80 what we do 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.100
 the following the bananas that we have 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.480
 here pure fresh quality chosen 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.480
 What we do is overflow the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.310
 now we use in this simple way 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.430
 and we add 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.660
 and that would be practically what is the 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.880
 garrison process all 100% 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.680
 gluten free good thanks July already 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.200
 see how the food is prepared here 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.250
 all in a super healthy way especially 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.530
 for those people who are 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.380
 gluten intolerant and that can therefore 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.610
 detect just eat something or give one 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.530
 cross contamination and that 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.300
 effectively being used not already 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.610
 they know that here in fire or brazil has 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.980
 one option and July is responsible for 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.930
 that there is no contamination with gluten in 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.690
