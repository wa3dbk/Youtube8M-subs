can plant food water and even power

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
can plant food water and even power
generators<00:01:15.049> alright<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.590> generators

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
generators alright so the generators

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.460 
generators alright so the generators
will<00:01:17.670> power<00:01:17.909> things<00:01:18.540> through<00:01:18.900> switches<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
will power things through switches that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.130 
will power things through switches that
require<00:01:20.040> power<00:01:20.280> lights<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.270> other<00:01:21.420> items<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
require power lights and other items and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.620 
require power lights and other items and
then<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.740> run<00:01:22.950> wires<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.939> connect<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:24.509> all

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
then you run wires that connect them all

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.360 
then you run wires that connect them all
and<00:01:24.869> again<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.340> works

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
and again it just works

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.310 
and again it just works
you<00:01:28.910> can<00:01:29.030> also<00:01:29.150> build<00:01:29.450> your<00:01:29.660> own<00:01:29.690> terminals

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
you can also build your own terminals

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.920 
you can also build your own terminals
that<00:01:30.950> hook<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.520> this<00:01:31.670> power<00:01:32.180> grid<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.810> then

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
that hook to this power grid and then

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.560 
that hook to this power grid and then
you<00:01:33.020> could<00:01:33.140> control<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.670> various<00:01:35.120> things<00:01:35.420> and

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
you could control the various things and

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.620 
you could control the various things and
tweak<00:01:35.870> them<00:01:36.140> oh<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.940> power<00:01:38.150> lines<00:01:38.480> are

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
tweak them oh that the power lines are

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.720 
tweak them oh that the power lines are
connected<00:01:38.750> to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:54.720 

this<00:01:43.360> includes<00:01:43.720> things<00:01:43.990> like<00:01:44.140> turrets

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.720 

because<00:01:55.730> you<00:01:55.850> do<00:01:56.000> want<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.300> build<00:01:56.480> defenses

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
because you do want to build defenses

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.010 
because you do want to build defenses
because<00:01:58.730> your<00:01:58.910> settlements<00:01:59.390> can<00:01:59.690> and<00:01:59.900> will

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
because your settlements can and will

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:15.199 
because your settlements can and will
get<00:02:00.200> attacked<00:02:00.470> by<00:02:00.800> Raiders

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.790
