00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.230
 download once they download it 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.110
 they will be left with a folder like 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.350
 this one we are going to give right click extract 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.350

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.590
 and we wait for it to be extracted 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:06.890
 the pack weighs 171 megabytes 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.960
 it's a bit heavy but it contains 30 of 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.159
 the best skins you can have for 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.619

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.850
 science and to download as you already know 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.280
 the downloads will be through equal 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.859
 although it is my personal server where 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.359
 I keep all my files and I would not be 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:26.520
 going up mediafire entertaining selection 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.959
 light files because media was 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.349
 arrested putting a little hard on the 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:34.079
 policies and has been erasing many 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:36.030
 files so when they are archives of 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.159
 zeros I'll leave them in mediafire but in 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.349
 wuala because I know via download 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.819
 direct good once extracted them 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:44.250
 this folder with the name of 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.489
 skins windows media player and they will find 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.219
 these 30 folders that contain all 

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:54.030
 the skins as you see here let's go in and 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:56.729
 bring the file to install a notebook 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.590
 notes with a little information and a 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.010
 image to see the preview of 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.140
 From d 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.170
 of that mask that we're going to install or 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.090
 that skin then how are we going to install 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.850
 good but they do not choose the one that you more 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.410
 Like it, I'm going to choose this one 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.920
 Transformers simply have to give 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.920
 Double click 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.710
 is downloading let's give it here now 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.350
 let's go up here of a few medium 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.350
 let's give right click see 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.240
 installed and we're going to choose the one that I'm going to 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.960
 choose the one of transformers 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.960
 we must double click 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.020
 and that's it now if they want to go back 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.379
 I think it's in this part if it's there 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:58.189
 in some they change let's see click 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:02.030
 right see mask selector and 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:05.269
 as long as standard is in that it is of the most 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.750
 searched for that language invader has a good 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.030
 effects 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.200
 also here is leaving the video 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.000
 so they can see what they are doing 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.760
 downloading and what are each of the 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.760
 packs but in the sounds and everything 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.350
 i 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:35.620
 now I want to clarify something 2 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.620
 and our little noise 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.470
 the skins were uploaded by a user 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.819
 taringa and I from there is that we do not 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.640
 download but I had uploaded them 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.769
 individually and I wanted to put them together 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.170
 all in one pack because individually 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.730
 they were erasing some then I 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.200
 what I did was I took them all down and 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.890
 I put in a pack to be 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.430
 downloaded then let's see for 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.430
 to return 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.980
 here 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.450
 then so each one each of the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.500
 masks that you want 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.030
 that's what to do by default 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.030
 there are some very good 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.640
 but it will not be in sound effects 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.340
 others do not and well then I will be 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.310
 leaving that pac there are next download 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.730
 and a small video here of the user of 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.730
 taringa 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.880
 that uploaded the video and I downloaded them from 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.860
 ok and I the successes in a pack because 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.699
 I was erasing some 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.659
