okay so if you're in 3d I don't imagine
that<00:00:09.590> you<00:00:09.710> actually<00:00:09.889> even<00:00:10.190> get<00:00:10.430> to<00:00:10.549> go<00:00:10.670> to

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
that you actually even get to go to

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.240 
that you actually even get to go to
enter<00:00:11.000> earth<00:00:11.440> that's<00:00:12.440> why<00:00:12.590> I'm<00:00:12.740> saying<00:00:12.950> get

enter earth that's why I'm saying get
spiritual<00:00:13.910> real<00:00:14.330> fast<00:00:14.779> okay<00:00:16.539> if<00:00:17.539> you<00:00:17.660> want<00:00:17.779> to

in<00:00:20.840> these<00:00:21.050> bodies<00:00:22.090> we're<00:00:23.090> doing<00:00:23.420> a<00:00:23.539> extreme

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
in these bodies we're doing a extreme

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.740 
in these bodies we're doing a extreme
reversal<00:00:24.590> now<00:00:24.620> of<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:26.090> game<00:00:26.300> now<00:00:26.450> that<00:00:26.600> we're

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
reversal now of the game now that we're

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.820 
reversal now of the game now that we're
playing<00:00:28.119> we're<00:00:29.119> all<00:00:29.240> now<00:00:29.480> able<00:00:30.289> to<00:00:30.320> imagine

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
playing we're all now able to imagine

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:37.299 
playing we're all now able to imagine
using<00:00:31.430> our<00:00:31.970> minds<00:00:32.719> using<00:00:33.590> our<00:00:34.300> thoughts<00:00:36.309> using

going<00:00:43.730> into<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.060> light<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:45.370> as<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:47.440> result

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
going into the light and as a result

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.010 
going into the light and as a result
that<00:00:48.829> allows<00:00:49.309> us<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:49.730> connect<00:00:50.059> with<00:00:50.120> our<00:00:50.420> star

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
that allows us to connect with our star

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.959

family<00:00:51.469> who<00:00:51.590> have<00:00:51.739> millions<00:00:52.130> of<00:00:52.340> ships<00:00:52.670> now

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
family who have millions of ships now

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.720 
family who have millions of ships now
flight<00:00:53.600> all<00:00:53.750> about<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.340> so<00:00:55.340> they<00:00:55.489> can't

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
flight all about and so they can't

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.130 
flight all about and so they can't
Landon<00:00:56.059> help<00:00:56.210> us<00:00:56.360> out<00:00:56.480> right<00:00:56.660> now<00:00:56.809> because

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
Landon help us out right now because

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.830 
Landon help us out right now because
we're<00:00:57.410> still<00:00:57.680> resonating<00:00:58.399> with<00:00:58.840> dance

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
we're still resonating with dance

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.440 
we're still resonating with dance
energies<00:01:00.730> so<00:01:01.730> there's<00:01:01.940> very<00:01:02.149> little<00:01:02.329> that

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
energies so there's very little that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.240 
energies so there's very little that
they<00:01:02.719> can<00:01:02.899> do<00:01:03.079> when<00:01:03.290> you're<00:01:03.410> stewing<00:01:03.770> in<00:01:04.009> your

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
they can do when you're stewing in your

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.840 
they can do when you're stewing in your
stuff<00:01:04.699> folks<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:06.020> we've<00:01:06.259> got<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.680> look<00:01:08.619> upwards

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
stuff folks so we've got to look upwards

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.070 
stuff folks so we've got to look upwards
from<00:01:10.850> whence<00:01:11.090> we<00:01:11.270> came<00:01:11.680> okay<00:01:12.680> this<00:01:13.040> is<00:01:13.190> where

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
from whence we came okay this is where

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.680 
from whence we came okay this is where
the<00:01:15.080> path<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:16.610> go<00:01:16.790> home<00:01:16.820> from<00:01:17.360> where<00:01:17.540> we

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
the path is to go home from where we

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.300 
the path is to go home from where we
come<00:01:17.900> from<00:01:17.930> before<00:01:18.530> we<00:01:18.680> came<00:01:18.950> into<00:01:19.130> these

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
come from before we came into these

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.149 
come from before we came into these
bodies<00:01:20.049> we<00:01:21.049> rise<00:01:21.320> in<00:01:21.619> our<00:01:22.250> frequencies<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:24.159> we

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
bodies we rise in our frequencies and we

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.859 
bodies we rise in our frequencies and we
may<00:01:25.310> choose<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.640> go<00:01:25.909> through<00:01:26.299> a<00:01:26.360> quantum<00:01:26.840> shift

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
may choose to go through a quantum shift

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:34.630 
may choose to go through a quantum shift
or<00:01:27.470> we<00:01:28.159> will<00:01:28.340> die<00:01:29.950> okay<00:01:31.930> so<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:34.130> whole<00:01:34.250> Niburu

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
or we will die okay so the whole Niburu

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.350 
or we will die okay so the whole Niburu
thing<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.270> related<00:01:35.869> part<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.770> Ascension

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.999 

so<00:01:41.360> niburu<00:01:41.750> is<00:01:41.960> actually<00:01:42.470> going<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:42.710> be<00:01:42.770> one<00:01:42.979> of

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
so niburu is actually going to be one of

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.480 
so niburu is actually going to be one of
the<00:01:43.100> main<00:01:43.280> catalyst<00:01:43.820> for<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.270> mass<00:01:44.689> ascension

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
the main catalyst for the mass ascension

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.859 
the main catalyst for the mass ascension
so<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.580> cannot<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:47.000> can<00:01:47.119> imagine<00:01:47.330> if<00:01:47.659> later

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
so you cannot you can imagine if later

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.870 
so you cannot you can imagine if later
on<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.320> year<00:01:48.430> okay<00:01:50.590> we've<00:01:51.590> got<00:01:51.890> all<00:01:52.729> of<00:01:52.790> a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.070 
house on hire lad resonates strongly the
idea<00:02:40.580> of<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.700> pit<00:02:40.910> house<00:02:41.060> in<00:02:41.330> lower<00:02:41.720> land

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
idea of the pit house in lower land

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.440 
idea of the pit house in lower land
doesn't<00:02:42.650> really<00:02:42.980> resonate<00:02:43.250> with<00:02:43.790> me<00:02:44.120> at<00:02:44.270> all

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
doesn't really resonate with me at all

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.540 
doesn't really resonate with me at all
so<00:02:44.810> if<00:02:45.590> you're<00:02:45.770> going<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.950> go<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.250> pit<00:02:46.400> house

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
so if you're going to go the pit house

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.540 
so if you're going to go the pit house
way<00:02:46.870> pretty<00:02:47.870> much<00:02:48.140> go<00:02:48.620> for<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:48.890> higher<00:02:49.100> as<00:02:49.370> high

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
way pretty much go for a higher as high

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.310 
way pretty much go for a higher as high
as<00:02:49.610> as<00:02:49.820> high<00:02:50.480> as<00:02:50.540> elevation<00:02:50.990> as<00:02:51.260> possible<00:02:53.320> okay

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
as as high as elevation as possible okay

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.010 
as as high as elevation as possible okay
the<00:02:54.830> houseboats<00:02:55.310> are<00:02:55.610> somewhat<00:02:56.600> going<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.930> be

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
the houseboats are somewhat going to be

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.260 
the houseboats are somewhat going to be
more<00:02:57.200> practical<00:02:57.380> if<00:02:57.800> you're<00:02:57.920> an<00:02:58.040> area<00:02:58.340> of<00:02:58.400> low

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
more practical if you're an area of low

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.050 
more practical if you're an area of low
lying<00:02:59.630> areas<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.140> more<00:03:00.880> likelihood<00:03:01.880> of

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
lying areas of more likelihood of

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.640 
lying areas of more likelihood of
flooding<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:02.870> if<00:03:02.959> you're<00:03:03.080> in<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.230> prairies

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
flooding so if you're in the prairies

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.420 
flooding so if you're in the prairies
for<00:03:04.280> example<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:05.170> might<00:03:06.170> want<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.220> start

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
for example you might want to start

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.040 
for example you might want to start
building<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.940> house<00:03:08.150> boat<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.570> maybe<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:11.840> will

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
building a house boat and maybe you will

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.030 
building a house boat and maybe you will
be<00:03:12.440> dry<00:03:12.680> for<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:13.100> next<00:03:13.220> years<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.090> come<00:03:14.500> if<00:03:15.500> we

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
be dry for the next years to come if we

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
be dry for the next years to come if we
even<00:03:16.250> have<00:03:16.459> ears<00:03:16.670> on<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.510> surface<00:03:18.880> we<00:03:19.880> may

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
even have ears on the surface we may

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.330 
even have ears on the surface we may
only<00:03:20.209> actually<00:03:20.990> have<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.470> very<00:03:21.770> short<00:03:22.010> time<00:03:22.070> on

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
only actually have a very short time on

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.900 
only actually have a very short time on
the<00:03:22.400> surface<00:03:22.760> it's<00:03:24.190> going<00:03:25.190> to<00:03:25.220> really<00:03:25.489> depend

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
the surface it's going to really depend

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.860 
the surface it's going to really depend
on<00:03:26.320> what<00:03:27.320> we<00:03:27.769> do<00:03:27.920> as<00:03:28.040> humans<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.880> like<00:03:29.750> I

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
on what we do as humans and and like I

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.960 
on what we do as humans and and like I
said<00:03:29.930> our<00:03:30.380> consciousness<00:03:31.190> is<00:03:31.459> affecting

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
said our consciousness is affecting

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.930 
said our consciousness is affecting
everything<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.800> we're<00:03:33.800> not<00:03:33.950> in<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:34.220> linear<00:03:34.459> time

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
everything so we're not in a linear time

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.280 
everything so we're not in a linear time
here<00:03:35.209> we<00:03:35.390> are<00:03:36.489> in<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.610> dissolving<00:03:38.180> timeline<00:03:39.880> ok

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
here we are in a dissolving timeline ok

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.840 
here we are in a dissolving timeline ok
so<00:03:43.000> give<00:03:44.000> some<00:03:44.209> thought<00:03:44.239> if<00:03:45.230> if<00:03:46.040> this

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
so give some thought if if this

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.250 
so give some thought if if this
resonates<00:03:47.060> with<00:03:47.480> you<00:03:47.600> give<00:03:47.840> some<00:03:48.019> thought<00:03:48.050> as

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
resonates with you give some thought as

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.320 
resonates with you give some thought as
to<00:03:48.530> whether<00:03:48.860> or<00:03:49.010> not<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.190> want<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.430> eat<00:03:49.610> during
