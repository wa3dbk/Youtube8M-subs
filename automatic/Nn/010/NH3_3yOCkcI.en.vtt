the knitted offer it's the same material

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.849 
the knitted offer it's the same material
that<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.020> running<00:01:01.350> shoes<00:01:01.590> from

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
adidas but it's going to be covered with

adidas but it's going to be covered with
that<00:01:04.710> layer<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.280> it's<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> feel<00:01:06.060> the

9<00:02:22.780> us<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.900> second<00:02:29.200> generation<00:02:29.650> of

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
9 us so this is the second generation of

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.460 
9 us so this is the second generation of
the<00:02:29.860> adidas<00:02:30.340> primeknit<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:31.090> can't<00:02:31.810> wait<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.230> try

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
the adidas primeknit I can't wait to try

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.990 
the adidas primeknit I can't wait to try
this<00:02:32.530> out<00:02:32.769> on<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.010> football<00:02:33.190> pitch<00:02:33.370> because

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
this out on the football pitch because

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.539 
this out on the football pitch because
the<00:02:34.480> upper<00:02:34.780> feels<00:02:35.049> super<00:02:35.650> super<00:02:35.950> soft<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.459> I

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
the upper feels super super soft and I

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.280 
the upper feels super super soft and I
guess<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:37.090> will<00:02:37.299> be<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.630> really<00:02:38.049> comfortable

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
guess this will be a really comfortable

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.830 
guess this will be a really comfortable
