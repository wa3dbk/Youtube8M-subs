00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.130 
technology helps the bands
world<00:03:19.879> it<00:03:20.879> does<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.450> mean<00:03:21.599> I<00:03:21.659> believe<00:03:21.989> it

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
world it does I mean I believe it

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.209 
world it does I mean I believe it
expands<00:03:22.799> our<00:03:22.920> game<00:03:23.150> expands<00:03:24.150> our<00:03:24.269> family<00:03:24.719> so

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:25.219 
expands our game expands our family so

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.069 
expands our game expands our family so
it's<00:03:26.219> a<00:03:26.370> plus<00:03:26.639> but<00:03:26.969> I<00:03:27.209> mean<00:03:27.629> it<00:03:27.900> may<00:03:28.019> be

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
it's a plus but I mean it may be

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.589 
it's a plus but I mean it may be
different<00:03:28.499> to<00:03:28.620> some<00:03:28.859> but<00:03:29.189> it's<00:03:29.370> also<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.849> plus

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
different to some but it's also a plus

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:42.170 
different to some but it's also a plus
two<00:03:31.019> others<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.409> know<00:03:31.469> Marcus<00:03:33.019> reputation

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.800 

um<00:03:43.109> I<00:03:43.909> believe<00:03:44.909> I'm<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.090> little<00:03:45.299> too<00:03:45.359> big<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.780> be

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
um I believe I'm a little too big to be

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.470 
um I believe I'm a little too big to be
scrappy<00:03:46.290> but<00:03:46.859> uh<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:47.430> am<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> physical<00:03:48.689> big<00:03:48.840> man<00:03:50.480> I

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
scrappy but uh I am a physical big man I

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.119 
scrappy but uh I am a physical big man I
kind<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.989> took<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.290> down<00:03:54.200> but<00:03:55.200> uh<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.620> mean<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:55.980> am

used to playing one way then when you're
out<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.250> plan<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.670> it's<00:04:36.480> kind<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.900> because

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
out that plan you it's kind of because

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.470

it<00:04:37.500> kind<00:04:37.740> of<00:04:37.800> becomes<00:04:38.040> a<00:04:38.190> habit<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.730> it's<00:04:39.150> now

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
it kind of becomes a habit so it's now

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.670 
it kind of becomes a habit so it's now
it's<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.840> point<00:04:39.990> where<00:04:40.170> you<00:04:40.230> got<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.500> build

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
it's to the point where you got to build

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.040 
it's to the point where you got to build
you<00:04:40.980> gotta<00:04:41.160> make<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.060> into<00:04:42.270> another<00:04:42.360> habit<00:04:42.960> but

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
you gotta make it into another habit but

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.980 
you gotta make it into another habit but
at<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.230> quick<00:04:43.530> ring<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:44.550> it's<00:04:45.390> easy<00:04:45.600> but<00:04:45.810> it's

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
at a quick ring so it's easy but it's

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:56.920 
at a quick ring so it's easy but it's
not<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:55.110> said<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.440> division<00:04:55.980> of<00:04:56.070> flavor<00:04:56.400> Oh

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
not you said the division of flavor Oh

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:09.770 
not you said the division of flavor Oh
labor<00:05:02.030> expect<00:05:03.030> clear<00:05:03.600> division

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.560 

um<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:11.500> mean<00:05:11.860> I<00:05:11.950> believe<00:05:12.550> we<00:05:12.820> played<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.090> similar

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
um I mean I believe we played a similar

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.550 
um I mean I believe we played a similar
role<00:05:14.970> but<00:05:15.970> in<00:05:16.150> different<00:05:16.390> ways<00:05:16.660> of<00:05:16.900> course<00:05:17.410> I'm

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
role but in different ways of course I'm

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.750 
role but in different ways of course I'm
a<00:05:17.620> lot<00:05:17.830> more<00:05:17.890> physical<00:05:18.670> and<00:05:19.170> it<00:05:20.170> is<00:05:20.350> a<00:05:20.730> lot<00:05:21.730> more

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
a lot more physical and it is a lot more

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.210 
a lot more physical and it is a lot more
I'm<00:05:22.210> more<00:05:22.450> physical<00:05:22.930> in<00:05:22.960> below<00:05:23.290> the<00:05:23.350> room<00:05:23.620> a<00:05:23.890> DS

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
I'm more physical in below the room a DS

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.340 
I'm more physical in below the room a DS
a<00:05:24.250> lot<00:05:24.550> more<00:05:25.060> athletic<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:25.720> above<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.170> room

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
a lot more athletic and above the room

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.970 
a lot more athletic and above the room
so<00:05:26.680> I<00:05:27.360> mean<00:05:28.360> it's<00:05:28.480> just<00:05:28.510> about<00:05:28.810> us<00:05:29.020> controlling

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
so I mean it's just about us controlling

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.650 
so I mean it's just about us controlling
the<00:05:30.070> paint<00:05:30.310> controlling<00:05:30.880> the<00:05:30.940> boards<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.540> I'm

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
the paint controlling the boards and I'm

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.870 
the paint controlling the boards and I'm
being<00:05:31.990> a<00:05:32.110> defensive<00:05:32.710> anchor<00:05:32.830> for<00:05:33.250> our<00:05:33.340> team<00:05:33.610> so

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
being a defensive anchor for our team so

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.960 
being a defensive anchor for our team so
that's<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:34.600> biggest<00:05:34.810> thing
