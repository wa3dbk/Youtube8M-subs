00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.109
 cls kuban but still filed them less 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.059
 however it can hardly be considered 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.559
 the main result of today's game 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.139
 the end is still not a game is what 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.269
 the team today shared points like us and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.100
 expected a very stressful difficult 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.510
 It turned out the game with equal chances in 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.020
 In general, we will consider success 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.220
 the fragment and I of the first half who were 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.660
 we have already repeatedly voiced and dismantled and 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.449
 Will probably be dismantled yet 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.579
 repeatedly in different esters on ntv plus 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.809
 moments that Kuban had first 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.149
 half time of course were very close to 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.329
 cool but scored first Spartak rice 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.230
 great played on someone else's face already in 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.500
 penalty and sent the world penalty where and 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.650
 the sword was helped to go turn the kulik and 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.440
 kabbars this way Moscow Spartak 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.150
 came forward in this meeting and after 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.220
 this is really tsiatim and passed to 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.720
 Krasnodar Kuban players still 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.780
 a few moments the team managed 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.810
 create and generally very nice here 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.830
 one of the most beautiful episodes 1 to 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.080
 at least half 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.330
 when the transfer ball for mosquitoes 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.220
 open responded ibrahim balde but 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.909
 throw the ball or Sergey Pischikova not 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.770
 and I could 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.439
 besides, Dmitri Kombarov helped 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.689
 your goalkeeper well, and this is already fragments 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.299
 second half is a miracle goal from araz 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.649
 ozbiliz a long distance 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.850
 turn around and make your way magic 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.579
 absolutely left 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.340
 cool twisted the ball into the top nine and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.310
 Sergey shoals turned out to this blow 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.560
 absolutely not ready that way on 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.289
 fifty-sixth minute the score caught up and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.439
 then the cube no more even 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.179
 came forward quite soon this attack 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.829
 which is also generally on the flank start 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.110
 knocked off a good transfer to the center on 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.479
 cabaret thats timely plays on the cube 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.229
 work easily removed Dmitry Komarov 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.250
 and sends the ball to Kirill kombarov 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.360
 pardon send the ball over your hands 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.299
 hopeless here jumped for the ball 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.579
 Sergey without any corner door 21 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.920
 Kuban comes forward despite the fact that 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.720
 second half of course so many 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.450
 moments at Spartak Gate was not 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.819
 Well, already in the end of the meeting at 8 second 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.579

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.430
 account in this meeting and sets 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.840
