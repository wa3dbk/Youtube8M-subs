will work together to build and that's

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.270 
will work together to build and that's
part<00:00:35.750> of<00:00:35.870> what<00:00:36.110> is<00:00:36.320> great<00:00:36.560> about<00:00:36.590> this<00:00:36.920> rural

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.190 

could<00:00:41.500> say<00:00:41.800> a<00:00:42.040> river<00:00:42.400> runs<00:00:42.850> through<00:00:42.970> it<00:00:43.240> but

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
could say a river runs through it but

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.100 
could say a river runs through it but
it'd<00:00:44.410> be<00:00:44.440> more<00:00:44.950> accurate<00:00:45.490> to<00:00:45.640> say<00:00:45.880> six<00:00:46.720> rivers

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
it'd be more accurate to say six rivers

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.620 
it'd be more accurate to say six rivers
run<00:00:47.440> through<00:00:47.680> it<00:00:47.860> that's<00:00:48.790> why<00:00:49.000> they<00:00:49.180> call<00:00:49.450> this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
run through it that's why they call this

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.440 
run through it that's why they call this
place<00:00:49.750> the<00:00:50.410> birthplace<00:00:50.980> of<00:00:51.010> rivers<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:55.120> are

not just here on this landscape the

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.010 
not just here on this landscape the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
headwaters in this region are so

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.440

critical to water quality to all those
who<00:02:01.690> live<00:02:01.899> downstream<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:03.030> liken<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.179> a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
who live downstream I liken it to a

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.800 
who live downstream I liken it to a
newborn<00:02:05.289> baby<00:02:05.640> parents<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.759> a<00:02:06.819> newborn<00:02:07.240> are

bestowed<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:08.740> responsibility<00:02:09.550> upon<00:02:10.149> them

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
bestowed this responsibility upon them

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.230 
bestowed this responsibility upon them
to<00:02:10.710> care<00:02:11.710> for<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.340> protect<00:02:12.370> this<00:02:12.970> very

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
to care for and protect this very

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.000 
to care for and protect this very
fragile<00:02:13.780> vulnerable<00:02:15.060> being<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:17.470> think<00:02:17.500> of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
fragile vulnerable being and I think of

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.930 
fragile vulnerable being and I think of
headwaters<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.850> way<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:21.370> landscape<00:02:21.819> up

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
headwaters that way the landscape up

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.540 
headwaters that way the landscape up
there<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.770> transplanted<00:02:23.770> from<00:02:23.950> really

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
there is transplanted from really

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.360 
there is transplanted from really
another<00:02:24.760> time<00:02:25.209> in<00:02:25.450> history<00:02:25.860> they<00:02:26.860> talk<00:02:27.100> about

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
another time in history they talk about

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.980 
another time in history they talk about
you<00:02:27.819> know<00:02:27.910> being<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.300> mountains<00:02:28.450> but<00:02:28.810> then

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
you know being in the mountains but then

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.890 
you know being in the mountains but then
here<00:02:29.620> in<00:02:29.800> these<00:02:29.890> little<00:02:30.220> places<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:31.150> seem

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
here in these little places that seem

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.390 
here in these little places that seem
almost<00:02:32.020> more<00:02:32.350> truck

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
almost more truck

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.850 
almost more truck
yeah<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.030> think<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.170> know<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.379> forests

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
yeah I think the you know the forests

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.940 
yeah I think the you know the forests
around<00:02:36.069> this<00:02:36.819> part<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:38.110> Monongahela<00:02:38.620> this

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.459 

I<00:05:45.729> think<00:05:46.389> the<00:05:46.449> coalition<00:05:46.900> that<00:05:46.930> has<00:05:47.050> been

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 
I think the coalition that has been

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.529 
I think the coalition that has been
built<00:05:48.310> around<00:05:48.460> this<00:05:48.729> initiative<00:05:48.969> is<00:05:49.479> really

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
built around this initiative is really

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.040 
built around this initiative is really
making<00:05:49.960> decision-makers<00:05:50.889> pay<00:05:51.430> attention

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
making decision-makers pay attention

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.059 
making decision-makers pay attention
