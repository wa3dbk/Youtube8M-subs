chance to belittle them yet I think I'm

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.100 
chance to belittle them yet I think I'm
doing<00:00:59.870> that<00:01:00.079> afterwards<00:01:00.769> nothing<00:01:01.899> so<00:01:02.899> I<00:01:02.960> can

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
doing that afterwards nothing so I can

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.180 
doing that afterwards nothing so I can
fold<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.800> up<00:01:04.009> yes<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:05.239> heard<00:01:05.540> me<00:01:05.600> right<00:01:05.869> I<00:01:06.470> have

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
put some strings here Justin out in

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.249 
put some strings here Justin out in
order<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.740> make<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:10.729> resemble<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.479> tep<00:01:12.080> a

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
order to make it resemble a tep a

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.389 
order to make it resemble a tep a
property<00:01:12.920> ep<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:13.700> we<00:01:13.790> can<00:01:13.940> close<00:01:14.300> it<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.399> I'm

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
property ep so we can close it and I'm

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.279 
property ep so we can close it and I'm
trying<00:01:16.759> to<00:01:19.179> I'll<00:01:20.179> try<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.600> make<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:21.020> work

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
trying to I'll try to make this work

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.400 
trying to I'll try to make this work
with<00:01:21.920> just<00:01:22.310> by<00:01:22.490> one<00:01:22.759> point<00:01:23.000> using<00:01:23.330> one<00:01:23.600> hand<00:01:23.630> as

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
with just by one point using one hand as

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.330 
with just by one point using one hand as
you<00:01:25.070> can<00:01:25.250> see<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:25.700> one<00:01:26.350> unfolds<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.560> really

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
you can see this one unfolds to a really

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.700 
you can see this one unfolds to a really
big<00:01:28.660> clutter<00:01:29.660> papers<00:01:30.850> but<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:32.090> can<00:01:32.360> also<00:01:32.710> fold

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
big clutter papers but I can also fold

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.820 
big clutter papers but I can also fold
it<00:01:34.009> up<00:01:34.220> nicely<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.820> actually<00:01:38.440> just<00:01:39.440> put<00:01:39.500> this

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
it up nicely and actually just put this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.200 
it up nicely and actually just put this
in<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.270> bigger<00:01:41.270> big<00:01:42.520> envelope<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:43.670> suppose<00:01:44.000> I

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
in a bigger big envelope I suppose I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.320 
in a bigger big envelope I suppose I
mean<00:01:44.360> this<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:44.539> really<00:01:45.020> big<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:47.030> what<00:01:47.300> I

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
mean this is really big so what I

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.040 
mean this is really big so what I
started<00:01:48.020> off<00:01:48.200> with<00:01:48.440> is<00:01:49.509> choosing<00:01:50.509> three

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
started off with is choosing three

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.819 
started off with is choosing three
different<00:01:51.649> kinds<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:52.159> cardstock<00:01:53.030> papers<00:01:53.840> and

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
different kinds of cardstock papers and

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.330 
different kinds of cardstock papers and
I<00:01:54.950> just<00:01:55.189> tried<00:01:55.880> I'd<00:01:56.439> follow<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:57.829> Collard

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
I just tried I'd follow the Collard

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.210 
I just tried I'd follow the Collard
Sheen's<00:01:58.729> in<00:01:59.090> this<00:01:59.619> papers<00:02:00.619> from<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.829> graphic

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
Sheen's in this papers from the graphic

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.109 
Sheen's in this papers from the graphic
45<00:02:01.490> series<00:02:02.439> and<00:02:03.439> then<00:02:03.920> I<00:02:04.040> folded<00:02:04.820> them

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
45 series and then I folded them

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.810 
45 series and then I folded them
diagonally<00:02:05.899> and<00:02:07.479> just<00:02:08.479> adhere<00:02:09.019> them<00:02:09.610> in<00:02:10.610> the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
diagonally and just adhere them in the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.360 
diagonally and just adhere them in the
toes<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.450> typical<00:02:12.260> away<00:02:12.470> but<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.070> can<00:02:13.220> actually

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
toes is typical away but I can actually

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.509 
toes is typical away but I can actually
make<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.299> TP<00:02:15.110> card<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.850> then<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:16.970> put<00:02:17.690> those

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
make that TP card and then I put those

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.000 
make that TP card and then I put those
make<00:02:19.519> them<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:19.820> mate<00:02:20.000> those<00:02:20.209> holes<00:02:20.769> so<00:02:21.769> I<00:02:21.829> could

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
make them it mate those holes so I could

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.210 
make them it mate those holes so I could
actually<00:02:22.510> put<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.750> ribbons<00:02:24.110> here<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.040> i<00:02:25.070> can

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
actually put the ribbons here so i can

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.520 
actually put the ribbons here so i can
find<00:02:25.579> this<00:02:25.760> elephant<00:02:26.360> enclosure<00:02:26.530> mechanism

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
find this elephant enclosure mechanism

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.509 
find this elephant enclosure mechanism
and<00:02:28.299> if<00:02:29.299> i'm<00:02:29.450> just<00:02:29.690> going<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.930> open<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.519> you'll

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
and if i'm just going to open it you'll

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.729 
and if i'm just going to open it you'll
see<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.820> i<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.150> put<00:02:32.420> quite<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.930> lot<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.290> paper

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
see that i have put quite a lot of paper

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.720 
see that i have put quite a lot of paper
here<00:02:34.130> on<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.579> inside<00:02:35.060> because<00:02:36.100> this<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.280> such

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
here on the inside because this is such

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.170 
here on the inside because this is such
a<00:02:37.760> big<00:02:38.180> car<00:02:38.510> dance<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:39.310> mean<00:02:40.310> it's<00:02:40.489> obvious<00:02:41.150> that

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
a big car dance I mean it's obvious that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.870 
a big car dance I mean it's obvious that
it's<00:02:41.570> going<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.810> be<00:02:41.959> pretty<00:02:42.170> heavy<00:02:42.709> so<00:02:43.579> I<00:02:43.609> just

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
it's going to be pretty heavy so I just
