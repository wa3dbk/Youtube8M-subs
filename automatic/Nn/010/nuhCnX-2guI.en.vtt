 Dudar 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:20.999
 be careful cards 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.439
 The club could have laid ambushes along their andritz share 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.130
 The sniper is also active had clearly failed 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.100

 Today we have become known over the predecessor 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.900

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.050
 they wanted to leave his squadron easier track damage 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.270
 however, they only have six of them in the pot and then they have to deal with the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 Lawsuit and what they have 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.440
