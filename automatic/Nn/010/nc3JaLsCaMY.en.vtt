okay<00:00:03.290> this<00:00:04.290> dimbleby<00:00:04.800> is<00:00:04.859> about<00:00:05.160> through

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
okay this dimbleby is about through

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.780 
okay this dimbleby is about through
dovetails<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:07.069> these<00:00:08.069> are<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.400> joints<00:00:08.700> that

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
dovetails and these are the joints that

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.390 
dovetails and these are the joints that
you'd<00:00:08.969> find<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.049> two<00:00:10.320> rear<00:00:10.619> corners<00:00:11.129> of<00:00:11.309> a

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
you'd find on the two rear corners of a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.970 
you'd find on the two rear corners of a
drawer<00:00:11.699> as<00:00:12.170> opposed<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.590> ones<00:00:13.770> at<00:00:13.949> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
drawer as opposed to the ones at the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.210 
drawer as opposed to the ones at the
front<00:00:14.369> which<00:00:14.969> would<00:00:15.240> be<00:00:15.449> half<00:00:16.350> lap<00:00:16.650> dovetails

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
front which would be half lap dovetails

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.519 
front which would be half lap dovetails
basically<00:00:18.150> through<00:00:18.449> dovetails<00:00:18.929> means<00:00:19.259> that

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
basically through dovetails means that

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.859 
basically through dovetails means that
you<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:19.920> see<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.970> dovetail<00:00:21.449> from<00:00:21.660> both

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
you can see the dovetail from both

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.499 
you can see the dovetail from both
elevations<00:00:22.740> as<00:00:22.949> opposed<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> drawer<00:00:24.330> where

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
elevations as opposed to a drawer where

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.620 
elevations as opposed to a drawer where
you<00:00:24.630> can't<00:00:24.900> see<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.289> joint<00:00:25.529> from<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> front

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.709 

is<00:00:30.630> go<00:00:30.929> horizontally<00:00:35.000> those<00:00:36.000> two<00:00:36.270> shoulder

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
is go horizontally those two shoulder

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.990 
is go horizontally those two shoulder
cuts<00:00:36.960> they're<00:00:37.469> only<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.860> shoulder<00:00:38.219> cuts<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
cuts they're only to shoulder cuts on a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.139 
cuts they're only to shoulder cuts on a
dovetail<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.899> rest<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.469> rip<00:00:40.949> cuts<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.910> cross

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
dovetail the rest are rip cuts to cross

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.860 
dovetail the rest are rip cuts to cross
cuts<00:00:42.420> rather<00:00:46.850> find<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.059> using<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> mallet

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
cuts rather find that using the mallet

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.810 
cuts rather find that using the mallet
means<00:00:49.109> that<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:50.120> get<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.300> sharp<00:00:51.719> crisp<00:00:52.820> paired

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
means that I get a sharp crisp paired

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.910 

now<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.670> next<00:01:06.910> step<00:01:07.120> is<00:01:07.570> to<00:01:07.690> know<00:01:08.170> strike

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
now the next step is to know strike

now the next step is to know strike
these<00:01:09.490> tails<00:01:10.480> on<00:01:10.900> to<00:01:11.050> my<00:01:11.200> pin<00:01:11.440> board<00:01:11.680> I<00:01:11.950> like

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
these tails on to my pin board I like

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.240 
these tails on to my pin board I like
the<00:01:13.000> thinness<00:01:13.300> of<00:01:13.510> this<00:01:14.020> because<00:01:14.770> if<00:01:15.040> it's<00:01:15.160> a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
the thinness of this because if it's a

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
the thinness of this because if it's a
very<00:01:15.460> fine<00:01:15.730> pin<00:01:16.150> you<00:01:17.020> can<00:01:17.050> get<00:01:17.410> in<00:01:17.560> there<00:01:17.860> and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
very fine pin you can get in there and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.130 
very fine pin you can get in there and
what<00:01:19.270> I'm<00:01:19.360> looking<00:01:19.690> for<00:01:19.840> now<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.910> for<00:01:21.910> a<00:01:22.300> glow

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
what I'm looking for now is for a glow

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.650 
what I'm looking for now is for a glow
of<00:01:23.320> light<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.800> be<00:01:23.920> seen<00:01:24.420> through<00:01:25.420> these

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
of light to be seen through these

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.320 
of light to be seen through these
shoulder<00:01:26.080> points<00:01:26.500> if<00:01:27.370> I<00:01:27.520> can<00:01:27.700> see<00:01:27.850> no<00:01:28.060> light

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
shoulder points if I can see no light

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.190 
shoulder points if I can see no light
then<00:01:29.110> I'm<00:01:29.230> probably<00:01:29.440> too<00:01:29.860> far<00:01:30.190> this<00:01:30.700> way<00:01:31.050> if<00:01:32.050> I

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
then I'm probably too far this way if I

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.520 
then I'm probably too far this way if I
can<00:01:32.350> see<00:01:32.530> white<00:01:32.770> paper<00:01:33.070> on<00:01:33.250> T<00:01:33.460> phone<00:01:33.640> that<00:01:33.880> way

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
can see white paper on T phone that way

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.130 
can see white paper on T phone that way
just<00:01:35.530> helps<00:01:35.890> me<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.220> see<00:01:36.520> what<00:01:37.240> I'm<00:01:37.450> doing<00:01:37.630> here

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.810 

I<00:01:45.900> will<00:01:46.900> go<00:01:47.020> back<00:01:47.050> to<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.710> piercing<00:01:48.220> so<00:01:48.430> again

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
I will go back to the piercing so again

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.530 
I will go back to the piercing so again
and<00:01:49.090> make<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.110> cut<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:51.520> higher<00:01:51.940> than<00:01:52.300> the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
and make a cut just higher than the

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:01.110 
and make a cut just higher than the
shoulder<00:01:53.500> line<00:01:59.190> these<00:02:00.190> blades<00:02:00.520> are<00:02:00.640> very<00:02:00.850> thin

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
shoulder line these blades are very thin

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.750 
shoulder line these blades are very thin
and<00:02:01.180> they<00:02:01.390> do<00:02:01.450> wander<00:02:01.900> around<00:02:05.760> stop

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
and they do wander around stop

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.870 
and they do wander around stop
occasioning<00:02:07.390> have<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.660> look<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:12.430> find<00:02:12.700> that

occasioning have a look do find that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.390 
occasioning have a look do find that
coping<00:02:13.420> saw<00:02:13.630> blade<00:02:13.930> would<00:02:14.170> be<00:02:14.320> too<00:02:14.590> thick

coping saw blade would be too thick

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.680 
coping saw blade would be too thick
often<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.940> go<00:02:16.120> into<00:02:16.510> your<00:02:16.630> tail<00:02:17.020> cut<00:02:18.690> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
a little on the shoulder just we could

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.679 
a little on the shoulder just we could
measure<00:02:42.579> it<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.000> very<00:02:43.180> little<00:02:43.420> strength

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
measure it but the very little strength

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:51.990 
measure it but the very little strength
in<00:02:44.319> n<00:02:44.920> grind<00:02:45.250> joints<00:02:46.650> anyway<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.780> then<00:02:51.000> metal

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.240 
in n grind joints anyway and then metal
hammers<00:02:52.329> best<00:02:52.629> because<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.829> hear<00:02:54.040> what's

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
hammers best because you can hear what's

going<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.670> with<00:02:54.879> a<00:02:54.909> metal<00:02:55.120> back<00:03:08.609> there<00:03:09.609> you<00:03:09.670> go

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
going on with a metal back there you go

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.199 
going on with a metal back there you go
nothing<00:03:10.209> you<00:03:10.329> do<00:03:10.480> through<00:03:11.200> dovetails<00:03:12.209> okay

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
nothing you do through dovetails okay

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.409 
nothing you do through dovetails okay
