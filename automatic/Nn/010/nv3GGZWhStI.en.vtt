00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
pair of HD 6770 s that i'm going to be

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.110 
pair of HD 6770 s that i'm going to be
reviewing<00:00:31.779> and<00:00:32.379> testing<00:00:32.789> so<00:00:33.789> here's<00:00:34.000> the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
reviewing and testing so here's the

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
first the flexed edition radeon HD 6770

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:48.290 
first the flexed edition radeon HD 6770
to<00:00:39.190> sapphire<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.780> second<00:00:41.500> is<00:00:42.720> the<00:00:47.100> gigabyte

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300

to sapphire and second is the gigabyte
HD<00:00:49.500> 6770<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.550> let's<00:00:51.700> do<00:00:51.790> a<00:00:51.850> quick<00:00:52.000> unboxing<00:00:52.210> on

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
HD 6770 so let's do a quick unboxing on

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.740 
HD 6770 so let's do a quick unboxing on
these<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.320> see<00:00:54.309> what<00:00:54.489> we<00:00:54.579> got<00:00:54.790> both<00:00:55.360> of<00:00:55.600> these

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
these and see what we got both of these

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.850 
these and see what we got both of these
are<00:00:56.500> unique<00:00:56.950> cards<00:00:57.720> very<00:00:58.720> much<00:00:59.050> different

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
are unique cards very much different

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.160 
are unique cards very much different
than<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:01.270> reference<00:01:01.780> product<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.579> gigabyte

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
than the reference product the gigabyte

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.100 
than the reference product the gigabyte
is<00:01:05.170> extremely<00:01:05.950> unique<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:07.360> that<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.990> is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
is extremely unique in that it is

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.090 
is extremely unique in that it is
completely<00:01:09.329> fanless<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.799> we<00:01:11.950> have<00:01:12.159> an<00:01:12.310> HD<00:01:12.850> 6770

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
completely fanless so we have an HD 6770

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.480 
completely fanless so we have an HD 6770
with<00:01:15.100> one<00:01:15.569> DisplayPort<00:01:16.649> one<00:01:17.759> HDMI<00:01:18.759> one<00:01:19.689> DVI

with one DisplayPort one HDMI one DVI
silent<00:01:21.539> fanless<00:01:22.889> quite<00:01:23.889> big<00:01:24.359> not<00:01:25.359> sure<00:01:25.600> that

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:25.779 
silent fanless quite big not sure that

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:28.319 
silent fanless quite big not sure that
that<00:01:25.869> would<00:01:26.020> fit<00:01:26.259> in<00:01:26.409> a<00:01:26.499> home<00:01:26.709> theater<00:01:27.039> PC<00:01:27.459> at

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
that would fit in a home theater PC at

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.539 
that would fit in a home theater PC at
least<00:01:28.509> not<00:01:28.719> a<00:01:28.749> small<00:01:29.049> form<00:01:29.380> factor<00:01:29.549> but

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
least not a small form factor but

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.969 
least not a small form factor but
certainly<00:01:31.090> a<00:01:31.149> unique<00:01:31.380> take<00:01:32.380> on<00:01:32.499> the<00:01:32.619> reference

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
certainly a unique take on the reference

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.340 
certainly a unique take on the reference
substandard<00:01:35.279> secondly

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
substandard secondly

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.380 
substandard secondly
the<00:01:37.950> Sapphire<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:39.350> there<00:01:40.350> flex<00:01:40.619> edition

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
the Sapphire is there flex edition

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.710 
the Sapphire is there flex edition
unique<00:01:42.390> thing<00:01:42.630> about<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.140> Flex<00:01:43.409> edition<00:01:44.720> that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
unique thing about the Flex edition that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.660 
unique thing about the Flex edition that
it<00:01:45.840> does<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.200> require<00:01:46.650> any<00:01:48.080> active<00:01:49.080> adapters

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
it does not require any active adapters

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.190 
it does not require any active adapters
it<00:01:50.670> has<00:01:52.670> extra<00:01:53.670> circuitry<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.570> card<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
it has extra circuitry on the card that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.800 
it has extra circuitry on the card that
allows<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.640> run<00:01:57.590> high<00:01:58.590> affinity<00:01:59.810> without

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
allows you to run high affinity without

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
allows you to run high affinity without
the<00:02:01.110> need<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:05.690> any<00:02:06.690> active<00:02:07.140> adapters<00:02:07.649> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the need for any active adapters it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.910 
the need for any active adapters it
comes<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:11.959> crossfire<00:02:12.959> here<00:02:13.650> we<00:02:13.769> go

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
comes with the crossfire here we go

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.600 
comes with the crossfire here we go
comes<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:14.910> an<00:02:17.030> HDMI<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.780> DVI<00:02:19.200> connector<00:02:19.800> so

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
comes with an HDMI the DVI connector so

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.830 
comes with an HDMI the DVI connector so
you<00:02:20.670> can<00:02:20.910> run<00:02:21.120> three<00:02:22.790> single-link<00:02:23.790> DVI<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.780> up

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
you can run three single-link DVI so up

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.420 
you can run three single-link DVI so up
to<00:02:24.959> 3<00:02:25.200> x<00:02:25.350> 1920<00:02:25.860> or<00:02:26.700> 3<00:02:26.940> x<00:02:27.090> 1080<00:02:27.480> p<00:02:28.010> without<00:02:29.010> buying

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
to 3 x 1920 or 3 x 1080 p without buying

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.800 
to 3 x 1920 or 3 x 1080 p without buying
any<00:02:30.110> expensive<00:02:31.110> active<00:02:31.530> adapters<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:33.180> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
any expensive active adapters and so it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.900 
any expensive active adapters and so it
is<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.080> complete<00:02:34.739> in<00:02:34.890> box<00:02:34.920> solution<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.819> you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
is a complete in box solution that you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.970 
is a complete in box solution that you
can<00:02:36.060> use<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.299> legacy<00:02:36.720> monitors<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.799> don't

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
can use the legacy monitors if you don't

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.850 
can use the legacy monitors if you don't
have<00:02:38.100> display<00:02:38.459> port<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:38.850> your<00:02:38.880> monitors<00:02:39.860> so

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
have display port on your monitors so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.350 
have display port on your monitors so
we're<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.310> reviewing<00:02:41.459> these<00:02:42.030> three

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
we're going to be reviewing these three

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.460 
we're going to be reviewing these three
cards<00:02:43.040> will<00:02:44.040> be<00:02:44.130> doing<00:02:44.340> single<00:02:44.579> card<00:02:44.880> reviews

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
cards will be doing single card reviews

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.350 
cards will be doing single card reviews
as<00:02:46.470> well<00:02:46.530> as<00:02:47.040> crossfire<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:48.000> look<00:02:48.180> for<00:02:48.329> those

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
as well as crossfire so look for those

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.049 
as well as crossfire so look for those
coming<00:02:48.750> soon
