00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
you know just in three years I've been

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.560 
you know just in three years I've been
gone<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.909> mean<00:01:27.060> there's<00:01:27.210> been<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> lot<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
gone I mean there's been a lot of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.270 
gone I mean there's been a lot of
coaching<00:01:27.960> changes<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.950> been<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.250> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
coaching changes it's been a lot of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.940 
coaching changes it's been a lot of
changes<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.000> style<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.450> play<00:01:30.829> you<00:01:31.829> know<00:01:31.920> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
changes in style of play you know I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.080 
changes in style of play you know I
think<00:01:32.220> there's<00:01:32.369> been<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> change<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
think there's been a change in the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.420 
think there's been a change in the
emphasis<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.479> athletic<00:01:34.290> programs<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
emphasis of athletic programs in the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.670 
emphasis of athletic programs in the
league<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> think<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.380> league<00:01:37.530> has

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
league and so I think if the league has

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.679 
league and so I think if the league has
gotten<00:01:37.950> stronger<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.549> gotten<00:01:38.820> better<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.270> i

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
gotten stronger it's gotten better and i

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.999 
gotten stronger it's gotten better and i
think<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.990> direction<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.500> heading<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
think the direction it's heading in is

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.639 
think the direction it's heading in is
is<00:01:41.670> really<00:01:41.880> exciting<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:43.110> seems<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.619> though

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
is really exciting it seems as though

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.580 
is really exciting it seems as though
the<00:01:43.860> offense<00:01:44.759> du<00:01:45.000> jour<00:01:45.290> recently<00:01:46.290> has<00:01:46.409> been

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
the offense du jour recently has been

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.289 
the offense du jour recently has been
the<00:01:46.710> spread<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:47.640> background<00:01:48.149> as

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the spread and that's your background as

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.999 
the spread and that's your background as
well<00:01:48.479> where<00:01:49.320> did<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.590> develop<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
well where did you develop that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.340 
well where did you develop that
philosophy<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.720> about<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
philosophy what do you like about the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.499 
philosophy what do you like about the
spread<00:01:52.500> why<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.340> different<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:54.000> why<00:01:54.240> has

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
spread why is it different and why has

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.380 
spread why is it different and why has
it<00:01:54.540> been<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.840> successful<00:01:55.880> well<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.909> think<00:01:57.149> what

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it been so successful well I think what

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.950 
it been so successful well I think what
it<00:01:57.479> allows<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:59.100> very<00:01:59.960> be

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it allows you to do is is be very be

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.690 
it allows you to do is is be very be
very<00:02:01.200> versatile<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.799> your<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.310> way<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.579> you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
very versatile in your the way that you

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.310 
very versatile in your the way that you
try<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.939> attack<00:02:03.210> defenses<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.079> think<00:02:04.259> it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
try to attack defenses and I think it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.679 
try to attack defenses and I think it
allows<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.770> use<00:02:04.890> your<00:02:04.920> personnel<00:02:05.689> and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
allows you to use your personnel and

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.749 
allows you to use your personnel and
create<00:02:06.990> positive<00:02:07.469> match<00:02:07.649> ups<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.190> move<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
create positive match ups and move the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.979 
create positive match ups and move the
football<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.300> ultimately<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:09.840> what

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
football and ultimately that's what

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.360 
football and ultimately that's what
college<00:02:10.229> football's<00:02:10.649> about<00:02:10.739> he's<00:02:11.129> got<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
college football's about he's got a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.369 
college football's about he's got a
score<00:02:11.580> points<00:02:11.819> now<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.840> have<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.020> chance<00:02:13.230> to

score points now to to have a chance to

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.890 
score points now to to have a chance to
win<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.650> Kyle

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
win in Kyle

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.809 
win in Kyle
football<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:15.189> know<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> spread<00:02:15.610> for

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
football and so you know the spread for

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.089 
football and so you know the spread for
us<00:02:15.909> has<00:02:16.120> always<00:02:16.360> been<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.540> great<00:02:16.780> equalizer<00:02:17.099> you

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
us has always been a great equalizer you

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.140 
us has always been a great equalizer you
know<00:02:18.189> you<00:02:18.250> don't<00:02:18.400> necessarily<00:02:18.489> have<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.970> have

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
know you don't necessarily have to have

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.970 
know you don't necessarily have to have
the<00:02:19.390> biggest<00:02:19.510> lineman<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.560> strongest

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
the biggest lineman the strongest

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.470 
the biggest lineman the strongest
lineman<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:21.519> you<00:02:21.640> can<00:02:21.760> find<00:02:21.970> skill<00:02:22.209> players

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
lineman but you can find skill players

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.509 
lineman but you can find skill players
that<00:02:22.689> can<00:02:22.810> execute<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.650> get<00:02:24.159> lined<00:02:24.370> up

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
that can execute and and get lined up

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.130 
that can execute and and get lined up
and<00:02:24.700> play<00:02:24.879> at<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.090> high<00:02:25.120> level<00:02:25.239> then<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.959> got<00:02:26.110> a

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
and play at a high level then you got a

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.390 
and play at a high level then you got a
chance<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.439> move<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.650> football<00:02:26.829> score<00:02:27.220> points

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
chance to move the football score points

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.160 
chance to move the football score points
I<00:02:27.730> think<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.299> other<00:02:28.420> thing<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.689> has<00:02:28.900> Cal

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.979 
I think the other thing that has Cal

seller<00:04:17.349> vision<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.829> think<00:04:17.979> that's<00:04:18.099> the<00:04:18.159> most

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250
