huge one that they landed here real
quickly<00:00:23.550> yeah<00:00:23.940> it's<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.360> double<00:00:24.570> apple

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
quickly yeah it's like a double apple

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.300 
quickly yeah it's like a double apple
deck<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.350> something<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.680> well<00:00:26.039> no<00:00:26.130> so

here's here's how this thing works this

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.950 
here's here's how this thing works this
thing<00:00:29.160> by<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.580> way<00:00:29.730> gets<00:00:30.060> goes<00:00:30.330> does<00:00:30.570> New<00:00:30.750> York

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
thing by the way gets goes does New York

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.310 
thing by the way gets goes does New York
LA<00:00:31.140> want<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.890> guess<00:00:32.039> how<00:00:32.070> long<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.550> takes<00:00:33.320> 40

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
LA want to guess how long it takes 40

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.160 
LA want to guess how long it takes 40
minutes<00:00:34.500> 40<00:00:35.340> minutes<00:00:35.370> 40<00:00:36.090> minutes<00:00:36.120> New<00:00:36.929> York

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
minutes 40 minutes 40 minutes New York

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.009 
minutes 40 minutes 40 minutes New York
LA<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:38.069> amazing<00:00:38.819> how<00:00:38.909> fast<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.390> goes<00:00:39.420> jrs<00:00:39.929> n

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
LA and amazing how fast it goes jrs n

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.540 
LA and amazing how fast it goes jrs n
pay<00:00:40.199> attention<00:00:40.589> to<00:00:40.710> me<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.280> he<00:00:41.370> doesn't

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
pay attention to me you know he doesn't

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.889 
pay attention to me you know he doesn't
care<00:00:41.729> he's<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.030> I'm<00:00:42.149> not<00:00:42.269> leaving<00:00:42.539> LA<00:00:42.749> so<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
care he's like I'm not leaving LA so I

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.090 
care he's like I'm not leaving LA so I
don't<00:00:43.079> need<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.229> fly<00:00:43.409> on<00:00:43.530> some<00:00:43.679> super<00:00:43.920> fast

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
don't need to fly on some super fast

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.469 
don't need to fly on some super fast
airplane<00:00:44.339> I<00:00:44.550> don't<00:00:44.760> care<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.089> Ratigan

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:45.479 
airplane I don't care what that Ratigan

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.879 
airplane I don't care what that Ratigan
guy<00:00:45.659> says<00:00:45.899> I'm<00:00:46.079> staying<00:00:46.350> right<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.559> maybe

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:46.889 
guy says I'm staying right here maybe

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:49.779 
guy says I'm staying right here maybe
I'll<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.159> surfing<00:00:48.109> the<00:00:49.109> way<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.409> thing<00:00:49.620> works

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
I'll go surfing the way this thing works

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.709 
I'll go surfing the way this thing works
submerge<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.969> airplane<00:00:51.239> near<00:00:51.359> the<00:00:51.420> propeller

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
submerge the airplane near the propeller

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.329 
submerge the airplane near the propeller
right<00:00:52.319> and<00:00:52.530> then<00:00:52.620> they<00:00:52.710> invented<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.069> jet

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
right and then they invented the jet

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.069 
right and then they invented the jet
engine<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.879> that's<00:00:54.179> like<00:00:54.359> a<00:00:54.389> huge<00:00:54.600> revolution

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
engine and that's like a huge revolution

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.299 
engine and that's like a huge revolution
they're<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.709> is<00:00:55.799> a<00:00:55.829> whole<00:00:56.039> new<00:00:56.069> way<00:00:56.249> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
they're like this is a whole new way to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.229 
they're like this is a whole new way to
propel<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.999> much<00:00:57.719> faster<00:00:58.170> although<00:00:58.409> obviously

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
propel so much faster although obviously

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.829 
propel so much faster although obviously
apparently<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:00.479> have<00:01:00.600> discovered

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
apparently what they have discovered

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.509 
apparently what they have discovered
with<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.499> hypersonic<00:01:02.129> plane<00:01:02.159> that<00:01:02.429> they

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
with this hypersonic plane that they

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.870 
with this hypersonic plane that they
tested<00:01:02.879> our<00:01:02.999> last<00:01:03.329> year<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> past<00:01:03.899> day<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.199> two

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
tested our last year the past day or two

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.920 
tested our last year the past day or two
they<00:01:06.920> create<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.270> shock<00:01:09.270> wave<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> air

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
they create a shock wave in the air

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.440 
they create a shock wave in the air
mm-hmm<00:01:10.770> god<00:01:11.730> knows<00:01:11.940> what<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> does<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.300> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
mm-hmm god knows what it does to the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.840 
mm-hmm god knows what it does to the
birds<00:01:12.660> by<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.960> way<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.410> yeah<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.950> so

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
birds by the way to get yeah like so

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.980 
birds by the way to get yeah like so
that<00:01:15.000> will<00:01:15.120> come<00:01:15.270> that's<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.630> next<00:01:15.840> that's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that will come that's for next that's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.300 
that will come that's for next that's
for<00:01:16.140> tomorrow<00:01:16.230> so<00:01:16.590> that's<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:16.920> somebody<00:01:17.160> else

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
for tomorrow so that's for somebody else

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.340 
for tomorrow so that's for somebody else
true<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:18.210> they<00:01:18.300> create<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> shock<00:01:18.840> wave<00:01:19.050> in<00:01:19.260> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
true but they create a shock wave in the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.840 
true but they create a shock wave in the
air<00:01:19.380> hopefully<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.190> at<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> higher<00:01:20.460> there<00:01:20.670> no

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
air hopefully it's at a higher there no

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.490 
air hopefully it's at a higher there no
birds<00:01:21.060> there<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.300> don't<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:21.870> hoping<00:01:22.230> all

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
birds there I don't know I'm hoping all

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.370 
birds there I don't know I'm hoping all
right<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.030> shock<00:01:24.330> wave<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.200> air<00:01:25.350> is

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
right the shock wave because the air is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
right the shock wave because the air is
just<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:25.890> water<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.700> just

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
just like the water right like it's just

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
just like the water right like it's just
a<00:01:26.880> fluid<00:01:27.210> mass<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.930> if<00:01:28.260> it's<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.710> gas

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
a fluid mass that if it's a gas

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.450 
a fluid mass that if it's a gas
obviously<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.550> it<00:01:29.610> has<00:01:29.730> the<00:01:29.850> same<00:01:30.030> dynamic

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
obviously but it has the same dynamic

would<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.550> fly<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.150> such<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> crap<00:02:06.740> absolutely

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
would you fly on such a crap absolutely

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.029 
would you fly on such a crap absolutely
not<00:02:08.060> why<00:02:09.060> not<00:02:09.090> no<00:02:09.750> way<00:02:10.019> I'm<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.560> were<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.920> New

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
not why not no way I'm we were in New

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.709 
not why not no way I'm we were in New
York<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.370> dinner<00:02:11.519> together<00:02:11.700> I'll<00:02:12.239> wait<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> few

York for dinner together I'll wait a few

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:14.449 
York for dinner together I'll wait a few
years<00:02:12.959> we<00:02:13.139> could<00:02:13.260> fly<00:02:13.560> down<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.920> wave<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.310> New

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
years we could fly down the wave to New

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.550 
years we could fly down the wave to New
York<00:02:14.609> for<00:02:14.790> dinner<00:02:14.969> right<00:02:15.749> and<00:02:15.989> then<00:02:16.170> fly<00:02:16.530> back

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
York for dinner right and then fly back

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.120 
York for dinner right and then fly back
on<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:17.159> wave<00:02:17.310> after<00:02:17.519> dinner

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
on the wave after dinner

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.190 
on the wave after dinner
no<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.610> sounds<00:02:18.970> great<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.360> theory<00:02:19.690> well<00:02:20.050> but

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
no that sounds great in theory well but

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.560 
no that sounds great in theory well but
this<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:20.500> new<00:02:20.710> technology<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:22.000> doesn't<00:02:22.390> sound

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
this is new technology it doesn't sound

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.040 
this is new technology it doesn't sound
no<00:02:22.810> one<00:02:22.990> died<00:02:23.200> no<00:02:24.160> one<00:02:24.280> died<00:02:24.430> yet<00:02:24.720> other<00:02:25.720> maybe

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
no one died no one died yet other maybe

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.260 
no one died no one died yet other maybe
some<00:02:26.260> birds<00:02:26.500> right<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.370> course<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.850> look<00:02:28.090> I'm

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
some birds right of course and look I'm

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.570 
some birds right of course and look I'm
afraid<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.690> fly<00:02:28.900> at<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.830> begin<00:02:30.100> with<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.520> a

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
afraid to fly at to begin with on a

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.730 
afraid to fly at to begin with on a
regular<00:02:30.850> plain<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.960> but<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.500> would<00:02:32.680> be

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
regular plain this but this would be

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.040 
regular plain this but this would be
over<00:02:32.980> faster<00:02:33.550> it'd<00:02:34.090> be<00:02:34.240> over<00:02:34.330> fast<00:02:34.630> first<00:02:34.810> time

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
over faster it'd be over fast first time

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.410 
over faster it'd be over fast first time
on<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.230> bird<00:02:35.470> but<00:02:35.800> it's<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.460> newer<00:02:36.940> form<00:02:37.300> of

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
on the bird but it's a newer form of

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.570 
on the bird but it's a newer form of
flying<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.500> needs<00:02:38.710> to<00:02:38.830> be<00:02:38.950> tested<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.370> little

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
flying so it needs to be tested a little

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.770 
flying so it needs to be tested a little
more<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:39.970> wait<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.360> want<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.540> little<00:02:40.690> more

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
more so wait you want a little more

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.900 
more so wait you want a little more
right<00:02:41.050> start<00:02:41.410> on<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.190> I'll<00:02:42.550> give<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.760> a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
right start on this I'll give it a

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.110 
right start on this I'll give it a
decade<00:02:43.290> decade<00:02:44.290> yeah<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:45.070> like<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:45.880> be<00:02:46.090> thorough
