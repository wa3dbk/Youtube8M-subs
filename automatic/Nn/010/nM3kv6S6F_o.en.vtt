00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
beans today that's what they look like

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.200 
beans today that's what they look like
once<00:00:21.779> they've<00:00:21.990> been<00:00:22.109> harvested<00:00:23.029> they're<00:00:24.029> then

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
once they've been harvested they're then

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.109 
once they've been harvested they're then
dried<00:00:24.740> packaged<00:00:25.740> up<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.279> actually<00:00:27.000> these

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
dried packaged up and actually these

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.519 
dried packaged up and actually these
days<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.720> get<00:00:27.869> them<00:00:28.050> from<00:00:28.170> any<00:00:28.349> good

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
days you can get them from any good

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.580 
days you can get them from any good
supermarket<00:00:29.779> when<00:00:30.779> they<00:00:30.929> are<00:00:31.019> harvested

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
supermarket when they are harvested

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.190 
supermarket when they are harvested
they're<00:00:31.830> everywhere

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
they're everywhere

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.590 
they're everywhere
hence<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> need<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.620> dry<00:00:35.250> them<00:00:35.430> out<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.270> people

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
hence the need to dry them out so people

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.400 
hence the need to dry them out so people
can<00:00:36.750> use<00:00:36.780> them<00:00:37.020> at<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> later<00:00:37.320> date<00:00:39.140> you<00:00:40.140> need<00:00:40.260> to

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
can use them at a later date you need to

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.590 
can use them at a later date you need to
reconstitute<00:00:40.950> them<00:00:41.520> which<00:00:41.820> means<00:00:42.030> covering

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
reconstitute them which means covering

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.889 
reconstitute them which means covering
them<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.780> water<00:00:43.050> which<00:00:43.559> i'm<00:00:43.739> gonna<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:44.070> here

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
them in water which i'm gonna do here

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.910 
them in water which i'm gonna do here
but<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.020> also<00:00:46.170> need<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.530> leave<00:00:46.770> them

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
but you also need to leave them

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.840 
but you also need to leave them
overnight<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.820> want<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.420> speed<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
overnight if you want to speed the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.139 
overnight if you want to speed the
rehydration<00:00:50.850> process<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.920> use<00:00:53.160> baking

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
rehydration process you can use baking

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.959 
rehydration process you can use baking
powder<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:55.260> bicarbonate<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.190> soda<00:00:56.460> maybe<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
powder or bicarbonate of soda maybe a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.549 
powder or bicarbonate of soda maybe a
teaspoon<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.930> sort<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.199> quantity<00:00:59.420> but

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
teaspoon for that sort of quantity but

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.500 
teaspoon for that sort of quantity but
what<00:01:01.559> i've<00:01:01.710> done<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.100> advance<00:01:02.510> because

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
what i've done in advance because

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.260 
what i've done in advance because
watching<00:01:03.840> those<00:01:04.470> beans<00:01:04.799> dry<00:01:05.159> would<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.790> worse

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
watching those beans dry would be worse

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.370 
watching those beans dry would be worse
than<00:01:06.510> watching<00:01:06.659> paint<00:01:07.080> dry

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
than watching paint dry

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
than watching paint dry
but<00:01:08.280> i've<00:01:08.369> already<00:01:08.490> done<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.210> see

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
but i've already done that you can see

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.359 
but i've already done that you can see
they<00:01:09.479> double<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.869> about<00:01:10.110> size<00:01:10.409> they<00:01:10.950> double<00:01:11.250> in

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
they double in about size they double in

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.499 
they double in about size they double in
size<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.540> what<00:01:12.689> i'm<00:01:12.780> gonna<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:14.509> i'm

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
size there and what i'm gonna do is i'm

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.280 
size there and what i'm gonna do is i'm
just<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.950> put<00:01:17.640> these<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> pan<00:01:21.290> cover

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
just going to put these in a pan cover

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.750 
just going to put these in a pan cover
them<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.560> cold<00:01:22.770> water

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.580 

and<00:01:27.650> it's<00:01:28.650> gonna<00:01:28.770> grab<00:01:29.070> my<00:01:29.310> light<00:01:30.440> what<00:01:31.440> will

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and it's gonna grab my light what will

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.160 
and it's gonna grab my light what will
happen<00:01:31.950> now<00:01:32.160> is<00:01:32.460> those<00:01:33.030> bees<00:01:33.300> will<00:01:33.630> come<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:33.990> to

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
happen now is those bees will come up to

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.690 
happen now is those bees will come up to
the<00:01:34.260> boil<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.830> soon<00:01:34.980> as<00:01:35.070> they<00:01:35.190> come<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the boil and as soon as they come up to

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.850 
the boil and as soon as they come up to
the<00:01:35.790> boil<00:01:36.030> I'm<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.840> gonna<00:01:36.960> drop<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.650> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the boil I'm just gonna drop it down to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.090 
the boil I'm just gonna drop it down to
a<00:01:37.920> gentle<00:01:38.370> simmer<00:01:38.960> until<00:01:39.960> they're<00:01:40.380> cooked<00:01:40.620> now

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
a gentle simmer until they're cooked now

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.790 
a gentle simmer until they're cooked now
I<00:01:41.160> reckon<00:01:41.790> from<00:01:42.300> boiling<00:01:42.870> so<00:01:43.320> from<00:01:43.530> when<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
I reckon from boiling so from when the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.710 
I reckon from boiling so from when the
water<00:01:43.980> comes<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.700> boiling<00:01:45.180> you're

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
water comes up to boiling you're

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.880 
water comes up to boiling you're
probably<00:01:45.990> looking<00:01:46.580> at<00:01:47.580> 10<00:01:47.850> minutes<00:01:48.890> cooking

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
probably looking at 10 minutes cooking

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.420 
probably looking at 10 minutes cooking
time<00:01:50.040> as<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.910> boiling<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:52.280> drop<00:01:53.280> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
time as it's boiling and then drop it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.460 
time as it's boiling and then drop it
down<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:54.000> another<00:01:54.480> say<00:01:54.720> twenty<00:01:55.050> to<00:01:55.230> thirty

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
down to another say twenty to thirty

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.410 
down to another say twenty to thirty
minutes<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.550> interesting<00:01:57.030> thing<00:01:57.270> about

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
minutes now the interesting thing about

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.550 
minutes now the interesting thing about
these<00:01:57.870> is<00:01:59.240> the<00:02:00.240> vital<00:02:00.690> thing<00:02:00.900> for<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.350> know

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
these is the vital thing for you to know

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.370 
these is the vital thing for you to know
is<00:02:01.979> cooking<00:02:02.430> times<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.240> vary<00:02:03.600> if<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
is cooking times really do vary if the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.050 
is cooking times really do vary if the
beans<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.800> been<00:02:04.920> knocking<00:02:05.100> around<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.880> you

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
beans have been knocking around for you

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.120 
beans have been knocking around for you
know<00:02:06.180> six<00:02:06.420> months<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.900> year<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.440> can<00:02:07.620> take<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> lot

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
know six months a year it can take a lot

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.810 
know six months a year it can take a lot
longer<00:02:08.369> for<00:02:08.820> them<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.600> reconstitute<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:11.490> also

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
longer for them to reconstitute and also

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.240 
longer for them to reconstitute and also
to<00:02:11.880> cook<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.960> that's<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.350> case<00:02:13.530> my<00:02:13.920> advice

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
to cook and if that's the case my advice

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.120 
to cook and if that's the case my advice
has<00:02:14.490> always<00:02:14.580> cut<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> beans<00:02:15.330> off<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.750> advance

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
has always cut the beans off in advance

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.949
