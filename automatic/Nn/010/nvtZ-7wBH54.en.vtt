you<00:01:12.000> know<00:01:12.030> even<00:01:12.450> something<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.260> small<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650

button sometimes I get inspired by shoes

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.580 
button sometimes I get inspired by shoes
and<00:01:17.490> then<00:01:18.360> when<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> start<00:01:18.930> designing<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and then when I start designing a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.080 
and then when I start designing a
collection<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.580> start<00:01:20.759> sketching

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
collection then I just start sketching

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.789 
collection then I just start sketching
and<00:01:21.600> then<00:01:22.290> from<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.560> point<00:01:23.840> we<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> pattern

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and then from that point we do a pattern

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.429 
and then from that point we do a pattern
draft<00:01:26.509> which<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.140> leather<00:01:28.320> jacket

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
draft which like for this leather jacket

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.819 
draft which like for this leather jacket
this<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> pattern<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.229> soft

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
this is the pattern so we do a soft

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.370 
this is the pattern so we do a soft
paper<00:01:32.610> pattern<00:01:33.090> what<00:01:33.659> made<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.020> decide<00:01:34.140> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
paper pattern what made you decide to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.980 
paper pattern what made you decide to
get<00:01:35.159> involved<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.729> creating<00:01:36.060> your<00:01:36.240> own<00:01:36.479> line
