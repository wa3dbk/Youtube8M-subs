00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.140
 good to all we are again in the 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.570
 anime and today we bring you a series 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.149
 amazing that everyone or even the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.739
 people who do not normally see anime 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.480
 surely you will have seen it and it is worthy 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.210
 it raises us a very very argument 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.460
 interesting what is it if you were 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.590
 able to kill anyone with 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.600
 just write it down in your notebook 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.040
 the protagonist this is not spoiler 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.040
 because it's the first chapter and we've 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.450
 considered that you can say in the 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.000
 first chapter our protagonist 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.490
 You obtain a notebook in which according to 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.310
 series of rules is able to kill the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.600
 who wants and you'll see how it 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.610
 develop the rules is very very 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.090
 interesting is a series of truths of 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.340
 10 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.600
 good would have to be stressed 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 This series is divided into two parts 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.189
 mainly there is the first part that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.390
 it is in fact coincide with the seasons 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.090
 the first part is the first season 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.640
 that is a past that to my way of seeing 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.549
 staff should have cut there and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.710
 is the second part that is a fat or 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.130
 is to see is not really a fat 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.500
 the first season is so good that it's 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.820
 very difficult to do a season that 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.220
 can compare to it then the 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.400
 second season really 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.050
 you go searching truth you do not see a 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.090
 series that compared with a normal series 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.470
 of anime is pretty good but 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.930
 compared to the first season not 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.450
 has nothing to do have left much that 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.240
 wish but good that just to see the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.370
 first season is well worth it 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.430
 put you to see this series and now hugo os 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.660
 let's talk about the characters 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.520
 then as my partner said this 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.349
 series has two seasons and these two 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.150
 seasons will bring new characters in 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.410
 the second part really when 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.670
 we say two seasons is not that they are 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.500
 really two seasons but there are 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.590
 a single season but that has two 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.630
 argumental parts good as the part 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.360
 main so to speak what are the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.709
 history is going to turn between kirk to our 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.890
 protagonist also called light 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.830
 that is a strategist mind is a kid 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.450
 that his father is in the police and he is 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.180
 who receives the death notebook from 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.130
 naked and good then the rules 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.140
 basically is that knowing the burden of 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.880
 the person you want to kill 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.739
 writing his name the notebook the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.450
 you can say more or less like 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.700
 dies things and that we are going to tell 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.230
 so that dadis the series but the person 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.390
 what I wrote is the name because it dies 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.739
 then when it starts to die all 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.880
 the criminals of the world because this 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.700
 man who will want to change the 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.650
 history will appear the a detective and 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.410
 basically we will play the agatha game 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.540
 christie in his detective books and 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.760
 thieves we will have on the one hand the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.750
 police that good police the detective 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.850
 who is looking for you 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.220
 the criminal who tries to escape from the 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.230
 justice and try to surpass in 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.120
 intelligence to the calculating mind that 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.440
 He is also pursuing him with which 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.670
 it's a titans duel between two 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.650
 intelligences your problems that 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.280
 will fight to not be one to not be 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.230
 discovered and another to capture him and the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.360
 resolution is what makes this good 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.450
 series on the other hand the second season 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.640
 and clarify that the characters are still 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.340
 maintaining his charisma are still 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.300
 exactly as good but and of 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.860
 done if it had been a season 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.390
 apart if I had started to start the 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.190
 series in the second season and good 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.390
 We have told you that it is the host but the 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.950
 problem is that as it started in the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.480
 first comparing as Ivan said the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.920
 first and the second the change is 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.870
 bestial then very powerful characters 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.580
 who like coaches for example 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.200
 those that you like the strategy how 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.750
 think the character as it is posed 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.520
 plots to reach your goals as 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.709
 others chase him they try to overcome it in 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.660
 intelligence to all those you will love 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.520
 the series those who prefer to see infinite 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.400
 stratos la vais hating 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.200
 so our blue companion of 93 we 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.940
 is going to comment now on the musical aspect and 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.940
 visual of the series forward is a tic 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.450
 very well, because my colleagues have already 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.060
 told that the series is a bit of 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.890
 detective and the criminal then the 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.660
 setting the animation of this series 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.450
 fits perfectly is an atmosphere 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.210
 quite dark and gloomy enough 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.160
 even sometimes not and especially that you 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.930
 gives an air of seriousness that they lack 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.650
 other animes this is not an anime is not 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.660
 a show is not an air type is not modern 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.770
 it's none of that this anime is very serious 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.830
 it's more mass is more leisurely it's all much 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.540
 more intellectual is everything much more 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.700
 let's say as my colleagues said 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.350
 coke diaz style or that kind of 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.240
 series even steins gate in some 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.789
 moments 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.050
 the music perfectly accompanies the 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.030
 moments has some soundtracks of 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.389
 piano electric guitar has some 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.889
 impeccable perfect soundtracks a 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.979
 for each character one for each 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.590
 situation is a one level of production 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.120
 an incredible level of detail level of 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.590
 detail that extends both the first 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.180
 part of the series as the second 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.650
 always maintaining that environment always 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.259
 maintaining that environment also 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.759
 worked with naut we are going to 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.160
 leave some images so you can see a 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.340
 little how is the anime about what we are 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.340
 talking 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.580
 yes 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.270
 and here you have seen the images that 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.340
 we have put is a pass 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:51.260
 in fact the music that we are put is 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.260
 great has also put us 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.750
 thank you good western the note that you 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.849
 we have given to this series is a 95 because 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.900
 We believe that it deserves it and you already know 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.430
 that we are lately bringing 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.379
 our favorite series except 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.710
 infinite strata in order to these two 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:11.530
 it stinks and good and we hope that I have 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.240
 liked this this new analysis and os 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:19.509
 we wait here until then 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.509
 we are we have all this
