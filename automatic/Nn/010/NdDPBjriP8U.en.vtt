alright guys so or just how to crash

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.410 
alright guys so or just how to crash
with<00:00:04.830> my<00:00:05.660> plate<00:00:06.660> 4/5<00:00:07.290> lady<00:00:07.830> flight<00:00:08.400> blade<00:00:08.700> 400

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
with my plate 4/5 lady flight blade 400

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.810 
with my plate 4/5 lady flight blade 400
so<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.710> what<00:00:10.860> happened<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> head

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
so this is what happened to the head

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.570 
so this is what happened to the head
I<00:00:11.900> am<00:00:12.900> flybarless<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.980> my<00:00:14.160> modded

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
I am flybarless and this is my modded

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.240 
I am flybarless and this is my modded
flight<00:00:15.299> bar<00:00:15.509> head<00:00:15.750> no<00:00:16.350> electronics<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.039> only

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
flight bar head no electronics the only

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.580 
flight bar head no electronics the only
really<00:00:17.760> electronics<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.720> my<00:00:18.869> heli<00:00:19.380> is

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
really electronics I have on my heli is

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.179 
really electronics I have on my heli is
the<00:00:19.859> gyro<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:21.890> my<00:00:22.890> esc<00:00:23.460> down<00:00:24.420> there<00:00:24.859> and<00:00:25.859> also

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the gyro and my esc down there and also

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.330 
the gyro and my esc down there and also
the<00:00:26.630> receiver<00:00:28.070> that's<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.340> there's<00:00:29.550> no

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
the receiver that's it there's no

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.490 
the receiver that's it there's no
electronics<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> beam<00:00:32.940> flybarless<00:00:33.500> so

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
electronics for the beam flybarless so

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.520 
electronics for the beam flybarless so
there's<00:00:34.649> my<00:00:34.800> stripped<00:00:35.160> down<00:00:35.219> head<00:00:36.140> at<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.200> crash

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
there's my stripped down head at a crash

there's my stripped down head at a crash
as<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.820> see<00:00:39.059> snap<00:00:39.719> my<00:00:39.930> fiber<00:00:40.230> glass<00:00:41.090> one

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
as you can see snap my fiber glass one

as you can see snap my fiber glass one
of<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.239> blades<00:00:43.280> so<00:00:44.280> I've<00:00:45.000> got<00:00:45.210> another<00:00:45.480> set<00:00:45.719> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
of the blades so I've got another set of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.010 
of the blades so I've got another set of
blades<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.820> big<00:00:47.820> deal<00:00:48.059> when<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.899> go

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
blades here a big deal when I can go

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
blades here a big deal when I can go
back<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.289> my<00:00:49.410> Woody's<00:00:49.739> which<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.489> four

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
back to my Woody's which would be four

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.850 
back to my Woody's which would be four
right<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.600> from<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.500> metal

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
right there so this is from one of metal

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.319 
right there so this is from one of metal
upgrades<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.399> had<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:59.180> everything's<00:01:00.180> back

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
upgrades I had so everything's back

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.750 
upgrades I had so everything's back
together<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:01.430> had<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.609> change<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:04.760> main

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
together I had to change out the main

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.190 
together I had to change out the main
shaft<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:09.000> also<00:01:09.689> had<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> change

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
shaft as you see and also had to change

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.730 
shaft as you see and also had to change
the<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.159> don't<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.430> where<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.820> right<00:01:12.090> now

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
the I don't know where it is right now

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
the I don't know where it is right now
but<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> feathering<00:01:14.520> shaft<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:15.600> it

but the feathering shaft that what it
was<00:01:15.900> also<00:01:16.049> been<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.710> swap<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:19.369> now<00:01:20.369> my

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
was also been so swap that out so now my

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.230 
was also been so swap that out so now my

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
only problem is to get a link from here

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.130 
only problem is to get a link from here
to<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.650> top<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:27.659> looks<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.900> I'm

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to here up top so it looks like I'm

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.170 
to here up top so it looks like I'm
gonna<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.710> rid<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
gonna have to get rid of this and this

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.249 
gonna have to get rid of this and this
thing<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.439> head<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:32.159> stripped<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.540> both<00:01:33.900> sides

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
thing the head is stripped on both sides

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.429 
thing the head is stripped on both sides
so<00:01:34.700> I'm<00:01:35.700> gonna<00:01:35.909> drill<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.960> drill<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.350> out

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so I'm gonna drill have to drill it out

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.539 
so I'm gonna drill have to drill it out
so<00:01:37.770> take<00:01:38.340> my<00:01:38.490> drill<00:01:38.729> bit<00:01:39.049> stick<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.259> there

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
so take my drill bit stick it in there

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.859 
so take my drill bit stick it in there
put<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> vise<00:01:41.820> grip<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> other<00:01:42.360> side<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
put a vise grip on the other side so it

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.569 
put a vise grip on the other side so it
doesn't<00:01:43.170> spin<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:43.799> drill<00:01:44.040> drill<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.460> out

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
doesn't spin and just drill drill it out

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.149 
doesn't spin and just drill drill it out
so<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.909> pop<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> out<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.860> hopefully<00:01:46.860> I'll

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
so I can pop that out and hopefully I'll

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.170 
so I can pop that out and hopefully I'll
get<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.060> I'll<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.930> back

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.600 

okay<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:55.800> everything's<00:01:56.800> pretty<00:01:56.979> much<00:01:57.130> put

have to get all ghetto and just I ended
up<00:02:05.950> just<00:02:06.220> snipping<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.760> off<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:07.300> don't<00:02:08.080> want

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it's not focusing this part right here

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:30.930 
it's not focusing this part right here

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
focusing on there anyway I sniff that

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.509 
focusing on there anyway I sniff that
off<00:02:33.489> I<00:02:33.989> just<00:02:34.989> eyeballed<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.070> when<00:02:36.220> I'm<00:02:36.340> at

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
off I just eyeballed this so when I'm at

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.140 
off I just eyeballed this so when I'm at
mid<00:02:36.790> stick<00:02:37.120> right<00:02:37.840> now<00:02:37.989> my<00:02:38.110> throttle<00:02:38.470> holds<00:02:38.769> on

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
mid stick right now my throttle holds on

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.410 
mid stick right now my throttle holds on
so<00:02:40.150> when<00:02:41.050> I'm<00:02:41.170> at<00:02:41.350> mid<00:02:41.560> stick<00:02:42.300> which<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:45.420> right

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
so when I'm at mid stick which is right

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.820 
so when I'm at mid stick which is right
there<00:02:47.880> that's<00:02:48.880> my<00:02:49.090> mid<00:02:49.300> stick<00:02:49.650> I've<00:02:50.650> got

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
there that's my mid stick I've got

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.690 
there that's my mid stick I've got
pretty<00:02:51.010> much<00:02:51.130> zero

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
pretty much zero

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.150 
pretty much zero
that's<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:52.600> eyeballing<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.230> right<00:02:53.380> now<00:02:53.739> so

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
that's this eyeballing it right now so

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.410 
that's this eyeballing it right now so
when<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.340> go<00:02:54.430> back<00:02:54.640> down<00:02:54.910> there<00:02:55.120> should<00:02:55.300> be

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
when I go back down there should be

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.680 
when I go back down there should be
negative<00:02:56.280> negative<00:02:57.280> 10<00:02:58.410> positive<00:02:59.410> 10

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
negative negative 10 positive 10

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.660 
negative negative 10 positive 10
that's<00:03:01.690> my<00:03:01.959> flat<00:03:02.230> I'll<00:03:02.350> hold<00:03:02.500> on<00:03:03.299> so<00:03:05.549> sorry<00:03:06.549> if

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
that's my flat I'll hold on so sorry if

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.039 
that's my flat I'll hold on so sorry if
it's<00:03:06.820> blurry<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.209> don't<00:03:07.450> know<00:03:07.540> why<00:03:07.630> snuffle

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
it's blurry I don't know why snuffle

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.420 
it's blurry I don't know why snuffle
it's<00:03:08.260> focusing<00:03:08.620> on<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.860> back<00:03:09.100> for<00:03:09.280> some

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
it's focusing on the back for some

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.340 
it's focusing on the back for some
reason

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
reason

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.160 
reason
maybe<00:03:11.350> I'll<00:03:11.560> be<00:03:11.709> better<00:03:11.950> if<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.459> go<00:03:12.640> like<00:03:12.700> this

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.260 

so

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
so

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.810 
so
just<00:03:18.840> gotta<00:03:19.020> put<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.230> guide<00:03:19.500> back<00:03:19.740> on<00:03:20.010> here<00:03:20.490> so

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
just gotta put the guide back on here so

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.780 
just gotta put the guide back on here so
if<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.150> swashplate<00:03:21.420> stay<00:03:21.990> still<00:03:22.490> and<00:03:23.490> then

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
if the swashplate stay still and then

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.460 
if the swashplate stay still and then
I'm<00:03:23.940> pretty<00:03:24.180> much<00:03:24.390> good<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.840> go

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
I'm pretty much good to go

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.200 
I'm pretty much good to go
I<00:03:26.420> have<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.540> resolder<00:03:28.340> one<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.400> my<00:03:29.490> antennas<00:03:30.030> on

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
I have to resolder one of my antennas on

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.650 
I have to resolder one of my antennas on
here<00:03:30.540> cuz<00:03:30.810> they<00:03:31.050> came<00:03:31.350> off<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:33.000> other<00:03:33.480> than

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
here cuz they came off but other than

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.150 
here cuz they came off but other than
that<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.990> rebuild<00:03:34.350> is<00:03:34.500> pretty<00:03:34.740> much<00:03:34.890> done

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
that the rebuild is pretty much done

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.250 
that the rebuild is pretty much done
just<00:03:35.340> gotta<00:03:35.520> put<00:03:35.790> my<00:03:35.940> blades<00:03:36.210> on<00:03:36.420> bowel<00:03:36.810> Simon

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
just gotta put my blades on bowel Simon

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:45.620 
just gotta put my blades on bowel Simon
more<00:03:37.410> good<00:03:43.250> alright<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:44.610> everything<00:03:45.450> is

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
more good alright so everything is

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.320 
more good alright so everything is
pretty<00:03:45.690> much<00:03:46.170> back<00:03:46.350> together<00:03:46.700> together<00:03:47.700> my

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
pretty much back together together my

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.070 
pretty much back together together my
vibe<00:03:49.320> Marlys<00:03:49.770> no<00:03:50.640> electronics<00:03:51.240> this<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.690> just

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
vibe Marlys no electronics this is just

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.000 
vibe Marlys no electronics this is just
the<00:03:52.170> gyro<00:03:52.560> so<00:03:53.220> that's<00:03:53.400> strictly<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:54.000> no

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
the gyro so that's strictly it no

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.630 
the gyro so that's strictly it no
stabilization<00:03:56.180> electronics<00:04:01.250> everything<00:04:02.250> put

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
stabilization electronics everything put

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.270 
stabilization electronics everything put
back<00:04:02.670> together

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
back together

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.870 
back together
swash<00:04:05.280> guides<00:04:05.610> back<00:04:05.910> on<00:04:07.490> hopefully<00:04:08.490> it<00:04:08.580> stays

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
swash guides back on hopefully it stays

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.840 
swash guides back on hopefully it stays
because<00:04:09.180> let's<00:04:09.510> call<00:04:09.720> Krazy<00:04:10.080> Glue<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:11.730> I'm

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
because let's call Krazy Glue that I'm

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.410 
because let's call Krazy Glue that I'm
using<00:04:12.500> what's<00:04:13.500> uh<00:04:14.000> it's<00:04:15.000> pretty<00:04:15.180> clean

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
using what's uh it's pretty clean

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:25.600 
using what's uh it's pretty clean
install<00:04:18.830> pretty<00:04:19.830> clean<00:04:20.130> pretty<00:04:20.520> simple

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.910 

that's<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.910> next<00:04:27.870> time<00:04:28.170> I'll<00:04:28.380> be<00:04:28.560> when

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
that's it next time I'll be when

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.650 
that's it next time I'll be when
everything<00:04:29.130> drives<00:04:29.550> will<00:04:29.730> be<00:04:29.880> spooling<00:04:30.360> this

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
everything drives will be spooling this

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:38.380 
everything drives will be spooling this
sucker<00:04:30.870> up<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.290> let's<00:04:31.650> see<00:04:31.800> what<00:04:31.920> happens

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.400 

okay<00:04:39.390> so<00:04:39.630> here<00:04:40.380> we<00:04:40.530> are<00:04:40.560> we're<00:04:40.920> back<00:04:41.370> together

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
okay so here we are we're back together

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.610 
okay so here we are we're back together
take<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.560> out<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.680> frontal<00:04:44.100> hold<00:04:45.620> actually

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
take it out of frontal hold actually

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.110 
take it out of frontal hold actually
that's<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:46.950> throttle<00:04:47.250> that's<00:04:47.850> out<00:04:48.090> of

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
that's it throttle that's out of

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.260 
that's it throttle that's out of
throttle<00:04:48.510> hold<00:04:49.160> and<00:04:50.160> we'll<00:04:50.610> fire<00:04:50.940> it<00:04:50.970> up<00:04:51.150> a

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
throttle hold and we'll fire it up a

00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:13.790 
throttle hold and we'll fire it up a
little<00:04:51.450> bit

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.900 

move<00:05:14.129> so<00:05:14.430> far

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.470 

she<00:05:17.060> goes

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.560 

I<00:05:23.570> was<00:05:24.350> afraid

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.750 

looks<00:05:28.960> like<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.230> blades<00:05:29.500> are<00:05:29.740> cracking

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
looks like the blades are cracking

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:43.279 
looks like the blades are cracking
don't<00:05:32.690> forget<00:05:32.960> that<00:05:33.020> when<00:05:33.470> it's<00:05:33.590> good

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:53.850 

they<00:05:43.830> should<00:05:44.039> be<00:05:44.129> spinning<00:05:44.369> pretty<00:05:44.669> good

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.010 

all<00:05:54.860> right<00:05:55.010> so<00:05:55.310> next<00:05:55.880> video<00:05:56.300> hopefully<00:05:56.660> will

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
all right so next video hopefully will

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.590 
all right so next video hopefully will
be<00:05:57.230> a<00:05:58.930> little<00:05:59.930> hover<00:06:00.260> test
