00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
but the waves over does so now you take

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.120 
but the waves over does so now you take
her<00:02:11.970> lemon<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.170> cut<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.410> into

her lemon and you have to cut it into
four<00:02:14.400> pieces<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.850> doesn't<00:02:15.300> there's<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.750> way<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
four pieces it doesn't there's a way to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.590 
four pieces it doesn't there's a way to
calculational<00:02:16.730> okay<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.240> do<00:02:18.480> it

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
calculational okay so you have to do it

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.620 
calculational okay so you have to do it
like<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.520> then<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.300> has<00:02:21.450> to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
like this and then like this it has to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.699 
like this and then like this it has to
be<00:02:21.750> straight<00:02:23.480> once<00:02:24.480> you've<00:02:24.660> done<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:24.900> you

be straight once you've done that you

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.050 
be straight once you've done that you
are<00:02:25.740> ready<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.190> rock<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.670> roll
