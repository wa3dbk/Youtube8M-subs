00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello everyone with you jackson and today 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.519
 There will be another review of the parcel from China 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.209
 Here came such a nonsense version 0 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.240
 and 215 kilogram that is 15 grams and the price 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.370
 6 bucks but almost 7 bucks written game 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.119
 accessories receive play accessories 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.220
 I'm often not sure what it is and 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.550
 went to the swedish post office and date here 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.259
 Unfortunately not indicated so I do not know 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.090
 since it says luxe i know what 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.800
 mini-box usually with such somehow 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.160
 incomprehensible term is sent and 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.160
 the parcels are therefore rather all this 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.000
 boxing is not grade 3 i'm not sure on a hundred 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.040
 percent that this is the case and the end all i have 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.280
 sure what it is I know what it is 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:54.190
 This we do again because 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.850
 I have a channel 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.590
 I will say somewhere even 1 2 3 is 4 joystick 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.710
 on my channel who review all 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.500
 were the same for picking true 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:13.189
 perhaps in quality they were different in 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:16.369
 I have my own which I do not use it and 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:19.960
 Along the way , compare them, and now 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.950
 such a new one seems to be ordered 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.469
 so let's say everything is fine 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.119
 prostitutes bones are small otherwise 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.890
 related but outwardly seemingly excellent 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.140
 the joystick seems to be all right in 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.689
 The kit comes here with usb 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.270
 cable length in my half meter 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.420
 so let's see yes indeed somewhere 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.950
 one and a half meter long cable 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.950
 stupid joystick that's it on old 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.030
 they certainly differ immediately you can 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 see what material is slightly different 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.170
 the marks are also different let's say here 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.369
 should be written here we have written 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.479
 nothing is written here at all 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.439
 some kind of plastic surface 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.810
 separately highlighted 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.520
 there is no such thing below these indicators 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.619
 burn here I do not know the previous one 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.090
 who ordered these indicators not 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.379
 were burning 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.989
 from the front they are the same but true 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.690
 What they new something new that's a lot 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.879
 why then here it is all softly possible 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.760
 already let's say developed i already 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.860
 pretty much and enjoyed it 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.090
 maybe as good as new he can 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.700
 therefore be with him 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.250
 statistics is all the same 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.910
 too student yes really very tight 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.620
 sticks 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.830
 after which you are generally very easy 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.819
 so shift and shift and press gently and 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.340
 there is no here though there is a little bit a little bit 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.209
 small-small clearance as opposed to from 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.760
 This backlash is anyone here is a backlash of horror 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.879
 there is almost no backlash from the upper keys 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.260
 the previous one also had a hatch on this this groove 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.420
 get the truth that's it of course 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.400
 do not play this little bit 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.489
 backlash but still the quality of these 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.700
 buttons are normal for the game fit tarka 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.170
 shift and second well, it seems to be sure 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.510
 ok but here they are for some reason 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.790
 I like it more smoothly 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.310
 clicking here how easy it is 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.519
 do n't even feel it chef so we 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.470
 here the buttons are all ok all on one 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.639
 level previous just busket glitches 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.040
 before the button was started 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.840
 so here we are, too, everything is fine 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.459
 like a normal joystick will not be removed 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.889
 there are no shoals 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.609
 I hope I hope it works and here is the glitch 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:37.310
 I found how but no glitch so let's say the differences 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.970
 one more press that 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.549
 batenkova so let's say this almost almost 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.769
 does not fall when you press it 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.450
 there is a characteristic loud click here at 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.970
 Us this is when you press it so 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.950
 quite lowered and no 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.540
 click here too the difference between them 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.609
 maybe used to it maybe 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.130
 determines but there is of course a difference between 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.810
 they even want to order the store's sleep 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.069
 one same product difference between them 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.889
 there is likely to depend on 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.120
 set delivery rather from the party 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.410
 parties can be different 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.870
 ordered elsewhere they are therefore 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.400
 little joystick another well it seems to be 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.760
 daughter, the quality is normal here 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.709
 will work without cereals without glitches 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.670
 apparently everything is fine just here this 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.440
 poke I like it because 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.810
 Guests to him initially because I 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.260
 promised in one person therefore 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.320
 it turns out that this joystick will not have to 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.630
 give it away so I hope he either doesn't 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.890
 notice or not particularly complain will not 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.110
 because you are not critical 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.600
 the most important functionality of the tails 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.850
 and there were also people on the channel who 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.740
 smeared these graphics so let's say yes it 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.460
 original until held in the hands of the originals 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.290
 know such 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.510
 and whether the original course of the original 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.000
 heavier massive for maybe a little 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.700
 key does not live there no 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.970
 backlash everything is fine but in order to 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.650
 just use let's say some 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.690
 games, even simple ones 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.300
 The emulators of this jessica are quite 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.550
 enough everything is normal shift and accurate 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.520
 nothing buggy and keys are pressed 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.200
 maybe yes it is not original at all the same 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.270
 worthy copy is not that they are very straight 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.760
 bad here its 3 here 4 Jessica ordered 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:15.150
 Well yes your not with me, and those who like their 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.190
 so let's say they bought not drive 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.660
 I've personally complained his here first 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.400
 joystick so far okay not 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.620
 complaining like everything works without 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.100
 complaints hope it is the same 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.320
 will but i don't know here please back 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.090
 that it is not original at all the same 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.460
 quality is normal for playability 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.230
 they are quite suitable in general 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.330
 already sign and bid for likes here 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.820
 so here 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.190
 joystick came from China I do not remember the time 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.900
 Well, somewhere maybe 30 days probably 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.450
 more because it's almost him 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.320
 forgot and in general to sign and bid 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.320
 huskies and in general for now
