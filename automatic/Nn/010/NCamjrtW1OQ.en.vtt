opinion<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.880> i<00:02:24.970> think<00:02:25.390> the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
opinion was that and i think the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.970

1000th like 1007 1012 1005 numbers like
that<00:03:42.120> if<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.510> take<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.350> LAX<00:03:44.920> number<00:03:45.370> and

you'll<00:03:49.090> get<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.480> pressure<00:03:49.720> differential<00:03:50.410> and

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
you'll get the pressure differential and

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.440 
you'll get the pressure differential and
that's<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.190> key<00:03:51.430> we're<00:03:51.700> looking<00:03:51.970> for<00:03:52.000> what<00:03:52.329> is

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
that's the key we're looking for what is

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.809 
that's the key we're looking for what is
the<00:03:52.630> difference<00:03:53.019> between<00:03:53.079> those<00:03:53.590> two

the difference between those two

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.640 
the difference between those two
differentials<00:03:54.819> if<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.750> have<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:55.959> less<00:03:56.350> extreme

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650
