00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.740
 So for me it was natural here 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.750
 the first derby and a great mood 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.240
 and to celebrate here is of course one 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.420
 special feeling for the fans I think 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.130
 today madness was 20 profit 2 0 in 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.840
 I think Osnabrück played great 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.460
 first half I think great football 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.920
 played two cancellations we sat 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.070
 somehow a little something after 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.750
 midgard and pressure but first 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.510
 show flag playtime website 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.690
 combative very well and I believe one 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.410
 super win so i just saw 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.850
 that came out of the Torfabrik 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.200
 except that the ball was free 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.790
 has run away only seen 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.290
 a defender from osnabrück was there 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.430
 behind me in breath belongs that one 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.420
 player ran after it has me 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.390
 The goalkeeper was always upside down 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.490
 a player over in the gate 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.830
 but I was also a goal myself 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.270
 past meyer was for me personally 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.860
 Of course it's bitter that I'm the one 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.950
 we did not do much 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.060
 have to bag sooner have to do something 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.440
 So I have to describe 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.440
 whose free kick or a long ball was 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.630
 then always be found starting on who quickly 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.060
 and I just thought the goalkeeper 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.590
 is not in it I try it easy and 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.039
 that goes in that way is of course one 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.770
 more beautiful 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.959
 that was completely honest after 20 years 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.369
 say 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.810
 There were so many standards for Hawaii 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.160
 where the with all man with man and mouse 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.929
 you can not get to the front either 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.310
 just small and over again 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.599
 situations where you did not know how much 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.330
 you can do the wall because 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:46.580
 the content is all because of that was that 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.679
 thing still in danger until 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.929
 to the 2 it is mixed emotions 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.310
 I have to say that because we are with the 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.310
 loss of dominik schmidt 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:06.310
 of course we have to replace it 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.130
 first and I'm so sorry that that 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.040
 he was so hurt today that that 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.470
 is not good for us and of course I am 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.570
 I'm disappointed that because of the same time 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.870
 I am happy that we are one 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.910
 heavy game against osnabrück for this 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.830
 have chosen one of us for 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.750
 his levy i believe every team 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.820
 can beat any team as well 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.460
 we have already shown that with great 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.900
 played soccer and now two days 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.610
 quiet and then from tuesday it works 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.320
 continue and focus for those for the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.580
 Of course, I'm looking forward to next derby 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.470
 of course I'm horny 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.700
 Of course that's a horny victory I 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.010
 I am glad that you all came 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.330
 and I am full of adrenaline I think 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.860
 I too I hope we have a cool 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.420
 home trip we have we have few 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.220
 Crate beer and we celebrate the victory 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.220
