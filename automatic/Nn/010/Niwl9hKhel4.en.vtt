00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.620
 up to tears with marie-mai rhymed 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.480
 hello hi and knowing that your career 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.900
 is really here to see with star 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.460
 academy 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.190
 let's talk a little about soul to remy who was 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.869
 before star academy olala listens that 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.830
 tell where to start 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.710
 I started writing at 6 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.180
 at some I knew it was clear 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.340
 that I wanted to become a singer 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.710
 I took courses in singing lessons 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.090
 of piano guitar lessons I 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.860
 always kept that in mind 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.320
 then I went on stage the first 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.960
 times in high school for a course of 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.730
 French terra which sealed the first 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.120
 times I felt the applause 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.840
 what a reaction to my voice in front of me 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.640
 public 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.170
 so that was really like a 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.610
 confirmation for me where this is 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.650
 that I wanted to do in life that a 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.809
 year after high school did I do it 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.430
 star academy so I do not know when 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.600
 even fast enough but behind 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.159
 missing a lot of price when 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.740
 wayne what do you think of all 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.600
 the categories 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.510
 it's a great honor actually it's 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.040
 feel that the industry is behind my 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.290
 active that encourages me because when we 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.820
 win our pop album at adisq it's 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.380
 the industry that decides so this is the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.270
 to know that my parents have 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.430
 understood my artistic approach that have 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.930
 encouraged then to win interpreter 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.430
 female of the year ben sassi the audience 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.780
 so it's like the best of both 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.760
 worlds and I feel that the industry is 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.159
 behind me that people are loyal 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.740
 one still follow they presented some 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.560
 women who are who are so 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.390
 so much so loyal so 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.780
 me it pushes me to just give me 300 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.710
 % then it gives me gas for the future 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.480
 how did you find your experience 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.820
 the union the voice as left 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.740
 I loved it I loved it 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.240
 nice experience for sure it's 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.030
 difficult at the level of emotions because 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.640
 that we focus on each one of them and 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.590
 then me I someone who really does 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.070
 where water at 300% when I invest in 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.680
 a project on 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.180
 I go to the bottom and then I ship it so 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.460
 it was difficult week after week 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.020
 see them go away but somewhere 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.150
 good I knew it was only concept 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.860
 of the show but I decided to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.750
 take a little break from the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.800
 voice this year to do shows this 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.360
 that I have you a singer first and 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.580
 foremost then I really wanted 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.680
 really found my fans of the museum on 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.209
 stage then for next year at the voice 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.860
 who knows maybe I'll pick up 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.540
 my chair 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.400
 but precisely still praise miki city 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.950
 link they'll be coach to the box 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.570
 had some advice to give to the coaches of the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.340
 pole advice to give him because 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.260
 he is someone who is extremely 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.900
 intelligent who knows exactly in 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.180
 what they are embarking on is a musician 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.200
 really really very talented so 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.670
 I think he's going to have a lot of 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.450
 things to learn from these candidates I 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.420
 can not wait to see him go 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.130
 and your fourth mirror album that is 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.050
 that he represents for you this album 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:58.489
 this album theirs it's a bit like it's 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.380
 as if we were taking a picture of the ten 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.800
 last years that we put it back on 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.410
 an album I have the impression that each 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.120
 every album I made every project 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.890
 is very faithful to a period 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.230
 so when I made my first album 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.670
 I was 19 years old so it was really 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.620
 very representative of what i'm doing this 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.090
 moment there same thing for the second 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.670
 album I was 20 years old 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.989
 third album I had 22 23 so the 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.690
 fourth album I feel like 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.370
 it's a little all those years ago will be 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.610
 a record all I have to cry in the 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.200
 past whether it's at the level of 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.030
 writing whether it is at the level of 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.400
 arrangements whatsoever 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.290
 on stage with my charm of things that 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.790
 I soon had so it's really a 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.840
 nice parenthesis of all that I have 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.840
 lived outside valley 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.450
 deployed 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.879
 we said to do 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.879
 there is 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.840
 the quest for the biggest dreams 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.970
 they are can call it like that she 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.130
 fell on this year album 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.140
 There are many but I would say that 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.700
 this moment my favorite song is 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.320
 different is the excerpt that plays in this 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.870
 moment there on the radio it's a song 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.260
 who is talking about the difference because the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.000
 young people are often not very very 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.530
 beautiful portraits a good tea a lot 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.320
 of insecurity then I meet my 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.820
 fans after every show that often 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.900
 that's the same topics come back who 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.280
 for me it's important to them 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.910
 express through a song that 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.830
 2013 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.390
 nothing more beautiful of more important then 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.860
 more inspiring different frame 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.840
 so for me a place very 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.530
 particular in my heart that they have 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.960
 future projects 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.630
 we do a lot of things because tonight 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.190
 it's the 64th show turned mirror 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.050
 then we still have a good one 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.970
 hundred the case does we want 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.370
 do things all winter long the 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.770
 spring next summer and then after that 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.270
 of course we have to offer 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.040
 little surprises friends to my fans 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.410
 we are writing very little for a 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.510
 new album and for a nice project so 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.210
 new songs and then a baby on 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.790
 would like to have a baby 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:09.940
 we move on to something else in a bain-marie 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.230
 thank you very much it's a good tour
