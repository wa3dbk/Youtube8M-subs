actually a pretty cool one note so it's

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.970 
actually a pretty cool one note so it's
got<00:03:26.390> decent<00:03:26.540> defenses<00:03:27.290> so<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.620> won't<00:03:27.830> get

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
got decent defenses so it won't get

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.090 
got decent defenses so it won't get
taken<00:03:28.190> down<00:03:28.420> lightly<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:30.430> think<00:03:31.780> yeah<00:03:32.950> an<00:03:33.950> in

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.680 
taken down lightly I think yeah an in
charge<00:03:34.430> beam<00:03:34.760> which<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:36.459> think<00:03:37.459> has<00:03:38.360> the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
charge beam which I think has the

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.170 
charge beam which I think has the
ability<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.650> raise<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.310> users<00:03:40.670> special

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
ability to raise the users special

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.630 
ability to raise the users special
attack<00:03:41.390> or<00:03:41.630> something<00:03:41.810> like<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:42.340> I'd<00:03:43.340> I've

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
attack or something like that I'd I've

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.690 
attack or something like that I'd I've
never<00:03:43.880> used<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.390> rusher<00:03:45.370> yeah<00:03:46.370> yeah<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.580> think

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
never used it a rusher yeah yeah I think

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.240 
never used it a rusher yeah yeah I think
that's<00:03:47.019> yeah

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
that's yeah

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.680
