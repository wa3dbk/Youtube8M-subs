some cases majors there a lot of
engineering<00:00:08.940> students<00:00:09.450> out<00:00:09.570> there<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.809> know<00:00:09.990> I

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
engineering students out there I know I

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.320 
engineering students out there I know I
was<00:00:10.590> an<00:00:10.679> engineering<00:00:10.980> student<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.490> am<00:00:11.730> NOT<00:00:12.000> an

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
was an engineering student I am NOT an

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.759 
was an engineering student I am NOT an
engineering<00:00:12.809> graduate<00:00:12.870> because<00:00:13.320> it's<00:00:13.590> hard

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
engineering graduate because it's hard

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.680 
engineering graduate because it's hard
enough<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.250> failed<00:00:14.610> at<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.540> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
enough that I failed at it and so I I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.689 
enough that I failed at it and so I I
had<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.260> go<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.529> different<00:00:16.650> major<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.460> was

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
had to go to a different major it was

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.279 
had to go to a different major it was
very<00:00:17.910> difficult<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.539> generally<00:00:18.990> was<00:00:19.109> very

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
very difficult and generally was very

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.380 
very difficult and generally was very
boring<00:00:19.770> work<00:00:20.010> but<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.939> understand

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.859 
that they're very exciting things you
can<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.279> with<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.550> major<00:00:24.029> should<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.539> finish

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
can do with that major should you finish

interesting so what you're seeing there
is<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> deka<00:00:44.399> arm<00:00:44.940> they're<00:00:45.600> much<00:00:45.960> more<00:00:46.170> videos

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
is the deka arm they're much more videos

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
for stuff like that exactly think about

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.460 
for stuff like that exactly think about
like<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.570> come<00:01:21.750> back<00:01:21.869> from<00:01:21.990> war<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:22.439> something

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
like you come back from war or something

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.590 
like you come back from war or something
like<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.340> expect<00:01:23.700> okay<00:01:24.000> maybe<00:01:24.210> i'll<00:01:24.299> get<00:01:24.390> some

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
like you expect okay maybe i'll get some

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.910 
like you expect okay maybe i'll get some
kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> prosthetic<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.710> able<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
kind of prosthetic but to be able to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.240 
kind of prosthetic but to be able to
pick<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.130> eggs<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.049> live<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.770> our

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
pick up eggs you can live it and our

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.660 
pick up eggs you can live it and our
life<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:30.049> everybody<00:01:31.049> else<00:01:31.229> exactly<00:01:31.920> perhaps

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
life like everybody else exactly perhaps

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.460 
life like everybody else exactly perhaps
all<00:01:32.880> perhaps<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.479> some<00:01:33.600> ways<00:01:33.780> even<00:01:33.810> better<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
all perhaps in some ways even better I

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.870 
all perhaps in some ways even better I
have<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.070> imagine<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.729> some

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
have to imagine that there are some

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.249 
have to imagine that there are some
awesome<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.390> side<00:01:36.600> effects<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> like
