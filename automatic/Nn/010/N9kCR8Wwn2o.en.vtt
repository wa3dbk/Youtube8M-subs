tasks<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.330> videogame<00:01:59.600> certainly<00:02:00.140> didn't<00:02:00.350> do

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
tasks in a videogame certainly didn't do

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.440

anything<00:02:00.440> for<00:02:00.770> me<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.940> games<00:02:02.150> were<00:02:02.300> all

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
anything for me the games were all

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.690 
anything for me the games were all
relatively<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.140> same<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:03.860> little<00:02:04.250> variety

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
relatively the same so a little variety

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
probably could have helped and maybe

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.530 
probably could have helped and maybe
