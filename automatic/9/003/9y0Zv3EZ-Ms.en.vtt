mark<00:00:07.770> thank<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.910> break-in<00:00:09.660> process<00:00:10.230> that

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
mark thank you the break-in process that

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.440 
mark thank you the break-in process that
seems<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.950> be<00:00:10.980> most<00:00:11.219> effective<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:12.059> me<00:00:13.519> is<00:00:14.519> one

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
seems to be most effective for me is one

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.380 
seems to be most effective for me is one
basically<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.190> reintroducing<00:00:17.190> moisture<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
basically of reintroducing moisture to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.260 
basically of reintroducing moisture to
the<00:00:18.420> reed<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.529> gradual<00:00:19.980> way<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.850> when<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> get

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the reed in a gradual way so when I get

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.269 
the reed in a gradual way so when I get
the<00:00:21.420> reed<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.020> take<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.500> out<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.830> plastic

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
the reed I take it out of this plastic

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.390 
the reed I take it out of this plastic
case<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.260> you<00:00:25.260> discard<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.859> case<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
case and you discard the case and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400 
case and you discard the case and
because<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> reed<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.330> dry<00:00:27.689> I'll<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.289> ahead

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
because the reed is dry I'll go ahead

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.290 
because the reed is dry I'll go ahead
and<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.769> whatever<00:00:28.980> marking<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.609> need<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.910> do<00:00:30.029> on

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
and do whatever marking I need to do on

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.010 
and do whatever marking I need to do on
the<00:00:30.570> reed<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:32.210> just<00:00:33.210> use<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> permanent<00:00:33.870> pen

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
the reed I just use a permanent pen

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.010 
the reed I just use a permanent pen
there's<00:00:34.290> nothing<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.270> usually<00:00:36.630> date<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
there's nothing and I usually date the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.459 
there's nothing and I usually date the
back<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.739> some<00:00:38.040> sort<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.399> an<00:00:38.489> idea<00:00:38.640> of

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
back so I have some sort of an idea of

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.569 
back so I have some sort of an idea of
when<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> reed<00:00:40.800> was<00:00:41.550> first<00:00:41.910> wet<00:00:42.829> and<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.890> dip<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
when the reed was first wet and I dip it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.990 
when the reed was first wet and I dip it
in<00:00:44.730> some<00:00:44.879> water<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:47.309> then<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.520> put<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
in some water and then I put it on the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.069 
in some water and then I put it on the
glass<00:00:49.190> once<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> glass<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.940> rub<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
glass once it's in the glass I rub the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.369 
glass once it's in the glass I rub the
vamp<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.980> make<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.399> smooth<00:00:53.640> as<00:00:53.760> possible

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
vamp to make it as smooth as possible

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.290 
vamp to make it as smooth as possible
against<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.500> face<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.340> main<00:00:56.550> reason<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
against my face but the main reason is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.849 
against my face but the main reason is
to<00:00:57.600> seal<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> pores<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:01.500> takes

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
to seal the pores so that it takes

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.429 
to seal the pores so that it takes
longer<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.879> saliva<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.690> penetrate<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
longer for the saliva to penetrate the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.700 
longer for the saliva to penetrate the
reed<00:01:05.060> after<00:01:06.060> I've<00:01:06.180> rubbed<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.540> 10<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:06.750> 12<00:01:07.140> 15

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
reed after I've rubbed it 10 or 12 15

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.510 
reed after I've rubbed it 10 or 12 15
times<00:01:09.380> then<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> simply<00:01:10.979> put<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
times then I simply put it on the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:25.450 
times then I simply put it on the
clarinet<00:01:12.350> mouthpiece<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:15.720> play<00:01:16.590> for

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.859 

that's<00:01:26.460> about<00:01:26.670> all<00:01:26.850> I'll<00:01:27.060> play<00:01:27.270> maybe<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
that's about all I'll play maybe a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.859 
that's about all I'll play maybe a
little<00:01:28.049> bit<00:01:28.259> longer<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.770> much<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:30.000> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
little bit longer but not much and that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.520 
little bit longer but not much and that
felt<00:01:31.110> pretty<00:01:31.140> good

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
felt pretty good

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.690 
felt pretty good
so<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:33.509> goes<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> box<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.250> don't

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
so it goes in the box and I just don't

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280 
so it goes in the box and I just don't
play<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.030> again<00:01:36.210> until<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> next<00:01:36.720> day<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.200> I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
play it again until the next day and I

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.280 
play it again until the next day and I
usually<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.860> Reed's<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.840> for<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.170> I'm

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
usually have Reed's going for what I'm

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.020 
usually have Reed's going for what I'm
playing<00:01:40.530> right<00:01:40.860> now<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.490> then<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.820> Reed's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
playing right now and then I have Reed's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.450 
playing right now and then I have Reed's
going<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.630> two<00:01:43.290> weeks<00:01:43.530> from<00:01:43.740> now<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.280> Reed's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
going for two weeks from now and Reed's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.580 
going for two weeks from now and Reed's
going<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:45.170> maybe<00:01:46.170> four<00:01:46.560> weeks<00:01:46.799> from<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:47.369> I

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
going for maybe four weeks from now I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.530 
going for maybe four weeks from now I
date<00:01:49.590> my<00:01:49.829> boxes<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.820> after<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> played

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
date my boxes and then I after I played

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.710 
date my boxes and then I after I played
that<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.780> simply<00:01:52.710> put<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> pen<00:01:53.790> mark<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.540> end

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that I simply put a pen mark on the end

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.719 
that I simply put a pen mark on the end
so<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.170> tell<00:01:55.350> how<00:01:55.439> many<00:01:55.500> times<00:01:55.649> I've<00:01:56.100> played

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
so I can tell how many times I've played

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.709 
so I can tell how many times I've played
it<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.950> once<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.610> six<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.000> seven<00:02:00.030> lines<00:02:00.509> on

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it and once I have six or seven lines on

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.250 
it and once I have six or seven lines on
there<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.320> about<00:02:01.530> ready<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.890> go

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
there it's just about ready to go

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.870 
there it's just about ready to go
maybe<00:02:03.560> in<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.490> beginning<00:02:06.190> like<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.340> said<00:02:07.550> 10<00:02:07.760> or

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
maybe in the beginning like I said 10 or

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.720 
maybe in the beginning like I said 10 or
15<00:02:08.210> seconds<00:02:08.690> but<00:02:08.930> as<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.290> as<00:02:10.040> the<00:02:10.400> lines

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:10.730 
15 seconds but as I as the lines

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.480 
15 seconds but as I as the lines
increase<00:02:11.240> I<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:12.080> know<00:02:12.200> we'll<00:02:12.470> play<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.800> two

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
increase I you know we'll play it two

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.820 
increase I you know we'll play it two
minutes<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:14.000> five<00:02:14.210> minutes<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:14.810> ten<00:02:15.500> ten

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
minutes and five minutes and ten ten

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.890 
minutes and five minutes and ten ten
minutes<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.310> eventually<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.970> just<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.570> know<00:02:17.660> I

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
minutes and eventually I just you know I

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.110 
minutes and eventually I just you know I
start<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.500> play<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.740> in<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.920> orchestra<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
start to play it in the orchestra the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.600 
start to play it in the orchestra the
better<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:21.170> break<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:21.560> process<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.310> longer

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
better the break in process the longer

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.420 
better the break in process the longer

you can use the Reed I personally use
the<00:02:25.670> same<00:02:25.910> Reed<00:02:26.210> if<00:02:27.100> we're<00:02:28.100> playing

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340

might<00:02:32.570> play<00:02:32.720> one<00:02:33.020> read<00:02:33.200> for<00:02:33.440> rosenkavalier

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
might play one read for rosenkavalier

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.460 
might play one read for rosenkavalier
and<00:02:34.400> then<00:02:34.520> if<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.760> have<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:34.970> play<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> concerto

and then if I have to play a concerto

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
and then if I have to play a concerto
I'll<00:02:36.470> play<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.710> different<00:02:36.950> read<00:02:37.250> for<00:02:37.430> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.680 
I'll play a different read for the
concerto<00:02:38.000> but<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.210> won't

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
concerto but I won't

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.870 
concerto but I won't
I<00:02:38.720> won't<00:02:39.080> use<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.470> same<00:02:39.710> read<00:02:39.980> for<00:02:40.340> them<00:02:40.490> for

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
I won't use the same read for them for

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.990 
I won't use the same read for them for
an<00:02:40.970> entire<00:02:41.210> two-hour<00:02:41.540> concert<00:02:42.400> my<00:02:43.400> goal<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.850> to

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the same Reed so that the intonation and
