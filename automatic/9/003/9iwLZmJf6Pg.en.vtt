00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and you know I just kind of built this

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.109

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
in actually a few hours or so it is very

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.330 
in actually a few hours or so it is very
irritating<00:00:27.449> map<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.260> build<00:00:28.500> because<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.220> have

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
irritating map to build because you have

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.070 
irritating map to build because you have
to<00:00:29.460> use<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.730> insane<00:00:30.060> game<00:00:30.300> type<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.840> all

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
to use the insane game type and all

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
to use the insane game type and all
these<00:00:31.289> are<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:33.079> like<00:00:34.079> Hill<00:00:34.380> markers<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
these are the like Hill markers and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.490 
these are the like Hill markers and
stuff<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.809> you<00:00:36.809> know<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.230> how<00:00:37.440> you

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
stuff like that you know like how you

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.979 
stuff like that you know like how you
using<00:00:37.890> race<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.610> checkpoints<00:00:39.360> except<00:00:39.840> an

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
using race for the checkpoints except an

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.600 
using race for the checkpoints except an
insane<00:00:40.440> game<00:00:40.649> type<00:00:40.920> you're<00:00:41.100> able<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.460> make

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
insane game type you're able to make

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.160 
insane game type you're able to make
them<00:00:41.760> show<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.510> ground<00:00:42.719> make<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.020> kind

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
them show up on the ground make you kind

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.950 
them show up on the ground make you kind
of<00:00:43.260> look<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.440> snow<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.510> I<00:00:45.510> thought<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.750> was

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
of look like snow and I thought that was

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.779 
of look like snow and I thought that was
pretty<00:00:46.110> cool<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:46.710> then<00:00:46.920> once<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.340> started

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
pretty cool but then once I started

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.840 
pretty cool but then once I started
getting<00:00:47.910> done<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> map<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.610> some<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.640> my

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
getting done with the map I some of my

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.569 
getting done with the map I some of my
hills<00:00:51.180> started<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.960> disappear<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.340> more<00:00:53.550> I

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
hills started to disappear the more I

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.790 
hills started to disappear the more I
got<00:00:53.789> into<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.239> map<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.199> got<00:00:55.379> really

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
got into the map so it got really

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.330 
got into the map so it got really
irritating<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.410> had<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> keep<00:00:58.800> tweaking

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
irritating and so I had to keep tweaking

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.459 
irritating and so I had to keep tweaking
in<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.789> took<00:00:59.969> me<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> couple<00:01:00.270> extra<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
in and took me a couple extra like a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.189 
in and took me a couple extra like a
couple<00:01:02.129> hours<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.270> try<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> fix<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
couple hours just to try to fix it and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.380 
couple hours just to try to fix it and
so<00:01:04.920> eventually<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.640> put<00:01:05.790> all<00:01:05.820> those<00:01:06.060> rocks

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
so eventually I just put all those rocks

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.370 
so eventually I just put all those rocks
around<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:08.180> ice<00:01:09.180> rink<00:01:09.600> there<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> center

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
around that ice rink there in the center

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.460 
around that ice rink there in the center
because<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.189> could<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.540> hill<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
because I could not get that hill to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.280 
because I could not get that hill to
come<00:01:13.890> back<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.509> Christmas<00:01:15.900> tree

know<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.450> fun<00:01:48.659> map<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> kind<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.500> go

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
know a really fun map just to kind of go

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.639 
know a really fun map just to kind of go
around<00:01:50.040> look<00:01:50.490> at<00:01:50.640> everything<00:01:51.200> but<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> main

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
around look at everything but the main

around look at everything but the main
thing<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.399> map<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.200> try<00:01:55.439> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
thing on this map is you have to try and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.450 
thing on this map is you have to try and
find<00:01:55.799> for<00:01:56.549> plasma<00:01:57.270> grenade<00:01:57.799> snowmen<00:01:58.850> okay<00:02:00.409> now

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
find for plasma grenade snowmen okay now

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.310 
find for plasma grenade snowmen okay now
case<00:02:02.460> y'all<00:02:02.700> don't<00:02:03.450> still<00:02:03.869> don't<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.229> an

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
case y'all don't still don't have an

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.969 
case y'all don't still don't have an
idea<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.509> look<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.719> three<00:02:07.320> plasma

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
idea what that is look for three plasma
