00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
the collectors on the outside right here

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:04.910 
the collectors on the outside right here
all<00:02:02.819> in<00:02:03.119> separate<00:02:03.479> corners<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:04.530> make<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.799> more

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
all in separate corners to make it more

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.639 
all in separate corners to make it more
difficult<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.399> them<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> steal<00:02:05.939> from<00:02:06.179> your

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
storages and I'm mostly like this

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.650 
storages and I'm mostly like this
because<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:12.049> it's<00:02:13.049> very<00:02:13.410> symmetrical<00:02:14.660> it's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
because it's it's very symmetrical it's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.320 
because it's it's very symmetrical it's
not<00:02:15.930> completely<00:02:16.440> random<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.239> some<00:02:18.239> other
