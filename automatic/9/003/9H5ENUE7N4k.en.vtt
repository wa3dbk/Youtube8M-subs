00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.610
 Here is 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.210
 Although it had been in the wind that the packing is not 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.439
 Though I was a comment that 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.439
 There is packing 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.830
 So no water spills 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.990
 Like this if nothing is in it 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.480
 The entrance of the However, 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.850
 It is in close contact and thin management 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.060
 And 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.690
 I really want to put in water 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.910

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.090
 Selling down 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:07.690
 It's in the middle of this, but it's like this when it's in space 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.690
 It has been included until now, but in double

 Below 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:18.760
 The air is relatively easy to take off because it 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.760
 In I think that I want to put the water in a dish 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:34.290
 It's about this time when you've got water. 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.580
 In because there is a take on the the Tteyuu this Faiz file gong configuration laser light 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.580

 When it's full, I hold it for a long time 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:05.420
