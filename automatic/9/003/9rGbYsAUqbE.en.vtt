00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.780 
better
the<00:02:58.780> higher<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.260> play<00:02:59.470> your<00:03:00.010> heel<00:03:00.220> when<00:03:00.640> it's

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the higher you play your heel when it's

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.970 
the higher you play your heel when it's
isolated<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:02.230> better<00:03:02.440> it's<00:03:02.620> going<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:02.830> look

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
isolated the better it's going to look

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.930 
isolated the better it's going to look
so<00:03:03.970> if<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.270> actually<00:03:04.510> like<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:06.520> looks<00:03:06.670> it

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
so if I actually like this it looks it

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.570 
so if I actually like this it looks it
looks<00:03:06.970> way<00:03:07.270> better<00:03:07.500> if<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.650> do<00:03:08.710> it<00:03:08.830> like<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.310> lot

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
looks way better if I do it like a lot
