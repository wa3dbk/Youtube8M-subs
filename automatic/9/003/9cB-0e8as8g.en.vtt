00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.800
 hello we are the carlota and because we are from 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.580
 Andalusia in our music let's hope 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.580
 everyone likes 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.630
 the style of the carlotas is a style 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.400
 conservative we do not sing to the family to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.890
 the mothers by god to the stories at 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.080
 love to love the dew the girl comes 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.820
 late to the one that says we sing to all 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.970
 my brother many social issues that the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.129
 people identify a lot with 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.370
 us but good even though we are from 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.420
 andalusia of cadiz sanlÃºcar de barrameda 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.250
 we want our music to reach 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.250
 these sites to the most possible 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.519
 we've seen maybe a little bit that we were going 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.220
 a concert and in the municipal booth 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.810
 always good more older people and of 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.479
 a few years here and girls with 15 14 13 18 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.549
 couple and flipping with the carlots and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.619
 singing our songs and I think the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.060
 music has evolved a little inside 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.700
 that the carlots are going to continue 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.200
 always singing to the same thing that does not 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.659
 we are a group that this year we sing 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.060
 rumba and the year we sing the rap not 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.100
 we have been keeping for 25 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.140
 years and we will continue to sing 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.420
 because the public likes the coves 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.720
 and as long as you like, we're going to 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.720
 change 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.550
 the truth that it has been a very work 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.270
 I would say a very relaxed small 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.330
 never forgetting that recording a disc does not 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.280
 it's easy because choosing the themes 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.710
 put us both in agreement because of course 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.150
 apart from what you have with him what you 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.460
 like you to be able to transmit 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.950
 because if they do not sing what you like 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.320
 you also have to put a little bit in 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.119
 the ear of the people who are going to buy 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.240
 your discs of the people that go to your 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.509
 concerts to please the most not 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.530
 you always get it does not contain a theme 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.780
 you think you'll like it but then 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.030
 same does not make the desired effect and 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.180
 conceal the contrary did not choose topics to 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.010
 the best that I eat is good come and 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.980
 then the one that people have 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.390
 bet then it has been a job the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.790
 truth in which they have given us many 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.739
 facilities we have chosen the topics that 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.739
 We have wanted nothing imposed on us 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.200
 this work pretty pretty well 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:45.350
 we go in the disc are eleven subjects the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.569
 darling goes a little bit of horns 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.239
 horns 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.950
 like life itself and then my devotion 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.040
 Mariana we sing to you all the patron saints 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.260
 from beyond andalusia the brunette of the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.540
 Carmen from the dew victory 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.030
 we sing to all the patrons I go by 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.639
 life we are both in front we are going 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.650
 we always talk to the face, despite 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:10.230
 who weighs or weighs us the other two 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.230
 but let's face the capitals 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.350
 where money is what it is today and what 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.230
 Sometimes we want this Seville 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.640
 with money you get everything 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.160
 fortunately because then it's off 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.220
 and let's go the boy of the manola hombre is 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.959
 a rociero theme as comfortable and we 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.910
 I love the tough one but here there is a lot 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.220
 people breaking there who he sprayed 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.990
 wonderful of the wonderful and we have 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.810
 decided to sing a medley of sevillanas 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.960
 of the dew and also that which 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.880
 we have always sung on the roads 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.470
 then modern women come 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.260
 men that we have not put modern to 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.640
 we'll both move from dwarfs to 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.530
 two more men because we are a little 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.000
 old to the area is still by in 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.590
 reality because because love 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.500
 formerly they were in the house washed 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.130
 ironed today not today they paint their hair 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.900
 today in days at the studio door are 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.390
 political deputation are processes of the 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.140
 zone lawyer for all those women 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.140
 this pretty song 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.830
 I think it was the first subject that I said without 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.880
 have to listen to others still 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.079
 I was on my disk 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.120
 precious is a subject rather a 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.370
 nostalgic not someone who has 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.630
 accompanied your whole life a friend a 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.910
 friend to the dew and we have gone her but 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.040
 we're always with you 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.860
 is going to have a gap in your deal a 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.720
 It's always pretty to see you 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.330
 also I with the virgin has to be 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.940
 with everyone always and there is one that 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.790
 will surprise you why 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.800
 is a sevillanas version of a theme 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.920
 precious that I think we know all 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.050
 the young and the less young of a 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.420
 ranchera de dew durcal I really like it 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.410
 we see it adapted by sevillanas and the 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.230
 truth that has been superchulo 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.360
 very nice superchule we have mixed 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.360
 Andalusia with the cute doctor 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.840
 with the multi the other part is a disc 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.840
 forgiveness without dizzy going well 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.410
 how it decided small that we go where we 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.569
 call with the music then with the 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.340
 suitcases prepare presence and back 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.830
 party always with the suitcases in the 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.139
 door for a hundred calls us there we go 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.259
 with our music we are no longer the 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:33.259
 old fools every day to sing 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.840
 the day 21 February in Barcelona then 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.750
 a valencia and well we started the tour 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.370
 down there we have already see over here 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.289
 if you call us I hope this year 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.070
 that we have had for a long time 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:48.280
 forgotten 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:51.190
 and dressed in flirty clothes 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.409
 the hook of the carlots are in that 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:58.439
 we are the same above as below 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:02.669
 Natural as the life itself 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:04.459
 we went up a little bit and at 12 and 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.769
 Measurement scenario I look at it and it says 

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:11.339
 like fights is that sometimes the 

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:14.009
 people think that everything is ready 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:16.709
 let's swear by god that not because this 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:19.979
 it will be an absurd they prepared us a no no 

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:21.209
 we have a script and the same already changes a 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.309
 topic because he wants to give the 

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:25.919
 musicians in leather now a sing is 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:28.349
 and the musicians stay like and I 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.449
 I say it turns me from Gothic to Rrrr 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.969
 that there is not you when you go out to sing a 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.379
 chicken under script I do not read the public is not 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:36.239
 same everywhere carmen thyssen or 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.039
 a script but if you take a 

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:39.839
 repertoire the musicians are prepared 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.729
 they have finished a topic and they are preparing 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:43.689
 for another what you have to change 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:46.259
 the notes pass to Carmen 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.259
 7 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.640
 I've seen it we discussed how all the 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.470
 sisters there are things that we are not 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.260
 agreement because we can not get 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.390
 agreement I do not have another vision 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:05.180
 of things better than her but good 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.180
 we cope with it beautiful 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:13.310
 if you go pretty my love 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:16.160
 I love you my love 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.770
 and other cleaning lips 7 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.810
 programming 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.810
 go forget about me
