00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
know no course were put up so I want to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.699 
know no course were put up so I want to
say<00:02:35.820> third<00:02:36.090> or<00:02:36.300> fourth<00:02:36.600> quarter<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.470> last

game<00:02:37.920> which<00:02:38.130> pretty<00:02:38.310> much<00:02:38.400> means<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.060> can

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
game which pretty much means that it can

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.340 
game which pretty much means that it can
go<00:02:39.300> either<00:02:39.480> way<00:02:39.600> how<00:02:39.900> are<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.050> feeling<00:02:40.320> about
