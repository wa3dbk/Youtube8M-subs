00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
hey guys here's a quick video showing

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.920 
hey guys here's a quick video showing
how<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.650> set<00:00:04.980> up<00:00:05.009> my<00:00:05.120> transmitters<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.750> work

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
how I set up my transmitters to work

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.549 
how I set up my transmitters to work
with<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.290> icon<00:00:07.799> bailout<00:00:08.790> feature<00:00:09.050> so<00:00:10.050> I've

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
with the icon bailout feature so I've

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.709 
with the icon bailout feature so I've
got<00:00:10.710> two<00:00:10.830> transmitters<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:11.490> I've<00:00:11.639> got<00:00:11.849> my<00:00:11.880> TX

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
got two transmitters here I've got my TX

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.790 
got two transmitters here I've got my TX
8<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.380> I've<00:00:14.040> got<00:00:14.219> my<00:00:14.460> TX<00:00:15.150> 18<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.870> wanted<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> show

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
8 and I've got my TX 18 I wanted to show

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.670 
8 and I've got my TX 18 I wanted to show
the<00:00:17.010> dx8<00:00:17.400> since<00:00:18.109> sure<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> lot<00:00:19.350> more<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.590> you

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the dx8 since sure a lot more of you

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.220 
the dx8 since sure a lot more of you
have<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.880> little<00:00:21.630> bit<00:00:21.840> different<00:00:22.170> in

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
have that and a little bit different in

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.570 
have that and a little bit different in
how<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.410> would<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.740> setup<00:00:23.070> since<00:00:23.430> you

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
how you would do this setup since you

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.800 
how you would do this setup since you
can't<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.660> simply<00:00:25.019> assign<00:00:25.490> switches<00:00:26.810> to

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
can't I just simply assign switches to

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.359 
can't I just simply assign switches to
mixes<00:00:28.199> meaning<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> pretty<00:00:29.279> much

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
mixes meaning you have to pretty much

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.730 
mixes meaning you have to pretty much
give<00:00:29.580> up<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.789> channel<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.900> do<00:00:31.080> what<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
give up a channel to do what I like to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.280 
give up a channel to do what I like to
do<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.009> bailout<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:33.030> one<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.329> x8<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.899> use

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
do for bailout so one with the x8 I use

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.069 
do for bailout so one with the x8 I use
this<00:00:34.469> switch<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.210> select<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.420> flight<00:00:36.600> mode<00:00:36.780> so

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
this switch to select the flight mode so

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.530 
this switch to select the flight mode so
this<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.350> flight<00:00:37.680> mode<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.100> flight<00:00:39.000> mode<00:00:39.239> or

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
this is flight mode one flight mode or

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.510 
this is flight mode one flight mode or
flight<00:00:39.750> set<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.079> two<00:00:40.290> flights<00:00:40.860> set<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.250> three

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
flight set up two flights set up three

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.450 
flight set up two flights set up three
and<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.200> flight<00:00:43.440> set<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:43.920> bailout

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and so in the flight set up one bailout

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
and so in the flight set up one bailout
is<00:00:44.640> disarmed<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
is disarmed and then here here and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
is disarmed and then here here and
either<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.010> these<00:00:47.100> two<00:00:47.280> positions<00:00:47.430> bailouts

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
either of these two positions bailouts

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.830 
either of these two positions bailouts
armed

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
armed

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.569 
armed
so<00:00:49.469> whatever<00:00:49.590> months<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.039> my<00:00:50.129> throttle<00:00:50.309> holes

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
so whatever months is my throttle holes

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.610 
so whatever months is my throttle holes
which<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.870> use

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
which I don't you like this one I use

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100 
which I don't you like this one I use
this<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.910> uh<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
this one here so uh so what I do is I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.979 
this one here so uh so what I do is I
take<00:00:55.289> off<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.039> set<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.989> helicopters

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
take off I'm in set up one helicopters

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.400 
take off I'm in set up one helicopters
pulls<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.460> then<00:00:59.789> as<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.809> airborne<00:01:00.960> I

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
pulls up and then as I get airborne I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
pulls up and then as I get airborne I
just<00:01:01.859> yank<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.160> switch<00:01:02.370> down<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.670> easy<00:01:02.789> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
just yank that switch down it's easy to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.429 
just yank that switch down it's easy to
find<00:01:03.090> because<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.510> high<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.229> this

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
find because it's high up I like this

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.640 
find because it's high up I like this
longer<00:01:05.129> switch<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:06.689> then<00:01:06.930> as<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> bail

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
longer switch and then as I want to bail

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.010 
longer switch and then as I want to bail
out<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.220> know<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:09.450> flick<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
out you know I can I can flick in the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.250 
out you know I can I can flick in the
hole<00:01:10.200> flick<00:01:10.710> back<00:01:10.950> out<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.430> I'm<00:01:11.640> flying<00:01:11.850> around

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
hole flick back out as I'm flying around

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.490 
hole flick back out as I'm flying around
and<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> works<00:01:13.560> great<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:16.320> so

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and it works great just like that and so

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.810 
and it works great just like that and so
I<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.890> method<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.490> new<00:01:17.610> there's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I like this method your new there's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.130 
I like this method your new there's
other<00:01:17.939> ways<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:18.570> most<00:01:18.960> guys

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
other ways to do it I think most guys

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.020 
other ways to do it I think most guys
know<00:01:19.770> I'm<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.070> also<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.460> want<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> know<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
know I'm and also just want to know that

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.630 
know I'm and also just want to know that
with<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.420> kind<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.840> setup<00:01:21.990> I've<00:01:22.710> got<00:01:22.950> three

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
with this kind of setup I've got three

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.510 
with this kind of setup I've got three
flight<00:01:24.000> three<00:01:24.540> flight<00:01:24.750> modes<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.520> normal

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
flight three flight modes here a normal

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.170 
flight three flight modes here a normal
mode<00:01:26.850> idle<00:01:27.659> up<00:01:27.780> idle<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.920> right<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> don't

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
mode idle up idle to right so I don't

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.870 
mode idle up idle to right so I don't
give<00:01:30.270> anything<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.960> my<00:01:31.110> normal<00:01:31.740> mode<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.820> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
give anything up and my normal mode is a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.200 
give anything up and my normal mode is a
full<00:01:33.150> 3d<00:01:33.420> flight<00:01:33.720> mode<00:01:34.189> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.400> idle<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
full 3d flight mode and then idle up is

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.469 
full 3d flight mode and then idle up is
the<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.930> know<00:01:36.990> whatever<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.920> want<00:01:38.100> there<00:01:38.479> some

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the you know whatever I want there some

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.149 
the you know whatever I want there some
guys<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> normal<00:01:40.259> mode<00:01:40.470> still<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.040> they

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
guys have the normal mode still so they

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
guys have the normal mode still so they
take<00:01:41.490> off<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.850> an<00:01:41.970> airplane<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.600> don't<00:01:42.990> like

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
take off like an airplane I don't like

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.710 
take off like an airplane I don't like
that<00:01:43.290> because<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.680> forget<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.130> crash<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.240> no

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
that because if I forget I crash so no

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.850 
that because if I forget I crash so no
thanks

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
thanks

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.679 
thanks
so<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> dx8<00:01:50.329> what<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.540> is

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
so to do this on the dx8 what you do is

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.060 
so to do this on the dx8 what you do is
first<00:01:52.320> thing<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.860> basically

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
first thing you have to do is basically

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.910 
first thing you have to do is basically
give<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.579> channel<00:01:53.820> assign<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> channel<00:01:54.920> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
give up a channel assign the channel to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.240 
give up a channel assign the channel to
the<00:01:56.040> switch<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.030> I've<00:01:57.149> done<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:58.250> on

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the switch and so what I've done is on

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.420 
the switch and so what I've done is on
the<00:01:59.579> channel<00:02:00.119> assignment<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.189> switch

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the channel assignment so you switch

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.469 
the channel assignment so you switch
select<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.399> use<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.880> Gov<00:02:06.060> output

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
select I have I use the Gov output

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.510 
select I have I use the Gov output
instead<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.469> using<00:02:07.619> throttle<00:02:08.069> curves<00:02:08.280> it's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
instead of using throttle curves it's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.949 
instead of using throttle curves it's
just<00:02:08.670> way<00:02:08.910> easier<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.270> do<00:02:09.509> because<00:02:09.750> it's

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
just way easier to do because it's

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.860 
just way easier to do because it's
automatic<00:02:10.410> flat<00:02:10.590> curves<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.580> I've<00:02:11.730> got<00:02:11.940> guv

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
automatic flat curves so I've got guv

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.370 
automatic flat curves so I've got guv
ox-3

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.240 

and<00:02:16.650> then<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.670> go<00:02:18.440> back<00:02:21.800> back<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.069> main

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
and then we go back back to the main

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.500 
and then we go back back to the main
menu<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:24.660> then<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.770> go<00:02:25.920> down<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.550> governor

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
menu and then if you go down to governor

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.930 
menu and then if you go down to governor
and<00:02:28.370> governors<00:02:29.370> only<00:02:29.489> losing<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.760> control

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and governors only losing the control

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.440 
and governors only losing the control
the<00:02:30.330> throttle<00:02:30.510> channel<00:02:31.580> I've<00:02:32.580> got<00:02:32.880> any<00:02:33.269> other

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
the throttle channel I've got any other

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.120 
the throttle channel I've got any other
three<00:02:33.660> different<00:02:33.959> speeds<00:02:34.349> that<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.769> icon

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
three different speeds that the icon

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.210 
three different speeds that the icon
uses<00:02:35.489> throttle<00:02:36.300> hold<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.260> mean<00:02:37.590> Lee<00:02:37.739> is<00:02:37.830> my<00:02:37.950> DX

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
uses throttle hold I I mean Lee is my DX

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.890 
uses throttle hold I I mean Lee is my DX
18<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.670> don't<00:02:38.880> use<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> dx8<00:02:39.360> at<00:02:39.510> all<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.870> just

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
18 I don't use the dx8 at all so I just

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.339 
18 I don't use the dx8 at all so I just
quickly<00:02:40.560> set<00:02:40.890> this<00:02:40.980> up<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.340> show<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:43.200> then

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
quickly set this up to show you and then

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.900 
quickly set this up to show you and then
for<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> mixing<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:46.380> get<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.709> switch<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:46.980> do

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
for the mixing to get this switch to do

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.120 
for the mixing to get this switch to do
the<00:02:48.000> idle<00:02:48.209> on<00:02:48.330> bill<00:02:48.480> out<00:02:48.660> what<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.380> do<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:49.980> go

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the idle on bill out what I do is I go

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.059 
the idle on bill out what I do is I go
to<00:02:50.160> mix<00:02:50.459> one<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.299> now<00:02:52.080> I'm<00:02:52.260> thinking<00:02:52.440> aux<00:02:52.769> 3

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
to mix one and now I'm thinking aux 3

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.979 
to mix one and now I'm thinking aux 3
which<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.459> switch<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.209> signed<00:02:54.480> aux<00:02:54.720> 3

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
which is the switch that we signed aux 3

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.259 
which is the switch that we signed aux 3
which<00:02:55.140> also<00:02:55.319> does<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.950> flight<00:02:56.130> setups<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.760> I

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
which also does the flight setups and I

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.020 
which also does the flight setups and I
mix<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.630> into<00:02:57.810> gov<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:59.010> unfortunately<00:02:59.880> now

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
mix it into gov so unfortunately now

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.520 
mix it into gov so unfortunately now
I've<00:03:00.180> wasted<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.599> channel<00:03:00.959> there's<00:03:01.230> no<00:03:01.349> way<00:03:01.470> to

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
I've wasted a channel there's no way to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.620 
I've wasted a channel there's no way to
just<00:03:01.739> say<00:03:01.860> like<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:02.819> switch<00:03:03.090> assigned<00:03:03.510> to

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
just say like this switch assigned to

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.660 
just say like this switch assigned to
this<00:03:03.720> function<00:03:04.140> but<00:03:04.739> it<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.040> what<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.400> and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
this function but it is what it is and

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.120 
this function but it is what it is and
then<00:03:06.030> here<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.780> know<00:03:06.870> basically<00:03:07.230> done<00:03:07.440> 20%

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
then here I you know basically done 20%

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.850 
then here I you know basically done 20%
which<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:09.480> might<00:03:09.630> want<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.900> paly<00:03:10.680> end<00:03:10.799> up

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
which you might want to paly end up

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.949 
which you might want to paly end up
something<00:03:11.040> like<00:03:11.190> 23<00:03:11.519> or<00:03:11.670> 24<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.360> get<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.660> low

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
something like 23 or 24 to get the low

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.170 
something like 23 or 24 to get the low
rpm<00:03:13.380> idle<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.860> this<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.819> when<00:03:15.090> you're

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
rpm idle and this this is when you're

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.580 
rpm idle and this this is when you're
actually<00:03:15.269> in<00:03:15.480> bail<00:03:15.810> out<00:03:15.959> your<00:03:15.989> bench<00:03:16.319> test

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
actually in bail out your bench test

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.960 
actually in bail out your bench test
again<00:03:16.799> I'll<00:03:16.920> show<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.340> next<00:03:17.459> video

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
again I'll show this in the next video

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.849 
again I'll show this in the next video
you're<00:03:18.329> adjusting<00:03:18.570> this<00:03:18.930> number<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.680> get<00:03:19.829> the

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
you're adjusting this number to get the

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.240 
you're adjusting this number to get the
idol<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.579> want<00:03:21.109> and<00:03:22.109> then<00:03:22.290> importantly

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
idol that you want and then importantly

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.520 
idol that you want and then importantly
down<00:03:23.700> here<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.120> want<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:24.810> have<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.200> mix

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
down here you want to just have this mix

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.069 
down here you want to just have this mix
active<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.190> throttle<00:03:26.850> hold<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:27.720> don't

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
active in throttle hold so you don't

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.809 
active in throttle hold so you don't
select<00:03:28.290> normal<00:03:28.769> you<00:03:29.069> don't<00:03:29.220> select<00:03:29.400> one<00:03:29.790> you

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
select normal you don't select one you

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.110 
select normal you don't select one you
know<00:03:30.120> select<00:03:30.420> two<00:03:30.739> so<00:03:31.739> that's<00:03:31.829> basically<00:03:32.310> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
know select two so that's basically the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.229 
know select two so that's basically the
the<00:03:33.780> setup<00:03:34.049> on<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.230> dx8

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.530 

and<00:03:40.239> then<00:03:40.540> on<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.810> DX<00:03:41.050> 18<00:03:42.030> it's<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.120> little<00:03:43.390> bit

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
and then on the DX 18 it's a little bit

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.839 
and then on the DX 18 it's a little bit
easier<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:44.260> do<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:45.510> here<00:03:47.580> it's<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.640> little<00:03:48.670> bit

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
easier to do so here it's a little bit

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.930 
easier to do so here it's a little bit
loud<00:03:49.090> so<00:03:49.420> I<00:03:49.450> go<00:03:49.629> to<00:03:49.690> channel<00:03:50.170> sign<00:03:50.379> and<00:03:50.909> what<00:03:51.909> I

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
loud so I go to channel sign and what I

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.039 
loud so I go to channel sign and what I
can<00:03:52.150> do<00:03:52.269> is<00:03:52.450> enjoy<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.810> next<00:03:53.140> screen<00:03:55.019> what<00:03:56.019> I

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
can do is enjoy the next screen what I

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.390 
can do is enjoy the next screen what I
do<00:03:56.140> is<00:03:56.379> I<00:03:56.500> say<00:03:56.680> ox-3

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
do is I say ox-3

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.390 
do is I say ox-3
to<00:03:58.299> chant<00:03:58.810> let<00:03:59.019> to<00:03:59.170> switch<00:03:59.470> ii<00:03:59.709> so<00:04:00.040> if<00:04:00.160> you<00:04:00.250> look

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
to chant let to switch ii so if you look

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.240 
to chant let to switch ii so if you look
right<00:04:00.519> here<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:01.750> is<00:04:01.810> switch<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.830> this<00:04:03.129> is

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
right here this is switch and this is

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.740 
right here this is switch and this is
the<00:04:03.310> same<00:04:03.489> flight<00:04:03.790> setup<00:04:04.090> flight<00:04:04.299> set<00:04:04.480> up<00:04:04.569> one

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
either one of these two positions so the

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.680 
either one of these two positions so the
way<00:04:11.440> I<00:04:11.470> use<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.709> is<00:04:12.040> it's<00:04:12.970> instead<00:04:13.299> of<00:04:13.390> one<00:04:13.569> when

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
way I use it is it's instead of one when

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.020 
way I use it is it's instead of one when
I<00:04:13.750> take<00:04:13.930> off<00:04:14.140> EC<00:04:14.650> won't<00:04:14.860> armed<00:04:15.129> unless<00:04:15.730> it's<00:04:15.910> in

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
I take off EC won't armed unless it's in

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.949 
I take off EC won't armed unless it's in
set<00:04:16.209> up<00:04:16.239> one<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:16.780> mean<00:04:17.500> my<00:04:18.539> slowest<00:04:19.539> head<00:04:19.690> speed

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
set up one I mean my slowest head speed

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.250 
set up one I mean my slowest head speed
I<00:04:20.280> flick<00:04:21.280> out<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.459> hold<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:22.060> take<00:04:22.570> off<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.139> go

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
I flick out a hold I take off and I go

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.040 
I flick out a hold I take off and I go
fly<00:04:23.639> if<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:24.820> wanted<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.240> use<00:04:25.330> bailout<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:25.810> armed

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
fly if I wanted to use bailout I armed

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.170 
fly if I wanted to use bailout I armed
it<00:04:26.229> and<00:04:26.380> then<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.370> can<00:04:27.520> hit<00:04:27.639> throttle<00:04:28.000> hold

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
it and then I can hit throttle hold

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.730 
it and then I can hit throttle hold
without<00:04:28.660> as<00:04:28.840> much<00:04:28.960> as<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.169> want<00:04:29.380> during<00:04:29.590> the

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
without as much as I want during the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.950 
without as much as I want during the
flight<00:04:29.949> and<00:04:30.520> that<00:04:30.729> works<00:04:30.940> really<00:04:31.240> well<00:04:32.160> ok<00:04:33.960> so

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
flight and that works really well ok so

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.040 
flight and that works really well ok so
we<00:04:35.020> go<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.500> main<00:04:35.620> menu<00:04:38.220> ok<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.780> here<00:04:40.960> I'm

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
we go to the main menu ok so here I'm

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.629 
we go to the main menu ok so here I'm
actually<00:04:41.169> using<00:04:41.440> tirado<00:04:41.860> curves<00:04:42.160> instead<00:04:42.550> of

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
actually using tirado curves instead of

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:43.980 
actually using tirado curves instead of
the<00:04:42.729> governor<00:04:43.090> menu<00:04:43.419> of<00:04:43.510> I'd<00:04:43.630> rather<00:04:43.750> use<00:04:43.960> the

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
the governor menu of I'd rather use the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.500 
the governor menu of I'd rather use the
governor<00:04:44.320> menu<00:04:44.530> but<00:04:44.680> I'm<00:04:44.740> not<00:04:44.860> for<00:04:45.099> now<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:46.360> so

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
governor menu but I'm not for now and so

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.120 
governor menu but I'm not for now and so
in<00:04:46.630> here<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.930> see<00:04:47.110> I've<00:04:47.229> got<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:48.099> three

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
in here you see I've got the three

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.339 
in here you see I've got the three
different<00:04:48.460> flight<00:04:48.820> modes<00:04:49.030> set<00:04:49.270> up<00:04:49.419> all<00:04:49.599> all<00:04:50.050> 3d

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
different flight modes set up all all 3d

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.830 
different flight modes set up all all 3d
flight<00:04:50.620> modes<00:04:50.860> number<00:04:51.220> 0<00:04:51.550> in<00:04:51.729> here<00:04:51.910> which<00:04:52.630> is

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
flight modes number 0 in here which is

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.190 
flight modes number 0 in here which is
great<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:54.910> then<00:04:55.150> what<00:04:55.419> I<00:04:55.450> do<00:04:55.539> is<00:04:55.660> I<00:04:56.020> go<00:04:56.169> to

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
great and then what I do is I go to

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.550 
great and then what I do is I go to
mixing<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:58.180> then<00:04:59.250> here<00:05:00.250> I've<00:05:00.400> got<00:05:00.580> the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
mixing and then here I've got the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.050 
mixing and then here I've got the
program<00:05:02.560> mix<00:05:02.950> 1<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.520> what<00:05:04.479> I've<00:05:04.599> done<00:05:04.780> is<00:05:05.169> e

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
program mix 1 and what I've done is e

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.250 
program mix 1 and what I've done is e
switch<00:05:07.060> e<00:05:07.090> so<00:05:07.510> here<00:05:07.539> I<00:05:07.720> can<00:05:07.900> actually<00:05:07.990> use<00:05:08.200> a

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
switch e so here I can actually use a

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.350 
switch e so here I can actually use a
switch<00:05:08.530> I<00:05:08.620> don't<00:05:08.770> have<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:08.979> dump<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:09.520> channel<00:05:09.880> to

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
switch I don't have to dump a channel to

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
switch I don't have to dump a channel to
make<00:05:10.510> this<00:05:10.599> would<00:05:10.840> work

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
make this would work

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.860 
make this would work
I've<00:05:11.680> got<00:05:11.830> e<00:05:12.039> to<00:05:12.070> throttle<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:13.090> then<00:05:13.599> here

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
I've got e to throttle and then here

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.500 
I've got e to throttle and then here
it's<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.740> negative<00:05:15.099> number<00:05:15.220> in<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.520> DX<00:05:15.880> 18<00:05:16.240> they

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
it's a negative number in the DX 18 they

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.700 
it's a negative number in the DX 18 they
changed<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.900> little<00:05:16.990> bit<00:05:17.169> of<00:05:17.260> how<00:05:17.320> they<00:05:17.440> do<00:05:17.500> it

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
changed a little bit of how they do it

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.010 
changed a little bit of how they do it
but<00:05:18.220> it's<00:05:18.370> minus<00:05:18.729> 24<00:05:19.150> percent<00:05:19.450> to<00:05:19.599> get<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:19.870> low

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
but it's minus 24 percent to get the low

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.980 
but it's minus 24 percent to get the low
rpm<00:05:20.410> that<00:05:20.560> I<00:05:20.590> want<00:05:21.060> during<00:05:22.060> bailout<00:05:22.599> so<00:05:22.810> I<00:05:22.840> have

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
rpm that I want during bailout so I have

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.460 
rpm that I want during bailout so I have
like<00:05:23.139> 100<00:05:23.289> 200<00:05:23.620> rpm<00:05:23.950> and<00:05:24.510> then<00:05:25.510> I<00:05:25.720> just<00:05:26.080> select

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
like 100 200 rpm and then I just select

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.770 
like 100 200 rpm and then I just select
a<00:05:26.830> whole<00:05:27.340> tube<00:05:27.700> only<00:05:27.820> be<00:05:28.030> active<00:05:28.360> in<00:05:28.539> flight

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
a whole tube only be active in flight

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.060 
a whole tube only be active in flight

mode hold not normal one or two and

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.770 
mode hold not normal one or two and
that's<00:05:33.070> pretty<00:05:33.310> much<00:05:33.490> it<00:05:33.729> for<00:05:33.760> that<00:05:33.970> so<00:05:34.660> now

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
that's pretty much it for that so now

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.430 
that's pretty much it for that so now
one<00:05:35.020> one<00:05:35.650> warning<00:05:36.449> this<00:05:37.449> is<00:05:37.660> what<00:05:37.900> I<00:05:37.990> pretty

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
one one warning this is what I pretty

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.500 
one one warning this is what I pretty

much consider this a current bug and how
its<00:05:40.660> implemented<00:05:40.960> because<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.800> doesn't

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
its implemented because it doesn't

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.750 
its implemented because it doesn't
happen<00:05:42.190> with<00:05:42.520> like<00:05:42.729> other<00:05:43.510> external<00:05:43.960> Governor

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
happen with like other external Governor

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.430 
happen with like other external Governor
500<00:05:45.760> systems<00:05:46.150> that<00:05:46.270> I've<00:05:46.360> used<00:05:46.599> so<00:05:47.200> what<00:05:47.349> can

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
500 systems that I've used so what can

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.159 
500 systems that I've used so what can
happen<00:05:47.620> is

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
happen is

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.689 
happen is
when<00:05:48.499> you<00:05:48.590> first<00:05:48.770> power<00:05:49.009> in<00:05:49.129> the<00:05:49.219> model<00:05:49.490> you're

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:49.699 
when you first power in the model you're

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.149 
when you first power in the model you're
in<00:05:49.849> hold<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:50.780> esc<00:05:51.110> arms<00:05:51.409> if<00:05:51.740> you<00:05:51.889> happen

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
in hold and the esc arms if you happen

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.029 
in hold and the esc arms if you happen
to<00:05:52.189> be<00:05:52.280> in<00:05:52.490> flight<00:05:52.699> set<00:05:53.060> up<00:05:53.210> two<00:05:53.840> or<00:05:53.990> three

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
to be in flight set up two or three

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.260 
to be in flight set up two or three
because<00:05:55.039> you've<00:05:55.249> now<00:05:55.400> you<00:05:55.699> have<00:05:55.849> this<00:05:55.939> mix

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
because you've now you have this mix

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.969 
because you've now you have this mix
that<00:05:56.509> you<00:05:56.599> see<00:05:56.810> won't<00:05:56.990> arms<00:05:57.379> so<00:05:57.650> with<00:05:57.919> the

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
that you see won't arms so with the

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.459 
that you see won't arms so with the
castle<00:05:58.340> you<00:05:58.430> won't<00:05:58.580> hear<00:05:58.729> the<00:05:58.939> arming<00:05:59.689> beep<00:05:59.900> so

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:00.469 
castle you won't hear the arming beep so

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:02.170 
castle you won't hear the arming beep so
you<00:06:00.529> got<00:06:00.680> to<00:06:00.770> be<00:06:00.889> in<00:06:01.039> set<00:06:01.219> up<00:06:01.249> one<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:01.789> it<00:06:01.879> arms

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
you got to be in set up one and it arms

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.269 
you got to be in set up one and it arms
okay<00:06:02.689> once<00:06:02.900> it<00:06:03.020> arms<00:06:03.319> if<00:06:03.949> you're<00:06:04.069> on<00:06:04.189> the

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279 
okay once it arms if you're on the

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.550 
okay once it arms if you're on the
ground<00:06:04.370> normally<00:06:04.999> flip<00:06:05.599> out<00:06:05.719> a<00:06:05.749> hole<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.349> spool

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
ground normally flip out a hole to spool

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.830 
ground normally flip out a hole to spool
up<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.770> model<00:06:07.039> well<00:06:07.849> now<00:06:08.060> if<00:06:08.389> you<00:06:08.509> happen<00:06:08.810> to

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
up the model well now if you happen to

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.959 
up the model well now if you happen to
flip<00:06:09.349> this<00:06:09.499> switch<00:06:09.620> down<00:06:09.979> to<00:06:10.310> set<00:06:10.520> up<00:06:10.639> two<00:06:10.849> or

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
flip this switch down to set up two or

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.119 
flip this switch down to set up two or
three<00:06:10.999> the<00:06:11.659> model<00:06:12.050> will<00:06:12.199> spool<00:06:12.499> up<00:06:12.710> to<00:06:12.979> your

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:13.129 
three the model will spool up to your

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.360 
three the model will spool up to your
slow<00:06:13.490> rpm<00:06:14.259> so<00:06:15.259> there's<00:06:15.590> really<00:06:15.860> two<00:06:15.979> switches

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.370 
slow rpm so there's really two switches

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.309 
slow rpm so there's really two switches
now<00:06:16.639> that<00:06:16.909> cause<00:06:17.090> the<00:06:17.330> rotors<00:06:17.629> to<00:06:17.840> turn<00:06:18.020> won't

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
now that cause the rotors to turn won't

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.409 
now that cause the rotors to turn won't
go<00:06:18.439> to<00:06:18.499> full<00:06:18.740> speed<00:06:19.069> it's<00:06:19.490> not<00:06:19.550> dangerous<00:06:20.240> like

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
go to full speed it's not dangerous like

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.809 
go to full speed it's not dangerous like
throttle<00:06:21.110> as<00:06:21.259> dangerous<00:06:21.680> as<00:06:21.860> throttle<00:06:22.189> but<00:06:22.729> is

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
throttle as dangerous as throttle but is

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:25.929 
throttle as dangerous as throttle but is
something<00:06:23.180> to<00:06:23.330> note<00:06:23.590> the<00:06:24.590> the<00:06:24.729> flap<00:06:25.729> of<00:06:25.879> the

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:25.939 
something to note the the flap of the

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:28.240 
something to note the the flap of the
system<00:06:26.240> what<00:06:26.360> it<00:06:26.449> should<00:06:26.629> do<00:06:26.779> is<00:06:27.020> not<00:06:27.979> allow

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
system what it should do is not allow

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.550 
system what it should do is not allow
you<00:06:28.310> to<00:06:28.460> pass<00:06:28.669> a<00:06:28.729> slow<00:06:29.120> rpm<00:06:29.300> until<00:06:30.259> it's

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
you to pass a slow rpm until it's

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.589 
you to pass a slow rpm until it's
reached<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:30.949> head<00:06:31.879> that<00:06:32.029> hits<00:06:32.180> the<00:06:32.419> target

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
reached the head that hits the target

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.659 
reached the head that hits the target
head<00:06:32.870> speed<00:06:33.080> once<00:06:33.379> then<00:06:34.039> it<00:06:34.219> allows<00:06:34.400> it<00:06:34.639> to

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
head speed once then it allows it to

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.490 
head speed once then it allows it to
pass<00:06:34.879> it<00:06:35.120> through<00:06:35.240> and<00:06:35.539> this<00:06:36.080> makes<00:06:36.379> it

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
pass it through and this makes it

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.670 
pass it through and this makes it
possible<00:06:37.009> to<00:06:37.699> use<00:06:37.729> es<00:06:38.180> es<00:06:38.539> like<00:06:38.779> castle<00:06:39.229> that

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
possible to use es es like castle that

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.529 
possible to use es es like castle that
have<00:06:39.830> their<00:06:39.979> own<00:06:40.009> soft<00:06:40.400> start<00:06:40.669> instead<00:06:41.449> of

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:41.539 
have their own soft start instead of

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:43.629 
have their own soft start instead of
only<00:06:41.689> using<00:06:41.870> the<00:06:42.080> soft<00:06:42.319> start<00:06:42.500> built<00:06:43.129> into<00:06:43.490> the

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
only using the soft start built into the

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.760 
only using the soft start built into the
icon<00:06:44.000> and<00:06:44.210> you<00:06:44.270> know<00:06:44.930> you<00:06:45.020> really<00:06:45.349> want<00:06:45.529> to<00:06:45.620> use

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
icon and you know you really want to use

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.350 
icon and you know you really want to use
the<00:06:45.979> soft<00:06:46.189> start<00:06:46.339> in<00:06:46.520> the<00:06:46.580> ESC<00:06:46.939> since<00:06:47.180> it's<00:06:47.300> a

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
the soft start in the ESC since it's a

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.179 
the soft start in the ESC since it's a
lot<00:06:47.479> smoother<00:06:47.930> so<00:06:48.589> that's<00:06:48.710> a<00:06:48.770> note<00:06:48.919> of<00:06:49.039> caution

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:49.189 
lot smoother so that's a note of caution

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:52.029 
lot smoother so that's a note of caution
I'm<00:06:49.969> hoping<00:06:50.300> they'll<00:06:50.900> fix<00:06:51.080> it<00:06:51.229> in<00:06:51.349> a<00:06:51.499> later

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 
I'm hoping they'll fix it in a later

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:53.920 
I'm hoping they'll fix it in a later
release<00:06:52.430> but<00:06:52.909> for<00:06:53.089> now<00:06:53.180> just<00:06:53.389> remember<00:06:53.539> that

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
release but for now just remember that

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.839 
release but for now just remember that
once<00:06:54.770> you're<00:06:54.919> on<00:06:54.949> the<00:06:55.129> ground<00:06:55.339> and<00:06:55.610> your<00:06:55.699> arm

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:55.849 
once you're on the ground and your arm

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.100 
once you're on the ground and your arm
you<00:06:56.060> don't<00:06:56.150> want<00:06:56.330> to<00:06:56.389> bump<00:06:56.539> the<00:06:56.659> switch<00:06:56.900> while

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
you don't want to bump the switch while

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.600 
you don't want to bump the switch while
you're<00:06:57.229> carrying<00:06:57.409> the<00:06:57.650> model<00:06:57.949> because<00:06:58.490> it

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
you're carrying the model because it

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.179 
you're carrying the model because it
will<00:06:58.729> start<00:06:59.000> turning<00:06:59.500> so<00:07:00.500> if<00:07:00.740> you<00:07:00.830> know<00:07:00.949> it's<00:07:01.099> a

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:01.189 
will start turning so if you know it's a

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:03.610 
will start turning so if you know it's a
bad<00:07:01.310> thing<00:07:01.370> if<00:07:02.300> you<00:07:02.659> if<00:07:02.960> you're<00:07:03.169> worried<00:07:03.560> about

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
bad thing if you if you're worried about

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.920 
bad thing if you if you're worried about
this<00:07:03.949> you<00:07:04.129> can<00:07:04.279> put<00:07:04.729> the<00:07:04.909> ESC<00:07:05.360> in<00:07:05.479> bulky<00:07:05.750> rotor

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
this you can put the ESC in bulky rotor

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.100 
this you can put the ESC in bulky rotor
mode<00:07:06.229> and<00:07:06.469> then<00:07:07.330> it<00:07:08.330> won't<00:07:08.449> have<00:07:08.689> that<00:07:08.719> problem

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
mode and then it won't have that problem

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.570 
mode and then it won't have that problem
because<00:07:09.889> you<00:07:10.069> don't<00:07:10.099> have<00:07:10.279> to<00:07:10.370> worry<00:07:10.490> about

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
because you don't have to worry about

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.829 
because you don't have to worry about
the<00:07:10.699> soft<00:07:10.909> start<00:07:11.060> but<00:07:11.240> then<00:07:11.360> you<00:07:11.449> can't<00:07:11.750> use

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:11.839 
the soft start but then you can't use

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.570 
the soft start but then you can't use
idle<00:07:12.259> and<00:07:12.379> bail<00:07:12.529> out<00:07:12.649> meaning<00:07:13.129> you<00:07:13.219> can't<00:07:13.399> have

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
idle and bail out meaning you can't have

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.909 
idle and bail out meaning you can't have
that<00:07:13.729> low<00:07:13.879> rpm<00:07:14.330> that<00:07:14.870> makes<00:07:15.080> the<00:07:15.229> this<00:07:15.500> pull<00:07:15.770> up

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
that low rpm that makes the this pull up

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:17.769 
that low rpm that makes the this pull up
a<00:07:15.949> lot<00:07:16.129> smoother<00:07:16.520> during<00:07:16.819> a<00:07:16.849> bailout<00:07:17.149> so

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:17.779 
a lot smoother during a bailout so

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:19.360 
a lot smoother during a bailout so
there's<00:07:18.169> some<00:07:18.349> pluses<00:07:18.529> and<00:07:18.770> minuses<00:07:19.099> here<00:07:19.279> if

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
there's some pluses and minuses here if

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.920 
there's some pluses and minuses here if
you're<00:07:19.520> willing<00:07:19.759> to<00:07:19.819> live<00:07:20.000> with<00:07:20.029> this<00:07:20.180> you<00:07:20.810> can

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930 
you're willing to live with this you can

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.559 
you're willing to live with this you can
live<00:07:21.080> with<00:07:21.199> it<00:07:21.550> otherwise<00:07:22.550> you<00:07:23.060> can<00:07:23.180> use<00:07:23.210> multi

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:23.569 
live with it otherwise you can use multi

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:24.939 
live with it otherwise you can use multi
rotor<00:07:23.719> mode<00:07:24.020> and<00:07:24.259> in<00:07:24.319> hand<00:07:24.469> everything<00:07:24.830> off

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:24.949 
rotor mode and in hand everything off

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:27.429 
rotor mode and in hand everything off
and<00:07:24.979> just<00:07:25.639> have<00:07:25.759> a<00:07:25.789> little<00:07:26.719> bit<00:07:26.839> harder<00:07:27.199> soft

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:27.439 
and just have a little bit harder soft

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:31.449 
and just have a little bit harder soft
start<00:07:27.789> okay<00:07:28.789> thanks<00:07:29.360> a<00:07:29.419> lot
