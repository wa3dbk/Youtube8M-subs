00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.420
 I'll show you how to twist your twist 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.460
 can knit mesh dreary one needs 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.840
 if you should be in it strictly 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.000
 wants to integrate diagonal lines 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.130
 That's two kinds of things 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.739
 through normal scratched stitches 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.829
 we have them down here but you see 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:27.270
 now they are not special either 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.790
 even some funds are something 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.710
 smaller and the other funds are something 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.690
 greater 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.300
 Personally, I do not like that at all 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.070
 I think that's very ugly and that's why 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.750
 in such a case I prefer to use the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.800
 Sorry mesh you can here above 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 First of all, the leagues are even more beautiful 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.000
 three-dimensional on top 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.450
 and second, the fists are all too 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.460
 almost the same size and therefore knits 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.770
 I prefer tourist in such a case 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.270
 mesh and how they go I show you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.750
 of course again without tools 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.360
 We knit to the spot 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.979
 so now comes a left twist the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.229
 Your next button will need to wash yours 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.770
 swap places and the first should 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.870
 lay on top of it diagonally 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.260
 We have to do that for once 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.170
 take off and turn back on the 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.690
 lift left needle 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.010
 now the second stitch is behind 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.190
 Knitted right and then comes now 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.720
 the trick through both stitches through yet 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.570
 knit once to the right 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.880
 so now you can see here is the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.150
 mesh diagonally on top and the second 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.530
 mesh is behind it shows you 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.159
 again the link to is therefore a mass 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.590
 take off 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.979
 the next stitch also take off both 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.580
 again turned on the left needle and 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.460
 then sting the second one at the back 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:04.229
 knit right and now both together 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:08.189
 knitted right wonderful is missing us 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.439
 still the right twist heavy word like that 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:13.510
 now these two meshes would have to be hers 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:15.099
 exchange space 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.060
 it's even easier now 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.189
 Knitted just like the first time 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.099
 to stretch right together through both 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:26.560
 mesh through then you pull that way 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:31.260
 a bit apart and knits the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:37.120
 first stitch just right again 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:40.359
 and there lies the transverse mesh and 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.129
 again shows again so how 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:49.060
 knit together to the right 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:51.639
 both machines at the same time then 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.690
 pull apart and the first stitch 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:59.040
 again quite stretch so I strictly 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.040
 just to the end of the series 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.900
 now you can look wonderful 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.159
 The stitches are the same 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.900
 big diagonally on top of the return journey at 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.909
 the return journey would be easy now 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.909
 knit all stitches as usual on the left 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.870
 I wish you much fun with it
