00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.860
 my son when I was ten years old against ten women 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.020
 for the first time 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.469
 become house 32 all his life 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.919
 I lived with fear 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.980
 the arrival of the dance venue, she expressed her wish several times 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.680
 we see very depressed and the sum that is in front of the window the room above virologist 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.899
 look outside and feel the league 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.619
 dismal 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.129
 pressure from depression that was so heavy that was so pathetic 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.020
 I find the face of saw in that fight 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.520
 and the worst thing has been that way all these years 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.020
 Wilders called it incredibly difficult to accept that a band could 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.500
 to be 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.800
 years before 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.289
 it's been a while since i've got you that thought 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.450
 as prime minister 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.880
 I might have anyway 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.550
 the limits of the law of large numbers and the concrete environment 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.550
 conversations about I dared with not of course 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.070
 the parents anyway 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.960
 The rule is to see how the can actually be done 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.160
 it is double 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.700
 I get you if you love someone the winter weather is now briefly and then you are 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.970
 not that the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.780
 2 this is so it says the fixer is wrong 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.120
 previously, the last six months were conditional 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.510
 it is a bottomless woman and a man once most beautiful a protocol 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.850
 we were more and more people to hold through it is already purchasing 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.760
 he gives an example for ajax come 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.580
 the spokesperson you can be happy that I am here 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.580
 hattem next to the cafe that its like to jump 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.530
 and I say to the right of the judge where you did that is not because 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.730
 I own a branch 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.260
 I have to imagine if you could always get that head then 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.200
 It doesn't happen and I was there every year 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.210
 I think too 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.260
 what i know now i know what i thought then long ago 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.900
 I think so too 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.350
 I assume that 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.180
 actually not really not really talking about death, you actually didn't 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.659
 really 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.660
 never ever 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.770
 this not as a serious option but I say why 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.309
 which not 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:12.009
 it was a very special five-year assistance 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.299
 always focused on 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.319
 main road 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.639
 that way that trying to do this comes according to meijer 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.719
 if I could become one and never observed a moment of silence yes 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.749
 cancel it by the end of next year and only one 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:36.339
 conditional release still acts and yes so do you again 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.960
 terrain 50 meters apart not exactly what and how 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.369
 and you try is what they like 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:47.349
 But otherwise there is a lot of learning not that big ready to put that basket 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.059
 a real help 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.469
 he has asked for a spacious civitate or was unable to pass 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.909
 he talked about it with another sign up for free 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.229
 but can therefore return from one 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.909
 my heart did not go into it 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:03.489
 the Hague
