and see how the knit purl knit into the
stitch<00:02:11.680> for<00:02:12.459> three<00:02:12.750> leaves<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:17.910> larger

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
stitch for three leaves this a larger

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.940 
stitch for three leaves this a larger
hole<00:02:19.379> then<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:21.420> other<00:02:22.420> than<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.290> knit<00:02:23.739> yarn

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
hole then the other than the knit yarn

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.460 
hole then the other than the knit yarn
over<00:02:24.280> knit<00:02:24.459> one<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.799> there's<00:02:26.799> this<00:02:27.160> extra

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
over knit one and there's this extra

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.770 
over knit one and there's this extra
yarn<00:02:29.470> kind<00:02:29.799> of<00:02:29.890> building<00:02:30.190> up<00:02:30.280> here<00:02:30.780> smaller

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
yarn kind of building up here smaller

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.580 
yarn kind of building up here smaller
hole<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:33.099> seems<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.610> just<00:02:33.970> kind<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.690> grow<00:02:35.140> from

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
hole it seems to just kind of grow from

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.050 
hole it seems to just kind of grow from
the<00:02:35.709> stitch<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.040> little<00:02:36.069> bit<00:02:36.400> more<00:02:36.610> organically

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
the stitch a little bit more organically

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.940 
the stitch a little bit more organically
and<00:02:38.129> it's<00:02:39.129> very<00:02:39.430> easy<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.730> do<00:02:40.079> so<00:02:41.079> that's<00:02:41.799> the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
and it's very easy to do so that's the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.670 
and it's very easy to do so that's the
one<00:02:42.069> I<00:02:42.099> like<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.489> use
