00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:06.750
 it's confirmed 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.790
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.000
 it would be printed and we are in a new 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.190
 news from microsoft and its xbox one and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.439
 is that it seems that what is coming 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.990
 being the company is not only changing 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.600
 your policies already know internal the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.640
 company policies you know that the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.210
 have changed from e3 to here the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.949
 has changed by adapting but to the profile 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.350
 of users you already know that is very 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.309
 well on the one hand and on the other hand 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.800
 creates distrust because this time it seems 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.989
 be that microsoft is changing us 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.629
 internal policies but they have also 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.460
 opted to make some modifications 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.850
 of the console hardware and in this 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.569
 case of the cpu remember what it does 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.850
 a few weeks I told you that with the gpu 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:56.969
 open good they had increased by 6% more 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.089
 and now he has confirmed it 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.559
 yusuf mehdi xbox marketing manager 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.929
 who in one of his last 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.290
 statements and appearances in the press 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:11.270
 noted that the cpu of xbox one 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.580
 and its frequency from 16 to 175 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.610
 megahertz apart from that the cpu of the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.680
 gpu forgiveness would increase by 6% therefore 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.460
 follow the internal changes of the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.710
 console at least 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.299
 they follow the changes they have had in 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.890
 mind this they did not have it in mind 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.560
 but that the changes within the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.930
 console apart from the gpu now touch it 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.460
 the CPU going from 1.6 to 1.75 megahertz 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.140
 I want you to tell me the connoisseurs 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.890
 of the battery this is what can 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.409
 influence I guess more power I think 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.210
 I do not know I want you to tell me and 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.860
 if you like these changes 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.110
 Sudden hardware in the console to 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.720
 just a couple of months from the departure of 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.330
 the console so maybe this already 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.850
 They had in mind for months and already has 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.869
 finalized is that I do not know but now what 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.920
