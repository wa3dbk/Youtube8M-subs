through<00:01:12.580> a<00:01:12.610> nether<00:01:12.850> gate<00:01:13.119> at<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.329> same<00:01:13.509> time

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
through a nether gate at the same time

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.179 
through a nether gate at the same time
and<00:01:13.960> fixes<00:01:14.259> for<00:01:14.289> players<00:01:14.649> being<00:01:14.890> invisible

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
and fixes for players being invisible

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.010 
and fixes for players being invisible
after<00:01:15.640> teleporting<00:01:16.149> until<00:01:16.420> either<00:01:16.570> they<00:01:16.810> move

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
after teleporting until either they move

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.440 
after teleporting until either they move
or<00:01:17.259> that<00:01:17.770> player<00:01:18.070> sees<00:01:18.399> them<00:01:18.670> as<00:01:18.789> invisible

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
or that player sees them as invisible

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.590 
or that player sees them as invisible
moves<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:21.149> essentially<00:01:22.149> there<00:01:22.270> was<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.450> bunch

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
moves so essentially there was a bunch

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.209 
moves so essentially there was a bunch
of<00:01:22.719> invisibility<00:01:23.079> go<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.500> that<00:01:23.619> I<00:01:23.649> had<00:01:23.829> no<00:01:23.950> idea

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
of invisibility go to that I had no idea

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.620 
of invisibility go to that I had no idea
about<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.640> I<00:01:24.700> don't<00:01:24.850> know<00:01:24.939> if<00:01:25.030> you<00:01:25.119> guys<00:01:25.270> had
