the cards that are less than nine not
equal<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.260> or<00:02:25.440> higher<00:02:25.610> so<00:02:26.610> 5<00:02:27.030> 3<00:02:27.480> &amp;<00:02:27.510> 4<00:02:27.810> we<00:02:28.019> add

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
equal to or higher so 5 3 &amp; 4 we add

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.660 
equal to or higher so 5 3 &amp; 4 we add
those<00:02:28.320> together<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.709> get<00:02:28.799> 12<00:02:29.070> is<00:02:29.250> 12<00:02:29.489> higher

those together we get 12 is 12 higher
the<00:02:29.849> night<00:02:30.060> yes<00:02:30.690> then<00:02:30.989> we<00:02:31.110> filled<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.470> picture

cards now we will add the numbers that
are<00:02:55.780> less<00:02:56.140> than<00:02:56.800> nine<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.400> 10<00:02:57.580> doesn't

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
are less than nine so the 10 doesn't

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.790 
are less than nine so the 10 doesn't
count<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.780> two<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.140> three<00:02:59.320> or<00:02:59.410> less<00:02:59.500> at<00:02:59.680> nine

we haven't filled the picture up which

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.820 
we haven't filled the picture up which

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
and it's going to play very differently

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.800 
and it's going to play very differently
with<00:04:05.410> both<00:04:05.760> with<00:04:06.760> three<00:04:07.030> people<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.600> chance

of<00:04:07.990> you<00:04:08.140> taking<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.680> picture<00:04:09.010> is<00:04:09.100> going<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.250> be

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
of you taking the picture is going to be

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.660 
of you taking the picture is going to be
much<00:04:09.550> higher<00:04:10.140> with<00:04:11.140> four<00:04:11.350> people<00:04:11.740> you<00:04:12.280> can<00:04:12.430> get

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
much higher with four people you can get

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.830 
much higher with four people you can get
away<00:04:12.760> without<00:04:12.940> taking<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.420> picture<00:04:13.720> very

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
away without taking the picture very

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.729 
away without taking the picture very
often<00:04:18.720> all<00:04:19.720> right<00:04:19.900> if<00:04:20.140> it's<00:04:20.290> running<00:04:20.410> too<00:04:20.530> dry

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
often all right if it's running too dry

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.990 
often all right if it's running too dry
for<00:04:20.770> you<00:04:21.570> does<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:22.690> one<00:04:22.810> drive<00:04:23.050> for<00:04:23.230> us<00:04:24.000> okay

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
for you does it one drive for us okay

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.570 
for you does it one drive for us okay
well<00:04:25.150> here's<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.390> deal<00:04:25.600> it's<00:04:26.560> possible<00:04:27.310> we're

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
well here's the deal it's possible we're

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.890 
well here's the deal it's possible we're
trick-taking<00:04:27.910> game<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.360> feel<00:04:28.540> like<00:04:28.720> they're

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
trick-taking game to feel like they're

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.190 
trick-taking game to feel like they're
on<00:04:28.930> autopilot<00:04:29.500> yep<00:04:30.220> I<00:04:30.430> mean<00:04:30.910> it's<00:04:31.210> if<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:32.050> play

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
on autopilot yep I mean it's if you play

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.290 
on autopilot yep I mean it's if you play
hearts<00:04:32.530> all<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.800> time<00:04:32.950> online<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:34.090> be<00:04:34.210> an

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
hearts all the time online is to be an

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.970 
hearts all the time online is to be an
autumn<00:04:34.510> pilot<00:04:34.750> in<00:04:34.810> fact<00:04:34.990> this<00:04:35.110> reminded<00:04:35.710> me<00:04:35.800> a

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
autumn pilot in fact this reminded me a

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.159 
autumn pilot in fact this reminded me a
little<00:04:36.280> of<00:04:36.460> hearts<00:04:36.870> except<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:37.930> was<00:04:38.020> more

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
little of hearts except it was more

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.890 
little of hearts except it was more
complicated<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.890> scoring<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.690> that's<00:04:40.690> where

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
complicated the scoring and that's where

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.930 
complicated the scoring and that's where
my<00:04:41.050> biggest<00:04:41.440> problem<00:04:41.770> with<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.950> game<00:04:42.160> is<00:04:42.340> is<00:04:42.550> I

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
my biggest problem with the game is is I

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.410 
my biggest problem with the game is is I
think<00:04:43.000> it's

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
think it's

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.650 
think it's
is<00:04:44.450> too<00:04:44.720> complex<00:04:45.350> for<00:04:45.530> what<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:45.950> is<00:04:45.980> I<00:04:46.510> got<00:04:47.510> sit

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
is too complex for what it is I got sit

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.030 
is too complex for what it is I got sit
there<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:47.870> say<00:04:47.960> okay<00:04:48.200> we<00:04:48.350> add<00:04:48.470> these<00:04:48.650> up<00:04:48.710> is

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
there and say okay we add these up is

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.250 
there and say okay we add these up is
that<00:04:49.340> number<00:04:49.550> higher<00:04:50.240> than<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.960> picture

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
that number higher than the picture

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.230 
that number higher than the picture
number<00:04:51.410> then<00:04:51.920> yes<00:04:52.190> then<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:52.520> take<00:04:52.730> it<00:04:52.880> that<00:04:53.030> no

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
number then yes then you take it that no

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.960 
number then yes then you take it that no
then<00:04:53.540> this<00:04:53.660> happens<00:04:54.130> it's<00:04:55.130> not<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.400> it's<00:04:55.700> too

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
then this happens it's not that it's too

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.990 
then this happens it's not that it's too
hard<00:04:56.330> it's<00:04:56.870> just<00:04:57.230> that<00:04:57.940> it's<00:04:58.960> unnecessary

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
hard it's just that it's unnecessary

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.160 
hard it's just that it's unnecessary
it's<00:05:02.000> just<00:05:02.270> another<00:05:02.540> trick<00:05:02.750> taking

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
it's just another trick taking

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.640 
it's just another trick taking
trick-taking<00:05:03.830> game<00:05:03.860> with<00:05:04.670> a<00:05:05.650> convoluted

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
trick-taking game with a convoluted

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.160 
trick-taking game with a convoluted
scoring<00:05:07.100> system<00:05:07.460> that's<00:05:07.790> all<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.270> is<00:05:08.300> yeah<00:05:09.140> I

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
scoring system that's all it is yeah I

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.210 
scoring system that's all it is yeah I
didn't<00:05:09.500> feel<00:05:09.590> like<00:05:09.650> there<00:05:09.890> was<00:05:09.950> anything

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
didn't feel like there was anything

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.210 
didn't feel like there was anything
really<00:05:10.610> that<00:05:10.730> new<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.750> unusual<00:05:12.110> no<00:05:12.980> I<00:05:13.010> mean

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
really that new and unusual no I mean

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.770 
really that new and unusual no I mean
that<00:05:13.370> every<00:05:13.610> trick<00:05:13.790> to<00:05:13.910> game<00:05:14.090> has<00:05:14.330> a<00:05:14.360> break

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
that every trick to game has a break

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.710 
that every trick to game has a break
brand<00:05:15.230> new<00:05:15.410> ground<00:05:15.740> but<00:05:16.550> then<00:05:16.760> why<00:05:17.270> do<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.510> want

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
brand new ground but then why do I want

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.630 
brand new ground but then why do I want
to<00:05:17.750> own<00:05:17.900> this<00:05:18.110> over<00:05:18.470> any<00:05:18.620> of<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:18.920> established
