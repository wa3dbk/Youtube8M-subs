okay here's another exercise where you
put<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.020> cap<00:02:09.200> on<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.530> seventh<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.240> only<00:02:11.240> on

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
put the cap on the seventh and only on

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.440 
put the cap on the seventh and only on
the<00:02:11.480> four<00:02:11.780> high<00:02:12.320> strings<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.610> e<00:02:13.850> is<00:02:14.000> normal

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
the four high strings so the e is normal

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.700 
the four high strings so the e is normal
and<00:02:14.660> then<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:16.040> normal<00:02:16.570> what<00:02:17.620> another<00:02:18.620> thing

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
and then a is normal what another thing

have to put them on all strings hell of
a<00:03:22.239> job<00:03:22.449> to<00:03:22.810> put<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.019> mine<00:03:23.199> you<00:03:23.319> betta<00:03:23.620> awesome<00:03:24.010> I

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
a job to put a mine you betta awesome I

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.250 
a job to put a mine you betta awesome I
did<00:03:25.810> it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
did it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.459 
did it
and<00:03:26.439> here's<00:03:26.680> an<00:03:26.799> example<00:03:26.859> of<00:03:28.049> how<00:03:29.049> it<00:03:29.260> looks

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:29.469 
and here's an example of how it looks

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:34.860 
and here's an example of how it looks
like<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.459> I<00:03:30.489> put<00:03:30.879> it<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.769> low<00:03:32.769> E<00:03:33.599> that's<00:03:34.599> now

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
like so I put it on the low E that's now

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.020 
like so I put it on the low E that's now
a<00:03:34.900> key<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:36.419> eighth<00:03:37.419> normal<00:03:37.989> D<00:03:38.260> is<00:03:38.319> normal<00:03:38.889> d<00:03:39.489> G

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
a key and eighth normal D is normal d G

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.649 
a key and eighth normal D is normal d G
is<00:03:40.150> normal<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:42.010> I've<00:03:42.129> put<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.549> on<00:03:42.699> the<00:03:42.819> B<00:03:43.030> so

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
is normal and I've put it on the B so

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.749 
is normal and I've put it on the B so
that's<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.019> D<00:03:44.199> now<00:03:45.000> this<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.150> ie<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:48.370> here's<00:03:48.669> an

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:48.759 
that's the D now this is ie so here's an

00:03:48.759 --> 00:04:23.460 
that's the D now this is ie so here's an
example<00:03:49.090> with

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:31.480 

you

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.550 

you
