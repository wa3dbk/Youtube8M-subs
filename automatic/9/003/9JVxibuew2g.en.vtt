00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.560 

we<00:04:41.550> weren't<00:04:41.640> expecting<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:42.210> were<00:04:42.390> you

apparently ah gave up already all right
I'm<00:04:50.760> gonna<00:04:50.880> do<00:04:51.150> another<00:04:51.390> one<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.630> those<00:04:51.840> but

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
I'm gonna do another one of those but

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.260 
I'm gonna do another one of those but
I'll<00:04:52.650> put<00:04:52.860> in<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:52.980> separate<00:04:53.400> video<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.730> guess<00:04:54.060> I

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
I'll put in a separate video I guess I

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.480 
I'll put in a separate video I guess I
know<00:04:54.330> that's<00:04:54.600> kind<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:54.930> short<00:04:55.230> but<00:04:55.620> whatever

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
know that's kind of short but whatever

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.550 
know that's kind of short but whatever
that<00:04:56.820> was<00:04:57.270> definitely<00:04:57.780> more<00:04:57.900> of<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.140> practice

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
that was definitely more of a practice

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.990 
that was definitely more of a practice
run<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:59.070> could<00:04:59.220> have<00:04:59.310> done<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.460> a<00:04:59.610> lot<00:04:59.820> better

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
run I could have done that a lot better

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.450 
run I could have done that a lot better
so<00:05:00.750> I'm<00:05:01.020> glad<00:05:01.169> that<00:05:01.290> wasn't<00:05:01.470> a<00:05:01.680> decent<00:05:02.100> run

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
so I'm glad that wasn't a decent run

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.090 
so I'm glad that wasn't a decent run
because<00:05:03.330> he<00:05:03.690> gave<00:05:03.870> up<00:05:04.050> too<00:05:04.260> easy<00:05:04.440> anyway<00:05:04.680> so<00:05:05.090> he
