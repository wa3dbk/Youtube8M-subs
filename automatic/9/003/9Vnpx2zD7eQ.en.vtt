00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
but in this one I'm going to explain the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:23.150

Odin strike so here we go okay so

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.590 
Odin strike so here we go okay so
there's<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.580> lot<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> people<00:00:24.000> out<00:00:24.269> there<00:00:24.300> that

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
think that the Odin strike is the next

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.509 
think that the Odin strike is the next
nuke<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.269> that's<00:00:27.990> not<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:29.340> not

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
nuke and that's not what it is it's not

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.370 
nuke and that's not what it is it's not
a<00:00:29.580> kill<00:00:29.880> streak<00:00:30.000> do<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.929> see<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> briefcase

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
floating right in front of me it's there

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.240 
floating right in front of me it's there
because<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.840> think<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.440> teammates<00:00:34.920> got

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
a kill in that area or perhaps I got a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.389 
a kill in that area or perhaps I got a
kill<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.649> area<00:00:37.950> recently
