window motor and you lift it up and out
okay

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
okay

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.470 
okay
and<00:02:16.660> then<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.870> got<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.080> reach<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.260> and

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
and then you got to reach in and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.199 
and then you got to reach in and
disconnect<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:21.430> wiring<00:02:21.640> harness

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
disconnect the wiring harness

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.790 
disconnect the wiring harness
I<00:02:22.239> can't<00:02:22.900> like<00:02:23.050> film<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:23.500> I'm<00:02:23.620> going<00:02:23.769> to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
I can't like film it so I'm going to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.050 
I can't like film it so I'm going to
show<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.310> afterwards<00:02:26.970> loosen<00:02:27.970> up

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
show it to you afterwards loosen up

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:37.350 
show it to you afterwards loosen up
pretty<00:02:28.300> good<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.190> now<00:02:36.970> you're<00:02:37.180> going<00:02:37.299> to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
pretty good and now you're going to

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.280 
pretty good and now you're going to
remove<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:38.230> bolt<00:02:38.470> here<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:42.930> already<00:02:43.930> loosened

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
remove this bolt here I already loosened

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.470 
remove this bolt here I already loosened
it<00:02:46.019> then<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:47.110> got<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.380> lift<00:02:47.560> up<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:49.269> you'll

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
it then you got to lift up and you'll

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.530 
it then you got to lift up and you'll
see<00:02:49.570> these<00:02:49.989> two<00:02:50.410> bolts<00:02:51.209> go<00:02:52.209> into<00:02:52.660> larger<00:02:53.410> holes

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
see these two bolts go into larger holes

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:04.330 
see these two bolts go into larger holes
now<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:57.489> roots<00:02:57.730> keep<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.120> kind<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:58.480> forward

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:23.750 

one<00:03:05.340> more<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:05.940> with<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:16.490> eventually<00:03:22.760> comes

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
one more here with it eventually comes

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.330 
one more here with it eventually comes
out<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:25.170> there's<00:03:25.860> your<00:03:26.130> hood<00:03:26.490> regular<00:03:26.850> remove

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
out and there's your hood regular remove

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.890 
out and there's your hood regular remove
show<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:31.880> now<00:03:32.880> here's<00:03:33.120> your<00:03:33.210> connector<00:03:33.720> for

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
show you now here's your connector for

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.340 
show you now here's your connector for
your<00:03:34.020> window<00:03:34.260> motor<00:03:35.810> what<00:03:36.810> you're<00:03:36.960> working<00:03:37.260> to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
your window motor what you're working to

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.710 
your window motor what you're working to
do<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:38.060> get<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.120> finger<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.710> that<00:03:40.710> block<00:03:41.630> get<00:03:42.630> it

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
do is get a finger on that block get it

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.770 
do is get a finger on that block get it
pulled<00:03:42.930> out<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:46.470> off<00:03:46.740> there<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.690> get

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
pulled out and off there and you can get

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.120 
pulled out and off there and you can get
your<00:03:48.900> hands<00:03:49.110> in<00:03:49.290> there<00:03:49.380> pretty<00:03:49.560> well<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.010> you

the windows slide down the place with

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.180 
the windows slide down the place with
the<00:05:11.340> regulator<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:14.010> install<00:05:14.699> my<00:05:14.880> two<00:05:16.190> 10

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
the regulator and install my two 10

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:25.540 
the regulator and install my two 10
millimeter<00:05:17.220> bolts<00:05:17.910> in<00:05:18.120> there<00:05:18.510> put<00:05:19.199> those<00:05:19.380> in

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:34.930 

let's<00:05:26.550> turn<00:05:26.789> the<00:05:26.910> car<00:05:27.150> on

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.070 

we<00:05:35.940> have<00:05:36.289> regulator<00:05:37.289> up<00:05:37.500> and<00:05:37.710> down<00:05:38.810> so<00:05:39.810> as<00:05:39.930> you

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
we have regulator up and down so as you

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.740 
we have regulator up and down so as you
can<00:05:40.169> see<00:05:41.180> as<00:05:42.180> long<00:05:42.240> as<00:05:42.419> you<00:05:42.479> know<00:05:42.570> what<00:05:42.660> you're

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
can see as long as you know what you're

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.820 
can see as long as you know what you're
doing<00:05:42.990> not<00:05:43.710> that<00:05:43.950> difficult<00:05:44.160> of<00:05:44.490> a<00:05:44.580> job<00:05:45.830> really

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
doing not that difficult of a job really

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.710 
doing not that difficult of a job really
the<00:05:47.039> most<00:05:47.190> difficult<00:05:47.729> part<00:05:48.030> will<00:05:48.150> be<00:05:48.270> is<00:05:48.510> if

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
the most difficult part will be is if

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.689 
the most difficult part will be is if
your<00:05:48.960> window<00:05:49.889> motor<00:05:50.099> is<00:05:50.340> broken<00:05:52.580> you<00:05:53.580> know

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
your window motor is broken you know

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.300 
your window motor is broken you know
being<00:05:53.970> able<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.270> get<00:05:54.539> to<00:05:54.780> those<00:05:55.070> two<00:05:56.070> bolts

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
being able to get to those two bolts

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.810 
being able to get to those two bolts
that<00:05:56.599> hold<00:05:57.599> the<00:05:57.810> window<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.139> the<00:05:58.320> regulator

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
that hold the window to the regulator

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.210 
that hold the window to the regulator
usually<00:05:59.820> if<00:05:59.910> your<00:06:00.060> regulator<00:06:00.449> is<00:06:00.660> the<00:06:00.750> problem

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
usually if your regulator is the problem

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.070 
usually if your regulator is the problem
you<00:06:02.220> can<00:06:02.370> force<00:06:02.669> the<00:06:02.820> window<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.599> go<00:06:03.720> into<00:06:03.990> the

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
you can force the window to go into the

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.350 
you can force the window to go into the
place<00:06:04.289> where<00:06:04.500> you<00:06:04.620> want<00:06:04.860> it<00:06:04.979> and<00:06:05.160> get<00:06:06.060> to<00:06:06.210> it

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
place where you want it and get to it

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.469 
place where you want it and get to it
through<00:06:06.630> these<00:06:06.810> access<00:06:07.199> holes<00:06:08.120> so<00:06:09.120> you<00:06:09.270> put

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
through these access holes so you put

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:25.420 
through these access holes so you put
