hopper the sands heavier than water so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.410 
hopper the sands heavier than water so
it<00:01:06.690> falls<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.259> and<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:08.520> water<00:01:08.820> drains

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it falls out and the water drains

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.469 
it falls out and the water drains
through<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:11.220> water<00:01:11.460> drains<00:01:12.030> through<00:01:12.240> a
