at this time all kinds of stuff like
that<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.159> there's<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.700> much<00:01:38.820> stuff<00:01:39.060> flying

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that and there's so much stuff flying

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.289 
that and there's so much stuff flying
your<00:01:39.509> way<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.340> start<00:01:42.060> talking

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
your way that if you just start talking

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.090 
your way that if you just start talking
to<00:01:42.600> someone<00:01:42.810> else<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.229> miss<00:01:43.590> some<00:01:43.860> very

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
to someone else you can miss some very

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.700 
to someone else you can miss some very
vital<00:01:44.579> instruction<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.869> definitely<00:01:46.530> do

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
vital instruction and you definitely do

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.350 
vital instruction and you definitely do
not<00:01:46.740> want<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.189> be<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.520> guy<00:01:47.700> who<00:01:47.759> missed<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
not want to be that guy who missed it

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.850 
not want to be that guy who missed it
and<00:01:48.540> did<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.689> wrong<00:01:48.930> thing<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> take

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.999 
to be that guy so yeah you need to keep
quiet<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.290> hear<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:01.890> your

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
quiet so you can hear all your

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.649 
quiet so you can hear all your
instruction<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> listen<00:02:03.090> when<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.450> tell

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
instruction and listen when they tell

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.959 
instruction and listen when they tell
you<00:02:03.689> what<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.079> do<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:05.670> there's

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
you what to do because it's there's

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.459 
you what to do because it's there's
nothing<00:02:06.270> wrong<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.509> asking<00:02:06.780> twice<00:02:07.200> they

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
nothing wrong with asking twice they

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.859 
nothing wrong with asking twice they
probably<00:02:07.710> do<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.280> want<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.700> ask<00:02:08.970> twice<00:02:09.450> just

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
probably do I want you to ask twice just

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.250 
probably do I want you to ask twice just
to<00:02:09.989> make<00:02:10.200> sure<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.679> know

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
to make sure you know

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.890 
to make sure you know
but<00:02:11.890> if<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.459> keep<00:02:12.730> quiet<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.390> listen<00:02:13.569> the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
but if you keep quiet and listen the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.210 
but if you keep quiet and listen the
first<00:02:14.080> time<00:02:14.349> then<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.560> won't<00:02:14.799> have<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.010> ask

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
first time then you won't have to ask

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.280 
first time then you won't have to ask
more<00:02:15.489> than<00:02:15.519> once<00:02:15.879> so<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.450> need<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.930> keep<00:02:17.079> quiet

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
more than once so you need to keep quiet

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.880 
more than once so you need to keep quiet
but<00:02:17.860> also<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.670> second<00:02:19.060> tip<00:02:19.239> is<00:02:19.480> be<00:02:19.959> heard<00:02:20.319> now

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
but also the second tip is be heard now

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.869 
but also the second tip is be heard now
you<00:02:20.950> might<00:02:21.220> think<00:02:21.250> those<00:02:21.640> two<00:02:21.849> things

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
you might think those two things

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.399 
you might think those two things
contradict<00:02:22.599> each<00:02:22.689> other<00:02:22.870> but<00:02:23.170> there<00:02:23.319> are

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
contradict each other but there are

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.869 
contradict each other but there are
actually<00:02:23.709> totally<00:02:23.890> different<00:02:24.340> categories

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
actually totally different categories

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.240 
actually totally different categories
when<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.239> say<00:02:25.480> be<00:02:25.689> heard<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.319> mean<00:02:26.769> that<00:02:26.980> if<00:02:27.099> you

when I say be heard I mean that if you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.280 
when I say be heard I mean that if you
have<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.459> problem<00:02:27.849> with<00:02:28.360> what<00:02:28.540> you're<00:02:28.569> doing<00:02:28.870> or
