00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
out the only negative side the fact that

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.990 
out the only negative side the fact that
I<00:01:54.780> had<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.320> within<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> second<00:01:56.340> week<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.880> ice

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
was taking them I got kind of a mild

breakout<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.250> alone<00:01:59.520> my<00:01:59.670> cheeks<00:01:59.969> which<00:02:00.659> I

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
breakout just alone my cheeks which I

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.780 
breakout just alone my cheeks which I
haven't<00:02:01.229> had<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.560> quite<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.799> while<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
haven't had for quite a while so the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.639 
haven't had for quite a while so the
only<00:02:02.939> thing<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.479> really<00:02:03.780> put<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.409> is

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
only thing like really put it down to is

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.260 
only thing like really put it down to is
because<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.219> tablet<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.820> supposed<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.180> me

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
because in the tablet is supposed to me

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.330 
because in the tablet is supposed to me
because<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.719> biotin<00:02:07.229> which<00:02:07.439> i<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.950> write<00:02:08.190> up

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
because the biotin which i can write up

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.040 
because the biotin which i can write up
can<00:02:08.640> actually<00:02:08.970> cause<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:09.539> model

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
can actually cause like model
