00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.470
 to me 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.219
 andy I have not the faintest idea of 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.100
 what the two Italians sang 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:18.260
 and the truth is that I do not want to know 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.260
 good things do not need to be understood 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.480
 I suppose they sang about something so 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.720
 beautiful that he could not express himself with 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.270
 words and that's precisely why you 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.790
 it made my heart throb 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.650
 I assure you that those voices raised you 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.540
 higher and further away than anyone 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.900
 living in such a gray place could 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.000
 Sound 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.010
 It was like without a beautiful bird 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.710
 entered our monotone cage and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.870
 had dissolved those walls and for 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.850
 a few moments until the last 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.850
 shouyang man felt free 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.010
 how hard it is to see how he loses his power 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.350
 letting go 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.450
 puppet sounds today just like yesterday is the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.270
 that moves threads marks styles without knowing 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.040
 the rest of learning mechanisms with 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.500
 they lie to themselves they are not 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.200
 worthy of his position music is an art 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.660
 and every person a world the flow is both 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.479
 body only seek deep what the 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.640
 people say nothing does not do well what you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.640
 you feel and they nothing you follow 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.820
 they carry the current nothing you to follow you and 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.610
 the fire of nothing should come is 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.920
 in the rival music has none is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.560
 how to paint what each one feels 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.869
 I always think about colors in music 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.110
 the silence a canvas each work would be 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.560
 Unique is the authentic one as the woman who 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.590
 you love makes you cry and laugh go never 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.009
 to die and live is a lady if it were not 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.450
 for you to lift every morning would be a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.700
 continuous chaos 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.490
 if the devil walks outside, send me 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 domain I do not have powers to not so much 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.369
 reached but with music to the beasts 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.399
 to mansur when I raise music in my 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.760
 coconut how many ways music in my coconut 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.989
 when I rest music on my coconut without 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.450
 music I do not advance what little by little crazy 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.970
 the fiber of the two only avoided everything 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.430
 that music is toxic is that without 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.940
 music would not make sense to gather well 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.340
 thousand people without technicians stuck 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.040
 superlative master company is like a 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.120
 Friend who shares your joy 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.330
 sadness and your courage your promises and your 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.510
 agony without melodies a moment lose 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.140
 its value would not exist those songs of 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.750
 love would enjoy would not live with a world 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.480
 off or trapped in your pain 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.640
 there was no radio antenna or stations 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.130
 we knew never dif some soundtracks 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.770
 there would not be the world for a country 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.560
 nor was there a Nikkei rhythm 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.560
 without and while fucking shit 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:20.780

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.780
 music 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.060
 I come from a planet where noise is not 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.489
 love path in a straight line composing 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.320
 with the sun the notebook hurts every 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.170
 line made me a goal compass me 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.720
 represents as a note how action sounds and 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.030
 I'm sorry I feel it please 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.520
 today I am frank and cool looking vibration 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.220
 the beethoven's ear or the lips of the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.800
 cross are from my recipes with music 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.770
 passion I feel I explode at a rhythm 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.739

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.930
 that valley that presides over an unhappy one tell me 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.120
 what do you do there tell me what you feel and with 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.060
 we'll talk quietly music is out there 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.670
 today the sadness and the ballad is known 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.190
 today I have understood child bravo and vÃ­ctor 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.110
 jara points out the riches of books 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.780
 that in the nannies it makes me more music 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.450
 that some cruel blowjob and rhyme of 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.240
 inside learn to be better and look for a 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.250
 great song to take away that resentment I come from 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.680
 a planet where hate is mortgages 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.190
 I have the recipe for cams in lubia 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.560
 sands 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.140

 of your speed and I live with music 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.770
 It helps me to be better I use sculpture 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.840
 that is stored in a drawer I build 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.390
 feelings that the legate understands 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.570
 I live in rooms in the halls of glam 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.570
 rock
