actually treasured they don't really do
anything<00:01:42.820> down<00:01:43.820> in<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.090> case<00:01:56.800> yes<00:01:57.800> beasts<00:01:58.130> are

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
anything down in the case yes beasts are

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.810 
anything down in the case yes beasts are
worth<00:01:59.180> just<00:01:59.720> two<00:02:00.020> or<00:02:00.170> three<00:02:00.520> even<00:02:01.520> maybe<00:02:01.670> even

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
worth just two or three even maybe even

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.680 
worth just two or three even maybe even
one<00:02:02.270> sometimes<00:02:03.280> now<00:02:04.280> Ford<00:02:04.730> they're<00:02:05.240> worth<00:02:05.390> a

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
one sometimes now Ford they're worth a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:23.710 
one sometimes now Ford they're worth a
little<00:02:06.380> bit<00:02:16.630> quenching<00:02:18.340> clever<00:02:19.340> go<00:02:22.510> all<00:02:23.510> right

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
little bit quenching clever go all right

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.970 
little bit quenching clever go all right
and<00:02:23.900> then<00:02:24.110> we<00:02:24.170> can<00:02:24.350> get<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.560> rest<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
and then we can get the rest of the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.130 
and then we can get the rest of the
Pikmin<00:02:25.190> on<00:02:25.400> this<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.730> make<00:02:25.850> it<00:02:25.880> this<00:02:26.209> process

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
Pikmin on this to make it this process

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.070 
Pikmin on this to make it this process
move<00:02:27.350> much<00:02:27.590> faster<00:02:28.239> if<00:02:29.239> you<00:02:29.390> did<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:29.930> notice

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
move much faster if you did you notice

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.440 
move much faster if you did you notice
the<00:02:30.290> difference<00:02:30.410> there<00:02:31.000> they<00:02:32.000> move<00:02:32.150> much

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the difference there they move much

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.440 
the difference there they move much
faster<00:02:32.690> what<00:02:33.170> can<00:02:33.290> we<00:02:33.350> pick<00:02:33.560> down<00:02:33.739> there

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
faster what can we pick down there

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.420 
faster what can we pick down there
so<00:02:35.450> if<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.630> didn't<00:02:35.840> notice<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:36.170> was<00:02:36.530> another

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
so if you didn't notice that was another

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.660 
so if you didn't notice that was another
person

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
person

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.040 
person

shut up this is my last one mine alright
we<00:02:57.280> will<00:02:57.370> delve<00:02:57.640> deeper<00:02:57.970> with<00:02:58.120> our<00:02:58.240> pigment

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
we will delve deeper with our pigment

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.980 
we will delve deeper with our pigment
most<00:03:00.280> caves<00:03:00.550> have<00:03:00.820> multiple<00:03:01.270> floors<00:03:01.540> most
