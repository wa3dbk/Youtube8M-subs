00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
frequently okay on her blood smear she

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.230 
frequently okay on her blood smear she
had<00:05:08.740> some<00:05:09.010> schistocytes<00:05:09.550> so<00:05:09.820> she<00:05:09.880> had<00:05:10.090> some

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
had some schistocytes so she had some

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.930 
had some schistocytes so she had some
evidence<00:05:10.390> of<00:05:10.780> a<00:05:11.070> hemolytic<00:05:12.070> process<00:05:12.580> going<00:05:12.790> on

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
evidence of a hemolytic process going on

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.730 
evidence of a hemolytic process going on
right<00:05:13.210> she<00:05:13.570> also<00:05:13.720> yeah<00:05:13.960> also<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.440> day<00:05:14.560> I'm

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
right she also yeah also the day I'm

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.790 
right she also yeah also the day I'm
lactose<00:05:15.400> like<00:05:15.940> this<00:05:16.120> dehydrogenase<00:05:16.780> which<00:05:17.110> is

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
lactose like this dehydrogenase which is

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.630 
lactose like this dehydrogenase which is
the<00:05:17.860> enzyme<00:05:18.010> that<00:05:18.190> shows<00:05:22.890> okay<00:05:23.890> so<00:05:23.950> so<00:05:24.610> what

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
the enzyme that shows okay so so what

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.969 
the enzyme that shows okay so so what
was<00:05:25.030> what<00:05:25.360> was<00:05:25.510> her<00:05:25.630> bu<00:05:25.900> in<00:05:26.020> Brannon<00:05:26.320> her<00:05:26.770> B

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
was what was her bu in Brannon her B

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.050 
was what was her bu in Brannon her B
when<00:05:27.220> I<00:05:27.250> mean<00:05:28.200> being<00:05:29.200> was<00:05:29.410> 185<00:05:29.890> which<00:05:30.460> is<00:05:30.610> way

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
when I mean being was 185 which is way

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.620 
when I mean being was 185 which is way
above<00:05:31.180> normal<00:05:31.510> for<00:05:32.260> this<00:05:32.530> interview<00:05:32.950> would<00:05:33.190> be

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
above normal for this interview would be

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.400 
above normal for this interview would be
2022<00:05:34.630> Lord<00:05:36.180> creatinine<00:05:37.180> if<00:05:37.870> her<00:05:38.050> kidneys<00:05:38.320> are

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
2022 Lord creatinine if her kidneys are

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.719 
2022 Lord creatinine if her kidneys are
normal<00:05:39.150> would<00:05:40.150> be<00:05:40.300> less<00:05:40.780> than<00:05:40.810> 1<00:05:41.140> and<00:05:41.520> hers<00:05:42.520> was

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
normal would be less than 1 and hers was

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.380 
normal would be less than 1 and hers was
7.2<00:05:43.479> okay<00:05:44.669> great<00:05:45.669> so<00:05:45.790> that's<00:05:45.940> why<00:05:46.090> she's<00:05:46.240> gonna

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
7.2 okay great so that's why she's gonna

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
7.2 okay great so that's why she's gonna
get<00:05:46.570> dialysis

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
get dialysis

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.190 
get dialysis
though<00:05:47.590> okay<00:05:48.430> and<00:05:49.300> also<00:05:49.870> for<00:05:50.700> her<00:05:51.700> appendix

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
though okay and also for her appendix

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.110 
though okay and also for her appendix
was<00:05:53.200> in<00:05:53.350> 104<00:05:53.860> range<00:05:54.100> which<00:05:54.370> is<00:05:54.400> rhombus<00:05:54.970> Ida

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
was in 104 range which is rhombus Ida

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.670 
was in 104 range which is rhombus Ida
punic

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
punic

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:07.260 
punic
okay<00:06:03.630> so<00:06:04.630> ninja<00:06:05.190> well<00:06:06.190> what<00:06:06.400> would<00:06:06.520> you<00:06:06.580> what

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
okay so ninja well what would you what

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.499 
okay so ninja well what would you what
would<00:06:07.330> you<00:06:07.539> say<00:06:07.750> would<00:06:07.930> be<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:09.509> differential

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
would you say would be the differential

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.900 
would you say would be the differential
on<00:06:11.259> this<00:06:11.470> what<00:06:12.460> things<00:06:12.610> are<00:06:12.699> gonna<00:06:12.820> be

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
on this what things are gonna be

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:31.770 
on this what things are gonna be
thinking<00:06:13.270> about<00:06:13.330> okay<00:06:29.880> see<00:06:30.880> we<00:06:31.180> would<00:06:31.300> get

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
thinking about okay see we would get

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.370 
thinking about okay see we would get
correct<00:06:32.259> Studies<00:06:32.590> on<00:06:32.770> her<00:06:33.009> as<00:06:33.220> well<00:06:33.870> but<00:06:34.870> for

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
correct Studies on her as well but for

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.879 
correct Studies on her as well but for
diagnosing<00:06:36.130> her<00:06:36.340> with<00:06:36.870> H<00:06:37.870> us<00:06:37.900> we<00:06:38.530> would<00:06:38.680> want

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
diagnosing her with H us we would want

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.800 
diagnosing her with H us we would want
to<00:06:39.009> get<00:06:39.160> check<00:06:39.460> out<00:06:39.580> toxin<00:06:39.970> on<00:06:40.090> her<00:06:40.270> right

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
to get check out toxin on her right

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.830 
to get check out toxin on her right
stool<00:06:41.349> studies<00:06:41.740> on<00:06:41.919> her<00:06:42.160> right<00:06:42.610> and<00:06:42.880> if<00:06:43.419> there

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 
stool studies on her right and if there

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.930 
stool studies on her right and if there
is<00:06:44.050> a<00:06:44.080> home<00:06:44.650> care<00:06:44.830> concurrent<00:06:45.639> back<00:06:45.789> to

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
is a home care concurrent back to

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.700 
is a home care concurrent back to
infection<00:06:46.419> infection<00:06:46.720> suspected<00:06:47.530> we<00:06:47.620> would

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
infection infection suspected we would

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.170 
infection infection suspected we would
also<00:06:47.830> want<00:06:47.979> to<00:06:48.130> get<00:06:48.250> blood<00:06:48.460> cultures<00:06:48.639> all

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
also want to get blood cultures all

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.879 
also want to get blood cultures all
right<00:06:49.360> so<00:06:49.750> let's<00:06:50.320> talk<00:06:50.470> a<00:06:50.530> little<00:06:50.650> bit<00:06:50.860> about

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
right so let's talk a little bit about

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.170 
right so let's talk a little bit about
management<00:06:51.520> you<00:06:51.580> guys<00:06:51.610> won't<00:06:51.849> tell<00:06:52.060> me<00:06:52.150> a

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
management you guys won't tell me a

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.520 
management you guys won't tell me a
little<00:06:52.270> bit<00:06:52.389> about<00:06:52.509> how<00:06:52.870> you<00:06:52.930> gonna<00:06:53.050> man<00:06:53.320> how

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
little bit about how you gonna man how

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.230 
little bit about how you gonna man how
we<00:06:53.590> would<00:06:53.830> manage<00:06:54.090> hemolytic<00:06:55.090> uremic

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
we would manage hemolytic uremic

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:08.719 
we would manage hemolytic uremic
syndrome

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:08.729 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:16.980 

okay<00:07:14.610> yeah<00:07:15.610> so<00:07:15.789> for<00:07:16.060> him<00:07:16.240> look<00:07:16.419> was<00:07:16.599> less<00:07:16.810> than

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
okay yeah so for him look was less than

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.779 
okay yeah so for him look was less than
six<00:07:17.320> maybe<00:07:17.560> get<00:07:17.949> a<00:07:17.979> transfusion

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:18.789 
six maybe get a transfusion

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:20.899 
six maybe get a transfusion
if<00:07:19.330> her<00:07:19.570> platelets<00:07:19.870> were<00:07:20.139> really<00:07:20.440> low<00:07:20.590> and

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:20.909 
if her platelets were really low and

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:23.430 
if her platelets were really low and
dangerously<00:07:21.909> low<00:07:22.120> you'd<00:07:22.330> give<00:07:22.870> her<00:07:22.990> playlist

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440 
dangerously low you'd give her playlist

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.129 
dangerously low you'd give her playlist
but<00:07:23.710> so<00:07:24.610> so<00:07:24.880> what<00:07:25.360> did<00:07:25.449> her<00:07:25.539> urine<00:07:25.780> look<00:07:25.960> like

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:26.139 
but so so what did her urine look like

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.010 
but so so what did her urine look like
so<00:07:27.099> we<00:07:27.370> did<00:07:27.550> a<00:07:27.639> point<00:07:27.909> a<00:07:28.090> urinalysis<00:07:28.389> here<00:07:28.780> Dom

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
so we did a point a urinalysis here Dom

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.110 
so we did a point a urinalysis here Dom
which<00:07:29.470> is<00:07:29.590> the<00:07:29.680> department<00:07:30.159> what<00:07:30.880> we<00:07:30.940> found

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 
which is the department what we found

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.969 
which is the department what we found
out<00:07:31.300> she<00:07:31.419> had<00:07:31.690> moderate<00:07:32.289> amounts<00:07:32.680> of<00:07:32.770> blood

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:32.979 
out she had moderate amounts of blood

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:35.210 
out she had moderate amounts of blood
