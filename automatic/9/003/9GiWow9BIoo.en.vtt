 pellicer 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.000
 now let's see the visual style that this magnificent system will present 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.050
 unattended operative 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.160
 this is our hindu kush cv once finished installed we will appear 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.120
 thus 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.630
 your second you install it automatically programs 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.630
 necessary for its better functioning 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
 and cadillacs and without forgetting the intent 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.520
 his second us has all the updates of xp zero view 4 no longer 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.580
 It will be necessary to update the Internet because it is already integrated into the system 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.510
 It also comes activated and will not read if it bothers you if your copy is original 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.260
 because his second us was made from the original cd of windows xp with his 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.630
 respective license 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.420
 his second us uses a heart of linux integrated into the system that makes 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.599
 that his second us is more stable and fast his second us is a system 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.240
 Free distribution operating using the gpl license 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.069
 his second us has by default the visual style of the powerful system 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.919
 most expensive operating system in the world of mac os leopard that makes its second us 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.279
 very attractive 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.549
 another of the improvements that this operating system brings is lost or last 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.180
 It serves when we have several windows open and selecting over them we 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:40.529
 will show on a minimized screen the window that contains each of them 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:45.229
 do not worry if you think that having the gadgets doc the tours tips what 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:49.219
 will slow down your computer these add-ons will not make it slower 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.569
 because they are not separate programs are from the same system 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.359
 what makes it different from the other operating systems is the wine spa 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.359
 a taskbar in the style of linux 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.199

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:11.039
 where we can access the internet pages in a faster way 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.709
 and the tab of the notes where we can go writing some messages 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.769
 or even text sheets 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.090
 then we have the programs tab where we can see one more way 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.699
 fast the programs that we have installed in our computer 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:33.489
 here we have the quick access programs to execute them directly 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:39.420
 then the tab my documents desktop and my pc 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.420
 where we can see the content in a faster way 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:47.669

 in the option complements its headquarters we have several ornaments or accessories 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.909
 to tune our operating system but the most interesting thing is this

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.049
 world would be the wrecks board 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.879
 is a program where you have a lot of different serials 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:05.639
 programs 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.209
 what is useful to us 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.120
 more when we download programs and we do not have their respective code 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.900
 activation 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.680
 we simply write the name of the program sinos the serial will come out 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.449
 and we can update every month 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.530
 in the system option your cv in dous 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.060
 We have several programs for the configuration and maintenance of 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.960
