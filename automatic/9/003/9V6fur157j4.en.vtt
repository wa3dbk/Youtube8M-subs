improvising<00:00:03.959> on<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.500> blues<00:00:04.830> scale<00:00:05.069> as<00:00:05.549> you

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
improvising on the blues scale as you

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.419 
improvising on the blues scale as you
probably<00:00:06.600> know<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.140> blues<00:00:07.379> scale<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.980> similar

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
probably know the blues scale is similar

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.459 
probably know the blues scale is similar
to<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> diatonic<00:00:09.300> scale<00:00:09.990> with<00:00:10.230> three

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
to a diatonic scale with three

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.470 
to a diatonic scale with three
differences<00:00:11.040> let's<00:00:11.519> take<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.820> F<00:00:11.940> scale<00:00:12.179> for

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
differences let's take the F scale for

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.440 
differences let's take the F scale for
example<00:00:12.509> here's<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> F<00:00:13.320> major<00:00:13.500> scale<00:00:14.450> seeds

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
example here's the F major scale seeds

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.720 
example here's the F major scale seeds
from<00:00:15.719> half<00:00:15.960> up<00:00:16.260> eighth<00:00:16.830> notes<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.400> octave<00:00:17.699> and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
from half up eighth notes and octave and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.570 
from half up eighth notes and octave and
back<00:00:18.060> down<00:00:18.500> and<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> key<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.010> F<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.460> have

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
back down and in the key of F we have

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.359 
back down and in the key of F we have
one<00:00:20.820> flat<00:00:21.119> right<00:00:21.420> B<00:00:21.689> flat<00:00:21.990> ok<00:00:22.470> well<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> blue

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
one flat right B flat ok well the blue

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
one flat right B flat ok well the blue
scale<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.170> more<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.710> also
