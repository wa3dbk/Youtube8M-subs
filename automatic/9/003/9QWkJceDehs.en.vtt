more time and so the zombies will die

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:18.890 
more time and so the zombies will die
and<00:03:09.960> then

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.250 

the<00:03:19.900> humans<00:03:20.349> spawn<00:03:20.709> well<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:22.180> warthogs<00:03:22.900> spawn

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
the humans spawn well the warthogs spawn

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.800 
the humans spawn well the warthogs spawn
here<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:24.640> zombies<00:03:25.030> foam<00:03:25.269> in<00:03:25.450> different

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
here the zombies foam in different

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.660 
here the zombies foam in different
places<00:03:26.019> along<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.560> map<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.129> they<00:03:27.280> don't<00:03:27.489> just

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
places along the map so they don't just

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.490 
places along the map so they don't just
spawn<00:03:27.970> in<00:03:28.180> one<00:03:29.110> place<00:03:29.379> every<00:03:29.680> time<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:31.500> humans

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
spawn in one place every time so humans

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.210 
spawn in one place every time so humans
could<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:32.860> fall<00:03:33.129> and<00:03:33.250> kill<00:03:34.860> um<00:03:37.890> yeah<00:03:38.890> it's

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
could just fall and kill um yeah it's

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.830 
could just fall and kill um yeah it's
not<00:03:39.489> like<00:03:39.519> they<00:03:39.879> spawn<00:03:40.180> there<00:03:40.420> every<00:03:40.659> time

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
not like they spawn there every time

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.059 
not like they spawn there every time
he's<00:03:41.110> just<00:03:41.319> gone<00:03:43.470> keep<00:03:44.470> telling<00:03:44.860> him<00:03:44.920> you

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
he's just gone keep telling him you

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.589 
he's just gone keep telling him you
can't<00:03:45.310> do<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.640> because<00:03:45.700> they<00:03:46.120> spawn<00:03:46.390> in

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
can't do that because they spawn in

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.680 
can't do that because they spawn in
different<00:03:46.930> places<00:03:47.110> every<00:03:47.530> time<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:48.690> then

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
different places every time and then

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.380 
different places every time and then
there's<00:03:49.930> another<00:03:50.019> warthog<00:03:50.920> right<00:03:51.129> there<00:03:51.390> the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
there's another warthog right there the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.839 
there's another warthog right there the
zombie<00:03:52.780> thing<00:03:53.049> this<00:03:53.650> game<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.220> like<00:03:54.519> really

zombie thing this game is like really

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.509 
zombie thing this game is like really
unfair<00:03:55.329> for<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.870> zombies<00:03:56.290> unlike<00:03:57.190> shirt

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
unfair for the zombies unlike shirt

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.550 
unfair for the zombies unlike shirt
sharks<00:03:58.209> and<00:03:58.329> minnows<00:03:58.470> because<00:03:59.470> this<00:03:59.799> map<00:04:01.560> well

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
sharks and minnows because this map well

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.059 
sharks and minnows because this map well
the<00:04:02.920> zombies<00:04:03.400> are<00:04:03.540> invisible<00:04:04.540> super<00:04:05.530> fast<00:04:05.799> and

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
the zombies are invisible super fast and

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.270 
the zombies are invisible super fast and
that's<00:04:06.280> super<00:04:06.700> jumps<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:08.049> there's<00:04:08.739> almost<00:04:08.950> no

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
that's super jumps so there's almost no

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.729 
that's super jumps so there's almost no
chance<00:04:09.310> of<00:04:09.819> humans<00:04:10.780> killing<00:04:11.440> them<00:04:11.530> with<00:04:11.620> the

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
chance of humans killing them with the

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.960 
chance of humans killing them with the
turret<00:04:12.159> or<00:04:12.430> sniping<00:04:13.329> armor<00:04:14.190> cream<00:04:15.190> or<00:04:15.430> getting

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
turret or sniping armor cream or getting

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:26.490 
turret or sniping armor cream or getting
them<00:04:16.120> with<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.630> Gauss<00:04:17.070> um<00:04:20.190> yeah<00:04:22.770> well<00:04:25.349> let<00:04:26.349> me

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
them with the Gauss um yeah well let me

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.719 
them with the Gauss um yeah well let me
think

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.850 

okay<00:04:29.729> yeah<00:04:30.120> zombies<00:04:31.110> health<00:04:31.620> is<00:04:32.780> like<00:04:33.860> it's

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
okay yeah zombies health is like it's

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.830 
okay yeah zombies health is like it's
almost<00:04:35.130> pretty<00:04:35.820> much<00:04:35.940> one<00:04:36.150> shot<00:04:36.389> kill<00:04:36.630> for

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
almost pretty much one shot kill for

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.969 
almost pretty much one shot kill for
them<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:39.660> humans<00:04:40.020> can<00:04:40.229> hardly<00:04:40.470> ever<00:04:40.650> see

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
them and the humans can hardly ever see

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.850 
them and the humans can hardly ever see
him<00:04:41.100> so<00:04:41.510> it's<00:04:42.510> actually<00:04:42.630> pretty<00:04:43.139> fair<00:04:43.500> for<00:04:43.740> the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
him so it's actually pretty fair for the

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.100 
him so it's actually pretty fair for the
zombies<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.669> humans<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.570> humans<00:04:45.750> have

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
zombies and the humans the humans have

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.830 
zombies and the humans the humans have
so<00:04:46.290> much<00:04:46.410> advantages<00:04:47.010> here<00:04:47.040> but<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.840> zombies

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
so much advantages here but the zombies

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.810 
so much advantages here but the zombies
are<00:04:48.870> invisible<00:04:49.199> in<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:50.100> front<00:04:50.400> entrance

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
are invisible in the front entrance

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.120 
are invisible in the front entrance
isn't<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.360> old<00:04:51.600> only<00:04:51.990> way<00:04:52.440> for<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.830> zombies

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
isn't the old only way for the zombies

isn't the old only way for the zombies
begin<00:04:53.400> in<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:55.010> zombies<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.400> course<00:04:56.910> like<00:04:57.330> I

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
really i thought was pretty interesting

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.790 
really i thought was pretty interesting
i<00:05:26.370> was<00:05:27.060> building<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.539> map<00:05:27.750> not<00:05:28.110> even<00:05:28.229> trying

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
i was building the map not even trying

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.550 
i was building the map not even trying
to<00:05:29.130> make<00:05:29.340> up<00:05:29.490> face<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.840> then<00:05:30.990> it<00:05:31.110> turns<00:05:31.380> out

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
to make up face and then it turns out

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.870 
to make up face and then it turns out
that<00:05:31.620> like<00:05:32.130> the<00:05:33.169> the<00:05:34.169> UM<00:05:34.560> pyramid<00:05:35.400> looks<00:05:35.700> like

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
that like the the UM pyramid looks like

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.370 
that like the the UM pyramid looks like
a<00:05:35.910> face<00:05:36.300> kind<00:05:36.870> of<00:05:37.310> see<00:05:38.310> like<00:05:38.610> it<00:05:39.570> hurts<00:05:39.960> the

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
a face kind of see like it hurts the
