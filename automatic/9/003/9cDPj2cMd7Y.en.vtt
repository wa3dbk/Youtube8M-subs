00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.089
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.080
 health that you are so hope you are 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:07.990
 all very well 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.820
 today I tell you the news about behavior 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.889
 and advance of Wolfart because the 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.549
 multiplayer as they say is pretty 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.159
 revolutionary an interview with the 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.869
 official magazine of xbox is the gija mary 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.939
 Some details have been commented 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.569
 related to the multiplayer of this 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.550
 game and apart from that in translates a 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:31.089
 Lots of new features and 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.600
 innovations apart if we compare it with 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.250
 the other titles of call of duty 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.890
 already including new weapons and 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.109
 movements as commented have we 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.480
 heavy weapons that are part of the 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.449
 new playable class a greater 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.059
 verticality where the exoskeleton can 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.179
 give us more strength a leap with 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.070
 impulse camouflage technology and others 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.280
 adjustments with movement detect you 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.960
 that do not look at all like titan 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 Ford made it clear 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.530
 we have a great combo when jumping with 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.940
 momentum and strike a death blow from 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.410
 the air 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.900
 we believe it is a fundamental change 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.270
 for secondary combats as well as 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 a wider linear experience of the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.290
 that we see in the campaign the shotgun is 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.140
 a weapon for close encounters 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.270
 but it's very ineffective against a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.400
 player who knows how to use the ability 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.160
 of momentum there is a lot of 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.960
 challenges and unique situations very 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.600
 interesting when we talk about the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.840
 multiplayer in detail you'll see that we 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.470
 we refer but the variety of the new 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.960
 drivers and choices of what I'm going 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.300
 offer a pretty playable experience 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.130
 revolutionary according to how fixed internet 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.980
 bad game and some were from pussy saga the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.870
 revolution have had to take a game 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.860
 last year 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.820
 so they arrive 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.510
 pussy for the cure 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.510
 the pussy 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.950
 a backpack that drives 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.800
 Flying kicks I bought had 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.150
 happened before I'll put it if I 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.640
 your the game because I can 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.430
 put me 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.780
 that is to say never game nonetheless has 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.760
 commented that certain aspects 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.490
 important multiplayer of call of 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.080
 duty are not going to be ruled out we know that 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.970
 some fundamental things have to 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.920
 be present in call of duty there is a 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.020
 bunch of weapons that have been that have 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.200
 suffered modifications in one version 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.870
 more futuristic as for example the ak-47 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.880
 not too candid in 50 years for 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.040
 a futurism version so we have 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.980
 adapted in the way in which the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.470
 we would see in 50 years there are other weapons that 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.450
 yes they have received a radical change of 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.980
 agreement with these 50 years and we have 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.560
 adjusted according to that change is 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.110
 to see them and tell yourself that they have 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.800
 changed a lot 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.830
 I tell you this news because 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.930
 you see the changes that are going to be made 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.020
 what they have done but under my point 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.750
 of sight and I speak with a person who 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.360
 love the jute with me it seems that they have 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.120
 been so desperate to the state 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.010
 desperate since they did not already know where 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.200
 go have had to take tita in fort 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.610
 to be able to make a game like that because 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.400
 the multiplayer is really going to be 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:29.100
 exactly the same as other things 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.940
 yes but what about the exoskeleton parkour 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.940
 flying kicks camouflage 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.940
 impulse 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.420
 is that I no longer know how to put each 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.480
 and who the rose's play so nothing 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.670
 boys is precocious still interested this 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.349
 news a little kiss to all and see you the 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.739
 another video of this channel until the 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.739
 next
