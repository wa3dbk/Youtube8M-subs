00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
the saw blade is ultra sharp and it

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.020 
the saw blade is ultra sharp and it
actually<00:04:22.270> cuts<00:04:22.890> for<00:04:23.890> being<00:04:24.070> so<00:04:24.280> short

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
actually cuts for being so short

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.750 
actually cuts for being so short
cuts<00:04:25.150> through<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.830> small<00:04:26.830> branch<00:04:27.100> pretty<00:04:27.430> quick

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
cuts through a small branch pretty quick

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.650 
cuts through a small branch pretty quick
and<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:29.860> backside<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.670> nice<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.060> square<00:04:31.210> so

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
and the backside is nice and square so

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.360 
and the backside is nice and square so
it's<00:04:31.810> really<00:04:32.080> good<00:04:32.410> for<00:04:32.620> striking<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.160> fire

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
it's really good for striking the fire

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.460 
it's really good for striking the fire
steel<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:36.460> blade<00:04:36.780> this<00:04:37.780> blade<00:04:38.169> actually

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
steel and the blade this blade actually

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.490 
steel and the blade this blade actually
is<00:04:38.980> a<00:04:39.040> lock<00:04:39.430> blade<00:04:39.760> it<00:04:40.210> locks<00:04:40.480> in<00:04:40.720> place<00:04:40.840> so<00:04:41.290> I

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
is a lock blade it locks in place so I

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.140 
is a lock blade it locks in place so I
thought<00:04:42.070> that<00:04:42.250> was<00:04:42.340> kind<00:04:42.639> of<00:04:42.700> neat<00:04:42.880> for<00:04:42.910> a

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
thought that was kind of neat for a

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.900 
thought that was kind of neat for a
pocket<00:04:43.419> knife<00:04:43.720> to<00:04:43.780> have<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.110> lock<00:04:44.470> blade<00:04:44.910> even

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
pocket knife to have a lock blade even

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.850 
pocket knife to have a lock blade even
though<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.210> don't<00:04:46.360> really<00:04:46.630> trust<00:04:47.080> lock<00:04:47.440> blades

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
though I don't really trust lock blades

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.730 
though I don't really trust lock blades
like<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.490> would<00:04:48.669> a<00:04:48.700> fixed<00:04:49.060> blade<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:50.410> it<00:04:50.560> has<00:04:50.710> a

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
like I would a fixed blade and it has a

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.530 
like I would a fixed blade and it has a
couple<00:04:51.160> other<00:04:51.280> blades<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.000> really<00:04:52.389> don't

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
couple other blades that I really don't

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.110 
couple other blades that I really don't
use<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:54.130> has<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.310> little<00:04:54.550> pair<00:04:54.820> of<00:04:54.910> tweezers

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
use and it has a little pair of tweezers

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.770 
use and it has a little pair of tweezers
and<00:04:55.389> uh<00:04:55.720> I<00:04:55.990> guess<00:04:56.650> that's<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:56.950> toothpick<00:04:57.780> which

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
and uh I guess that's a toothpick which

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.960 
and uh I guess that's a toothpick which
is<00:04:58.930> kind<00:04:59.200> of<00:04:59.260> nice

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
is kind of nice

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.960 
is kind of nice
and<00:05:01.290> then<00:05:02.730> the<00:05:03.730> other<00:05:03.970> knife<00:05:04.330> is<00:05:05.160> this<00:05:06.160> swiss

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
and then the other knife is this swiss

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.830 
and then the other knife is this swiss
gear<00:05:07.419> which<00:05:08.350> is<00:05:08.590> made<00:05:08.800> in<00:05:08.830> Taiwan<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.850> wouldn't

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
gear which is made in Taiwan I wouldn't

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.440 
gear which is made in Taiwan I wouldn't
trust<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.230> blade<00:05:11.470> for<00:05:11.770> anything<00:05:12.310> but<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:13.419> is

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
trust the blade for anything but it is

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.530 
trust the blade for anything but it is
heavy<00:05:13.840> duty<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:15.030> it<00:05:16.030> does<00:05:16.300> have<00:05:16.510> a

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
heavy duty and it does have a

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.260 
heavy duty and it does have a
