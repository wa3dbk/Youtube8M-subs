00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
there this one has a locking system and

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.749 
there this one has a locking system and
you<00:01:23.000> have<00:01:23.149> to<00:01:23.560> make<00:01:24.560> sure<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:24.979> press<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.580> and

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
then you pull it it's not enough room in

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.830 
then you pull it it's not enough room in
there<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:29.800> pull<00:01:30.800> these<00:01:30.979> lights<00:01:34.450> this<00:01:35.450> kind<00:01:35.750> of

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
there to pull these lights this kind of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.889 
there to pull these lights this kind of
really<00:01:36.050> tricky<00:01:36.679> it's<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.159> harder<00:01:37.819> to<00:01:38.060> work<00:01:38.270> are

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
really tricky it's a harder to work are

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.440 
really tricky it's a harder to work are
able<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.039> remove<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:40.550> you<00:01:41.270> need<00:01:41.509> to<00:01:43.450> basically

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
able to remove it you need to basically

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.320 
able to remove it you need to basically
it's<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.289> harder<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:46.009> put<00:01:46.399> your<00:01:46.580> hand<00:01:46.910> in<00:01:47.090> there

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.180 
it's a harder to put your hand in there
you<00:01:47.660> have<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:48.080> make<00:01:48.110> sure<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.739> play<00:01:49.039> around

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
you have to make sure you play around

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.979 
you have to make sure you play around
but<00:01:50.030> very<00:01:50.869> carefully<00:01:51.800> you<00:01:52.610> have<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:53.030> make<00:01:53.780> sure

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
but very carefully you have to make sure

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:56.499 
but very carefully you have to make sure
that<00:01:54.020> how<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:54.530> rotates<00:01:55.160> once<00:01:55.789> it<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.149> rotates

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
that how it rotates once it so rotates

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.380 
that how it rotates once it so rotates
then<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.410> pulls<00:01:57.860> it<00:01:58.069> out<00:01:58.250> see<00:01:58.610> if<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.940> able<00:01:59.179> to

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
then it pulls it out see if I able to

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.139 
then it pulls it out see if I able to
show<00:01:59.810> you<00:01:59.869> then<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.649> wire<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.220> connected<00:02:02.030> is

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
show you then the wire is connected is

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.199 
show you then the wire is connected is
small<00:02:02.479> if<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.869> can<00:02:03.110> go<00:02:03.349> man<00:02:03.619> I'm<00:02:04.429> going<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:05.000> pull

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
small if it can go man I'm going to pull

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.710 
small if it can go man I'm going to pull
this<00:02:05.390> wire<00:02:05.660> out<00:02:05.989> so<00:02:06.800> now<00:02:07.009> this<00:02:07.310> bulb<00:02:07.640> is<00:02:07.849> out<00:02:08.090> so

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
this wire out so now this bulb is out so

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.330 
this wire out so now this bulb is out so
we're<00:02:08.929> going<00:02:09.080> to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
we're going to

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.380 
we're going to
this<00:02:10.850> is<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.150> original<00:02:11.330> stock<00:02:12.080> item<00:02:12.620> bulb<00:02:13.390> as

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
this is the original stock item bulb as

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.300 
this is the original stock item bulb as
I<00:02:14.450> say<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.440> let<00:02:15.620> me<00:02:15.740> put<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.040> here

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
I say I let me put it here

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.990 
I say I let me put it here
it's<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.750> 4300<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:18.230> I'm<00:02:19.040> going<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.490> bring<00:02:19.730> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
it's a 4300 and I'm going to bring the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.940 
it's a 4300 and I'm going to bring the
other<00:02:20.300> one<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.520> comparison<00:02:22.880> of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
other one and this is the comparison of

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.800 
other one and this is the comparison of
this<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.100> 8,000<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:27.140> I'm<00:02:27.290> going<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.670> do<00:02:28.810> $8,000

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
this is 8,000 so I'm going to do $8,000

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.290 
this is 8,000 so I'm going to do $8,000
I<00:02:32.709> don't<00:02:33.709> know<00:02:33.830> if<00:02:33.950> we<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.220> zoom<00:02:34.250> in<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.150> is

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
I don't know if we can zoom in this is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.660 
I don't know if we can zoom in this is
the<00:02:35.450> way<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:35.780> says<00:02:36.050> or<00:02:36.319> open<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.069> way<00:02:37.340> and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
the way it says or open this way and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.449 
the way it says or open this way and
close<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.390> way<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:39.560> what<00:02:39.739> it<00:02:39.830> will<00:02:39.950> do<00:02:40.430> that

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
close this way so what it will do that

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.070 
close this way so what it will do that
I'm<00:02:41.030> going<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.420> insert<00:02:41.870> as<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.940> straight

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
I'm going to insert as this is straight

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.220 
I'm going to insert as this is straight
then<00:02:45.080> I'm<00:02:45.200> going<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.530> turn<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:46.010> round<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
then I'm going to turn the round and the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.960 
then I'm going to turn the round and the
