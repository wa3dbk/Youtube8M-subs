00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.460

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.280
 friends from afar today tell this 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.770
 Well, as if from the experience of life comes 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.199
 man resume doing soviet carry 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.689
 former man comes to do resume we 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.759
 sit down with higher education there 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.949
 the engineer see where he worked there on the radio 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:28.380
 the factory worked what the year did but the engineer 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.619
 yaga is understandable that you shoulder 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.930
 engineers do that and I would understand 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.570
 what the engineers did from you at the factory but 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.230
 miracle and god of engineers he is engineer 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 dontcha odious engineer means then 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.440
 I already had to portray there 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.350
 to scratch a turnip and speak there 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.630
 did here she did here did and for 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.420
 few years I went to this level 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.730
 that in almost any profession I can 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.980
 In general, there are a dozen of some bullit 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.570
 write about what people are doing there 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.309
 in general, itâ€™s not difficult at all, but we 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.929
 Now we are not talking about this but we are talking about 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.070
 that people are adults with education 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:14.460
 performed as if intelligent 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.740
 mental work so not able 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.590
 two words to say about what they were doing 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.119
 at work in fact they are generally two 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.829
 words can not say because 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.840
 if you could understand all talk 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:28.679
 They were about work told but they 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.799
 just don't talk and why am i 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.240
 to tell at that time on 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.240
 returning from Kiev 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.009
 I was there to make a small this treatment 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.189
 that here can be one of those who 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.170
 start a blog and thank god there was found 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.209

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.219
 which distinguishes soviet and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.929
 post-Soviet space from everything 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.139

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.820

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.310

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.190
 time as you like 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.100

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.380
 understand here on the internet on the net and and 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.970
 typhus fully functioning or you 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.620
 funktsioniruesh at a level which 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.230
 your grandparents functioned 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.850
 that is, no functionary to say no 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.290
 you can write you can not speak 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.570
 in front of people can not and so on you year 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.989
 do a 12 year old child block or 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.120
 a ten year old even needs to 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.470
 evolve like kids go 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.180
 there literary circle 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.220
 well what a normal child where in 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.680
 our age would go there in the literary 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.660
 a circle of poems there wrote nothing there 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.580
 stories what there is a story and give 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.430
 it was necessary to be so I do not know there by whom 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.850
 and today, for example, if there was a circle 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.860
 there on creating a blog on youtube i think 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.960

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.760

 Curve or there are grimaces they build 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.690
 left with their nose and with their 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.880
 grimaces among tens of millions 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.760
 people who wander there on the internet by 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.630

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.200
 engineer 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.340
 so this aids world is such here 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.980
 modern world such 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.400

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.620
 I do n't care who will say anything because 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.750
 modern world you do not care who what 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.720
 will tell you because there is before you 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.490
 the whole world will not be there who is with you in 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.400
 classroom is studying or which yard you to 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.620

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.920
 sitting in the toilet and screaming busy they 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.510
 drink there I do not know and the river guide here sneeze 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.670
 here they are full of peace to the people 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.820
 who say well done to you come on 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.340
 be friends and here is this discovery should 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.430
 make kids and adults need help not 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.410
 burn out yes yes well that's an atom a negative 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.230
 my belly and my granddaughter Sasha is 6 years old 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:50.450
 and I wanted her to block the case she teaches 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.730
 caught fire become genre watching videos and 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.010
 my there and cartoons look at youtube 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.640
 but parents are opposed they say 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.680
 something is not necessary because there is negative 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.780
 what else is this parents here if 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.370
 they should alternate these comments there 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.610
 ban there and what 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.590
 goats change here and 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.449
 so where did the child go in development 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.909
 I think that not only children and parents 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:17.240
 should also learn here in this world 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:19.460
 live and function effectively and not 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.750
 afraid there are some sort of people with 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.539
 negative comments 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.580
 she learns to live in this world where every 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.509
 what reptiles can she come to say 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.819
 he doesn't care 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:31.870
 this is a very important point all the guys 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:34.639
 happy already almost came to work and 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.710

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.139
 very cool very cool and for 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.460
 Development children have nothing you will not 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:42.460
