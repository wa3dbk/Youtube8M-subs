00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.870
 berne on dear professor researcher at the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.599
 Bern University of Applied Sciences 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.669
 firstly photosynthesis its part of the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.730
 carbon carbon dioxide co2 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:17.910
 captured by the leaves in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.000
 the atmosphere is usually said 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.710
 this worry with a little water the light 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.280
 solar to give glucose 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.930
 so it is then the know so wise 12:06 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.210
 and oxygen but it's a lot more 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.129
 subtle that it does not need to 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.890
 only six molecules of water for 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.680
 associate with six molecules of co2 it 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.690
 must 12 molecules of water if we consider 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.810
 the complete formula of photosynthesis 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.280
 and this water is completely dissociated 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.520
 it is a water that is entirely 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.890
 defeat is here I put in blue 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.480
 the hydrogen is in yellow the oxygen is 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.340
 the new oxygen that are from the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.010
 photosynthesis it's not just about 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.989
 the oxygen that remains of CO2 is 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.399
 the oxygen that comes from the water is from 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.170
 oxygen that has never been in 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.140
 the air never was breathe it's 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.799
 virgin oxygen hydrogen of water 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.070
 by in the glucose in blue is in a 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.670
 new at the end of the formula 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.780
 a formula 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.000
 h2o is this new winged to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.299
 oxygen at 6 o'clock but its oxygen 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.680
 comes from co2 these two virgin lots which 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 never flowed that never 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.330
 participated in the cycle and it's something 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.150
 absolutely phenomenal thing the tree 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.900
 takes co2 it incorporates into the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.659
 organic mass 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.909
 but he takes some water and they did 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.380
 of oxygen they made sugar and he 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.930
 in fact new water that has 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.360
 never been seen could we say 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.880
 that's about photosynthesis 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 and if we consider the masses for 1000 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.840
 kg of wood at the taceq 17 trees we had 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.040
 need not 1000 kilos of gaseous CO2 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.350
 May 2008 151 kg of carbon dioxide from 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.500
 co2 so every kg of wood 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.360
 it's almost two kilograms of CO2 captured 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.640
 in the atmosphere is incorporated into the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.909
 earth for every kilo of wood you have 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.679
 practically 1.3 kg of oxygen which is 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.770
 produced virgin oxygen ever 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.240
 breathe 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.580
 and 500 grams of new water and that's 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.280
 that's the problem and the prospects 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.960
 it is that we make the trees work 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.980
 for not only decreased mitigated the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.690
 problem of global warming 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.690
 it's a solution to this problem
