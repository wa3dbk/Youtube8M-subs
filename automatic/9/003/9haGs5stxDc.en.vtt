take<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> section<00:00:12.090> from<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:13.080> side<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.559> your

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
take a section from one side of your

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.470 
take a section from one side of your
part<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.309> divide<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.849> into<00:00:14.910> three<00:00:15.120> different

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
part and divide it into three different

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.820 
part and divide it into three different
sections

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.830 

now<00:00:19.830> take<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> front<00:00:20.430> section<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.180> bring<00:00:21.570> it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
now take the front section and bring it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.259 
now take the front section and bring it
over<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.500> middle<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.490> then<00:00:23.820> bring<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.060> back

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
over the middle and then bring you back

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:32.479 
over the middle and then bring you back
over<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.720> middle<00:00:30.470> now<00:00:31.470> take<00:00:31.679> another<00:00:31.830> section

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
over the middle now take another section

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.090 
over the middle now take another section
from<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.880> front<00:00:33.290> join<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> previous

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
from the front join it to the previous

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.510 
from the front join it to the previous
section<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.880> bring<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.329> over<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> middle<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
section and bring it over the middle and

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.770 
section and bring it over the middle and
repeat<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.670> by<00:00:38.850> taking<00:00:39.030> another<00:00:39.300> section

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
repeat this by taking another section

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.020 
repeat this by taking another section
from<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.110> back<00:00:40.280> join<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> previous

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
from the back join it to the previous

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.880 
from the back join it to the previous
back<00:00:42.390> section<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.140> bring<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.559> over<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
back section and bring it over the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
back section and bring it over the
middle<00:00:44.129> again<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> technique<00:00:45.629> for

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
middle again this is the technique for

00:00:45.809 --> 00:01:34.399 
middle again this is the technique for
creating<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.350> fun<00:00:46.590> phrase<00:00:47.090> continue

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:53.320 

you

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.230 

once<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.510> reach<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.720> points<00:01:55.230> past<00:01:55.470> your<00:01:55.770> ear

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
once you reach the points past your ear

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.880 
once you reach the points past your ear
instead<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.450> taking<00:01:58.140> sections<00:01:58.500> from<00:01:58.680> both

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
instead of taking sections from both

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.800 
instead of taking sections from both
signs<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.700> adding<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.480> previous

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
signs and adding them to the previous

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.690 
signs and adding them to the previous
sections<00:02:01.230> you<00:02:01.800> will<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:02.040> adding<00:02:02.310> sections

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
sections you will be adding sections

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.460 
sections you will be adding sections
only<00:02:03.150> from<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.510> front<00:02:03.750> sign

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
only from the front sign

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.070 
only from the front sign
so<00:02:05.280> essentially<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.330> will<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.510> creating<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
so essentially you will be creating a

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.200 
so essentially you will be creating a
French<00:02:07.320> lace<00:02:07.680> braid<00:02:08.010> towards<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.910> end<00:02:09.090> of

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
French lace braid towards the end of

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.980 
French lace braid towards the end of
your<00:02:09.360> braid<00:02:10.790> now<00:02:11.790> continue<00:02:12.390> braiding<00:02:12.630> and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
your braid now continue braiding and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.510 
your braid now continue braiding and
stop<00:02:13.350> up<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.680> middle<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.070> your<00:02:14.220> head

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
stop up the middle of your head

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.250 
stop up the middle of your head
essentially<00:02:15.210> leaving<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.690> rest<00:02:15.960> of<00:02:16.140> your

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
essentially leaving the rest of your

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.520 
essentially leaving the rest of your
hair<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:17.820> create<00:02:18.060> another<00:02:18.810> braid<00:02:19.170> from<00:02:19.350> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
hair to create another braid from the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:37.460 
hair to create another braid from the
other<00:02:19.680> side

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.869 

once<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.590> finish<00:02:38.920> braiding<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.430> section

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
once you finish braiding that section

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.330 
once you finish braiding that section
secure<00:02:40.599> it<00:02:40.720> with<00:02:40.989> an<00:02:41.200> elastic<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:42.010> set<00:02:42.220> it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
secure it with an elastic and set it

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.460 
secure it with an elastic and set it
aside<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.970> get<00:02:43.450> started<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.019> other<00:02:44.050> side

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
aside to get started on the other side

00:02:44.470 --> 00:03:05.150 
aside to get started on the other side
of<00:02:44.500> your<00:02:44.709> hand

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.740 

repeat<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.340> very<00:03:06.580> same<00:03:06.910> steps<00:03:07.270> on<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.480> other

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
repeat the very same steps on the other

00:03:07.750 --> 00:04:03.180 
repeat the very same steps on the other
side

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:13.240 

you

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.350 

this<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:14.460> a<00:04:14.490> fun<00:04:14.790> part

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
this is a fun part

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.000 
this is a fun part
take<00:04:16.080> both<00:04:16.350> brain<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:17.750> make<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.959> knot<00:04:19.170> with<00:04:19.500> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
take both brain and make a knot with the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.340 
take both brain and make a knot with the
braid

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
braid

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.750

you can natural hair several times I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.910 
you can natural hair several times I
will<00:04:26.100> be<00:04:26.220> knotting<00:04:26.520> it<00:04:26.610> three<00:04:27.060> times<00:04:27.300> in<00:04:27.570> total
