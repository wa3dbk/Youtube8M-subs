gonna make our way backwards here and
let's<00:05:45.400> take<00:05:45.729> a<00:05:45.789> look<00:05:46.150> at<00:05:46.419> the<00:05:47.169> lift<00:05:47.500> itself

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
let's take a look at the lift itself

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.920 
let's take a look at the lift itself
that<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:49.380> 3911<00:05:50.380> has<00:05:51.370> built<00:05:51.789> in<00:05:52.060> straight<00:05:52.630> from

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
that the 3911 has built in straight from

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.510 
that the 3911 has built in straight from
the<00:05:53.050> factory<00:05:55.229> so<00:05:56.229> our<00:05:56.470> power<00:05:56.710> switch<00:05:57.250> is<00:05:57.490> right

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
the factory so our power switch is right

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:07.430 
the factory so our power switch is right
out<00:05:57.970> here<00:05:58.419> we<00:05:59.199> do<00:05:59.440> have<00:05:59.470> a<00:06:00.100> hand<00:06:01.000> remote<00:06:02.430> and

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.650 

I'm<00:06:08.440> just<00:06:08.740> going<00:06:09.039> to<00:06:09.130> get<00:06:09.940> the<00:06:10.120> remote<00:06:10.419> out

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
I'm just going to get the remote out

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:19.200 
I'm just going to get the remote out
here<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:16.830> we<00:06:17.830> have<00:06:17.919> a<00:06:18.009> great<00:06:18.250> remote<00:06:18.669> here<00:06:19.060> and

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
here and we have a great remote here and

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.600 
here and we have a great remote here and
then<00:06:19.720> basically<00:06:20.349> all<00:06:20.500> that<00:06:20.919> happens<00:06:21.370> now

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
then basically all that happens now

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.000 
then basically all that happens now
normally<00:06:22.120> you<00:06:22.240> wouldn't<00:06:22.449> operate<00:06:22.599> this<00:06:23.289> from

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
normally you wouldn't operate this from

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.439 
normally you wouldn't operate this from
the<00:06:24.130> ground<00:06:24.400> but<00:06:24.610> I'm<00:06:24.729> just<00:06:24.880> doing<00:06:25.240> this<00:06:25.389> for

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
the ground but I'm just doing this for

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.589 
the ground but I'm just doing this for
demonstration<00:06:26.440> purposes<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:28.090> lift<00:06:28.360> would

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 
demonstration purposes the lift would

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:34.290 
demonstration purposes the lift would
fold<00:06:28.960> itself<00:06:29.800> down<00:06:30.690> and<00:06:32.970> then<00:06:33.970> you<00:06:34.150> would<00:06:34.270> be

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
fold itself down and then you would be

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.830 
fold itself down and then you would be
able<00:06:34.570> to<00:06:35.190> wield<00:06:36.190> the<00:06:36.460> chair<00:06:36.729> backwards<00:06:37.419> there

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
able to wield the chair backwards there

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.920 
able to wield the chair backwards there
are<00:06:38.110> support<00:06:38.860> handles<00:06:39.400> for<00:06:40.060> a<00:06:40.090> second<00:06:40.659> person

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
are support handles for a second person

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.200 
are support handles for a second person
as<00:06:41.320> it<00:06:41.470> should<00:06:41.740> be<00:06:41.889> operated<00:06:42.550> with<00:06:42.729> two<00:06:42.970> people

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
as it should be operated with two people

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.240 
as it should be operated with two people
and<00:06:43.750> then<00:06:44.229> you<00:06:44.409> would<00:06:44.560> hit<00:06:44.710> the<00:06:44.919> release

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
and then you would hit the release

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.170 
and then you would hit the release
button<00:06:45.610> which<00:06:46.419> nice<00:06:46.750> and<00:06:47.110> calmly<00:06:47.919> brings<00:06:48.820> that

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
button which nice and calmly brings that

00:06:49.180 --> 00:07:01.390 
button which nice and calmly brings that
lift<00:06:49.650> right<00:06:50.650> down

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.249 

and<00:07:01.490> as<00:07:02.150> it<00:07:02.300> reaches<00:07:02.690> the<00:07:02.810> ground<00:07:03.490> it<00:07:04.490> it<00:07:05.300> opens

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
and as it reaches the ground it it opens

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:11.370 
and as it reaches the ground it it opens
up<00:07:06.560> our<00:07:06.800> little<00:07:07.460> ramp<00:07:08.020> for<00:07:09.130> to<00:07:10.130> exit<00:07:10.580> now

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.580 
up our little ramp for to exit now
simply<00:07:12.380> stowing<00:07:12.830> it<00:07:12.949> is<00:07:13.100> the<00:07:13.250> reverse<00:07:13.580> it

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
simply stowing it is the reverse it

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:19.020 
simply stowing it is the reverse it
