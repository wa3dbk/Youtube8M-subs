00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.490 
game and it will allow me to add visual
effects<00:00:14.910> particle<00:00:15.420> effects<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.900> sound

effects<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.100> them<00:00:17.279> however<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.840> week<00:00:19.050> I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
effects to them however this week I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.870 
effects to them however this week I
spent<00:00:19.529> most<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.800> my<00:00:19.859> time<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.430> planning<00:00:20.760> out

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
spent most of my time just planning out

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.420 
spent most of my time just planning out
and<00:00:21.119> setting<00:00:21.539> up<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.930> attack<00:00:22.230> editor<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.189> as

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
and setting up this attack editor so as

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.250 
and setting up this attack editor so as
you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.699> see<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.090> haven't<00:00:24.480> really<00:00:24.689> added<00:00:24.900> many

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
you can see I haven't really added many

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.529 
you can see I haven't really added many
features<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> quite<00:00:26.310> yet<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.029> what<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.210> can

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
features to it quite yet but what I can

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.169 
features to it quite yet but what I can
do<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.380> open<00:00:28.830> up<00:00:28.920> an<00:00:29.130> attack<00:00:29.460> file<00:00:29.789> which

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
do is I can open up an attack file which

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.179 
do is I can open up an attack file which
loads<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.720> attack<00:00:30.990> into<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> editor<00:00:31.859> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
loads the attack into the editor and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
loads the attack into the editor and
then<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.210> preview<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.840> attack<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
then I can preview this attack in the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.580 
then I can preview this attack in the
test<00:00:34.829> area<00:00:35.190> by<00:00:35.610> pressing<00:00:36.059> fire<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:37.440> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
test area by pressing fire this of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.470 
test area by pressing fire this of
course<00:00:37.770> works<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.280> visual<00:00:38.640> effects<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.149> well

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
course works with visual effects as well

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.020 
course works with visual effects as well
so<00:00:39.960> if<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.290> open<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.860> beam<00:00:41.100> attack<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
so if I open up the beam attack here and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.389 
so if I open up the beam attack here and
I<00:00:42.270> fire<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> visual

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
I fire that you can see that the visual

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.029 
I fire that you can see that the visual
effects<00:00:44.760> are<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.239> working<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.930> expected

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
effects are all working as expected

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.660 
effects are all working as expected
I<00:00:47.450> also<00:00:48.450> added<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.110> timeline<00:00:49.739> slider<00:00:50.160> here

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
I also added this timeline slider here

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.340 
I also added this timeline slider here
which<00:00:50.879> allows<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> take<00:00:51.660> control<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
which allows you to take control of the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.170 
which allows you to take control of the
attack<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> go<00:00:53.190> through<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.550> animation<00:00:53.850> at

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
attack and go through the animation at

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.049 
attack and go through the animation at
your<00:00:54.420> own<00:00:54.600> pace<00:00:55.039> you<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.160> also<00:00:56.280> stop<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
your own pace you can also stop and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.880 
your own pace you can also stop and
change<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.719> camera<00:00:57.960> position<00:00:58.050> whenever<00:00:58.620> you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
change the camera position whenever you

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.770 
change the camera position whenever you
want<00:00:59.129> allowing<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.510> attack

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
want allowing you to see the attack

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.889 
want allowing you to see the attack
frozen<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.620> any<00:01:01.920> point<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.430> time<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.059> this

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
frozen at any point in time and this

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.450 
frozen at any point in time and this
looks<00:01:04.140> pretty<00:01:04.439> cool<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> beam<00:01:05.159> attack

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
looks pretty cool with the beam attack

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
looks pretty cool with the beam attack
but<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.970> will<00:01:06.060> look<00:01:06.210> even<00:01:06.659> cooler<00:01:06.840> next<00:01:07.260> week

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
but it will look even cooler next week

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.140 
but it will look even cooler next week
when<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.010> working<00:01:08.310> with<00:01:08.580> particle

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
when I have this working with particle

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
when I have this working with particle
effects<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.689> explosions<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.860> other<00:01:11.100> things

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
effects and explosions and other things

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.030 
effects and explosions and other things
like<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.900> back<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.140> game<00:01:13.380> I've<00:01:13.740> been

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
like that back in the game I've been

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.100 
like that back in the game I've been
continuing<00:01:14.460> my<00:01:14.850> quest<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.540> make<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.930> game

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
continuing my quest to make the game

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.260 
continuing my quest to make the game
look<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.560> appealing<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.400> possible<00:01:17.430> before<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
look as appealing as possible before the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.020

disappointed<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.579> results<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> was

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
disappointed with the results so I was

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.080 
disappointed with the results so I was
able<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> create<00:01:43.350> some<00:01:43.619> nice<00:01:43.799> flowery<00:01:44.399> areas

optimize<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.670> grass<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.360> plant<00:01:48.689> rendering

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
optimize my grass and plant rendering

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
optimize my grass and plant rendering
process<00:01:49.530> soon<00:01:50.070> which<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:50.790> hopefully<00:01:51.000> allow

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to build a whole world with a bit more

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.570 
to build a whole world with a bit more
greenery<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.740> seeing<00:01:55.740> as<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.010> adding<00:01:56.400> some

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
butterflies so I updated my particle

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
to loop through the same texture Atlas

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.260
