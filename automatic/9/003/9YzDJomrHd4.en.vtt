 Hello everyone in this video I of the isa 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.059
 we decided to play two 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.059
 dx man characters 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:20.609
 I chose blink this girl with 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:24.420
 these strange symbols and on the face while 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.000
 elisa did the character's trick 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.689
 played by jennifer lawrence ie 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.689
 mystique 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.710
 we hope you like it and if you do 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.010
 interested follow the tutorial 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.010
 Hello 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:54.120
 I put this crazy brown on the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.100
 eyelid and began to blend it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.440
 it fades as much as possible because it must 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.329
 be a fairly light makeup and a 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.300
 limited to the area of ​​the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:08.700
 I take another small eyelid 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.720
 then tends to use it to blend it better 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.720
 and I put it in the fold 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.190
 then I take this white rose and it 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.880
 put on under the arch 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.880
 eyebrow 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.250
 now contour the eye enough 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.250
 coarse with a black pencil 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.350
 then after putting on false eyelashes 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:46.960
 I make these geometric designs that the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:54.670
 character a lee I fill with a 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:57.550
 eyeshadow in purple cream then I make one 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.039
 strange contouring to imitate games 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.140
 of lights and shadows that have been created on 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.470
 face of the character in the picture I have 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.060
 chosen to look like you in 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.060
 so as to resemble them more 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.590
 then with this pencil contour to the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.950
 lips is a purple pencil and then I will go 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.820
 also to fill them then the vent with 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.350
 this brush with the help of this 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.630
 lipstick always in purple 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.410

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.410
