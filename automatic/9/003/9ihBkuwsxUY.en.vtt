00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.880
 responsive and when flipping not

 google plus google chat beyond that 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.300
 I will note that Internet access will be 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.920
 maximum simple because in 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.170
 the device has a large module 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.470
 but if the number of applications you do not 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.909
 It seems to you that they are few 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.940
 two icons that will allow you 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.140

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.209
 most suitable adapted 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.209
 for samsung and naturally android market 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.940
 besides that there is fm radio which 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.550
 let you listen to the radio everything is logical 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.709
 camera in the device of 2 megapixels and 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.560
 naturally i have a shooting function 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.530
 view for such a device in general 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.959
 turn out pretty well take a look 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.520
 with the appearance of devices on the display 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.220
 the speaker is located under the display 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.459
 there are three buttons 2 touch this 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.470
 context menu button and button 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.870

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.390
 return home 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:52.489
 headphone jack on top 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.310
 three and a half millimeters and yusbi connector 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.560
 which is covered up so sideways 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.050
 power on / off button 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.970

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:13.800
 protrusion to remove the cover 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.730
 rechargeable but here we see a speaker 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.040
 and 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.239
 the camera itself they would be visible 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.720
 through the cover 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.370
 which is quite logical flash camera does not have 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.170
 At first I said that I would say where is 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.360
 memory card slot 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.630
 actually he is hiding under 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.459
 the battery on the cover is here 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.730
 battery and under the battery 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.730
 there is a sim card slot 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.130
 equipment is the same compact 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.650
 I will say as the apparatus itself includes it 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.660
 Brief guide yusb cable and network 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.150
 Charger 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.000
 actually all of them we considered 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.829
 compact apparatus samsung galaxy put he 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.350
 so compact that just a little bit 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.450
 more entry ticket in metro

 behalf of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin but 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.400
 it is well equipped and inexpensive 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.500
 so I think it will be pleasant 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.130
 an acquisition for you either 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.260
