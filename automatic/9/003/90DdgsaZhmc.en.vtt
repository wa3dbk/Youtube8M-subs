reason<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:31.510> reason<00:00:31.630> why<00:00:31.870> I'm<00:00:32.020> saying<00:00:32.169> that<00:00:32.380> is

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
reason the reason why I'm saying that is

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.180 
because there's nobody even in visual
sight<00:00:34.089> so<00:00:35.079> that's<00:00:35.289> that's<00:00:35.649> it<00:00:35.890> for<00:00:36.070> that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
sight so that's that's it for that
