00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello everyone good in this little video 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.410
 let's make a check that 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.299
 the shhh that we have locally in 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.860
 our pc or in our mac are 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:18.030
 correct you already know that there is a problem 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:22.560
 with 6 h of the 60 versions up 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:26.250
 612 which automatically saves 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.860
 and cid are already not good and in our 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.380
 price of this more we can have shh of 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.550
 that guy or we can have him down by 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.590
 the types that are correct then 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.140
 how can we have doubts if they are 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.030
 ok or it's wrong let's check 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.219
 to control then the first thing is 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.949
 locate them and then check then 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.390
 to locate based on what 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.609
 program we have already used will be in a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.609
 good site then there's basically 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:53.280
 four ways to download a sh to our 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:58.350
 ifai tomato price 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:03.769
 has redsnow oy shit is it 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.659
 a program that is in Syria 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.020
 live and does not save directly in the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.050
 iphone 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.600
 then send them by email to the pc or the 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:18.090
 mac and we can ishs of crisis 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.040
 then those sh will have them in your 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.840
 mail from the elves located from 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.340
 sir there are problems locating them 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.869
 now let's focus on those that 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.910
 keep for example they had then then 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.759
 to know where they keep money that is 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.860
 well let's be on pc or the mac let's go 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:38.020
 directly to our user 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:43.140
 and in the root of shs producers 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.420
 there are the tiny hunger shh 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.310
 if we get this folder verify that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.990
 have administrator permissions and 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.780
 you have enabled the visualization of 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.420
 Hidden or system folders 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.810
 so here we have already located and 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.050
 for example we want to verify that it is 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050
 all right 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.650
 this same although 5 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.619
 Well we arrested him now it's Tripoli for 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.750
 the truth of gender 6 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.870
 those that lower those of snow those that lower 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.319
 in three I did not start the route is different 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:25.830
 if we are in a pc we have to go 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:29.550
 our user to data roaming 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.540
 that's not shs h here we can see the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.910
 60s that we have downloaded network not for example 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.230
 we will verify this we are at 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.349
 desk and then 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.080
 if we are in a mac and for which 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.370
 are the reds the shh te reds no 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.670
 we have to our user bookstore 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.080
 application support redsnow shs h that 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.440
 would be the route now then once 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.440
 we have 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.299
 156 superior 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.549
 we are that your key and what we will do is 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.190
 simulate that we create a taste for 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.569
 show from top left and 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.599
 immediately ask us to load the sh 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.970
 we use load and select by 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.770
 example this that starts with 291 is in 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.870
 the desk 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.990
 we do not locate 291 you call me and for 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.700
 example this one tells us that it's valid 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.930
 this in theory we could use it 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.930
 let's check this 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:42.250
 principal 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:45.250
 and let's go back and let's go and this is the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.250
 309 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.450
 with your desk 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.320
 we do not check 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:59.000
 for example this has told us that it is 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.390
 wrong this we could not use it 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.540
 well that's it so you can locate and 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.600
 check the ssd that you have locally 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.430
 saved and see if you can use them 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.430
 one day or not
