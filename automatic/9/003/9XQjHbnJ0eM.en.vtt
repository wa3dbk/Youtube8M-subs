00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:31.159 
on the side um also what out this attack
um<00:05:24.649> have<00:05:25.649> I<00:05:25.889> ever<00:05:26.509> wore<00:05:27.509> any<00:05:28.019> body<00:05:29.119> shapers<00:05:30.169> my

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
um have I ever wore any body shapers my

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.739 
um have I ever wore any body shapers my
mom<00:05:31.699> tortured<00:05:32.699> me<00:05:32.849> with<00:05:32.879> those<00:05:33.179> things<00:05:33.479> when<00:05:33.659> I

00:05:33.739 --> 00:05:33.749 
mom tortured me with those things when I

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:36.589 
mom tortured me with those things when I
was<00:05:33.959> younger<00:05:34.199> so<00:05:35.099> I<00:05:35.129> don't<00:05:35.579> wear<00:05:35.849> them<00:05:36.059> now<00:05:36.269> I

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
was younger so I don't wear them now I

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.109 
was younger so I don't wear them now I
think<00:05:36.990> they're<00:05:37.229> better<00:05:37.559> for<00:05:38.490> people<00:05:38.699> like

00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:39.119 
think they're better for people like

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:41.239 
think they're better for people like
size<00:05:39.599> 14<00:05:40.169> and<00:05:40.199> down<00:05:40.559> because<00:05:40.860> they<00:05:41.039> don't<00:05:41.219> have

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:41.249 
size 14 and down because they don't have

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:43.459 
size 14 and down because they don't have
that<00:05:41.339> many<00:05:41.610> rooms<00:05:41.999> and<00:05:42.449> I<00:05:43.019> don't<00:05:43.199> think<00:05:43.349> it's

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:43.469 
that many rooms and I don't think it's

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:48.379 
that many rooms and I don't think it's
really<00:05:43.889> that<00:05:45.139> restricting<00:05:46.139> to<00:05:47.069> them<00:05:47.279> but<00:05:48.179> once

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
really that restricting to them but once

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.540 
really that restricting to them but once
you're<00:05:48.629> a<00:05:48.659> little<00:05:48.990> bigger<00:05:49.379> it<00:05:49.800> gets<00:05:50.039> really

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
you're a little bigger it gets really

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.179 
you're a little bigger it gets really
annoying<00:05:50.939> you<00:05:51.719> I<00:05:52.019> don't<00:05:52.529> really<00:05:52.709> think<00:05:52.829> that<00:05:53.069> a

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:53.189 
annoying you I don't really think that a

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.719

spandex and what happens is that it's
really<00:07:40.879> really<00:07:41.150> tight<00:07:41.539> on<00:07:41.689> the<00:07:41.810> skin<00:07:42.169> because

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:42.979 
really really tight on the skin because

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:45.040 
really really tight on the skin because
your<00:07:43.129> body<00:07:43.310> has<00:07:43.430> nowhere<00:07:43.879> to<00:07:43.999> stretch<00:07:44.360> and

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.300 
that really isn't all that great for

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.669 
that really isn't all that great for
plus-size<00:07:48.259> figures<00:07:48.740> okay
