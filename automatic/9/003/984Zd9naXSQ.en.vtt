00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.220
 hello to all I find you 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.010
 today to show you how 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.560
 I bring volume to my hair with 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.150
 my bed that's so it's not an obstacle to 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.010
 my routine end if a little bit of my routine 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.900
 smoothing mu had already done a video on 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.160
 my sister bed and on my hair routine 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.300
 I wanted but in info bar if 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.800
 I forgot you put the links girls 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.720
 do not hesitate to tell me but you will see 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.370
 it's simple it's a technique 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.110
 what to look for because right now 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.000
 I had hair really flat and 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.500
 it works well and especially it holds 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.080
 a long time I leave you right away 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.010
 with the video so my hair is 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.480
 still wet 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.370
 it's simply because my 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.760
 straightener dries wet hair I 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.979
 you will put in bar info my wine 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.229
 review on this bed alone and I still 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.059
 it's at my roots to take off 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.199
 roots but that's not what makes that 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.799
 it's going to hold 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.120
 I will come to separate my hair so 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.170
 I am always like I do 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:12.780
 usually the top part apart if 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.780
 I'm coming tech 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:30.320
 and I will come apart to keep 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:32.119
 just below it here and I put him 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.549
 put back my heat protector 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.479
 from l'orÃ©al cel net for smoothing 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.630
 so I always come in master of a 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.140
 moment I did not put enough I come 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.209
 but otherwise if not distributed 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.500
 well and it tends to drag 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.929
 the grounds 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.459
 when it turns under the only one so 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.440
 I insist on the lengths and the 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.720
 spikes to protect them well and we're going 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.240
 right now start so I take 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.490
 straightener I start with the hop side 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.549
 I take a wick neither too big nor 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.150
 too fine and I'm going to come put my 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:14.360
 sister bed at the root and I come high school 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.209
 by simply looking up 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.489
 and you see it's right now 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.530
 small volume and I continue like that 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.530
 all the long hop 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.090
 the other side 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.980
 always a little galley below 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.200
 and that's it for that part and after 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.430
 I still continue by separating 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.190
 hair so for the top I'm going 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:37.400
 come apart just in three 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:41.170
 parties by reacting and then doing 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.170
 same but in the neck 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:09.510
 so that's pretty much 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.880
 after months in general right now I the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.620
 task my bangs but down but you have 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.510
 still a lot of volume and especially 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.370
 what's cool is that it's enough 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.019
 well to be able to take this hair 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.540
 you do a cold blow 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.830
 master of the lacc but that's it if you 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.690
 how are you leaving your hair 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.220
 quite often that you have time to 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.110
 blow- dry this stuff 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.560
 it's a good technique for smoothing 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.090
 the hair 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.590
 after it is sure when a long hair 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.160
 it's a bit boring me I can you 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.680
 must have seen 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.120
 but the result is there are the girls 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.560
 I hope you enjoyed it I make you 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.560
 big kisses and I tell you see you soon
