 you are the same 

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.120
 to provide that 22m wide range 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.290
 speeds over two thousand kilometers in 

00:00:07.289 --> 00:00:09.830

 enemy constructors 

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 variable geometry 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.939

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.679
 up to sixty five degrees 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.389
 m less angles were used when 

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:33.220

 greatest sweep on 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.040
 big 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.230
 two powerful engines developed 20 tons each

 e fight 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.650
 the plane has long experienced and taken 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.750
 into service only nineteen hundred 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.650
 76 year 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.930
 that 22m immediately won the respect of reactors 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.470
 they appreciated the ease of management 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.470
 machine and a great overview of the taiga 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.820
 and you its effectiveness 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.990
 bomber excelled 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.990
 and the power of the weapon did not have 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.280
 in 1981, the designers 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.430
 significantly refined the aircraft 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.880
 improved its aerodynamics of printing 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.210
 personalities increased 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 up to twenty five tons maximum 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.690
 the speed reached two thousand people m 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.130

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.330
 without refueling 7 thousand kilometers 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.060
 combat load increased to 24 tons 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.689
 version of the missile carrier the plane drove yes three 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:50.450
 rockets 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.760
 like 22 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.550
 has been improved and 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.140
 defensive weapons on 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.380
 the aircraft used a gun installation 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.240
 caliber 23 millimeter 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.159
 with a rate of 4 thousand shots 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:03.880
 a minute 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.570
 even the gun was used for 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.249
 thermal and radio interference 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.239

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.679
 without interference the crews are able 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:32.890
 take the plane to the desired area 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.520
 ensure the performance of combat 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.349
 tasks and return to the club 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.619
 to your airfield 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.709
 it is clear that such a serious car 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.139
 evoked increased interest in intelligence 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.699
 countries she 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.079
 by the way and coded the nickname of the aircraft

 specialists 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.279
 having such a formidable flying cruiser as 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:03.779
 that 22m in the first days of the war euro 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.479
 the Soviet Union could completely 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.889
 paralyze the possibility of nato forces 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.119

 large aggregation 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.899
 without even using nuclear

 with ordinary tourists 

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:29.879
 the Americans were sure that

 from May 5 rub 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:34.249
