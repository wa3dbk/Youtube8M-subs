athletes<00:00:09.330> I<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:10.500> witnessed<00:00:10.950> firsthand<00:00:11.540> what

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
athletes I have witnessed firsthand what

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.270 
athletes I have witnessed firsthand what
their<00:00:12.719> training<00:00:13.139> regimen<00:00:13.530> looks<00:00:13.710> like<00:00:13.980> and

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
their training regimen looks like and

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.939 
their training regimen looks like and
how<00:00:14.670> important<00:00:15.240> fuel<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.320> their<00:00:16.470> recovery

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
how important fuel is for their recovery

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.760 
how important fuel is for their recovery
so<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.520> know<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.760> certain<00:00:18.210> foods<00:00:18.660> give<00:00:19.320> their

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so we know that certain foods give their

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.730 
so we know that certain foods give their
muscle<00:00:20.220> glycogen<00:00:20.369> stores<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.180> boost<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.560> if

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
muscle glycogen stores a boost and so if

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.349 
muscle glycogen stores a boost and so if
they're<00:00:22.920> racing<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.519> pumpkin<00:00:23.820> over<00:00:24.029> time

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
they're racing to the pumpkin over time

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.689 
they're racing to the pumpkin over time
then<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:24.960> know<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.199> they're<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> be
