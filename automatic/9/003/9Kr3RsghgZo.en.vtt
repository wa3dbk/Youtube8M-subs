00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
we basically toggle the key off and we

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.000 
we basically toggle the key off and we
hit<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.450> checkmark<00:02:19.019> we<00:02:19.260> toggle<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.650> key<00:02:19.769> on

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010

hit a checkmark we toggle the key on
again<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.750> tune<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.440> didn't<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:22.980> a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
again and the tune is in I didn't get a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.380

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
chance to to record exactly how it goes

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.300 
chance to to record exactly how it goes
similar<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> predator<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.080> basically<00:02:28.560> it

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
similar to a predator so basically it

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.640 
similar to a predator so basically it

of the traders truck and get a 2010 just

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.129 
of the traders truck and get a 2010 just
like<00:06:12.250> in<00:06:12.400> tuning<00:06:13.620> which<00:06:14.620> is<00:06:14.740> kind<00:06:14.919> of<00:06:14.979> sad<00:06:16.139> all

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
like in tuning which is kind of sad all

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.820 
like in tuning which is kind of sad all
things<00:06:17.380> considered<00:06:18.150> you<00:06:19.150> bought<00:06:19.330> her

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
things considered you bought her

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.689 
things considered you bought her
2011-2012<00:06:20.830> truck<00:06:21.160> and<00:06:21.400> it<00:06:21.460> feels<00:06:21.760> like

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 
2011-2012 truck and it feels like

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.680 
2011-2012 truck and it feels like
from<00:06:24.699> what<00:06:24.850> I've<00:06:24.940> been<00:06:24.970> hearing<00:06:25.060> the<00:06:25.270> trannys

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
from what I've been hearing the trannys

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.710 
from what I've been hearing the trannys
a<00:06:25.750> little<00:06:25.960> bit<00:06:26.050> weak<00:06:26.229> on<00:06:26.440> these<00:06:26.590> now<00:06:26.770> and

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
a little bit weak on these now and

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.890 
a little bit weak on these now and
that's<00:06:28.720> probably<00:06:29.229> the<00:06:29.380> reason<00:06:29.560> why<00:06:30.780> we<00:06:31.780> were

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
that's probably the reason why we were

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.570 
that's probably the reason why we were
stopped<00:06:32.110> right<00:06:32.139> here<00:06:32.350> and<00:06:32.650> all<00:06:32.770> I'll<00:06:33.250> pull<00:06:33.490> the
