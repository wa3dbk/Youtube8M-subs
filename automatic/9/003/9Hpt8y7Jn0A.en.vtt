light green Oregon pine tree plate they

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.950 
light green Oregon pine tree plate they
only<00:02:26.350> made<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.710> for<00:02:26.980> one<00:02:27.220> year<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.840> what

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
only made this for one year this is what

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.870 
only made this for one year this is what
a<00:02:29.110> normal<00:02:29.350> Oregon<00:02:29.890> pine<00:02:30.280> tree<00:02:30.460> plate<00:02:30.670> looks

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
a normal Oregon pine tree plate looks

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.280 
a normal Oregon pine tree plate looks
like<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.360> can<00:02:31.510> still<00:02:31.750> get<00:02:31.900> these<00:02:32.020> today

like and you can still get these today

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.710 
like and you can still get these today
but<00:02:33.220> back<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.850> think<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.120> was<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.300> first<00:02:34.540> year

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
but back I think it was the first year

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.270 
but back I think it was the first year
they<00:02:34.870> did<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.110> pine<00:02:35.290> tree<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.920> did<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.070> light

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
they did the pine tree you did a light

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.580 
they did the pine tree you did a light
green<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.850> now<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.930> could<00:02:38.080> from<00:02:38.290> then<00:02:38.410> on

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
green and now that could from then on

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.610 
green and now that could from then on
they<00:02:38.920> did<00:02:39.160> a<00:02:39.220> dark<00:02:39.430> green<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:40.290> really<00:02:41.290> like<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
they did a dark green I really like the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.950 
they did a dark green I really like the
light<00:02:41.770> green<00:02:41.950> plates<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.840> because<00:02:43.840> they're

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
light green plates and because they're

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.990 
light green plates and because they're
rare<00:02:44.220> mainly<00:02:45.220> that's<00:02:45.430> why<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:45.610> like<00:02:45.820> them

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000
