spacers but given the fact that this is
a<00:00:16.310> like<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> woodgrain<00:00:17.930> type<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.109> looking

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
a like a woodgrain type of looking

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.310 
a like a woodgrain type of looking
tighter<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.630> supposed<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> look<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.230> a

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
tighter and it supposed to look like a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.140 
tighter and it supposed to look like a
wood<00:00:22.590> floor<00:00:22.800> or<00:00:22.920> once<00:00:23.220> as<00:00:23.369> installed

so yeah get some tile spacers in here
make<00:00:39.570> sure<00:00:39.719> everything<00:00:39.960> spaced<00:00:40.230> out<00:00:40.410> properly

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
make sure everything spaced out properly

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.979 
make sure everything spaced out properly
and<00:00:42.090> then<00:00:42.210> from<00:00:42.329> here<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.690> you're<00:00:42.840> going<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
and then from here what you're going to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.520 
and then from here what you're going to
do<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.230> take<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> level<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.719> maybe<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.809> mallet<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
do is take a level and maybe a mallet a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.250 
do is take a level and maybe a mallet a
rubber<00:00:46.829> mallet<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.969> kind<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> put<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> level

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
rubber mallet and kind of put the level

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.510 
rubber mallet and kind of put the level
loop<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.559> top<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.190> make<00:00:50.489> sure

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
loop on top of it and make sure

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.830 
loop on top of it and make sure
everything<00:00:50.670> switched<00:00:51.239> down<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> same

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
everything switched down at the same

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.279 
everything switched down at the same
level<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.980> don't<00:00:53.219> know<00:00:53.399> what<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:54.289> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
level is what you don't know what is you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.080 
level is what you don't know what is you
know<00:00:55.440> one<00:00:55.980> tile<00:00:56.190> would<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.520> higher<00:00:56.730> than<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
know one tile would be higher than the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
know one tile would be higher than the
other<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:58.140> creates<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> Ridge<00:00:58.890> is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
other and it creates like a Ridge is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.650 
other and it creates like a Ridge is
everything<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> slight<00:01:00.149> furniture

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
everything going to slight furniture

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.720 
everything going to slight furniture
over<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.020> stuff<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:02.280> know<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.430> could<00:01:02.609> end

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
over this stuff you know you could end

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.429 
over this stuff you know you could end
up<00:01:02.789> damaging<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.329> time<00:01:03.539> making<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> tile<00:01:04.260> on

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
up damaging the time making the tile on

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.219 
up damaging the time making the tile on
it<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.769> looks<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:04.979> crap<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.369> an<00:01:05.580> abbess<00:01:06.229> so

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
it just looks like crap in an abbess so

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.219 
it just looks like crap in an abbess so
that's<00:01:08.189> pretty<00:01:08.400> much<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
that's pretty much it

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.420 
that's pretty much it
just<00:01:10.229> making<00:01:10.560> weight<00:01:10.740> around<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.100> floor

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
just making weight around the floor

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.840 
just making weight around the floor
driving<00:01:11.909> down<00:01:12.030> silos<00:01:12.360> maybe<00:01:12.810> spaced<00:01:13.650> out<00:01:13.890> if

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
driving down silos maybe spaced out if

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.149 
driving down silos maybe spaced out if
you<00:01:15.000> put<00:01:15.180> down<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.750> few<00:01:16.140> times<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.770> hand

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
you put down a few times like this hand

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
you put down a few times like this hand
blue<00:01:17.310> tiles<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.420> said<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.750> stopped<00:01:18.990> get

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
blue tiles like I said it stopped get

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.359 
blue tiles like I said it stopped get
your<00:01:19.560> spacers<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.930> in<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.080> case

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
your spacers in there and in this case

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.280 
your spacers in there and in this case
I'm<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> grab<00:01:23.729> my<00:01:23.909> square<00:01:24.270> make<00:01:25.110> sure

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.589 
have all my whole top whole floor tiles
put<00:02:08.649> down<00:02:08.830> all<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.819> way<00:02:09.910> around<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.269> room<00:02:10.509> the

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
put down all the way around the room the

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.990 
put down all the way around the room the
next<00:02:10.869> step<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:12.880> my<00:02:13.030> edges<00:02:14.610> no<00:02:15.610> way<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.819> do

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
next step is to do my edges no way to do

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.870 
next step is to do my edges no way to do
that<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:17.709> essentially<00:02:18.100> just<00:02:18.250> measure<00:02:18.640> how

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
that is I essentially just measure how

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.570 
that is I essentially just measure how
long<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.120> need<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.510> be<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.709> for<00:02:20.890> example<00:02:21.280> here

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
long I need it to be so for example here

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.520 
long I need it to be so for example here
I<00:02:21.730> measured<00:02:22.390> from<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.660> distance<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.410> where

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
I measured from this distance to where

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.440 
I measured from this distance to where
it<00:02:23.620> contacts<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.130> wall<00:02:24.370> at<00:02:24.819> that<00:02:25.060> proper

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
it contacts the wall at that proper

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.830 
it contacts the wall at that proper
angle<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.500> case<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.890> 13<00:02:27.280> inches<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.780> I

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
angle in this case is 13 inches and I

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.930 
angle in this case is 13 inches and I
come<00:02:29.019> over<00:02:29.140> here<00:02:29.410> measure<00:02:29.709> 13<00:02:30.310> inches<00:02:30.610> for<00:02:30.910> a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
come over here measure 13 inches for a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.080 
come over here measure 13 inches for a
net<00:02:31.090> edge<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.390> edge<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.959> then<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:33.430> cut<00:02:33.970> it

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
net edge to that edge and then I cut it

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.620 
net edge to that edge and then I cut it
with<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.950> tile<00:02:36.220> what's<00:02:36.580> off<00:02:36.760> which<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.510> have

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
with the tile what's off which I have

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.970 
with the tile what's off which I have
here<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.989> got<00:02:38.200> home<00:02:38.380> depot<00:02:38.620> for<00:02:38.769> about<00:02:38.950> a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
here I got home depot for about a

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.160 
here I got home depot for about a
hundred<00:02:39.100> bucks<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:40.450> that's<00:02:40.480> what<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.930> do<00:02:41.049> is

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
hundred bucks so that's what you do is

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.809 
hundred bucks so that's what you do is
just<00:02:41.200> go<00:02:41.380> around<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:41.950> cut<00:02:42.100> your<00:02:42.250> pieces<00:02:42.459> if

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
just go around and cut your pieces if

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.180 
just go around and cut your pieces if
you've<00:02:43.330> laid<00:02:43.720> out<00:02:45.840> your<00:02:46.840> tile<00:02:47.080> properly<00:02:47.680> and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
you've laid out your tile properly and

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.380 
you've laid out your tile properly and
had<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.489> same<00:02:48.670> distance<00:02:48.970> from<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.180> wall

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
had it the same distance from the wall

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.539 
had it the same distance from the wall
or<00:02:49.420> anything<00:02:49.810> everything<00:02:50.140> should<00:02:50.470> be<00:02:50.549> just

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
or anything everything should be just

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.810 
or anything everything should be just
the<00:02:51.640> right<00:02:51.880> distance<00:02:52.060> but<00:02:53.700> given<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> fact

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
the right distance but given the fact

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.580 
the right distance but given the fact
that<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.390> know<00:02:55.480> stuff<00:02:55.750> happens<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.350> stuff

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
that you know stuff happens and stuff

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.780 
that you know stuff happens and stuff
might<00:02:56.769> shift<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.190> little<00:02:57.310> bit<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.670> your

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
might shift a little bit of your

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.340 
might shift a little bit of your
measurements<00:02:58.150> may<00:02:58.329> have<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.570> been<00:02:58.600> exact<00:02:59.140> on

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
measurements may have not been exact on

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.560 
measurements may have not been exact on
or<00:02:59.650> whatever<00:02:59.920> I<00:03:00.130> measure<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:01.000> name<00:03:01.269> it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
or whatever I measure it you name it

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.190 
or whatever I measure it you name it
each<00:03:01.930> individual<00:03:02.530> piece<00:03:02.769> before<00:03:03.400> cutting<00:03:03.609> it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
each individual piece before cutting it

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.289 
each individual piece before cutting it
so<00:03:05.200> I'm<00:03:05.980> going<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.280> do<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:06.790> cut<00:03:07.150> all<00:03:07.269> my

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
so I'm going to do that I cut all my

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.759 
so I'm going to do that I cut all my
pieces<00:03:07.630> at<00:03:07.870> once<00:03:08.049> lay<00:03:08.260> them<00:03:08.380> down<00:03:08.410> where<00:03:08.680> they

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
pieces at once lay them down where they

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.640 
pieces at once lay them down where they
need<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:08.950> go<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.489> then<00:03:10.299> bring<00:03:11.200> them<00:03:11.320> in<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.440> tile

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
need to go and then bring them in a tile

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.280 
need to go and then bring them in a tile
saw<00:03:11.680> cut<00:03:12.280> them<00:03:12.400> put<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.150> back<00:03:13.299> down<00:03:13.570> mix<00:03:14.140> up

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
saw cut them put it back down mix up

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.599 
saw cut them put it back down mix up
mortar<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.829> can<00:03:14.950> put<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.130> all<00:03:15.190> down<00:03:15.220> at<00:03:15.459> one

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
mortar and I can put it all down at one

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.059 
mortar and I can put it all down at one
time<00:03:15.790> that's<00:03:16.510> how<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.690> prefer<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.170> do<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.440> with

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
time that's how I prefer to do it with

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.440 
time that's how I prefer to do it with
this<00:03:18.250> pattern<00:03:18.670> once<00:03:18.850> again<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.180> herringbone

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
this pattern once again the herringbone

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.530 
this pattern once again the herringbone
it's<00:03:19.720> going<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.900> be<00:03:20.019> a<00:03:20.049> little<00:03:20.200> bit<00:03:20.410> difficult

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
it's going to be a little bit difficult

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.420 
it's going to be a little bit difficult
I'm<00:03:22.540> going<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.810> cut<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.079> lot<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.380> pieces<00:03:23.560> if<00:03:24.280> I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
I'm going to cut a lot of pieces if I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.340 
I'm going to cut a lot of pieces if I
would<00:03:24.549> have<00:03:24.609> done<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.819> square<00:03:25.150> for<00:03:25.900> pattern<00:03:26.260> or

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
would have done a square for pattern or

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.170 
would have done a square for pattern or
one<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.590> offset<00:03:26.920> patterns<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.489> wouldn't

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
one of the offset patterns I wouldn't

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.550 
one of the offset patterns I wouldn't
have<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.389> cut<00:03:28.510> anywhere<00:03:28.810> near<00:03:29.019> as<00:03:29.139> much<00:03:29.170> tile

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
have to cut anywhere near as much tile

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.559 
have to cut anywhere near as much tile
so<00:03:30.459> I'm<00:03:30.519> going<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.700> spend<00:03:30.880> quite<00:03:31.299> a<00:03:31.329> while

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
so I'm going to spend quite a while

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.690 
so I'm going to spend quite a while
cutting<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.079> but<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.680> like<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.519> way<00:03:33.609> this

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
cutting it but I like the way this

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.390 
cutting it but I like the way this
herringbone<00:03:34.090> pattern<00:03:34.389> is<00:03:34.450> looking<00:03:35.400> it

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
herringbone pattern is looking it

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.220 
herringbone pattern is looking it
definitely<00:03:36.910> gives<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.150> room<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.630> different

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
definitely gives the room a different

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.080 
definitely gives the room a different
look<00:03:38.380> and<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.340> think<00:03:39.579> it's<00:03:39.819> gonna<00:03:39.910> look<00:03:39.970> really

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
look and I think it's gonna look really

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.800 
look and I think it's gonna look really
good<00:03:40.389> so<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:42.120> feel<00:03:43.120> like<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:43.450> worth<00:03:43.600> it

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
good so I feel like it's worth it

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.750 
good so I feel like it's worth it
another<00:03:44.650> thing<00:03:44.799> I<00:03:44.920> note<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.310> I<00:03:45.459> do<00:03:45.519> not

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
another thing I note is that I do not

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.129 
another thing I note is that I do not
have<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.970> baseboard<00:03:46.450> down<00:03:46.630> yet<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.079> don't

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
have a baseboard down yet so I don't

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.590 
have a baseboard down yet so I don't
have<00:03:47.319> to<00:03:47.470> get<00:03:47.680> quite<00:03:48.459> right<00:03:48.970> up<00:03:49.090> next<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.359> log

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
have to get quite right up next to log

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.660 
have to get quite right up next to log
and<00:03:49.840> have<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.319> little<00:03:50.829> bit<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.190> gap<00:03:51.340> there<00:03:51.370> but

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
and have a little bit of a gap there but

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.850 
and have a little bit of a gap there but
you<00:03:51.760> don't<00:03:51.850> want<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.180> be<00:03:52.269> more<00:03:52.420> than

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
you don't want it to be more than

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.190 
you don't want it to be more than
quarter<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.190> an<00:03:53.280> inch<00:03:53.340> or<00:03:53.520> so<00:03:53.700> because<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:55.050> are

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
quarter of an inch or so because you are

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.080 
quarter of an inch or so because you are
you<00:03:55.680> know<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.860> baseboards<00:03:56.250> only<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:56.550> thick<00:03:56.850> I

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
you know the baseboards only so thick I

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.510 
you know the baseboards only so thick I
think<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:57.450> about<00:03:57.570> a<00:03:57.600> half<00:03:57.810> an<00:03:57.930> inch<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:59.370> yeah

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
think it's about a half an inch so yeah

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.890 
think it's about a half an inch so yeah
I've<00:03:59.610> got<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.790> little<00:03:59.970> wiggle<00:04:00.330> room<00:04:00.360> there<00:04:00.540> but

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
I've got a little wiggle room there but

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.930 
I've got a little wiggle room there but

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.680 
cracks easier and two as you're pushing
the<00:05:23.130> grout<00:05:23.370> down<00:05:24.300> between<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:26.360> your<00:05:27.360> mortar

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
the grout down between the your mortar

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.450 
the grout down between the your mortar
joints<00:05:28.020> there<00:05:28.169> what's<00:05:28.860> going<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:29.040> happen<00:05:29.340> is

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
joints there what's going to happen is

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.770 
joints there what's going to happen is
eventually<00:05:29.790> it's<00:05:29.880> gonna<00:05:29.940> start<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.270> dry<00:05:30.570> out

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
eventually it's gonna start to dry out

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.300 
eventually it's gonna start to dry out
and<00:05:31.080> then<00:05:31.530> it's<00:05:31.620> going<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.830> get<00:05:31.890> really<00:05:32.130> hard

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
and then it's going to get really hard

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.980 
and then it's going to get really hard
to<00:05:32.400> work<00:05:32.580> with<00:05:32.790> when<00:05:32.910> it's<00:05:33.030> really<00:05:33.180> thick<00:05:33.419> so<00:05:33.900> I

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
to work with when it's really thick so I

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.420 
to work with when it's really thick so I
like<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.200> mix<00:05:34.410> it<00:05:34.590> really<00:05:34.740> thin<00:05:36.950> that<00:05:37.950> way<00:05:38.130> it's

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
like to mix it really thin that way it's

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.610 
like to mix it really thin that way it's
just<00:05:38.490> easier<00:05:38.970> to<00:05:39.060> work<00:05:39.210> with<00:05:39.270> so<00:05:40.260> that's<00:05:40.500> what

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
just easier to work with so that's what

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.020 
just easier to work with so that's what
I<00:05:40.650> might<00:05:40.770> do<00:05:40.860> is<00:05:40.950> clean<00:05:41.160> my<00:05:41.190> floor<00:05:41.550> mix<00:05:41.910> my

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
I might do is clean my floor mix my

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.070 
I might do is clean my floor mix my
ground<00:05:42.270> then<00:05:42.450> I'll<00:05:42.540> show<00:05:42.660> you<00:05:42.750> how<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:42.870> put

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
ground then I'll show you how to put

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.710 
ground then I'll show you how to put
that<00:05:43.200> in<00:05:43.350> or<00:05:43.530> foot
