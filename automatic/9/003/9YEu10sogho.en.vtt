00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.600 

alright<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:01.530> in<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:01.979> I'll<00:00:02.340> teach<00:00:02.520> you

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
alright so in this video I'll teach you

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.960 
alright so in this video I'll teach you
how<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.790> do<00:00:03.110> three<00:00:04.110> heart<00:00:04.410> patterns<00:00:04.799> they<00:00:05.759> get

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
how to do three heart patterns they get

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.870 
how to do three heart patterns they get
more<00:00:06.180> complex<00:00:06.779> as<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.710> video<00:00:08.130> goes<00:00:08.460> on<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.330> I

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
more complex as the video goes on so I

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.410 
more complex as the video goes on so I
would<00:00:11.880> hold<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.410> white<00:00:13.410> or<00:00:13.830> black<00:00:14.460> well<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
would hold the white or black well the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.529 
would hold the white or black well the
most<00:00:15.570> people<00:00:15.780> have<00:00:15.900> black<00:00:16.080> by<00:00:16.289> before<00:00:16.680> white

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
most people have black by before white

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.859 
most people have black by before white
hold<00:00:18.539> white<00:00:18.900> or<00:00:19.230> black<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.100> front<00:00:20.630> red<00:00:21.630> on

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
hold white or black on the front red on

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.259 
hold white or black on the front red on
top<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.970> blue<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.600> left<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.910> black<00:00:26.910> still

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
top and blue on the left and black still

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.870 
top and blue on the left and black still
works<00:00:27.510> fine<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:28.220> white<00:00:29.220> just<00:00:29.519> looks<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> little

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
works fine but white just looks a little

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.340 
works fine but white just looks a little
nicer<00:00:30.000> so

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.770 

here's<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:36.010> first<00:00:36.280> one<00:00:36.550> and<00:00:36.969> it<00:00:37.149> is<00:00:37.329> the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
here's the first one and it is the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.099 
here's the first one and it is the
simplest<00:00:38.260> one<00:00:38.559> out<00:00:38.920> of<00:00:39.129> all<00:00:39.309> of<00:00:39.370> them<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.960> have

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
simplest one out of all of them you have

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.069 
simplest one out of all of them you have
to<00:00:41.230> hold<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.530> on<00:00:41.680> an<00:00:41.829> angle<00:00:42.010> so<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.269> street

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
to hold it on an angle so the street

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.549 
to hold it on an angle so the street
sides<00:00:44.589> or<00:00:45.129> actually<00:00:45.579> curved<00:00:45.930> will<00:00:46.930> be<00:00:47.260> on<00:00:47.530> a

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
sides or actually curved will be on a

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.750 
sides or actually curved will be on a
diagonal<00:00:48.280> line<00:00:48.760> so<00:00:49.710> there's<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:51.070> heart<00:00:53.760> show

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
diagonal line so there's the heart show

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.399 
diagonal line so there's the heart show
you<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:54.940> next<00:00:55.149> one<00:00:55.299> here<00:00:55.690> is<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:55.930> second<00:00:56.260> one

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
you the next one here is the second one

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.270 
you the next one here is the second one
you<00:00:57.010> hold<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.339> at<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.549> same<00:00:57.729> angle<00:00:58.149> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you hold it at the same angle and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.910 
you hold it at the same angle and
instead<00:01:00.280> of<00:01:00.369> all<00:01:00.610> red<00:01:00.909> and<00:01:01.149> white<00:01:01.539> it's<00:01:01.920> red

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
instead of all red and white it's red

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.450 
instead of all red and white it's red
outline<00:01:03.309> blue<00:01:04.269> in<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:05.080> middle<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:05.500> white<00:01:06.250> on

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
outline blue in the middle and white on

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.680 
outline blue in the middle and white on
the<00:01:06.490> edges<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:07.149> little<00:01:09.119> bit<00:01:10.119> harder<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.539> make

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
the edges a little bit harder to make

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.450 
the edges a little bit harder to make
but<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.899> not<00:01:13.899> as<00:01:14.050> hard<00:01:14.200> as<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.380> third<00:01:14.619> one<00:01:14.830> so

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
but it's not as hard as a third one so

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.760 
but it's not as hard as a third one so
show<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.210> third<00:01:16.390> one<00:01:16.569> and<00:01:16.780> here's<00:01:17.440> the

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
show you the third one and here's the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.330 
show you the third one and here's the
third<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.399> final<00:01:18.700> pattern<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.530> trio<00:01:20.890> of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
third and final pattern and the trio of

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.570 
third and final pattern and the trio of
heart<00:01:21.610> patterns<00:01:21.970> I<00:01:22.210> guess<00:01:22.950> hold<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.159> still<00:01:24.429> in

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
heart patterns I guess hold it still in

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.240 
heart patterns I guess hold it still in
the<00:01:24.640> same<00:01:24.819> angle<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.950> should<00:01:26.950> get<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:29.250> white

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
the same angle and should get this white

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.289 
the same angle and should get this white
background<00:01:31.060> red<00:01:31.630> outline<00:01:32.380> blue<00:01:33.369> outline<00:01:34.030> for

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
background red outline blue outline for

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.999 
background red outline blue outline for
the<00:01:34.330> middle<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:35.440> red<00:01:35.619> dot<00:01:35.860> um<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:38.409> have<00:01:38.920> to

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
the middle and a red dot um I have to

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.249 
the middle and a red dot um I have to
say<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.399> second<00:01:39.850> one<00:01:39.939> is<00:01:40.060> actually<00:01:40.450> my

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
say the second one is actually my

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.740 
say the second one is actually my
favorite<00:01:41.759> but<00:01:42.759> this<00:01:43.000> one<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.390> still<00:01:43.479> pretty

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
favorite but this one is still pretty

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.840 
favorite but this one is still pretty
cool<00:01:45.509> yeah<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.829> after<00:01:48.100> all<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.340> patterns<00:01:48.670> you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
cool yeah so after all the patterns you

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.459 
cool yeah so after all the patterns you
get<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.329> bunch<00:01:50.049> of<00:01:50.140> multicolored<00:01:50.710> ones<00:01:51.359> mmm

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
get a bunch of multicolored ones mmm

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.889 
get a bunch of multicolored ones mmm
this<00:01:53.469> just<00:01:53.770> looks<00:01:53.939> more<00:01:54.939> like<00:01:55.359> a<00:01:55.390> Valentine's

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
this just looks more like a Valentine's

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.090 
this just looks more like a Valentine's
Day<00:01:56.140> pattern<00:01:56.500> I<00:01:56.619> guess<00:01:57.810> red<00:01:58.810> white<00:01:59.109> and<00:01:59.350> blue

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
Day pattern I guess red white and blue

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.850 
Day pattern I guess red white and blue
or<00:02:00.340> red<00:02:00.399> black<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.210> blue

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.270 

okay<00:02:07.820> so<00:02:07.880> as<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.479> said<00:02:08.539> earlier<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:10.100> should

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
okay so as I said earlier you should

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.180 
okay so as I said earlier you should
hold<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.789> white<00:02:11.030> or<00:02:11.270> black<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.870> front

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
hold the white or black on the front

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.700 
hold the white or black on the front
right<00:02:13.190> on<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.400> top<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.820> blue<00:02:14.810> on<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.320> left

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
right on the top and blue on the left

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.050 
right on the top and blue on the left
side<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:16.840> look<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.850> first

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
side so look like that and so the first

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.030 
side so look like that and so the first
thing<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.330> want<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.510> do<00:02:20.690> for<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.620> first

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
thing you want to do for the first

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.880 
thing you want to do for the first
pattern<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.180> simplest<00:02:23.570> one<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.900> want<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.770> get

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
pattern the simplest one is want to get

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.170 
pattern the simplest one is want to get
this<00:02:25.930> three<00:02:26.930> by<00:02:27.200> five<00:02:27.740> rectangle<00:02:28.730> right<00:02:28.910> here

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
this three by five rectangle right here

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.350 
this three by five rectangle right here
so<00:02:30.370> first<00:02:31.370> we'll<00:02:31.550> bring<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:31.970> red<00:02:32.120> down

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
so first we'll bring the red down

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.000 
so first we'll bring the red down
because<00:02:32.840> that's<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.260> color<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.650> we<00:02:33.770> want

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
because that's the color that we want

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.750 
because that's the color that we want
the<00:02:34.790> replace<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.720> with<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.680> blue<00:02:36.980> because<00:02:37.400> those

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
the replace it with a blue because those

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.490 
the replace it with a blue because those
are<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:37.910> three<00:02:38.209> cars<00:02:38.420> they<00:02:38.600> want<00:02:38.780> not<00:02:39.200> green

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
are the three cars they want not green

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.199 
are the three cars they want not green
so<00:02:39.830> this<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.370> with<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.640> blue<00:02:42.190> like<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.220> so

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
so this it with the blue like that so

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.140 
so this it with the blue like that so
the<00:02:44.420> big<00:02:44.959> blue<00:02:45.140> section<00:02:45.530> is<00:02:45.650> right<00:02:45.770> here

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
the big blue section is right here

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.060 
the big blue section is right here
connect<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.270> red<00:02:47.660> edges<00:02:48.790> back<00:02:49.790> up<00:02:50.030> top<00:02:50.300> and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
connect the red edges back up top and

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.340 
connect the red edges back up top and
you<00:02:52.070> connect<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.489> blue<00:02:52.790> back<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.350> left

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
you connect the blue back to the left

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.290 
you connect the blue back to the left
and<00:02:57.350> so<00:02:58.250> there<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.459> got<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.670> main<00:02:58.820> portion

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
and so there you got the main portion

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.660 
and so there you got the main portion
you<00:03:00.170> want<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.440> get<00:03:00.560> this<00:03:00.739> two<00:03:00.980> by<00:03:01.100> three<00:03:01.340> block

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
you want to get this two by three block

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.780 
you want to get this two by three block
down<00:03:01.940> here<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:03.310> you'll<00:03:04.310> have<00:03:04.430> your<00:03:04.550> basic

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
down here and you'll have your basic

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.590 
down here and you'll have your basic
heart<00:03:05.239> pattern<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:06.880> bring<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.970> red<00:03:08.120> down<00:03:08.270> just

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
heart pattern so bring the red down just

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.070 
heart pattern so bring the red down just
like<00:03:08.660> before<00:03:08.890> substitute<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.220> over<00:03:10.630> with<00:03:11.630> the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
like before substitute it over with the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.820 
like before substitute it over with the
blue<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:14.140> just<00:03:15.140> want<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.410> three<00:03:15.620> by<00:03:15.769> two

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
blue so you just want the three by two

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.440 
blue so you just want the three by two
so<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:17.530> just<00:03:18.530> bring<00:03:18.890> over<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.760> three<00:03:20.269> by<00:03:20.390> two

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
so you just bring over the three by two

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.490 
so you just bring over the three by two
block<00:03:21.640> connect<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.850> red<00:03:23.000> edges<00:03:23.209> back<00:03:23.810> up<00:03:24.200> top

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
block connect the red edges back up top

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.050 
block connect the red edges back up top
again<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.450> then<00:03:26.450> connect<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.170> blue<00:03:27.590> edges

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
again and then connect the blue edges

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.500 
again and then connect the blue edges
back<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:31.090> as<00:03:32.090> you've<00:03:32.360> done<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:33.790> there's<00:03:34.790> the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
back so as you've done that there's the

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.270 
back so as you've done that there's the
simplest<00:03:35.959> pattern<00:03:36.970> now<00:03:37.970> i'll<00:03:38.090> show<00:03:38.150> you<00:03:38.330> the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
simplest pattern now i'll show you the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.660 
simplest pattern now i'll show you the
harder<00:03:40.280> one<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.640> make<00:03:40.850> but<00:03:41.239> not<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:42.049> hard<00:03:42.670> so

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
harder one to make but not that hard so

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.600 
harder one to make but not that hard so
after<00:03:43.910> you've<00:03:44.330> got<00:03:44.540> this<00:03:44.900> pattern<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:46.430> you

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
after you've got this pattern that you

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.500 
after you've got this pattern that you
want<00:03:46.820> to<00:03:47.000> have<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.570> a<00:03:49.269> kind<00:03:50.269> of<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.420> same

middle blue heart and so on do the same
for<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.830> buy<00:04:27.950> one<00:04:28.100> block<00:04:28.340> which<00:04:28.940> we<00:04:29.090> want

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
for this to buy one block which we want

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.530 
for this to buy one block which we want
right<00:04:29.450> there<00:04:29.680> so<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:30.830> bring<00:04:31.010> down<00:04:31.310> that<00:04:31.540> to

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
right there so you bring down that to

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.730 
right there so you bring down that to
buy<00:04:32.690> one<00:04:32.870> block<00:04:33.190> right<00:04:34.190> there<00:04:34.300> we<00:04:35.740> substitute

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
buy one block right there we substitute

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.170 
buy one block right there we substitute
it<00:04:36.919> over<00:04:37.160> with<00:04:37.400> this<00:04:37.840> white<00:04:38.840> one<00:04:39.500> by<00:04:39.650> two<00:04:39.710> block

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
it over with this white one by two block

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.460 
it over with this white one by two block
connect<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.240> red<00:04:41.479> edges<00:04:42.490> back<00:04:43.490> again<00:04:44.260> as<00:04:45.260> you

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
connect the red edges back again as you

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.940 
connect the red edges back again as you
can<00:04:45.620> see<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.479> then<00:04:47.479> you<00:04:47.510> connect<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.680> blue

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
can see and then you connect the blue

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.629 
can see and then you connect the blue
and<00:04:49.280> white<00:04:49.790> edges<00:04:50.260> at<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.500> same<00:04:51.680> time<00:04:51.919> back

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
and white edges at the same time back

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.200 
and white edges at the same time back
again<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:54.400> there<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.490> got<00:04:55.669> that<00:04:55.820> pattern

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
again so there you got that pattern

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.730 
again so there you got that pattern
closer<00:04:57.169> than<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.440> first<00:04:57.650> one<00:04:57.830> I<00:04:59.080> guess<00:05:00.080> but

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
closer than the first one I guess but

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.450 
closer than the first one I guess but
that's<00:05:00.919> just<00:05:01.040> my<00:05:01.220> opinion<00:05:02.919> now<00:05:03.919> show<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:04.250> the

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
that's just my opinion now show you the

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.659 
that's just my opinion now show you the
third<00:05:04.729> one<00:05:05.620> so<00:05:06.620> then<00:05:06.770> after<00:05:06.919> you've<00:05:07.190> got<00:05:07.430> this

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
third one so then after you've got this

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.170 
third one so then after you've got this
pattern<00:05:08.500> with<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.650> white<00:05:09.919> or<00:05:10.250> black<00:05:10.700> still<00:05:11.030> on

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
pattern with the white or black still on

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.080 
pattern with the white or black still on
front<00:05:11.950> you<00:05:12.950> want<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.280> have<00:05:13.400> this<00:05:13.580> little<00:05:13.820> dot

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
front you want to have this little dot

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.460 
front you want to have this little dot
right<00:05:14.419> here<00:05:15.070> either<00:05:16.070> red<00:05:16.520> or<00:05:16.550> white<00:05:16.880> or<00:05:17.470> black

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
right here either red or white or black

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.680 
right here either red or white or black
actually<00:05:18.919> I<00:05:19.070> think<00:05:19.940> white<00:05:20.210> looks<00:05:20.510> a<00:05:20.600> little

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
actually I think white looks a little

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.060 
actually I think white looks a little
bit<00:05:20.870> weird<00:05:21.080> because<00:05:21.260> it's<00:05:21.530> right<00:05:21.770> next<00:05:21.919> to

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
bit weird because it's right next to

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.860 
bit weird because it's right next to
this<00:05:22.220> block<00:05:22.550> right<00:05:22.580> here<00:05:22.880> and<00:05:23.150> then<00:05:23.240> I<00:05:23.479> just

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
this block right here and then I just

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.219 
this block right here and then I just
prefer<00:05:24.020> red<00:05:24.320> so<00:05:25.750> you<00:05:26.750> want<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:26.990> red<00:05:27.110> right

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
prefer red so you want the red right

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.430 
prefer red so you want the red right
here<00:05:27.440> so<00:05:27.650> you<00:05:27.889> substitute<00:05:28.600> over<00:05:29.600> that<00:05:30.200> red<00:05:30.710> dot

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
here so you substitute over that red dot

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.490 
here so you substitute over that red dot
you<00:05:34.330> substituted<00:05:35.330> it<00:05:35.450> again<00:05:35.750> with<00:05:36.080> this<00:05:36.169> white

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
you substituted it again with this white

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.969 
you substituted it again with this white
one<00:05:36.740> because<00:05:36.889> the<00:05:37.430> three<00:05:37.669> colors<00:05:37.850> again

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
one because the three colors again

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:44.159 
one because the three colors again
connect<00:05:39.979> the<00:05:40.039> blue<00:05:40.430> edges<00:05:41.889> back<00:05:42.889> like<00:05:43.820> that

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
connect the blue edges back like that

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.250 
connect the blue edges back like that
you<00:05:45.169> connect<00:05:45.440> leave<00:05:45.620> red<00:05:45.800> edges<00:05:47.020> back<00:05:48.020> like

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
you connect leave red edges back like

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.260 
you connect leave red edges back like
that<00:05:48.440> and<00:05:48.740> so<00:05:49.960> there<00:05:50.960> you<00:05:51.110> have<00:05:51.139> it<00:05:51.850> the<00:05:52.850> third

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
that and so there you have it the third

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.300 
that and so there you have it the third
and<00:05:54.430> hardest<00:05:55.430> pattern<00:05:56.200> to<00:05:57.200> make<00:05:57.229> still<00:05:58.099> not

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
and hardest pattern to make still not

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.279 
and hardest pattern to make still not
that<00:05:58.460> very<00:05:58.639> hard<00:06:00.400> and<00:06:01.400> so<00:06:01.780> if<00:06:02.780> you<00:06:02.900> flip<00:06:03.169> it

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
that very hard and so if you flip it

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.770 
that very hard and so if you flip it
over<00:06:03.440> I<00:06:03.590> guess<00:06:04.300> on<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.360> yellow<00:06:05.750> green<00:06:06.020> orange

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
over I guess on the yellow green orange

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.779 
over I guess on the yellow green orange
side<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:10.520> get<00:06:11.389> these<00:06:11.539> same<00:06:12.010> results<00:06:13.010> but<00:06:13.250> just

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
side you get these same results but just

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.670 
side you get these same results but just
different<00:06:14.030> colors

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
different colors

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.450 
different colors
so<00:06:16.270> there's<00:06:17.270> the<00:06:17.389> original<00:06:17.720> ones<00:06:18.160> put<00:06:19.160> at<00:06:19.310> an

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
so there's the original ones put at an

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.939 
so there's the original ones put at an
angle<00:06:19.820> like<00:06:19.850> that<00:06:21.160> and<00:06:23.410> you<00:06:24.410> look<00:06:24.560> pretty<00:06:24.770> nice

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
angle like that and you look pretty nice

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:30.749 
angle like that and you look pretty nice
so<00:06:27.880> good<00:06:28.880> pattern<00:06:29.210> for<00:06:29.360> Valentine's<00:06:29.780> Day

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 
so good pattern for Valentine's Day

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.910 
so good pattern for Valentine's Day
thanks<00:06:31.759> for<00:06:31.850> watching
