 Hello Polynesians! Today we are going to make the challenge of mashed potatoes. Wuu! 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.940
 And this challenge is that, well I prepared this challenge, in these dishes we have mashed 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.400
 Potato and to the bottom or entangled there are beans of the jelly beans, aha of those like Harry 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.650
 Potter but other flavors. Exact. There are all the colors, but there is only one green 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.900
 in each of the dishes, then it is the one that they have to take out. Okay. Whoever finds it 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.860
 faster is the one who wins. Goes. The good thing that this can be eaten. And here 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.480
 There are the judges of every 1 of us. Here they are. Okay. I disagree a little with the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.280
 plastics of you, but it has traserín. It has traserín. It has very large pompitas. 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.860
 The good thing that this can be eaten as Lesslie says. 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.780
 Ok If not, we're going to die. And since we have not 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 eaten, I think we will know this very well. Ok, let's start with the challenge. 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.620
 Whoever takes the 1st green, wins. 1,2,3! 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.460
 Karen, do not pass! 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.180
 Oh, I can not find anything! 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.560
 Is it the dust, right? 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.020
 Do not! 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.460
 I do not find any. 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.540
 I do not find any. 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.060
 I already got embroiled. I'm Santa Claus 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.080
 No I can not. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.780
 I can not find it. I finished 1kg of puree I can not find any beans, not one has left. 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.140
 Ah, look, here it is, it is moving. 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.840
 Is not this true Karen? do not. 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.460
 That is not, the one that I just took out. 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.840
 I found it! 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.580
 Do not! 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.360
 How do i do it? 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.600
 I dont know. Let's see you and me Karen, see who finds it faster. 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.820
 Come on, brother brother! Well, I'm going. He found it! 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.080
 Now you go. Follow. 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.500
 You follow, sister! 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.320
 what we had to find, what flavor 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.180
 it is this? I think lemon, lemon soda something like that. I think it's lemon soda. 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.720
 I found 3. I was the one who won in finding 3. no, Rafa also found three. 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.500
 No, I found several but since they were red and blue I did not take them out. My technique was to put 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.360
 the language and so on ... like that with the language, what did you do? 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.100
 First I did that ... I ate it. Did you eat it? Yes, well that's how I ate it and I 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.960
 it happened and so on. Gross! It's mashed potatoes. 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.360
 I do not eat flour. Well, it's not real puree. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.920
 It's not real puree, it's from that instant. Like this video if you liked it and put 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.520
 the comments that other challenges you think I would like ... that other challenges ... no, no, no! 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.140
 Why are you eating it? And put in the comments that other challenges want 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.640
 let's do and see you in the next video, Polynesians. 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.560
 Goodbye! I love them! 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.040
 I'm going to send you some kisses of flavor to dad.
