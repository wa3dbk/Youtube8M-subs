00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.980
 of the clock in jones the truth is that I 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.020
 I am a super fan of children and hopes 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.940
 I want to comment on it every time we go to 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.160
 a store every time you see something of 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.670
 they get excited and shout community 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.040
 I know that it's a movie for 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.020
 children is already all that but the truth is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.240
 I love children and I can not 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 to avoid then denis is like that which 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.260
 controls me a little bit when we go to 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.890
 super and we see things from the miners but 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.350
 I do not leave the mines anymore 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.670
 Well I like a lot we came up with 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.690

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.110
 teach to make these children that also 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.750

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.240

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.430
 super easy to do you do not need 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.580
 many things take you little time and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.649
 They are very nice, so you do not need 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.049
 nothing expensive we are recycling what is 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.780
 best of all so let's see the 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.310
 tutorial and in the end we will send 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.050
 We are the people who give us 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.179
 they asked for greetings 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.789
 let's see it goodbye cover the materials 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.909
 that we are going to need are glazes for 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.429
 nails blue silver or gray coffee 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.220
 and white the eggs where the 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.420
 surprise kinder egg toy 3 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:00.020
 permanent markers blue coffee and black 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:02.090
 a pencil and finally small sweets 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.250
 that fit inside the egg 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.920
 The first thing we are going to do is take the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.800
 Huevito and observe that they already bring 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.140
 guides one is like a curve that that 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.000
 will continue as a guide for the neck and 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.280
 the other is in the part where it opens 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.069
 the little egg that we are going to take as 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.920
 guide to make our overalls 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.470
 minion let's start to trace by 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.900
 these roads especially around 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.269
 our little egg making the shape of the 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.819
 overall of our minion comes first 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.830
 that we are going to mark you can guide you with a 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.079
 pencil or if you can not also know 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.640
 can be with a marker do the 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.769
 following lines that shows you to 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.480
 continuation 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.610
 do not worry much because the lines 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.049
 of the track are very thick because 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.560
 this is going to cover later with the 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.560
 enamel 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.670
 now we can start painting the overalls 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.519
 of our minion with nail polish 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.050
 This is what we are doing, taking care of the 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.930
 guides that we had already marked with 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.750
 our pencil leaves part of the work 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.129
 of the million to paint it at the end since 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.580
 this is going to allow you so 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.740
 hold it better when painting it 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.750
 any mistake you have when painting it 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.420
 do not worry you can erase it later 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.610
 with you remove very well to make the eye of 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.750
 your minion draws a circle with the pencil 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.490
 and paint it with white enamel 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.190
 outline the eye of communion with help 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.430
 of a pin and the silver enamel or 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.189
 Gray 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.840
 with the brown enamel paints a strip that 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.700
 come out from one end of the eye of 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.500
 mignon going around all his 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.660
 head until you reach the other end of the 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.210
 eye 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.910
 if you spend a bit of the eye margin 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:51.580
 with the cape polish you can touch up what 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.100
 with the pin and the silver enamel 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.810
 with the blue permanent marker we are going to 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.790
 start to outline the suit 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.340
 our minion as well as doing some 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.170
 details as your bags do not forget that 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.030
 the markers must be permanent 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.000
 this is so that our work that already 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.030
 we did not previously ruin with 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.700
 be a water marker 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.280
 with marker tape draw a circle on 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.440
 the eye and on it places only the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.450
 black marker tip this is for 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.180
 give you a nicer effect draws on the 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.990
 mouth the buttons of his overalls and the 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.849
 the group's shield in the central pocket 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.099
 depending on how you want your hair 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.099
 minion draws a few dots or lines 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.900
 in his head as shown in the video 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:36.030
 with white enamel you can draw 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.310
 just a little dot to give it 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.259
 a shine in your eyes to your mind 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.110
 Finally in a leaf you can write 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.690
 a letter draw a picture or put in 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.960
