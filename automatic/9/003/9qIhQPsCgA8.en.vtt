or anything on idle it'll get really hot

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.499 
or anything on idle it'll get really hot
if<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.020> bump<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> 6200<00:01:14.460> rpm<00:01:15.180> you'll<00:01:15.360> be

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
if I bump it up to 6200 rpm you'll be

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.100 
if I bump it up to 6200 rpm you'll be
able<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.750> hear<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.369> there<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.549> at<00:01:18.030> five<00:01:18.750> six

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
able to hear it there it is at five six

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.280 
able to hear it there it is at five six
and<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.250> 62<00:01:20.670> 37<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.630> that's<00:01:21.780> over<00:01:21.930> top

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and there it is 62 37 so that's over top

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710 
and there it is 62 37 so that's over top
speed<00:01:22.590> most<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.340> time<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> leave<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.030> 3.0

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
speed most of the time I leave it on 3.0

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.539 
speed most of the time I leave it on 3.0
I<00:01:24.900> keeps<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.350> right<00:01:25.470> around<00:01:25.650> fifty<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.280> sixty

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
I keeps it right around fifty to sixty

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.580 
I keeps it right around fifty to sixty
degrees<00:01:26.880> Celsius<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:27.960> I'm<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.409> some

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
degrees Celsius if I'm going to do some

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.319 
degrees Celsius if I'm going to do some
editing<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.130> some<00:01:29.280> export<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.880> I'll<00:01:30.000> bump<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
editing or some export it I'll bump it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.200 
editing or some export it I'll bump it
up<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> 5000<00:01:31.439> but<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:33.060> nice

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210
