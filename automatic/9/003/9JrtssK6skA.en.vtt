 here on the side we have some 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.130
 characters of the milan protocol and the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.119

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.880
 milena I do not know why the attack also 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.689

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.689
 expansion 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.570
 they are also characters of flesh and blood. 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.970
 Secret something like that and being here 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.400
 We have 59 Mariana that means that 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.560

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.420
 of which we had just come to each one box 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.720

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.090
 This package is here 08 lookout in the galley 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.770
 is above and I hope to keep this 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.689
 box intact but if you look well 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.509
 near here has some dots in it 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.670
 would be the assembly of the store stand 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.530
 so in this video I'm going to open a 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.250
 booster and box 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.149
 Do you think it's cool so he has a 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.149
 deviation up here 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:23.329
 and it was then we'll see the guys look 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.700
 only what search that has this here is is the 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.689

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.090
 The new series right. I'm very happy. 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.829
 which looks at the number of searches while 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.810
 I'll be able to open for sure. 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.840
 get open understanding how to save 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:46.269
 that again in this video is only coming in the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.000
 So guys, keep something 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.510
 There is nothing here so let's wait. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.510
 said roberto 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:59.209
 So this is the ninth booster. 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:03.889
 actually not so new that it is out in 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.980
 pure and hard arena is good he is very 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:08.989
 cool I think despite this jazz and a half 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.090
 He's not that old , but he's already 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:17.690
 a late series 09 of the 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.760
 baby have the amendment then this one is 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.129
 most current I bought in practice that was 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.229
 but now it is not anymore because it had 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.269
 one serious problem is the company 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.750
 of tv on then advancing it straight 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.349
 on here 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.669
 then this expansion here is the second 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.949
 crowne tom and now is already in third 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.959
 two cards, right? 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:39.129
 so I 'll open here the first one 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.129
 cut off this time I had 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:53.620
 so there it is ok 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:02.269
 hughton is much better of all go karts 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:05.569
 dana 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:12.859
 here she does not think very good, huh? 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:17.299
 It's really cool, this is it too. 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:21.349
 legal is the son of beauty next to 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.210
 the second command is open and a 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.050
 rare in the first booster this one is 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.300
 O 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.539
 which opened well in fact but here the name 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.009
 it 's different to have been here and there 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.360
 a little game, right? 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.229
 mainly had its Japanese name 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.639
 asked bnb so chinese probably 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:42.500
 Now I'll focus on the cards, beauty. 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:44.060
 Great people, there, then, beauty. 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.889
 People, this is the eye right here. 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.860
 now it's up to me and it 's close, it 's cool 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.569
 I'm following this character I 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.240
 would put the deck at least 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:55.460
 put it since it is the type from here then 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.319
 There is a lot of trouble in but the engine 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.300
 always get more in the shells in the galley 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:03.919
 and a character takes a stand 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.960
 has made huge had not i will read now 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.840
 in the video but then I read then 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.000
 way is good than wrong right? 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:23.560
 I kick the fuckin eating at the ow mall 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:28.069
 then open people and warmer and bt 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:33.740
 by the way it 's just that and not so special 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:39.169
 is that the character even more the alpha 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:44.360
 It's very cool already and it's also very 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:46.069
 cool the chinese website including asking 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.630
 the parts can not assemble the parts 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:56.150
 in this expansion 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:06:00.680
 the omega dana and well it is not much 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:02.990
 good level 4,200 then only for collection 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.120
 and this here is ibitu another name of 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.800
 highlight on the line sure you have not seen 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.840
 it's china 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:13.039
 but what I think if you do not know 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:19.479
 if the movie and more 300 bps assignment 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:19.479
 result today's net in the galley as well 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:27.710
 along with 1001 wj opened and the referee was 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.900
 So this was today's video. 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.759
 so if you like this one I like 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.440
 add favorites and subscribe to 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.639
 up a lot of people realized how this has 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.509
 nothing, I do not like it or kagame the galley 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:42.139
