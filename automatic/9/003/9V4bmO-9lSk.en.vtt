00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.219
 Here at this video I show you how 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.290
 you are a basil plant quasi end 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.760
 and I really have one now 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.439
 such a cheap plant from the 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.790
 Supermarket and if you are 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.349
 plant them in the garden or in the 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.420
 length of drag will go as a week 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.099
 The things actually to 90 percent 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.960
 that's because they, of course, with 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.489
 fertilizer and any things like that 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.599
 they are extremely manipulated 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.099
 grow as fast as you can then 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.509
 at home are intended to do, too 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.340
 do not keep that long because of that i have in 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.630
 either one would be my garden 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.820
 We recommend you to pull from seed 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.380
 then the most robust or 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.460
 I'm worried about a plant like that 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.410
 at some point in a video one more time 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.000
 before it comes with its woody 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.560
 Unfortunately, they are not there at the moment 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.920
 turn to it because it just more to 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.280
 to have 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.200
 and as I said that is very robust 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.730
 the holds is completely winter has the 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.550
 is completely outside then comes, so to speak 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.079
 sometime in march april or something like may 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.160
 at the latest, the whole sprout and me 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.510
 Show now really only in this 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.640
 Plant that's why I worried 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.020
 how and where to get those things now 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.180
 most call because the leaves have that 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.350
 is wrong and you see 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.810
 always here 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.210
 Stem here and there is always here 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.710
 here this branch and if you now 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 cut off the stems here 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.040
 would be then it is so then he is 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.930
 Constant quasi here completely away this 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.880
 stem over here then now 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.290
 yes, this piece about him but must 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.070
 still supplied with water and nutrients 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.049
 become 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.060
 that's why it's stupid that is if you 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.610
 The whole thing will always be above 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.229
 cut off these two crotches 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.520
 so here 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.409
 then the two sheets are further 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.330
 supplied and there is no energy 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.380
 so to speak, the plant was not deprived of any 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.670
 energy is wasted 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.720
 Of course that is also a reason why 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.950
 the plants are special for some 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.740
 to go in quickly because they do not 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.659
 do it right and as I said that is possible 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.890
 of course with this plant it would be 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.180
 then I would cut this off 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.500
 and if you do it all here too 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.210
 below always do where the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.530
 Branches is if you have it here now 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.049
 I would do that with the little leaves 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.170
 I do not want to do that but I want to be here 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.760
 cut off 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.500
 So it is left and right two 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.900
 very tiny leaves this one 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.460
 And this and more you have to do one 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.439
 to him in a basil plant even 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.430
 do not know how to recommend otherwise 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.720
 I'll give you one again 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.369
 I also try to do tutorial 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.599
 still as my basil plant is called 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.519
 and put a link to the 1 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.930
 the corresponding video then what I 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.069
 still turn but as I said only 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.290
 here if you are such a normal 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.999
 basil plant you have the harvest like you 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.359
 is and you have in this video 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.359
 learned now
