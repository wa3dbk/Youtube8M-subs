00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.679
 b Bernd legs of Carl Zeiss industrial metrology I visit 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.079
 Stalin Sterner 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:19.809
 There he wants to look at the latest measuring device in action 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:24.919
 The numbers come from is one of the world's leading providers of 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.060
 Injection molded silicone parts 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.800
 The Austrian company stands for high quality and precision in 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.800
 the development of products for mass production 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.680
 and to ensure the quality 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.880
 The company uses devices from Carl Zeiss 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.010
 looks tired 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.230
 Merkel performed well for the projects 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.180
 that the mobile could be 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.910
 special challenge over there 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.550
 that this duel 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.550
 the ray of hope Fred equals 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.630
 that a lot of kids have to take care Schalke quality is well possible for this 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.830
 to change 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.439
 The duel consists of twelve different ones 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.670
 we knock 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.210
 we are now locked is the colonel 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.560
 around 50 guests buy the game 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.120
 - the telecom not capable 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.820
 Dr we had several idle reported 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.340
 rent 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.940
 in the Union Finnish plastic was sampled the soft silicone became that 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.820
 money 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.740
 The development of the steering wheel switch therefore lasted very long today 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.620
 Stalin Sterner uses only one meter the computer tomograph Metro 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.430
 Tom 800 from Carl Zeiss 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.090
 X-rays illuminate the silicone components from all directions 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.210
 and reveal hidden details 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.910
 how did that happen 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.750
 scored for it 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.990
 then her performance will be the old one 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.390
 has been chosen 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.390
 Werner Utz Tillmann look into the depths 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.720
 the Kaulitz software calculates a 3d model of the data from the wealth of data 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.760
 component 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.310
 the different colors show clearly 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.799
 whether it has the right dimensions or not 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.959
 that is allowed 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.739
 many residents 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.619
 Picture Wilhelm 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:20.019
 frond 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.019
 the fans for having bought it since he was in court 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.849
 the culprits come 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.849
 the meeting point will be approx 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.180
 the numbers speak for themselves 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.490
 Stalin Sterner reduced the development time of new prototypes by the 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.319
 half 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.319
 Our everyday life is determined by seemingly simple things 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.829
 Once again it has been shown which know which experiences and which 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.799
 Technology is behind it 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.829
 It's just as startling as Institute 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.079
 on
