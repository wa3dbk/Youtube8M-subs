transmitter I'm using an old futaba 7c
transmitter<00:00:39.260> which<00:00:39.470> works<00:00:39.739> great<00:00:39.980> for<00:00:40.010> that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
transmitter which works great for that

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.490 
transmitter which works great for that
with<00:00:42.290> the<00:00:43.190> transmitter<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:44.659> controller

board that I'm using else I got from
Hobby<00:00:47.989> King<00:00:48.409> it<00:00:48.650> is<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:50.260> hobbyking<00:00:51.260> kk<00:00:52.180> LCD

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
control the board which works great was

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.370 
control the board which works great was
really<00:01:05.250> easy<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.520> program<00:01:05.940> really<00:01:06.900> easy<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
really easy to program really easy to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.880 
really easy to program really easy to
set<00:01:07.620> up<00:01:08.150> see<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.210> got<00:01:09.330> my<00:01:09.420> receiver<00:01:09.780> there<00:01:10.080> all

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
set up see I got my receiver there all

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.380 
set up see I got my receiver there all
the<00:01:11.720> receiver<00:01:12.720> wires<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:14.640> four<00:01:14.940> main

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the receiver wires the four main

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.270 
the receiver wires the four main
channels<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.110> then<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> auxilary<00:01:16.680> plugs<00:01:17.100> in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
channels and then the auxilary plugs in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.600 
channels and then the auxilary plugs in
to<00:01:17.610> five<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.680> we<00:01:19.680> got<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> outputs<00:01:20.370> for

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
to five and then we got the outputs for

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.770 
to five and then we got the outputs for
each<00:01:21.890> ESC<00:01:23.030> coming<00:01:24.030> out<00:01:24.120> on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> other<00:01:24.450> side<00:01:24.570> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
each ESC coming out on the other side of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.950 
each ESC coming out on the other side of
the<00:01:24.900> board<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.360> actually<00:01:27.510> started

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the board and I just actually started

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.610 
the board and I just actually started
off<00:01:28.050> with<00:01:28.230> turnigy<00:01:29.930> ESC<00:01:30.930> s<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.290> those<00:01:31.440> all

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
off with turnigy ESC s with those all

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.920 
off with turnigy ESC s with those all
blew<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.670> very<00:01:32.880> short<00:01:33.090> period<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.450> time<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.870> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
blew in a very short period of time so I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.359 
blew in a very short period of time so I
had<00:01:34.050> to<00:01:34.110> go<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.260> my<00:01:34.320> local<00:01:34.500> hobby<00:01:34.740> shop<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.250> get

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
had to go to my local hobby shop and get

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:46.140 
had to go to my local hobby shop and get
30<00:01:36.360> amp<00:01:36.600> ESC<00:01:37.110> s<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:37.680> work

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.150 

the<00:01:47.150> motors<00:01:48.250> also<00:01:49.250> came<00:01:49.460> from<00:01:49.730> hobbyking<00:01:50.510> and

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
the motors also came from hobbyking and

00:01:51.160 --> 00:02:06.990 
the motors also came from hobbyking and
these<00:01:52.160> are<00:01:52.990> 2826<00:01:54.880> same<00:01:55.880> zoom<00:01:56.360> in<00:01:56.510> there<00:01:57.640> 28:26

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.449 

you

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.830 

orders<00:02:13.150> from<00:02:13.330> hobbyking<00:02:14.549> these<00:02:15.549> are<00:02:15.879> 1,200<00:02:16.480> kV

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
orders from hobbyking these are 1,200 kV

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.149 
orders from hobbyking these are 1,200 kV
I<00:02:16.870> believe<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:20.260> props<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.739> got<00:02:20.890> from<00:02:21.040> Hobby

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
I believe the props I got from Hobby

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.589 
I believe the props I got from Hobby
Kane<00:02:21.459> weren't<00:02:21.700> really<00:02:21.909> that<00:02:22.060> great

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
Kane weren't really that great

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.580 
Kane weren't really that great
so<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.200> upgraded<00:02:23.769> these<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.189> easier<00:02:24.640> 8<00:02:25.599> by<00:02:25.870> 4.5

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
so I upgraded these to easier 8 by 4.5

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.130 
so I upgraded these to easier 8 by 4.5
props<00:02:27.299> which<00:02:28.299> work<00:02:28.540> really<00:02:28.840> great<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
props which work really great in the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.569 
props which work really great in the
front<00:02:32.409> there<00:02:33.239> see<00:02:34.239> I've<00:02:34.390> got<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:35.579> camera

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
front there see I've got the camera

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:45.730 
front there see I've got the camera
mount

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.860 

you

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.470 

I<00:02:50.220> actually<00:02:51.220> changed<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.700> cameraman<00:02:52.269> it

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
I actually changed the cameraman it

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.729 
I actually changed the cameraman it
actually<00:02:52.780> came<00:02:52.959> up<00:02:53.019> with<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.290> three<00:02:53.530> channel

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
actually came up with a three channel

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.830 
actually came up with a three channel
camera<00:02:54.220> mount<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.519> I<00:02:54.610> actually<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:54.940> reduced

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
camera mount and I actually just reduced

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.449 
camera mount and I actually just reduced
it<00:02:56.170> down<00:02:56.200> just<00:02:56.590> with<00:02:56.739> one<00:02:56.890> channel<00:02:57.250> all<00:02:57.430> I

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
it down just with one channel all I

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.949 
it down just with one channel all I
really<00:02:57.760> needed<00:02:58.060> was<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.390> be<00:02:58.510> able<00:02:58.569> to<00:02:58.659> go<00:02:58.780> up

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
really needed was to be able to go up

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.710 
really needed was to be able to go up
and<00:02:59.170> down<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:00.879> can<00:03:01.060> see<00:03:01.180> this<00:03:01.299> can<00:03:01.510> point

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
and down so you can see this can point

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.740 
and down so you can see this can point
down<00:03:01.930> pretty<00:03:02.200> well<00:03:03.360> patrols<00:03:04.360> all<00:03:04.569> that

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
down pretty well patrols all that

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.030 
down pretty well patrols all that
Channel<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:07.290> feels<00:03:08.290> like<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.680> can<00:03:08.860> see

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
Channel and feels like that you can see

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.369 
Channel and feels like that you can see
I<00:03:09.069> just<00:03:09.129> have<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.610> I'll<00:03:10.599> hold<00:03:10.780> all<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.110> one

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
I just have it I'll hold all this one

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.259 
I just have it I'll hold all this one
channel<00:03:12.629> on<00:03:13.629> my<00:03:13.870> radio<00:03:14.110> here<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:15.099> that<00:03:16.060> works

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
channel on my radio here and that works

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.309 
channel on my radio here and that works
really<00:03:16.510> good<00:03:16.810> don't<00:03:17.290> really<00:03:17.530> need<00:03:17.709> the

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
really good don't really need the

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.009 
really good don't really need the
panning<00:03:21.090> cankle<00:03:22.090> because<00:03:22.329> you<00:03:22.420> can<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.750> turn

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
panning cankle because you can just turn

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.460 
panning cankle because you can just turn
the<00:03:23.230> helicopter<00:03:24.190> itself<00:03:25.170> there's<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.290> pretty

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
the helicopter itself there's a pretty

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:34.400 
the helicopter itself there's a pretty
good<00:03:26.650> robust<00:03:28.410> servo<00:03:29.410> connection

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.760 

keeps<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:34.980> nice<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.190> smooth<00:03:36.470> comes<00:03:37.470> with<00:03:37.620> this

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
keeps it nice and smooth comes with this

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.500 
keeps it nice and smooth comes with this
rail<00:03:38.040> system<00:03:38.550> against<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.910> nation<00:03:39.210> forward

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
rail system against that nation forward

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.290 
rail system against that nation forward
and<00:03:39.750> gets<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:41.220> camera<00:03:41.460> view<00:03:41.760> out<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.090> view

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
and gets the camera view out of the view

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.090 
and gets the camera view out of the view
of<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.510> propellers<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:44.640> works<00:03:44.850> pretty<00:03:45.060> good

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
of the propellers it works pretty good

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.730 
of the propellers it works pretty good
and<00:03:47.100> that's<00:03:47.340> pretty<00:03:47.580> much<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.880> setup<00:03:48.740> it's

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
and that's pretty much the setup it's

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.780 
and that's pretty much the setup it's
pretty<00:03:49.950> easy<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.430> get<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:51.060> get<00:03:51.240> it<00:03:51.330> flying

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
pretty easy to get it to get it flying

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.750 
pretty easy to get it to get it flying
basically<00:03:54.350> it's<00:03:55.350> in<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:55.740> safe<00:03:56.340> mode<00:03:56.520> right

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
basically it's in the safe mode right

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.270 
basically it's in the safe mode right
now<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.000> if<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.540> just<00:03:57.720> hold<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.890> controller

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
now and if you just hold the controller

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.680 
now and if you just hold the controller
down<00:03:59.660> to<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.810> bottom<00:04:01.170> right<00:04:01.680> hand<00:04:01.740> rudder<00:04:02.310> and

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
down to the bottom right hand rudder and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.300 
down to the bottom right hand rudder and
it<00:04:03.690> goes<00:04:03.840> from<00:04:04.910> two<00:04:05.910> arm<00:04:06.410> just<00:04:07.410> like<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.830> and

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
it goes from two arm just like that and

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.930 
it goes from two arm just like that and
to<00:04:08.850> turn<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.270> off<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.600> arms<00:04:09.960> back<00:04:10.260> on<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.590> safe

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
to turn it off the arms back on to safe

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.490 
to turn it off the arms back on to safe
you<00:04:11.940> go<00:04:12.240> back<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.630> buck<00:04:12.810> back<00:04:13.080> corner

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
you go back on the buck back corner

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.850 
you go back on the buck back corner
right<00:04:13.590> now<00:04:13.710> goes<00:04:13.920> back<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.250> safe<00:04:14.460> again<00:04:15.860> back

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
right now goes back to safe again back

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.140 
right now goes back to safe again back
to<00:04:16.890> arms<00:04:18.290> boom<00:04:19.290> just<00:04:19.530> like<00:04:19.650> that

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
to arms boom just like that

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.550 
to arms boom just like that
the<00:04:21.150> cool<00:04:21.420> extra<00:04:21.780> feature<00:04:22.110> that<00:04:22.230> I<00:04:22.290> put<00:04:22.530> on

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
the cool extra feature that I put on

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.100 
the cool extra feature that I put on
here<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:24.200> I<00:04:25.200> found<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.650> way<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.830> wire<00:04:26.400> in<00:04:27.110> the

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
here is I found a way to wire in the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.580 
here is I found a way to wire in the
voltage<00:04:29.660> right<00:04:30.660> onto<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.020> board<00:04:31.260> straight

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
voltage right onto the board straight

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.960 
voltage right onto the board straight
you<00:04:31.710> can<00:04:31.890> see<00:04:32.160> what<00:04:32.280> it<00:04:32.370> says<00:04:32.520> right<00:04:32.550> now<00:04:32.880> it

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
you can see what it says right now it

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.460 
you can see what it says right now it
says<00:04:33.120> eleven<00:04:33.510> point<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.780> just<00:04:33.810> finished<00:04:34.200> flying

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
says eleven point I just finished flying

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.000 
says eleven point I just finished flying
so<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.640> voltage<00:04:35.970> is<00:04:36.120> down<00:04:37.010> but

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
so it that the voltage is down but

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.870 
so it that the voltage is down but
basically<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.610> wire<00:04:38.910> right<00:04:39.540> here<00:04:40.790> where<00:04:41.790> is

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
basically this wire right here where is

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.490 
basically this wire right here where is
it<00:04:42.000> right<00:04:42.120> no<00:04:42.210> no<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.510> goes<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.020> de

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
it right no no that goes to the de

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.700 
it right no no that goes to the de
beeper<00:04:44.330> there<00:04:45.330> is<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.660> wire<00:04:46.140> that<00:04:46.170> actually

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
beeper there is a wire that actually

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.980 
beeper there is a wire that actually
plugs<00:04:46.950> in<00:04:47.130> here<00:04:47.160> to<00:04:47.430> my<00:04:47.550> power<00:04:47.790> panel<00:04:48.270> that

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
plugs in here to my power panel that

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.500 
plugs in here to my power panel that
goes<00:04:49.170> wires<00:04:49.590> underneath<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:51.000> control<00:04:51.150> of

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
goes wires underneath the control of

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.620 
goes wires underneath the control of
boards<00:04:51.840> which<00:04:52.130> feeds<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.400> voltage<00:04:54.240> into<00:04:54.540> it

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
boards which feeds the voltage into it

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.050 
boards which feeds the voltage into it
as<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.870> can<00:04:55.020> see<00:04:55.080> there<00:04:55.490> I've<00:04:56.490> got<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.880> power

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
as you can see there I've got the power

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.580 
as you can see there I've got the power
distribution<00:04:57.540> panel<00:04:58.020> that<00:04:58.260> comes<00:04:58.440> from

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
distribution panel that comes from

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.130 
distribution panel that comes from
hobbyking<00:04:59.419> but<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.570> worked<00:05:00.750> out<00:05:00.900> really

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
hobbyking but that worked out really

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:10.370 
hobbyking but that worked out really
good<00:05:01.440> for

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.650 

making<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.250> nice<00:05:11.430> fast<00:05:11.730> connections<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.510> my

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
making a nice fast connections to my

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.560 
making a nice fast connections to my
controller<00:05:13.260> is<00:05:13.410> easy<00:05:13.740> change<00:05:14.160> out<00:05:14.400> must<00:05:15.360> be

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
controller is easy change out must be

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.100 
controller is easy change out must be
controllers<00:05:16.080> if<00:05:16.230> I<00:05:16.350> need<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.900> works

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
controllers if I need to and it works

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:26.780 
controllers if I need to and it works
great<00:05:22.670> easy<00:05:23.670> change<00:05:24.090> out<00:05:24.300> of<00:05:24.390> batteries<00:05:25.790> and
