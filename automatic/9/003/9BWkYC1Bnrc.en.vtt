guy who can basically shoot from long

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.370 
guy who can basically shoot from long
distance<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:08.760> rely<00:01:09.060> too<00:01:09.119> much<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.630> passing<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
distance we rely too much on passing and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.020 
distance we rely too much on passing and
these<00:01:10.740> small<00:01:11.010> passes<00:01:11.430> don't<00:01:11.610> allow<00:01:11.820> us<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
these small passes don't allow us to

these small passes don't allow us to
shoot<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> box<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.320> FA<00:01:13.560> Cup<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.920> all<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
shoot in the box the FA Cup is all the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.469 
shoot in the box the FA Cup is all the
way<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.280> January<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.850> can't<00:01:15.060> talk<00:01:15.210> about<00:01:15.360> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
way in January we can't talk about that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.570 
way in January we can't talk about that
yet<00:01:15.780> Champions<00:01:16.560> League<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.950> started<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
yet Champions League we started with the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330 
yet Champions League we started with the
defeat<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.960> need<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.590> strong

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
defeat I think what we need is a strong

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.640 
defeat I think what we need is a strong
tactical<00:01:21.210> strategy<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:22.020> move<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.500> game

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
tactical strategy to move the game

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.859 
tactical strategy to move the game
forward<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.340> think<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:24.270> would<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.570> what

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
forward I think what would that be what

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.810 
forward I think what would that be what
would<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.140> suggest<00:01:25.320> I'd<00:01:25.979> say<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.520> we

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
would you suggest I'd say that we

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.999 
would you suggest I'd say that we
basically<00:01:27.210> need<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.570> get<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:28.470> players<00:01:28.740> today

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
basically need to get see players today

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
basically need to get see players today
they<00:01:29.400> need<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> start<00:01:30.000> realizing<00:01:30.540> their<00:01:30.689> value

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
they need to start realizing their value

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.749 
they need to start realizing their value
and<00:01:31.200> start<00:01:31.740> playing<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.070> bit<00:01:32.220> better<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.670> we

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
and start playing a bit better like we
