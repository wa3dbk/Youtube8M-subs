00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
I was he to other great team so I'd say

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.590 
I was he to other great team so I'd say
you<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> them<00:00:38.760> three<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.329> you'd<00:00:39.510> like

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
you go to them three you know you'd like

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.479 
you go to them three you know you'd like
to<00:00:39.660> think<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.020> every<00:00:40.260> tear<00:00:41.129> them<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.399> being

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
to think of every tear them with being

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.450 
to think of every tear them with being
the<00:00:41.640> final<00:00:41.820> at<00:00:42.030> least<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:44.930> Swansea<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.460> they

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the final at least and Swansea and they

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.700 
the final at least and Swansea and they
obviously<00:00:47.840> had<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> great<00:00:49.079> season<00:00:49.289> last<00:00:49.440> year

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
obviously had a great season last year

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.049 
obviously had a great season last year
and<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.340> always<00:00:50.460> hard<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.789> repeat

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and I think it's always hard to repeat

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.220 
and I think it's always hard to repeat
that<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.480> do<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.809> they've<00:00:51.930> done<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
that what do you know they've done that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
that what do you know they've done that
and<00:00:52.469> reminds<00:00:53.340> them<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> league<00:00:53.820> cup<00:00:54.000> as

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and reminds them in the league cup as

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.639 
and reminds them in the league cup as

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
games i mean i think the gamma against

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.250 
games i mean i think the gamma against
away<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.360> routing<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> tough<00:01:10.080> game

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
away at routing was a tough game

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.200

up<00:02:36.049> there<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.439> terms<00:02:36.709> of<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:38.060> know<00:02:38.120> Bri<00:02:38.840> that

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.139 
up there in terms of you know Bri that

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.069 
up there in terms of you know Bri that
he<00:02:39.230> had<00:02:39.439> and<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:39.859> the<00:02:39.980> pure<00:02:40.430> ability<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.389> you

he had and just the pure ability and you

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.869 
he had and just the pure ability and you
know<00:02:42.169> it<00:02:42.709> was<00:02:42.799> always<00:02:43.069> managed<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.340> produce<00:02:43.549> as

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
know it was always managed to produce as

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.159 
know it was always managed to produce as
well<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.239> we<00:02:44.299> probably<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.629> best<00:02:44.810> player<00:02:45.019> that

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:45.169 
well so we probably the best player that

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:48.759 
well so we probably the best player that
have<00:02:45.260> led<00:02:45.439> with<00:02:46.870> up<00:02:47.870> manchester<00:02:48.379> united<00:02:48.709> in
