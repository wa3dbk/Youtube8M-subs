00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.380
 or the round you see it today I bring you a video 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.790
 of questions and answers I told you so much 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.889
 for instagram as per twitter that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.650
 would make questions with the hashtag 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.449
 answer so I've picked up the ones that I 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.980
 have seemed more curious or that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.619
 ye I think more curious or have 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.480
 never answered and I will answer it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.939
 how do they deal with haters 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.609
 I'm lucky that I do not have 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.439
 a lot of many haters always go 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.390
 to have any comment out of place 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.520
 or that you do not like the criticism 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.489
 constructive are always affected but what 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.190
 which are insults in plan and to attack 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.230
 directly that affects us simply 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.539
 you have to admit to not paying attention to it and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.309
 go ahead I 've said it before I 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.110
 I have gone through many stages of my life 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.989
 in which this one was not going to support this 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.520
 so that's why I already have the body made 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.789
 but still I think I have enough 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.070
 good acceptance and we are very 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.899
 happy for not having so many haters 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.629
 where I would live in a country of ice cream and 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.580
 nutella or in a country of Haitian unicorns 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.540
 definitely in a country of ice cream and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.840
 nutella 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.600
 and extremely obese but good would not happen 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.730
 nothing when we're going to meet you I hope 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.440
 that very very very soon because the truth 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.870
 that I would love in your first video 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.970
 conqueror you recorded you can record with 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.880
 a little canon to take photos 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.070
 compact that did not have autofocus is 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.540
 say this to refocus something 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.760
 I would have to stop the video and go back to 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.100
 focus and it was a roll that means the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.010
 network is not for you when you see it is 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.210
 part of my family no longer second to 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.770
 youtubers say this but it is that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.200
 true are people who are with you 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.150
 especially in both good and bad a 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.460
 moment had supported me a lot with 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.860
 the subject of my bitch that if you do not know the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.479
 operated but surely I will speak in my 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.130
 secondary channel on it because I 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.530
 you are asking a lot how is 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.240
 as long as I command the bad guys 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.390
 comments would always jump defend me 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.450
 in general I do not know apart there is a lot 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.900
 honey when I see on the street I do not know in 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.790
 Seriously, it's great for me, I'm not sure, 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.590
 changed my life because we squeeze more 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.190
 strong the control keys if you are 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.050
 running out of batteries 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.610
 the truth that I do this is typical 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.500
 that you see that the command does not work anymore 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.360
 lose even more the key but the certain thing 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.360
 is that my command broke a key 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.900
 quite strong even if you have batteries 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.730
 I do not know how you look at this year's year 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.220
 this has been done by several youtubers 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.400
 video just of how you look in 10 years and 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.250
 I the truth is that I have a problem and 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.760
 is that he planned my life a lot and I have 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.030
 an idealized and fantastic idea of ​​how 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.090
 would be my life in harm would have almost as 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.580
 30 years and I would like to be with 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.680
 someone married 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.050
 I would love to marry the truth if I 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.690
 I would like to be married and I would not mind 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.070
 and to have a girl I want to get married and 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.720
 have young children I always have 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.280
 dear many people do not share this 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.140
 opinion but it's something that makes me 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.150
 illusion but of course to have 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.570
 this should have a fixed job 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.850
 one money per month to each other or yes a 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.440
 house where to live and all this then 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.180
 let's hope the truth arrives that I 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.860
 like to see me like this with a job that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.270
 like and enjoying life 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.640
 and especially with the people to whom 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.820
 I want to ask me keep going up 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.800
 videos to youtube with charge without charge 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.890
 Do not collaborate or stop uploading 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.710
 videos charging the same in what is 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.050
 refers is that if I do not I do not know to what 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.910
 you mean ok, they are me 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.060
 asking continue uploading video to 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.460
 youtube without charging or not or upload videos and 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.400
 keep charging me at the beginning I went up 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.650
 videos without anyone paying me or doing 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.690
 collaborations or anything and in fact I continue 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.250
 making videos that are not 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.290
 collaborations for example this is not 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.790
 a collaboration there are thousands of videos 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.680
 funny collaborations and I do it with 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.720
 taste is my hobby I enjoy it 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.450
 much is something I've seen what 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.970
 I feel proud and I love it so 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.560
 I will see that part I could not continue doing 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.130
 videos without doing any kind of 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.430
 collaboration 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.520
 how would you define your style I do not know my self 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.440
 really every morning I get up with a 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.290
 different mood and as I encourage my 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.670
 state of happiness I dress in a 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.769
 way or another idea that goes apart from 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.810
 continue then I do not know obscure to say it 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.300
 pants ripped off some 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.650
 a shirt with bone or skeleton or 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.480
 things like that a little thinking about my year of 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.460
 my 15 years rather said that another day I 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.120
 fancy more stylish more like more 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.030
 arranged more sweet my girl is or a day 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.470
 more than a tube cake I do not know I think that 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.870
 right now how are you watching me and 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.490
 lately you must is with the style that 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.620
 I think that it is longer lasting 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.570
 saying it said a style that has my 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.180
 dark range as if I like them have 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.840
 my features how I like cues 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.910
 touch of elegance so to speak I do not know 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.250
 I think I found a style and it's unique 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.130
 and it's mine what you bought you pay for it 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.020
 or your mother, you ask me in each 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.699
 hall that 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.199
 I would ask each hall that 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.370
 where did he get the money that I am 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.699
 millionaire that if I touched the 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.099
 lottery many know that the hold 50 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:13.720
 percent or even more are usually 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.310
 collaboration is to say the clothes they give me 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.099
 free I just say without any problem 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.780
 he knows it a lot so that's why he does not come out 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.569
 the money but you also know that 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.919
 youtube now a job before I do not know 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.190
 I made money with the videos of 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:29.379
 youtube now if you dedicate a lot 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.389
 edit time is not easy to record is not 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.970
 easy to have ideas is not easy to be 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.970
 content creator is not easy is a 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.490
 work and that's why they pay you so I pulled out 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.800
 the money from there that my work 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.840
 now what would you say to yours 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.210
 gone and I have a lot of stage and I would say 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:51.849
 many things since you do not paint yourself like that 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:55.539
 please do not cut your hair yet do not get 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.490
 you are wrong with this boy but no no no 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.259
 would tell me anything because if I said something 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.849
 I would already be changing in my story and not 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:05.060
 I would have arrived at the moment that I am 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:07.130
 now so I would just say a relax 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.800
 from 1 to 10 regarding sales of less 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.380
 ok this point but see you have 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.030
 that come to see me because it gives off so much 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.800
 happiness 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.960
 today because I am happy I have my side to me 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.000
 many people who love me I have 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.160
 good friends I have my family that 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.730
 It takes care of me very much I have the person 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.500
 that makes me happier I think now 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.210
 same is the person who makes me more 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.130
 happy that in my boyfriend and I also have a 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:35.020
 precious bitch that survives everything and is 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.020
 fantastic by day I shop twice 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:45.000
 he seemed to see well selling everything and three 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.710
 times because I get hungry like the one and 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.020
 then you do not at ten- thirty then 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.419
 a lot of hours he can eat and 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.740
 I am hungry and mediating several times what 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.020
 It was what inspired you to study 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.389
 ism nutrition and is awaiting your 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.949
 good choice, many of you know my 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.570
 story and if I do not leave it the little box 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:02.490
 information from my study and I'm going to 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.400
 point of finishing dietetics I have one 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:08.400
 subject is something that I already know that I do not 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.100
 like I'm talking about nutrition and in that 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.139
 field if I like I like to give advice 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.540
 but I would not like it as a job to 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:18.270
 every day you get tired much I 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.940
 I took a lot of tirria and I do not see myself 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.410
 working on it I chose it because 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.320
 I liked helping people 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:28.350
 they liked science and it was the only thing that 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.750
 he had no blood or operations or anything and 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.360
 could help people directly in 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.800
 nutrition and psychology and I think it 's 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.120
 psychology would affect me too much 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.200
 problems so that's why I went to 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.030
 nutrition but I think I was wrong 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.039
 I should have gotten the letter and 

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.569
 be studying something audiovisual or 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.449
 some race of 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:47.580
 I do not know literature and be a teacher 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:49.319
 well and I go back gone all have been bunch 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.029
 of questions thousands years more really 

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:52.709
 you have done a lot and I have 

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:54.209
 asked also a lot about what
