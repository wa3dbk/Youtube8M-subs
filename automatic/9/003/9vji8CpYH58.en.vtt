00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.130
 so if there should there is some space 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.170
 turns oil through operation of the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.760
 he doesn't fall into it 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.130
 us moths started last week 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.990
 cambuur has been politely important for 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.769
 fc twente by bringing in the equalizer 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.240
 shoot 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.300
 is that what you meant in earlier 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.010
 take interviews with the lead 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.480
 yes that is it is a bit like me 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.970
 mean 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.480
 tim has some extras at that time 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.449
 necessary and yes I feel called 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.540
 because 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.390
 am able to take foundation with them now 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 busy with my second year here 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.910
 I again what the experience Samar 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.070
 hiss they do not agree season 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.350
 You can expect them naturally at 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.390
 by what more had shown that god 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.320
 put him together for yourself nice card 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.160
 keep training 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.199
 I change it I have I could and if you 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
 but enough trains and it comes 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.440
 anyway the rides and so I have 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.379
 had to give up 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.939
 I do have some heavy periods 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.130
 it is pure and new 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.950
 new club new players around you 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 other pressure you have to win now 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.390
 we will so if you had thought was 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.630
 very nice beautiful she was not much 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.630
 to daan 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.970
 I learned a lot of things last 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.409
 year that of course also plays with again 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.780
 better players who 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.140
 of which you also record things and tadic 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 promes and yes you learn from each other and from 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.570
 I also have a lot of things in it 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.720
 learned 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.460
 so so on i get the good stuff out of you 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.880
 Boys are drawn there you go 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.430
 in that it is a feed specifically 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.890
 yes i have used to that always 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.040
 very well your body and hair was just 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.610
 very strong at the ball and yes I don't 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.710
 very often no self in the duel 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.960
 a madman learned from him to be the man 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.659
 blocks and have come over me then 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.460
 then go to the ball and it did 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.609
 previously always different so me 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.310
 easier to balance out 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:08.910
 I learned so much from and and that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.830
 we small things you still have contact 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.860
 with ardic or promes 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.290
 not with a shower but with quincy 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.239
 well we still have one who wins 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.280
 start that they are made good luck set 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.250
 with the number of boys 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.709
 and that is still in it so yes we 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.030
 have another lesson in there what does she do that 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.010
 even more for things out there on that app 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.769
 We come to talk about those conversations 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.500
 a lot of things now only about football 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.299
 and what football actually little 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.329
 talked to her 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.790
 we bully each other a bit 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:44.849
 backgrounds and where do you guys 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.920
 all the pictures of youth come from 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.870
 hairstyles that sort of thing must be wrong 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.970
 everything beyond that is nice too 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.099
 if you can keep in touch that way 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.200
 then from that old team bar team 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.360
 strong you all together nut than 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.620
 you know it and it's good to have a good one 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.269
 to have bond with each other because then you go 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.510
 on the pitch also for each other by it 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.709
 fire 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.709
 so that's all right 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.810
 this weekend the home game against ado 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.090
 the hague in the grolsch fortress 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.680
 what do you know about that team so a team 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.269
 that should not be underestimated 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.630
 they go home until the last 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.160
 minute and ahead of time you have that family too 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.540
 style long before and then they scored 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.780
 yet one in the last minutes 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.400
 goal and we just have to be very sharp 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.440
 play out of focus from the start 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.500
 fight a bit very often 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.400
 last half an hour and that patience 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.620
 we must also save Saturday and as 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.690
 we just we do it well are 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.690
 we must be able to beat ado the hague
