00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
now this isn't new technology this isn't

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.619 
now this isn't new technology this isn't
a<00:00:53.670> new<00:00:53.850> idea<00:00:53.879> or<00:00:54.239> anything<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.570> that

reflectors<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.170> been<00:00:55.320> around<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.070> quite

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
reflectors have been around for quite

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
reflectors have been around for quite
some<00:00:56.699> time<00:00:56.730> now<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.210> they're<00:00:57.719> almost<00:00:57.899> always

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
some time now but they're almost always

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.099 
some time now but they're almost always
quite<00:00:58.829> larger<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.609> they<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.629> not

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
quite larger so they can be you know not

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
quite larger so they can be you know not
that<00:01:01.140> easy<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> carry<00:01:01.890> around<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> bit

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that easy to carry around and a bit

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.250 
that easy to carry around and a bit
awkward<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.270> handle<00:01:03.539> particularly<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.140> you're

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
awkward to handle particularly if you're

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.509 
awkward to handle particularly if you're
doing<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.500> self<00:01:04.739> shoot<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
doing a self shoot like if you have a

doing a self shoot like if you have a
camera<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.060> hand<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.450> you're<00:01:06.540> trying<00:01:06.720> to

camera in one hand and you're trying to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.240 
camera in one hand and you're trying to
use<00:01:07.170> your<00:01:07.350> reflector<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> other<00:01:08.040> hand

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
use your reflector in the other hand

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.670 
use your reflector in the other hand
it's<00:01:08.970> awkward<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.840> doesn't<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.470> work

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
it's awkward and doesn't really work

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.020 
it's awkward and doesn't really work
that<00:01:10.890> one<00:01:11.040> that's<00:01:11.280> where<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.640> comes<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that one that's where this comes in

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.469 
that one that's where this comes in
because<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> saw<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.439> folds<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:13.979> into<00:01:14.490> that

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
because as you saw it folds up into that

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.480 
because as you saw it folds up into that
kind<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.750> size<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> size<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:16.710> slip<00:01:17.159> into

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
kind of size the size that can slip into

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.810 
kind of size the size that can slip into
your<00:01:17.729> pocket<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:19.110> bewilderingly<00:01:20.100> easily<00:01:20.759> it

back and just like those little lights

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
back and just like those little lights
we<00:01:23.850> talked<00:01:24.060> about<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.229> small<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.560> so

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.230 
we talked about it is so small and so

pocket or your bag or whatnot and you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
will never ever notice you're carrying

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.530 
will never ever notice you're carrying
it<00:01:30.960> there<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.170> no<00:01:31.350> bulk<00:01:31.740> or<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.549> burden

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it there is no bulk or you know burden

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.960 
it there is no bulk or you know burden
to<00:01:33.930> lug<00:01:34.200> around<00:01:34.280> until<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.369> actually<00:01:35.549> need<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
to lug around until you actually need it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.440 
to lug around until you actually need it
and<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:37.159> it<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.460> become<00:01:38.850> invaluable

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and that's when it can become invaluable

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.090 
and that's when it can become invaluable
now<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.170> you're<00:01:40.290> not<00:01:40.350> familiar<00:01:40.409> with<00:01:40.799> what

now if you're not familiar with what

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.370 
now if you're not familiar with what
these<00:01:41.369> do<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.689> probably<00:01:42.840> guess<00:01:43.140> by<00:01:43.350> now

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
these do you can probably guess by now

by me pointing it at the light over

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.389 
by me pointing it at the light over
there<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.659> designed<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.020> reflect<00:01:46.920> light<00:01:47.009> as

the<00:01:47.549> name<00:01:47.750> may<00:01:48.750> imply<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.619> silverside

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the name may imply so silverside

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.789 
the name may imply so silverside
reflecting<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> lot<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.810> direct<00:01:52.259> light<00:01:52.500> very

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
reflecting a lot of direct light very

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
things like that supplementing lighting

even<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.570> you're<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> studio<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.290> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
even if you're in the studio so if I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.859 
even if you're in the studio so if I
turn<00:01:58.740> off<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.670> these<00:01:59.820> lights<00:02:00.119> over<00:02:00.450> here

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
turn off one of these lights over here

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.840 
turn off one of these lights over here
so<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.229> all<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.560> shadow<00:02:01.799> over<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.729> use

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
so I'm all in shadow over here I can use

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.660 
so I'm all in shadow over here I can use

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
this reflector to light up there we go

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.300 
this reflector to light up there we go

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that side of my face so if you've only

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.330 
that side of my face so if you've only
got<00:02:08.459> one<00:02:08.489> light<00:02:09.030> handy<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.250> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
got one light handy then this is a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.710 
got one light handy then this is a
really<00:02:11.700> cheap<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.060> expensive<00:02:12.239> way<00:02:12.660> to

really cheap and expensive way to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.670 
really cheap and expensive way to
essentially

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

start shooting with a duel light setup

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.509 
start shooting with a duel light setup
and<00:02:16.409> I've<00:02:16.650> got<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:16.890> be<00:02:16.980> honest<00:02:17.220> with<00:02:17.400> you

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
and I've got to be honest with you

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.949 
and I've got to be honest with you
because<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.390> relatively<00:02:18.750> small

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
because this is a relatively small

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.289 
because this is a relatively small
diameter<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.920> one<00:02:20.549> reflective<00:02:21.090> side

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
diameter this one reflective side

diameter this one reflective side
doesn't<00:02:21.599> really<00:02:21.959> do<00:02:22.319> much<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.980> job<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.670> most

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
doesn't really do much of a job in most

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.580 
doesn't really do much of a job in most
circumstances<00:02:24.330> just<00:02:24.870> doesn't<00:02:25.379> have<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
circumstances just doesn't have the

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.990 
circumstances just doesn't have the
surface<00:02:25.950> area<00:02:26.159> to<00:02:26.220> reflect<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.730> lot<00:02:26.849> of<00:02:26.909> light

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
surface area to reflect a lot of light

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.850 
surface area to reflect a lot of light
the<00:02:27.629> white<00:02:27.750> side<00:02:28.019> works<00:02:28.290> really<00:02:28.470> well<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.769> the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the white side works really well on the

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.319 
the white side works really well on the
bigger<00:02:29.040> reflectors<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.940> know<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> big

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
bigger reflectors but you know the big

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.699 
bigger reflectors but you know the big
and<00:02:30.480> bulky<00:02:30.599> an<00:02:30.780> awkward<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.140> use<00:02:31.260> one-handed

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
and bulky an awkward to use one-handed

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.630 
and bulky an awkward to use one-handed
we<00:02:31.769> talked<00:02:31.980> about<00:02:32.099> that<00:02:32.280> already

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
we talked about that already

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.030 
we talked about that already
but<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.480> silver<00:02:33.810> side<00:02:33.959> works<00:02:34.349> brilliantly

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
but the silver side works brilliantly

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.770 
but the silver side works brilliantly
outdoors<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.970> I've<00:02:36.030> got<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> bunch<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.510> stuff

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
outdoors and I've got a bunch of stuff

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.750 
outdoors and I've got a bunch of stuff
that<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.319> shot<00:02:37.829> with<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.310> show<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.579> as

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
that I shot with this to show you as

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.789 
that I shot with this to show you as
we're<00:02:39.060> talking<00:02:39.450> about<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:39.900> all<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.680> this

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
we're talking about and so all of this

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.009 
we're talking about and so all of this
is<00:02:41.040> shot<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.579> know<00:02:41.700> no<00:02:41.879> additional<00:02:42.659> line<00:02:42.840> so

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
is shot you know no additional line so

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.809 
is shot you know no additional line so
I'm<00:02:43.140> showing<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> before<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:43.980> after<00:02:44.340> -

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
I'm showing you the before and after -

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.250 
I'm showing you the before and after -
so<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.269> can<00:02:45.420> kind<00:02:45.569> of<00:02:45.629> get<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> really<00:02:46.049> good

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
so you can kind of get a really good

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.830 
so you can kind of get a really good
idea<00:02:46.319> of<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.859> difference<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:48.180> reflector<00:02:48.629> can

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
idea of the difference the reflector can

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.110 
idea of the difference the reflector can
make<00:02:49.079> just<00:02:49.440> simply<00:02:50.069> by<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.700> know<00:02:50.819> moving

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
make just simply by you know moving

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.089 
make just simply by you know moving
sunlight<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:51.959> other<00:02:52.109> side<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.650> stuff<00:02:52.920> you

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
sunlight to the other side of stuff you

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.860 
sunlight to the other side of stuff you
can<00:02:53.250> sort<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.790> bring<00:02:54.000> out<00:02:54.120> details<00:02:54.629> and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
can sort of bring out details and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.599 
can sort of bring out details and
highlight<00:02:55.410> your<00:02:55.590> subject<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.430> get<00:02:56.579> a

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
highlight your subject so you get a

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.640 
highlight your subject so you get a
better<00:02:56.760> idea<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.180> what<00:02:57.239> your<00:02:57.510> focus<00:02:58.079> is<00:02:58.379> and

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
better idea of what your focus is and

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.289 
better idea of what your focus is and
beyond<00:02:58.920> using<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.579> move<00:02:59.819> light<00:03:00.090> around

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
beyond using this to move light around

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.690 
beyond using this to move light around
you<00:03:00.480> can<00:03:00.599> actually<00:03:00.720> use<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.349> stop<00:03:02.310> light

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
you can actually use this to stop light

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.720 
you can actually use this to stop light
you<00:03:03.269> can<00:03:03.390> use<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.629> as<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.780> shade<00:03:04.519> like<00:03:05.519> in<00:03:05.640> this

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
you can use it as a shade like in this

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.210 
you can use it as a shade like in this
example<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:06.329> this<00:03:06.540> statue<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:07.019> shot<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.680> here's

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
example of this statue I shot so here's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.830 
example of this statue I shot so here's
the<00:03:08.519> gist<00:03:08.760> how<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.120> statue<00:03:09.359> looked<00:03:09.629> in<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
the gist how the statue looked in the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.030 
the gist how the statue looked in the
direct<00:03:10.049> Sun<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:10.349> you<00:03:10.409> can<00:03:10.530> say<00:03:10.620> fairly<00:03:10.920> high

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
direct Sun so you can say fairly high

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.740 
direct Sun so you can say fairly high
shadows<00:03:11.400> very<00:03:11.519> direct<00:03:11.970> sun<00:03:12.150> no<00:03:12.299> clouds<00:03:12.569> and

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
shadows very direct sun no clouds and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.899 
shadows very direct sun no clouds and
the<00:03:12.810> scars<00:03:13.019> to<00:03:13.109> diffuse<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.739> light<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.519> used

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
the scars to diffuse the light so I used

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.149 
the scars to diffuse the light so I used
the<00:03:15.239> reflector<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.260> actually<00:03:16.530> shield<00:03:16.950> the

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
the reflector to actually shield the

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.220 
the reflector to actually shield the
light<00:03:17.340> from<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.730> shadow<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.419> even<00:03:18.900> out<00:03:19.019> those

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
light from the shadow to even out those

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.599 
light from the shadow to even out those
things<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.650> way<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:19.829> can<00:03:20.010> bring<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> exposure

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
things that way I can bring the exposure

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.970 
things that way I can bring the exposure
up<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.599> looks<00:03:21.810> much<00:03:22.200> more<00:03:22.380> gentle<00:03:22.859> and

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
up and it looks much more gentle and

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.580 
up and it looks much more gentle and
natural<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.549> soft<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.030> just<00:03:24.510> lovely<00:03:25.079> really

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
natural and soft and just lovely really

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.800 
natural and soft and just lovely really
and<00:03:25.889> here's<00:03:26.190> an<00:03:26.340> example<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.970> often<00:03:27.299> using<00:03:27.780> the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
and here's an example I often using the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.659 
and here's an example I often using the
reflector<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.410> instead<00:03:29.069> of<00:03:29.129> blocking<00:03:29.519> out<00:03:29.549> the

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
reflector to instead of blocking out the

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.520 
reflector to instead of blocking out the
lights<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:29.940> try<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.299> fill<00:03:30.599> in<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.930> shadows<00:03:31.290> on

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
lights to try and fill in the shadows on

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.259 
lights to try and fill in the shadows on
the<00:03:32.040> other<00:03:32.250> side<00:03:32.519> bouncing<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.000> sunlight

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
the other side bouncing the sunlight

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.849 
the other side bouncing the sunlight
around<00:03:33.359> which<00:03:33.599> was<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:34.079> little<00:03:34.260> difficult<00:03:34.560> to

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
around which was a little difficult to

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.229 
around which was a little difficult to
position<00:03:35.250> because<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.549> was<00:03:35.639> under<00:03:35.819> a<00:03:35.849> tree<00:03:36.120> so

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
position because it was under a tree so

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.580 
position because it was under a tree so
I<00:03:36.299> had<00:03:36.389> to<00:03:36.510> find<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.079> position<00:03:37.200> where<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.530> could

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
I had to find a position where I could

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.830 
I had to find a position where I could
get<00:03:37.829> this<00:03:38.010> into<00:03:38.879> a<00:03:38.910> beam<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.329> sunlight<00:03:39.359> and

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
get this into a beam of sunlight and

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.330 
get this into a beam of sunlight and
then<00:03:39.989> reflect<00:03:40.319> it<00:03:40.410> up<00:03:40.620> into<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:40.950> shadow<00:03:41.160> and

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
then reflect it up into the shadow and

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.849 
then reflect it up into the shadow and
stuff<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:42.269> little<00:03:42.810> bit<00:03:42.959> tricky<00:03:43.199> bit<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.769> it

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
stuff so a little bit tricky bit and it

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.619 
stuff so a little bit tricky bit and it
can<00:03:43.980> be<00:03:44.129> done<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.519> from<00:03:44.819> the<00:03:44.940> back<00:03:45.150> side<00:03:45.449> here

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
can be done and from the back side here

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.199 
can be done and from the back side here
again<00:03:45.870> similar<00:03:46.230> thing<00:03:46.410> one<00:03:46.949> just<00:03:47.340> natural<00:03:47.910> one

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
again similar thing one just natural one

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.420 
again similar thing one just natural one
where<00:03:48.510> I've<00:03:48.599> used<00:03:48.629> a<00:03:48.930> reflector<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.829> fill<00:03:50.250> in

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
where I've used a reflector to fill in

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.939 
where I've used a reflector to fill in
those<00:03:50.819> harsh<00:03:51.269> shadows<00:03:51.569> and<00:03:51.930> make<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.199> just<00:03:52.530> a

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
those harsh shadows and make it just a

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.379 
those harsh shadows and make it just a
little<00:03:52.980> more<00:03:53.160> pleasant<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.819> gentle<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.209> know

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
little more pleasant and gentle you know

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.309 
little more pleasant and gentle you know
it's<00:03:54.510> pending<00:03:54.720> on<00:03:54.780> what<00:03:54.870> kind<00:03:55.019> of<00:03:55.079> looking

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
it's pending on what kind of looking

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.300 
it's pending on what kind of looking
after<00:03:55.410> maybe<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.739> want<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:55.949> house<00:03:56.069> shadows

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
after maybe you want the house shadows

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.670 
after maybe you want the house shadows
maybe<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.609> done<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.910> point<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.530> lacking<00:03:58.530> one

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
maybe you done the point is lacking one

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.199 
maybe you done the point is lacking one
of<00:03:58.769> these<00:03:58.919> in<00:03:59.250> your<00:03:59.340> bag<00:03:59.519> or<00:03:59.730> your<00:03:59.879> pocket

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
of these in your bag or your pocket

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.990 
of these in your bag or your pocket
doesn't<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.410> know<00:04:01.530> cost<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.190> any<00:04:02.459> weight<00:04:02.970> or

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
doesn't you know cost you any weight or

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.729 
doesn't you know cost you any weight or
bulk<00:04:03.449> or<00:04:03.660> anything<00:04:03.989> just<00:04:04.260> like<00:04:04.379> the<00:04:04.530> light

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
bulk or anything just like the light

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.900 
bulk or anything just like the light
just<00:04:04.949> like<00:04:05.129> a<00:04:05.160> sitting<00:04:05.519> beginning<00:04:05.760> this<00:04:05.819> video

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
just like a sitting beginning this video

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.789 
just like a sitting beginning this video
you<00:04:06.150> can<00:04:06.239> carry<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.540> around<00:04:06.569> all<00:04:07.079> day<00:04:07.139> every

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
you can carry it around all day every

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.110 
you can carry it around all day every
day<00:04:07.829> and<00:04:07.949> never<00:04:08.280> even<00:04:08.459> notice<00:04:08.970> you're

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
day and never even notice you're

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.869 
day and never even notice you're
carrying<00:04:09.419> it<00:04:09.510> but<00:04:10.319> when<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.560> need<00:04:10.919> it<00:04:11.099> or<00:04:11.310> it's

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
carrying it but when you need it or it's

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.490 
carrying it but when you need it or it's
invaluable<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.780> one<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:12.959> my<00:04:13.019> favorite<00:04:13.349> things

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
invaluable and one of my favorite things

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.170 
invaluable and one of my favorite things
about<00:04:13.709> these<00:04:13.889> beyond<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.579> boob<00:04:14.910> all<00:04:15.060> during

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
about these beyond the boob all during

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.210 
about these beyond the boob all during
the<00:04:15.389> usefulness<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.530> fact<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:16.829> it<00:04:17.070> does

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
the usefulness is the fact that it does

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.830 
the usefulness is the fact that it does
that<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.639> because<00:04:17.820> it's<00:04:18.000> small<00:04:18.239> it's<00:04:18.750> really

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
that and because it's small it's really

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.539 
that and because it's small it's really
easy<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.590> fold<00:04:19.799> up<00:04:19.979> again<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.250> get<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.400> big

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
easy to fold up again you get the big

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:21.890 
easy to fold up again you get the big
ones<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.910> know<00:04:21.030> sometimes<00:04:21.539> you<00:04:21.599> get<00:04:21.690> like

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
ones you know sometimes you get like
