00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.180 
Earth and then I go into the panorama
view<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.300> let's<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.690> say<00:02:45.870> if<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.320> was<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.680> this

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
view so let's just say if I was it this

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.820 
view so let's just say if I was it this
section<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.850> stadium<00:02:48.650> they'd<00:02:49.650> actually

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
section of the stadium they'd actually

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.640 
section of the stadium they'd actually
give<00:02:50.220> me<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.700> panorama<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.510> all<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.290> way<00:02:52.410> around

give me a panorama of all the way around

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.680 
give me a panorama of all the way around
that's<00:02:52.830> a--that's<00:02:53.130> a--<00:02:53.250> getting<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.880> right

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
that's a--that's a-- getting the right

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.990 
that's a--that's a-- getting the right
not<00:02:55.350> most<00:02:55.590> reason<00:02:56.070> are<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.310> really

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
not most reason are the really

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.530 
not most reason are the really
undetailed<00:02:57.990> door<00:02:58.670> it's<00:02:59.670> like<00:02:59.910> I<00:02:59.970> could<00:03:00.270> stand

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
undetailed door it's like I could stand

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.600 
undetailed door it's like I could stand

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
here in the state stay basically it only

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.650 
here in the state stay basically it only
allows<00:03:02.850> me<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.120> stand<00:03:03.330> on<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.600> up<00:03:05.420> only<00:03:06.420> I'll

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.199 
of it Bob cause sometimes I will
actually<00:03:23.190> have<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.489> go<00:03:23.700> out<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:23.910> look<00:03:24.000> for<00:03:24.060> my

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
actually have to go out and look for my

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.120 
actually have to go out and look for my
own<00:03:24.330> pictures<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.930> play<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:25.470> then<00:03:25.590> let's

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
own pictures to play that but then let's

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.040 
own pictures to play that but then let's
let<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.580> sweet<00:03:26.820> amp<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.239> can<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:27.480> can<00:03:27.870> move

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
let that a sweet amp I can I can move

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.080 
let that a sweet amp I can I can move
here<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.860> click<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.130> arrow<00:03:29.489> it'll<00:03:29.700> move<00:03:29.910> me

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
here I can click the arrow it'll move me

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.880 
here I can click the arrow it'll move me
a<00:03:30.120> bit<00:03:30.390> more<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.780> way<00:03:31.019> but<00:03:31.500> basically<00:03:31.769> I'll

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
a bit more this way but basically I'll

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.390 
a bit more this way but basically I'll
get<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> nice<00:03:32.340> view<00:03:32.580> of<00:03:32.670> here<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:34.050> I<00:03:34.170> turn

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
get a nice view of here but if I turn

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.130 
get a nice view of here but if I turn
panorama<00:03:35.400> photos<00:03:35.850> on<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.269> can<00:03:36.630> let's<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:36.989> say

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
panorama photos on I can let's just say

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.750 
panorama photos on I can let's just say
I'm<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.440> hover<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.920> mouse<00:03:38.010> here<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.580> there's<00:03:38.700> a

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
I'm I hover the mouse here and there's a

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.420 
I'm I hover the mouse here and there's a
picture<00:03:38.970> here<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.480> picture<00:03:40.170> exactly<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.190> way

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
picture here a picture exactly the way

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.580 
picture here a picture exactly the way
I'm<00:03:41.610> looking<00:03:41.760> at<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.450> stadium<00:03:43.049> will<00:03:43.410> just

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
I'm looking at the stadium will just

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.650 
I'm looking at the stadium will just
come<00:03:43.739> off<00:03:43.890> so<00:03:44.070> it's<00:03:44.190> like<00:03:44.310> if<00:03:44.670> I'm<00:03:44.970> pointed

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
come off so it's like if I'm pointed

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.440 
come off so it's like if I'm pointed
here<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.290> corner<00:03:46.830> looks<00:03:47.130> like<00:03:47.420> it's<00:03:48.420> a

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
here then that corner looks like it's a

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.360 
here then that corner looks like it's a
really<00:03:48.660> good<00:03:48.810> thing<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.410> really<00:03:49.799> like<00:03:49.950> it

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
really good thing I really like it

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.370 
really good thing I really like it
but<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.910> course<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.390> don't<00:03:52.019> know<00:03:52.110> how<00:03:52.200> accurate

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
but of course I don't know how accurate

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.199 
but of course I don't know how accurate
it<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:52.860> in<00:03:53.010> terms<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.400> images<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:53.880> stuff<00:03:54.090> like

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
it is in terms of images and stuff like

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.970 
it is in terms of images and stuff like
that<00:03:54.360> just<00:03:54.390> yet<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.140> yeah<00:03:55.380> that's<00:03:55.620> all<00:03:55.860> I'm

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
I've got a lot of primitive myself I had

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.539 
I've got a lot of primitive myself I had
this<00:04:00.390> pitch<00:04:00.660> yeah<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.410> was<00:04:01.799> talking<00:04:01.950> some<00:04:02.340> game

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
this pitch yeah I was talking some game

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.210 
this pitch yeah I was talking some game
planet<00:04:02.940> minecraft<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.540> he<00:04:03.720> suggested<00:04:04.470> us<00:04:04.620> a

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
planet minecraft and he suggested us a

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.789 
planet minecraft and he suggested us a
pitch<00:04:06.209> size<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.690> scale<00:04:06.989> what<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.260> think<00:04:07.530> wasn't

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
pitch size of scale what I think wasn't

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.900 
pitch size of scale what I think wasn't
one<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.190> can't<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.910> can't<00:04:09.209> on<00:04:09.330> but<00:04:09.590> it<00:04:10.590> was<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:11.130> few

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
one I can't I can't on but it was a few

days<00:04:11.940> ago<00:04:12.090> on<00:04:12.390> my<00:04:12.630> mind's<00:04:12.900> just<00:04:13.290> been<00:04:13.470> my<00:04:13.709> one

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
days ago on my mind's just been my one

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.070 
days ago on my mind's just been my one
cuz<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:14.519> way<00:04:14.640> as<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:14.880> lot<00:04:15.060> mainly<00:04:15.330> today

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
cuz of way as a lot mainly today

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.520 
cuz of way as a lot mainly today
but<00:04:16.680> yeah<00:04:17.340> just<00:04:17.780> overall<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.169> size<00:04:19.410> of

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
but yeah just overall that the size of

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.370 
but yeah just overall that the size of
the<00:04:19.650> pitch<00:04:19.859> is<00:04:20.100> it's<00:04:20.400> really<00:04:20.580> nice<00:04:21.380> he

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
the pitch is it's really nice he

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.800 
the pitch is it's really nice he
actually<00:04:22.680> give<00:04:22.830> me<00:04:23.060> exact<00:04:24.060> measurements<00:04:24.599> for

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
actually give me exact measurements for

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.480 
actually give me exact measurements for
all<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:25.140> sauce<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:25.410> I've<00:04:25.950> actually<00:04:26.099> got<00:04:26.400> it

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
all this sauce so I've actually got it

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.350 
all this sauce so I've actually got it
on<00:04:26.610> Polly<00:04:26.849> exact

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
on Polly exact

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.249 
on Polly exact
measurements<00:04:28.110> in<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:29.569> changed<00:04:30.569> a<00:04:30.659> few<00:04:30.870> tad

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
measurements in I changed a few tad

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.980 
measurements in I changed a few tad
things<00:04:31.620> like<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:33.120> is<00:04:33.300> supposed<00:04:33.479> to<00:04:33.719> be<00:04:33.870> our

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
things like this is supposed to be our

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.390 
things like this is supposed to be our
diagonal<00:04:34.530> but<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:34.830> really<00:04:35.099> don't<00:04:35.280> like

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
diagonal but I really don't like

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.550 
diagonal but I really don't like
diagonal<00:04:35.909> circles<00:04:36.419> so<00:04:36.990> I<00:04:37.020> decided<00:04:37.349> to<00:04:37.439> type

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
diagonal circles so I decided to type

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.869 
diagonal circles so I decided to type
them<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:37.919> let's<00:04:38.129> make<00:04:38.310> it<00:04:38.430> look<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.610> bit<00:04:38.639> more

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 
them in let's make it look a bit more

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.209 
them in let's make it look a bit more
round<00:04:39.180> it's<00:04:39.870> up<00:04:39.990> like<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.319> what<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:41.009> main

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
round it's up like that what the main

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:42.649 
round it's up like that what the main
thing<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.520> need<00:04:41.669> to<00:04:41.789> add<00:04:41.879> this<00:04:42.120> is<00:04:42.300> light

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
thing I need to add this is light

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.110 
thing I need to add this is light
especially<00:04:43.349> as<00:04:43.650> these<00:04:43.919> areas<00:04:44.189> of<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.759> bee<00:04:44.909> I

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
especially as these areas of a bee I

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.760 
especially as these areas of a bee I
usually<00:04:45.780> play<00:04:45.930> with<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.110> brightness<00:04:46.500> fully

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
usually play with the brightness fully

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.740 
usually play with the brightness fully
up<00:04:46.979> so<00:04:47.460> when<00:04:47.610> it's<00:04:47.729> doubt<00:04:47.939> like<00:04:48.180> this<00:04:48.389> now<00:04:48.569> it's

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
up so when it's doubt like this now it's

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.779 
up so when it's doubt like this now it's
still<00:04:48.990> really<00:04:49.169> bright<00:04:49.439> that's<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.400> thing<00:04:50.610> yes

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
still really bright that's the thing yes

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.490 
still really bright that's the thing yes
so<00:04:50.939> there<00:04:51.150> if<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.419> was<00:04:51.509> dark<00:04:51.689> and<00:04:52.050> people

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
so there if it was dark and people

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.920 
so there if it was dark and people
didn't<00:04:52.800> poet<00:04:53.069> off<00:04:53.189> it<00:04:53.340> like<00:04:53.520> their<00:04:53.759> black<00:04:53.969> Otsu

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
didn't poet off it like their black Otsu
