00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.170
 the peace of the Lord we are in the 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:18.860
 corner of ction and today I'll be 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.619

 Look, it's just a delay 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.470

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.740
 tv bookmark 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.440
 it has this size because it leaves the 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.450
 size because then in the end we will 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:41.150
 be putting a verse amen 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.940
 so come on, always remembering that 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:50.150
 We're going to need a barbecue stick. 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.000

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.290
 facebook and on the blog you cut it 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:09.970
 leaves there so put on the sheet 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.970
 renterÃ­a and with the toothpick you will mark 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:22.069
 do not need to tighten too much with the scissors 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:25.450
 in the middle of the scissors remembering you will 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.450
 cut the leaf of avare 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.570
