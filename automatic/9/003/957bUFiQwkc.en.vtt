few<00:02:05.880> instances<00:02:06.390> while<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> was<00:02:07.049> playing<00:02:07.350> which

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
few instances while I was playing which

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.859 
few instances while I was playing which
I<00:02:07.890> was<00:02:08.220> very<00:02:08.429> impressed<00:02:08.789> by<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.209> utilization

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
I was very impressed by the utilization

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.490 
I was very impressed by the utilization
of<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.289> 2.5<00:02:11.069> be<00:02:11.340> space<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:12.420> present<00:02:12.930> certain

of the 2.5 be space to present certain

of the 2.5 be space to present certain
elements<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.220> world<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:15.240> was<00:02:15.390> pleasing

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
elements of the world it was pleasing

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.290 
elements of the world it was pleasing
both<00:02:16.110> aesthetically<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.160> you<00:02:17.940> know<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.210> a

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
both aesthetically and you know in a

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.810 
both aesthetically and you know in a
tactile<00:02:18.780> sense<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:19.890> can<00:02:20.010> feel<00:02:20.250> fluid

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
tactile sense because you can feel fluid

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.880 
tactile sense because you can feel fluid
motions<00:02:21.390> much<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.200> would<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
motions much like you would with the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.680 
motions much like you would with the
freerunning<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.640> other<00:02:23.760> Creed<00:02:24.090> games<00:02:24.390> and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
freerunning of the other Creed games and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.960 
freerunning of the other Creed games and
then<00:02:25.110> beyond<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.100> left<00:02:26.340> uncertain

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
then beyond that I'm just left uncertain

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.850 
then beyond that I'm just left uncertain
but<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.390> should<00:02:27.540> also<00:02:27.660> very<00:02:28.110> clearly<00:02:28.410> mention

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
but I should also very clearly mention

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.080 
but I should also very clearly mention
this<00:02:28.950> was<00:02:29.160> an<00:02:29.280> early<00:02:29.580> build<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> game

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
this was an early build of the game

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.270 
this was an early build of the game
there<00:02:30.840> are<00:02:30.930> portions<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.709> may<00:02:31.950> not<00:02:32.160> have

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
there are portions that may not have

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.820 
there are portions that may not have
been<00:02:32.310> finalized<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.360> even<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.410> just<00:02:34.590> it

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
been finalized but even so it just it

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.130 
been finalized but even so it just it
felt<00:02:35.040> rough<00:02:35.400> playing<00:02:36.240> an<00:02:36.360> assassin's<00:02:36.900> creed

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
felt rough playing an assassin's creed

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.290 
felt rough playing an assassin's creed
game<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:37.709> become<00:02:38.250> synonymous<00:02:38.640> with<00:02:39.240> the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
game it's become synonymous with the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.900 
game it's become synonymous with the
idea<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:40.080> being<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:41.160> free<00:02:41.610> roaming

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
idea of being this free roaming

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030 
idea of being this free roaming
basically<00:02:42.690> unstoppable<00:02:43.620> killing<00:02:43.890> machine

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
basically unstoppable killing machine

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.979 
basically unstoppable killing machine
there's<00:02:44.730> stealth<00:02:45.000> elements<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.690> as<00:02:45.810> well

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
there's stealth elements to it as well

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.560 
there's stealth elements to it as well
of<00:02:46.110> course<00:02:46.170> most<00:02:46.860> people<00:02:47.040> try<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.670> employ<00:02:48.480> a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
of course most people try to employ a

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.750 
of course most people try to employ a
stealth<00:02:48.959> approach<00:02:49.050> from<00:02:49.380> what<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.620> can<00:02:49.770> see<00:02:49.920> but

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
stealth approach from what I can see but

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.729 
stealth approach from what I can see but
when<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.510> end<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:51.989> getting<00:02:52.200> into<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.560> situation

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
when you end up getting into a situation

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.440 
when you end up getting into a situation
where<00:02:53.400> you're<00:02:53.580> forced<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.060> deal<00:02:54.300> with

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
where you're forced to deal with

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.080 
where you're forced to deal with
combatants<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.920> as<00:02:56.160> much<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.550> part<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
combatants that is as much a part of the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.210 
combatants that is as much a part of the
gameplay<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.170> stealth<00:02:58.440> approaches<00:02:58.950> and

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
gameplay as the stealth approaches and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.520 
gameplay as the stealth approaches and
this<00:02:59.520> attempts<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.000> turn<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.660> dime<00:03:01.020> and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
this attempts to turn that on a dime and

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.370 
this attempts to turn that on a dime and
go<00:03:02.130> mark<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> ninja<00:03:03.239> style<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:04.140> it's

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
go mark of the ninja style and it's

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.910 
go mark of the ninja style and it's
forcing<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.920> into<00:03:04.950> stealth<00:03:05.700> only<00:03:06.060> situations

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
forcing you into stealth only situations

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.320 
forcing you into stealth only situations
essentially<00:03:07.920> punishing<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.700> for<00:03:08.730> wanting<00:03:09.300> to

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
essentially punishing you for wanting to

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.630 
essentially punishing you for wanting to
take<00:03:09.630> matters<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.170> your<00:03:10.200> own<00:03:10.410> hands<00:03:10.739> oh<00:03:11.130> this

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
is all again more than likely a personal

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.740 
is all again more than likely a personal
preference<00:03:14.070> here<00:03:14.430> but<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.209> didn't<00:03:15.540> really

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
preference here but I didn't really

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.470 
preference here but I didn't really
enjoy<00:03:16.410> my<00:03:16.830> experience<00:03:17.459> as<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.880> related<00:03:18.239> to

my<00:03:21.390> play<00:03:21.660> session<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.320> was<00:03:22.530> coerced<00:03:23.280> into

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
my play session I was coerced into

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.970 
my play session I was coerced into
situations<00:03:23.880> where<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.930> game<00:03:24.959> clearly<00:03:25.709> said

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
situations where the game clearly said

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.130 
situations where the game clearly said

really been the strongest suit of this

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.530 
really been the strongest suit of this
franchise<00:04:05.040> but<00:04:05.579> at<00:04:05.700> least<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:06.209> had<00:04:06.390> become

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
franchise but at least it had become

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.620 
franchise but at least it had become
consistent<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.370> suppose<00:04:08.670> consistency

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
consistent and I suppose consistency

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.240 
consistent and I suppose consistency
shouldn't<00:04:10.140> really<00:04:10.320> be<00:04:10.410> what<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.799> call<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.160> a

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
shouldn't really be what I call it a

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.220 
shouldn't really be what I call it a
question<00:04:11.579> in<00:04:11.670> here<00:04:11.880> but<00:04:12.420> what<00:04:12.570> I<00:04:12.600> do<00:04:12.720> take

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
question in here but what I do take

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.830 
question in here but what I do take
issue<00:04:13.410> with<00:04:13.590> is<00:04:14.040> whether<00:04:14.940> or<00:04:15.090> not<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.390> new

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
issue with is whether or not this new

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.099 
issue with is whether or not this new
direction<00:04:16.049> things<00:04:16.890> are<00:04:17.100> taking<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.780> fun<00:04:18.780> I

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
direction things are taking is fun I

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.949 
direction things are taking is fun I
think<00:04:19.799> it<00:04:19.890> will<00:04:20.070> be<00:04:20.310> but<00:04:20.760> for<00:04:21.329> an<00:04:21.419> entirely<00:04:21.780> new

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.400 
think it will be but for an entirely new

Assassin's Creed with this approach

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.339 
greatest experience the 2.5 the approach
is<00:05:08.949> certainly<00:05:09.520> different<00:05:09.849> but<00:05:10.389> felt<00:05:10.960> clunky

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
is certainly different but felt clunky

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.860 
is certainly different but felt clunky
it<00:05:12.130> forced<00:05:12.610> itself<00:05:12.909> onto<00:05:13.150> me<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:13.419> majority<00:05:13.840> of
