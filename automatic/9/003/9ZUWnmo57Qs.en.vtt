00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.020
 but not serious 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.620

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.409
 well you do it with so much love 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.180
 it shows that you want to do what 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.920
 do you really want and that's something 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.170
 good that it is that you teach the emotion that 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.360
 you have to make it sing beautifully 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.280
