00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.040
 headband with super habits originated 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.560
 easy and that is perfect for 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.379

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.780
 that approaching halloween have a 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.730
 headband but if we want to be adapting 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.830
 they can put it in a pair of tweezers so that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.250
 nothing 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.820
 hair assured that it is very nice like that 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.129

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:39.570

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.470

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.989
 Double-check the outline on your 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.579
 template on the fabric plush trims and 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.579
 repeat the stone 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.820
 when you have finished cutting them 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.270
 take one of the pieces and turn it 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.510

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.820

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.630
 black and felt with pink but leaves 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.840
 a space at the end so you can 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.360
 turn around 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.920
 turn over and put a little bit of silicone on 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.920
 the missing space or sew 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.979

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.979

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.980
 how I want my little ears a little 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.620
 more detailed I added strips with a

 bun but it's up to everyone 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.880

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.970
 side 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.970

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.510

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.530
 sometimes 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:46.030
