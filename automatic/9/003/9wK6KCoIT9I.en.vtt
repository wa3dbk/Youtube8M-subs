00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hello dear friends today we are 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.919
 test rolling speed 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.170
 vegetable garden various tools and 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.240
 try to assess the quality of processing 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.730
 soil on the test plot of the field which 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.430
 not processed one year will pass 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.560
 otter shovel tests with special 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.699
 curved silhouette and elevated 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.699
 soil permeability 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.579
 traditional spade bayonet or bayonet 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:46.250
 direct acting shovels for hardy and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:48.950
 strong spins and 4 teeth of villas 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.300
 possessing a passing action 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.300
 designed to weed their fans 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 test method to calculate the average time 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.980
 rolling a uniform soil area 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.939
 measuring 10 meters by 1 meter for each 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:10.770
 of the participants in the first test 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:14.460
 participating otter shovel she with ease 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.860
 penetrates the soil and its curved shape 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.159
 helps with less effort to recline 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.310
 the ground at the same time is a shovel 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.869
 periodically cut weeds what can 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.869
 greatly complicate their cleaning 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.130
 spade bayonet participates in test number two 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.560
 traditional bayonet shovel is a shovel 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.930
 with ease enters the ground but for 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.170
 she will need more soil 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.810
 effort unlike shovels dough 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:15.390
 number 1 and here we also observe 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:17.970
 periodic weed cutting we 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.950
 go to the third test and in the arena 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.920
 4 teeth appear 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:30.270
 with virtually no effort 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.760
 villas penetrate the ground but fighting 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.630
 lumps of land will require at least two 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.140
 three hits and at the same time note that 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.730
 villas practically do not cut weed 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.730
 helping to remove it from the soil entirely 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:09.000
 Now let's replace the hand tool on 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.440
 mechanized on our garden and 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.069
 motor-cultivator and we open the test 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.750
 number four 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:21.150
 carefully observe how buried 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.160
 cultivator knives tillage 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.569
 going deep into the ground for 20-30 centimeters 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.299
 knives easily loosen the earth but at the same 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.019
 time most weeds are either crushed 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.319
 apart or wound onto a shaft and 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.569
 motor cultivator last member 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.590
 tests was a motor cultivator and here it is 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.590
 processed strip 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:56.290
 our tests are completed and we are ready 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:04:00.010
 share test results for 4 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.790
 place 4 teeth and villas 42 minutes on 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.819
 third place shovel bayonet 36 minutes on 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.489
 second place an otter shovel 30 minutes and on 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.000
 first place motor cultivator processing 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.400
 plot 10 on 1 meter took him all 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.229
 10 minutes 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.630
 appreciating the quality of rolling we came 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.820
 to the conclusion that with shovels and pitchforks better 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.000
 weed is selected and motor cultivator 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.830
 helps to loosen the already cultivated soil 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.160
