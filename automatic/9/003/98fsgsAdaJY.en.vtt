00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.800
 for me rl is an extremely sport 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:45.500
 complete the pilot must have decision 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.780
 and courage skill speed dexterity 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.719
 resistance is a continuous adaptation the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.260
 pilot must however adapt to the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.850
 different weather conditions of the weather 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.850
 it's a very difficult sport 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.350
 it's a motor sport that though 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.080
 captures the charm of being able to 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.240
 transit on open roads that therefore 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.810
 the day before they are perhaps traveled by 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.400
 ordinary people are winding roads 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.530
 must be roads that lead to 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.770
 the ability of course is hard to test 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.770
 pilot 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.990
 it's a fantastic experience for me is a 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.080
 work and my team and mine 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.080
 family 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.490
 they will have to martino 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.320
 ga 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.960
 get 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.080
 the notes are a code during the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.090
 reconnaissance every pilot dictates the notes 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.100
 the navigator writes the first one 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.960
 pass then the second pass on 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.580
 navigator dictates and does the same 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.180
 what then in the race we divided the curves 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.580
 in speed the left one is slow 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.430
 the left 67 is faster is 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.430
 clearly the nanda remains to rise 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.989
 Sell 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.989
 the movement want rope 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:35.210
 with navigator in practice atc close i 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:40.420
 three square meters for hours and hours days 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.420
 integers for which purposes must be total 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.860
 from the first corner you must succeed in 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.190
 enter into symbiosis with your pilot e 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.680
 do and do all the testing in one 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.680
 just breath 10 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.680
 down 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.880
 venere with three inside so more secure 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.140
 that to hold to be a finite 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.140
 finished then opens 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.550
 rally is of the public the public can 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.980
 post near the machines both in 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.620
 assistance park when we arrive at 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.170
 few meters from us and on the tests 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.020
 specials always manned by 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:43.060
 but commissioners can see the passages a 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:46.990
 street side when you see the full hills 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.620
 of people that fortunately happens 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:55.020
 that's a nice thing makes you me 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.020
 it still excites after so many years 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.700
 the night is a memory of what 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.130
 it could be above all the past from 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.410
 There were many more rallies at night 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.350
 now, on the other hand, there is very little evidence 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.300
 at night for us navigators it is 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.260
 just as difficult because you have to 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.360
 however, read in the dark and at a small light 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.000
 that only illuminates the notebook of the 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.400
 notes there are flashes there 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.390
 they sometimes remember where you are 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.390
 however the public 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:36.330
 you must have the brakes must have the trim 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.399
 you must have the engine must have the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.969
 ease of use because you never do it 

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:44.369
 narrow dirty streets wet snow and 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:47.279
 dirt we find everything for which here is you 

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:50.449
 I say immediately the rally is the real sport 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:50.449
 of the bus exits
