working on support mxf for mex makes
quicktime<00:02:33.900> plugin<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.070> can<00:02:35.280> read<00:02:35.460> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
quicktime plugin so you can read the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.710 
quicktime plugin so you can read the
files<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:36.090> any<00:02:36.270> quicktime<00:02:36.810> application<00:02:37.470> and

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
files in any quicktime application and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.570 
files in any quicktime application and
yeah<00:02:39.720> that's<00:02:39.870> about<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.770> we<00:02:40.890> also<00:02:41.070> develop

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
yeah that's about it and we also develop

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.600 
yeah that's about it and we also develop
a<00:02:41.700> small<00:02:42.660> transcoder<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.800> will<00:02:44.010> transcode

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
a small transcoder that will transcode

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.640 
a small transcoder that will transcode
into<00:02:45.200> quicktime<00:02:46.200> pro<00:02:46.350> res<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.810> that's<00:02:49.050> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
into quicktime pro res so that's the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.830 
into quicktime pro res so that's the
options<00:02:49.950> right<00:02:50.130> now<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:51.120> i'm<00:02:51.570> sure

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
options right now and there i'm sure

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.410 
options right now and there i'm sure
there's<00:02:52.110> more<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.800> come<00:02:52.830> real<00:02:53.310> soon<00:02:53.550> it's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
there's more to come real soon it's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.910 
there's more to come real soon it's
great<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:54.840> i<00:02:55.080> see<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.440> because<00:02:55.740> of<00:02:55.860> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
great and i see that because of the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.920 
great and i see that because of the
small<00:02:56.130> form<00:02:56.400> factor<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:56.850> able<00:02:57.030> using<00:02:57.390> systems

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
small form factor you able using systems

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.980 
small form factor you able using systems
like<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.260> 3d<00:02:58.590> right<00:02:58.800> here<00:02:59.090> this<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> km

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
like this 3d right here this is to a km

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.840 
like this 3d right here this is to a km

rig<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:07.320> two<00:03:07.470> cameras<00:03:07.950> weights<00:03:08.940> about<00:03:10.040> two

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
rig the two cameras weights about two

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.300 
rig the two cameras weights about two
kilos<00:03:11.400> each<00:03:11.610> with<00:03:11.970> lenses<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:13.410> it's<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.740> four

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
kilos each with lenses so it's like four

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.729 
kilos each with lenses so it's like four
kilos<00:03:14.700> of<00:03:14.730> camera<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.230> rig<00:03:16.440> weights

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
kilos of camera and the rig weights

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.729 
kilos of camera and the rig weights
about<00:03:17.010> seven<00:03:17.520> kilos<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.720> that's<00:03:18.750> about<00:03:19.050> 11

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
about seven kilos so that's about 11

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.330 
about seven kilos so that's about 11
kilos<00:03:19.980> or<00:03:20.310> 22<00:03:20.940> pounds<00:03:21.450> roughly<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.920> rig

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
kilos or 22 pounds roughly so this rig

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.810 
kilos or 22 pounds roughly so this rig
will<00:03:23.370> work<00:03:23.790> for<00:03:24.540> shooting<00:03:25.050> handheld<00:03:25.890> or<00:03:26.340> on<00:03:26.790> a

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
will work for shooting handheld or on a

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.570 
will work for shooting handheld or on a
Steadicam<00:03:27.420> or<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.900> crane<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:29.040> we<00:03:29.190> think<00:03:29.370> this

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
Steadicam or on a crane so we think this

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.840 
Steadicam or on a crane so we think this
is<00:03:29.730> really<00:03:30.030> good<00:03:30.440> setup<00:03:31.440> for<00:03:31.650> for<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:32.610> kind

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
is really good setup for for that kind

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.650 
is really good setup for for that kind
of<00:03:32.910> work<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.420> we<00:03:33.959> have<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.140> lot<00:03:34.380> of<00:03:34.410> people

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
of work and we have a lot of people

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.900 
of work and we have a lot of people
asking<00:03:36.660> about<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.620> 3d<00:03:37.950> capabilities<00:03:38.730> or

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
asking about the 3d capabilities or

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.460 
asking about the 3d capabilities or
camera<00:03:39.390> and<00:03:39.709> we<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:40.890> a<00:03:40.920> 3d<00:03:41.489> interface<00:03:42.470> you

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
camera and we have a 3d interface you

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.979 
camera and we have a 3d interface you
connect<00:03:43.800> a<00:03:44.370> cable<00:03:44.790> between<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.360> cameras<00:03:45.780> and

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
connect a cable between the cameras and

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.560 
connect a cable between the cameras and
then<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:47.280> said<00:03:47.489> one<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.000> cameras<00:03:48.330> in<00:03:48.450> this

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
then you said one of the cameras in this

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.660 
then you said one of the cameras in this
master<00:03:49.170> mode<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.860> second<00:03:50.190> one<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.580> the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
master mode and the second one in the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
with the first camera the second camera

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.420 
with the first camera the second camera
follows<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.580> it's<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.180> line<00:03:57.360> saying<00:03:58.430> interface

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
follows and it's a line saying interface

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.699 
follows and it's a line saying interface
so<00:03:59.730> both<00:04:00.330> images<00:04:00.900> are<00:04:01.700> synced<00:04:02.700> together<00:04:03.709> is
