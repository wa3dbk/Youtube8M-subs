00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
better quality some that were made in

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.330 
better quality some that were made in
China<00:01:16.160> aren't<00:01:16.640> as<00:01:16.730> good<00:01:17.360> quality<00:01:17.900> as<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:19.130> ones

made<00:01:19.550> in<00:01:19.670> other<00:01:19.790> countries<00:01:20.300> but<00:01:20.330> I<00:01:20.900> just<00:01:21.650> liked

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
made in other countries but I just liked

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.210 
made in other countries but I just liked
the<00:01:22.340> durability<00:01:23.030> for<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.870> most<00:01:24.050> part<00:01:24.320> of<00:01:25.040> the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
the durability for the most part of the

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.530 
the durability for the most part of the
Lego<00:01:25.580> minifigure<00:01:26.860> now<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:27.920> this<00:01:28.850> today<00:01:29.480> is

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
Lego minifigure now the this today is

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.000 
Lego minifigure now the this today is
the<00:01:29.750> first<00:01:29.780> time<00:01:30.080> I've<00:01:30.290> seen<00:01:30.650> one<00:01:30.860> of<00:01:30.950> the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
the first time I've seen one of the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.750 
the first time I've seen one of the
character<00:01:31.400> building<00:01:32.110> figures<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:33.670> it's<00:01:34.670> a

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
character building figures and it's a

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.670 
character building figures and it's a
little<00:01:35.000> stiff<00:01:35.330> because<00:01:35.870> I<00:01:36.170> knocked<00:01:36.350> over<00:01:36.620> the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
little stiff because I knocked over the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.470 
little stiff because I knocked over the
leg<00:01:36.830> them<00:01:36.980> in<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.130> head<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.610> doesn't<00:01:37.850> swivel

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
leg them in the head it doesn't swivel

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.990 
leg them in the head it doesn't swivel
easy<00:01:38.690> so<00:01:39.410> I<00:01:39.440> try<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.710> turn<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:40.070> it's<00:01:40.490> very<00:01:40.760> hard

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
easy so I try to turn it it's very hard

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.560 
easy so I try to turn it it's very hard
to<00:01:41.060> move<00:01:41.980> lego<00:01:42.980> man<00:01:43.400> moves<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.910> little<00:01:44.030> easier

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
to move lego man moves a little easier

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.870 
to move lego man moves a little easier
but<00:01:45.260> it<00:01:45.560> gives<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.010> impression<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.550> me<00:01:46.670> that

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
but it gives the impression to me that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.520 
but it gives the impression to me that
maybe<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.150> little<00:01:47.360> last<00:01:47.750> longer<00:01:48.200> be<00:01:48.320> more

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
maybe a little last longer be more

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.820 
maybe a little last longer be more
durable<00:01:49.330> arms<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.690> can<00:01:50.900> put<00:01:51.140> them<00:01:51.260> move<00:01:51.650> them

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
durable arms you can put them move them

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.730 
durable arms you can put them move them
is<00:01:52.160> pretty<00:01:52.430> much<00:01:52.520> as<00:01:53.080> about<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.200> same<00:01:54.440> range

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
is pretty much as about the same range

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.710 
is pretty much as about the same range
of<00:01:55.010> motion<00:01:55.400> as<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.970> lego<00:01:56.270> man

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.170 

so<00:02:00.230> that's<00:02:00.440> those<00:02:00.710> two<00:02:01.040> now<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.640> connects

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
so that's those two now the connects

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.630 
so that's those two now the connects
although<00:02:02.930> they<00:02:03.080> do<00:02:03.140> have<00:02:03.290> elbows<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.400> move

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
although they do have elbows that move

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.660 
although they do have elbows that move
and<00:02:05.060> needs<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.750> move<00:02:06.020> unless<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:07.040> get<00:02:07.250> one<00:02:07.580> of

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
and needs to move unless you get one of

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.420 
and needs to move unless you get one of
the<00:02:08.080> for<00:02:09.080> instance<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.440> connects<00:02:09.740> beetles<00:02:10.190> I

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
the for instance to connects beetles I

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.710 
the for instance to connects beetles I
should<00:02:10.700> have<00:02:10.759> pulled<00:02:10.940> one<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.150> those<00:02:11.330> out<00:02:11.540> to

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
should have pulled one of those out to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.270 
should have pulled one of those out to
there<00:02:11.930> they're<00:02:12.260> built<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.680> little<00:02:12.920> differently

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
there they're built a little differently

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.800 
there they're built a little differently
than<00:02:13.550> these<00:02:13.730> they<00:02:13.880> don't<00:02:14.060> have<00:02:14.180> moving<00:02:14.420> elbows

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
than these they don't have moving elbows

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.130 
than these they don't have moving elbows
means<00:02:15.230> but<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:17.120> connects<00:02:17.540> man<00:02:17.780> has

good and you know I'm not a big fan of
medical<00:02:44.060> box<00:02:44.240> but<00:02:44.630> he's<00:02:44.780> got<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.170> knees<00:02:45.380> that

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
medical box but he's got the knees that

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.940 
medical box but he's got the knees that
move<00:02:45.770> he's<00:02:46.010> got<00:02:46.040> he's<00:02:46.970> got<00:02:47.000> elbows<00:02:47.510> move<00:02:47.950> and

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
move he's got he's got elbows move and

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.940 
move he's got he's got elbows move and
move<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.160> little<00:02:49.340> bit<00:02:49.430> head<00:02:50.060> moves<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:51.680> it's

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
move a little bit head moves so it's

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.510 
move a little bit head moves so it's
pretty<00:02:52.160> good<00:02:52.400> figure<00:02:53.209> 4<00:02:53.630> mega<00:02:53.810> bloks<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.520> still

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
pretty good figure 4 mega bloks I still

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.630 
pretty good figure 4 mega bloks I still
just<00:02:56.410> not<00:02:57.410> crazy<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:57.950> look<00:02:58.130> at<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.370> Pope

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
just not crazy but look at that Pope

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.330 
just not crazy but look at that Pope
he's<00:02:59.000> gonna<00:02:59.209> split<00:02:59.630> that's<00:03:00.620> neat<00:03:00.950> ain't<00:03:01.190> do

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
he's gonna split that's neat ain't do

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.300 
he's gonna split that's neat ain't do
splits<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.020> mega<00:03:03.200> bloks<00:03:03.530> they<00:03:03.860> do<00:03:03.920> have<00:03:04.280> a

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
splits so the mega bloks they do have a

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.270 
splits so the mega bloks they do have a
wider<00:03:04.700> range<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.209> motion<00:03:05.720> they<00:03:06.709> look<00:03:06.920> more

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
wider range of motion they look more

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.500 
wider range of motion they look more
realistic<00:03:07.750> but<00:03:08.750> look<00:03:08.900> more<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.440> humans<00:03:10.510> so

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
realistic but look more like humans so

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.610 
realistic but look more like humans so
anyway<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:13.120> figure<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.380> overall<00:03:15.380> pretty

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
anyway this figure is overall pretty

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.100 
anyway this figure is overall pretty
good<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:19.670> just<00:03:19.880> not<00:03:20.330> happy<00:03:20.870> with<00:03:21.019> the

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
good so I just not happy with the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.590 
good so I just not happy with the
quality<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.650> mega<00:03:22.340> bloks<00:03:22.640> bricks<00:03:23.090> that's<00:03:23.480> why

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
quality of mega bloks bricks that's why

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.900 
quality of mega bloks bricks that's why
I<00:03:23.630> usually<00:03:23.959> don't<00:03:24.110> buy<00:03:24.320> any<00:03:24.680> mega<00:03:25.310> bloks<00:03:25.580> it's

they do make good roller coasters though
I'm<00:03:38.030> not<00:03:38.090> happy<00:03:38.570> with<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.870> minifigures<00:03:39.410> the

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
Lego has more human details but I'm just

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.070 
Lego has more human details but I'm just
partial<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.910> classic<00:03:53.360> Lego<00:03:53.810> minifigure

partial to the classic Lego minifigure
even<00:03:54.650> though<00:03:54.739> it's<00:03:54.890> kind<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.160> squarish<00:03:55.700> with

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
even though it's kind of squarish with

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.710 
even though it's kind of squarish with
the<00:03:56.120> legs<00:03:56.500> not<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.799> good<00:03:58.160> range<00:03:58.459> of<00:03:58.640> motion<00:03:58.820> it's

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
the legs not a good range of motion it's

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.699 
the legs not a good range of motion it's
just<00:04:00.170> that<00:04:00.260> Lego<00:04:01.060> made<00:04:02.060> something<00:04:02.390> in<00:04:02.810> 1978

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
just that Lego made something in 1978

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:04.960 
just that Lego made something in 1978
and<00:04:03.830> they've<00:04:03.950> pretty<00:04:04.190> much<00:04:04.280> stuck<00:04:04.760> with<00:04:04.940> it

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
and they've pretty much stuck with it

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.580 
and they've pretty much stuck with it
since<00:04:05.540> then<00:04:05.750> they've<00:04:05.959> put<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.320> little<00:04:06.440> more

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
since then they've put a little more

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.910 
since then they've put a little more
details<00:04:07.010> on<00:04:07.190> them<00:04:07.370> now

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
details on them now

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.830 
details on them now
and<00:04:08.459> sometimes<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.090> get<00:04:09.209> different<00:04:09.390> heads

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
and sometimes you get different heads

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.460 
and sometimes you get different heads
and<00:04:10.349> headgear<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.220> things<00:04:11.520> like<00:04:11.610> that<00:04:11.670> but

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
and headgear and things like that but

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.060 
and headgear and things like that but
they<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.950> been<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.520> long<00:04:14.790> lasting<00:04:15.030> figure

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
they it's been a long lasting figure

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.650 
they it's been a long lasting figure
mega<00:04:17.070> bloks<00:04:17.340> has<00:04:17.549> come<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.760> long<00:04:17.850> way<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.419> see<00:04:18.630> a

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
mega bloks has come a long way I see a

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.960 
mega bloks has come a long way I see a
lot<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.900> improvement<00:04:19.530> with<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.160> i<00:04:20.370> think

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
lot of improvement with that so i think

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.659 
lot of improvement with that so i think
the<00:04:21.239> figure<00:04:21.389> is<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.810> good<00:04:22.049> figure<00:04:22.340> so<00:04:23.340> these<00:04:23.490> are

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
the figure is a good figure so these are

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.180 
the figure is a good figure so these are
