00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 thanks for watching this video what in 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.430
 this occasion we are going to do is a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.670
 delicious cajeta or dulce de leche 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:15.230
 and here we have the same amounts go 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.810
 to be in the description of the video the 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.580
 correct amounts 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:25.370
 also and here what we are going to use 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.790
 it's cow's milk 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.280
 the recipe goes with goat milk or milk 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.010
 of cow originally the cajeta carries 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.920
 goat's milk but if you do not have it 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.020
 for some reason you want to use milk 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.620
 of cow well ahead 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.210
 here we are going to use goat's milk 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.210
 to brown sugar 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.410
 of milk milk we will use two 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.820
 cups 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.890
 of brown sugar we will use three 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.930
 quarters cup 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:09.040
 a quarter teaspoon of carbonate 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.250
 one teaspoon half a teaspoon forgiveness 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.710
 of vanilla essence all that we're going 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.710
 to attach with milk 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.690
 to 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.080
 we are going to live it that it was done well 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:35.660
 sugar with everyone and we lose 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.660
 over medium heat 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.450
 we learn the medium fire depends if 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.450
 has a gas or light stove going 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.360
 controlling the fire what we are going to 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.610
 to do is to bring it to a boil that does not have 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.280
 a whole tree just a little bit of 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.500
 I boiled let's say to go 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.050
 and are reducing the moving 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.080
 continually 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.140
 we go to the tenths and now we're going to 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.180
 let networking break down as 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.580
 go entering the same let's go 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.560
 going down to fire or temperatures 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.680
 67 minutes 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.390
 you have to be very careful with that to 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.959
 that does not stick down on the surface 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.440
 because we were using a pot 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:26.130
 deep and wide because that way that way 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.870
 we have more surface that can 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.330
 need more perfect double the recipe 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.489
 they will have double but it will last a 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.640
 little more time that's why time is not 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:39.160
 Exactly you always have to take care of 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.430
 medium fire and you have to go lowering 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.170
 but once it's almost boiling already 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.780
 the need to go to keep moving 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.100
 it will stick us down on the surface and 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.100
 then those little ones will be made 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.680
 of cream custard then here and what 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.959
 what are we going to do we continue to fire 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.520
 medium and we will continue to beat 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:09.430
 let's say with the shovel of the spoon of 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.240
 Wood the wooden shovel as you want 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.880
 calls you to go taking off what possible 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.280
 go waiting downstairs but you have to 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.319
 beating and you have to go lowering 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.900
 working and working without neglecting 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:27.880
 this as he gave the time can be 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.250
 It depends on the amount more or less 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.470
 So, what are you taking care of? 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.769
 like 18 minutes how can you see that 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.250
 small boil that is not so much is 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.250
 As we have 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.590
 beating it mixing them forgiveness 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.540
 a few others just so it does not stick 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.319
 nothing 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.349
 down 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.459
 in the descriptions of the video the same goes 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.560
 to have 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:01.709
 I'm going to put some dessert links or 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:07.189
 costs or recipes that carry this box 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.189
 they do not require a recommendation 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.040
 the minutes as you can see does not stop 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:17.120
 move how is this but we do not owe it 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.810
 to leave moving so that 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.450
 and we do not want anything sticking 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.220
 here if you like you can download the 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.590
 temperature 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:32.230
 or fire a bit like dances 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.690
 analyzing how you can see it no longer fall 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.139
 just such 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.810
 We are going to leave a little liquid 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.650
 more so that we have the texture that 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.750
 which we want to take and 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.990
 invite them to follow us 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.340
 on facebook 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.340
 the chef will help you 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:01.139
 ready as you can see we have the 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.550
 texture more or less we want 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.430
 the jet is already 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:10.670
 less thicker liquid 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.660
 I just want this a little bit more burnt 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.660
 leave it a little bit more 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.629
 but this is this texture and it's already 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.870
 ready 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:27.750
 remember that cooling 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:32.190
 is going to express itself like that and nothing more than 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.310
 we cool and our cajeta is ready 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.870
 I recommend that you subscribe to 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.470
 listen to the same you can see how it is 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.930
 thick as it fry then of course 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.870
 it's going to be much thicker now 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.210
 optionally if what if you want your 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.550
 finished career 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.930
 you can put a couple of teaspoons 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.910
 brandy whiskey tequila roll 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.729
 what gives you the hand 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.319
 is that you 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.319
 it's good that I know 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:09.890
 that mix well with the cajeta in what 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:14.270
 that follows it well mixed the vÃ­ctor what 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:16.430
 that I have put him does not take out anymore because 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.620
 we also do not want the 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:22.460
 alcohol completely 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.460
 So just what mix 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:29.630
 approximately 20 seconds and ready 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:32.990
 already take it out let it cool or cool it 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:36.080
 if it occupies it if it needs it before 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.900
 can cool with in a bowl that has 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.700
 ice and water with this globally what 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:45.100
 he's mixing until he was referring 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:51.400
 more or less it will come out 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:54.370
 about a cup of cajeta or a 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:59.020
 little more the same as it cools the 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:02.160
 Can store in bottles in jars 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.160
 who sell for that 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.290
 and use it of course when you do not go 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.650
 in need there are many ways to eat 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.770
 no and now I thank you very much for your time 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.319
