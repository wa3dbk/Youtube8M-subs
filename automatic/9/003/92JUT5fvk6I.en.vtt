00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
to go from being just average to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.630 
to go from being just average to
fricking<00:01:15.330> spectacular<00:01:16.200> at<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.710> do<00:01:16.950> who

section<00:01:21.000> below<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.150> let's<00:01:21.420> start<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
section below and let's start a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.179 
section below and let's start a
conversation<00:01:22.350> that's<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:23.040> bit

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
conversation that's a little bit

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.440 
conversation that's a little bit
different<00:01:23.520> than<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> ones<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.970> usually<00:01:24.119> have

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
different than the ones we usually have

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.480 
different than the ones we usually have
alright<00:01:25.080> now<00:01:25.229> let's<00:01:25.680> get<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.130> pattern

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
alright now let's get to this pattern

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.830 
alright now let's get to this pattern
this<00:01:26.610> pattern<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> I've<00:01:27.450> played

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this pattern is one that I've played

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.660 
this pattern is one that I've played
around<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.560> years<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
around with for years and it's a it's a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.710 
around with for years and it's a it's a
pattern<00:01:29.909> you've<00:01:30.030> seen<00:01:30.180> me<00:01:30.270> post<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> couple

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
pattern you've seen me post a couple

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.109 
pattern you've seen me post a couple
things<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.259> before<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.829> essentially<00:01:32.670> it's

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
things on before and essentially it's

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
things on before and essentially it's
it's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.600> three<00:01:33.869> note<00:01:34.049> pattern<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.890> right

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
it's a three note pattern so it's right

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
it's a three note pattern so it's right
right<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:36.060> gonna<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> kick<00:01:36.900> after

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
right and then I'm gonna do a kick after

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.270 
right and then I'm gonna do a kick after
that<00:01:37.530> okay

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that okay

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.219 
that okay
so<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:38.759> gonna<00:01:38.970> loop<00:01:39.329> over<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.810> bar<00:01:40.079> cuz

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
so that's gonna loop over the bar cuz

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.929 
so that's gonna loop over the bar cuz
it's<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.439> three<00:01:40.680> notes<00:01:40.860> sticking<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.610> bar<00:01:41.790> of

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it's a three notes sticking in a bar of

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.690 
it's a three notes sticking in a bar of
4/4<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.079> that's<00:01:43.259> gonna<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.619> over<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> bar<00:01:44.460> line

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
4/4 so that's gonna go over the bar line

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.149 
4/4 so that's gonna go over the bar line
it's<00:01:44.909> gonna<00:01:45.000> resolve<00:01:45.509> itself<00:01:45.990> every<00:01:46.770> six

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it's gonna resolve itself every six

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.859 
it's gonna resolve itself every six
beats<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:47.700> every<00:01:47.909> bar<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> half<00:01:48.509> or<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
beats or every bar and a half or a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.170 
beats or every bar and a half or a
little<00:01:49.110> resolve<00:01:49.590> itself<00:01:49.920> every<00:01:50.520> three<00:01:50.909> bars

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
little resolve itself every three bars

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.179 
little resolve itself every three bars
so<00:01:51.810> here's<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.380> pattern<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.799> we're<00:01:53.040> going

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
so here's the pattern that we're going

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:08.469 
so here's the pattern that we're going
to<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.340> doing

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.790 

all<00:02:09.479> right<00:02:09.570> so<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.810> takes<00:02:09.959> three<00:02:10.289> bars<00:02:10.530> for

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
all right so it takes three bars for

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800 
all right so it takes three bars for
that<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.130> resolve<00:02:11.520> or<00:02:11.760> every<00:02:12.240> bar<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.660> half

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
that to resolve or every bar and a half

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.180 
that to resolve or every bar and a half
no<00:02:12.990> that's<00:02:13.140> important<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> remember<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.040> bar

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
no that's important to remember the bar

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.410 
no that's important to remember the bar
and<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.400> half<00:02:14.550> because<00:02:14.820> what<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.000> want<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.270> do<00:02:15.390> I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and a half because what I want to do I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.370 
and a half because what I want to do I
was<00:02:15.570> sitting<00:02:15.750> here<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.959> was<00:02:16.050> like<00:02:16.140> okay

was sitting here and I was like okay

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.500 
was sitting here and I was like okay
let's<00:02:16.920> take<00:02:17.100> something<00:02:17.490> simple<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:18.000> let's<00:02:18.360> do

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
let's take something simple and let's do

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.480 
let's take something simple and let's do
something<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.200> we're<00:02:20.070> gonna<00:02:20.160> do<00:02:20.340> that

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
something with so we're gonna do that

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.690 
something with so we're gonna do that
four<00:02:20.760> times<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.360> one<00:02:21.630> e<00:02:21.660> foot<00:02:22.080> boot

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
four times so one e foot boot

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.760 
four times so one e foot boot
one-e-and-a<00:02:23.700> two-e-and-a<00:02:24.770> three-e-and-a

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
one-e-and-a two-e-and-a three-e-and-a

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.610 
one-e-and-a two-e-and-a three-e-and-a
the<00:02:26.459> next<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.150> we're<00:02:27.780> gonna<00:02:27.870> play<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.260> snare

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the next one we're gonna play the snare

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.510 
the next one we're gonna play the snare
so<00:02:29.160> it'll<00:02:30.090> be<00:02:30.209> one<00:02:30.990> E<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.170> uh<00:02:31.620> two<00:02:31.650> E<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.100> AH

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
so it'll be one E and uh two E and AH

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.570 
so it'll be one E and uh two E and AH
three<00:02:32.550> E<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:32.970> AH<00:02:33.420> four<00:02:33.450> E<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.959> AH<00:02:34.680> one<00:02:35.280> E<00:02:35.489> and

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
three E and AH four E and AH one E and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.650 
three E and AH four E and AH one E and
two<00:02:36.239> E<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.900> AH<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.280> four<00:02:38.910> times<00:02:39.120> through<00:02:39.480> that

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
two E and AH so four times through that

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.600 
two E and AH so four times through that
pattern<00:02:40.020> with<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> kick<00:02:40.709> then<00:02:41.280> play<00:02:41.489> the

pattern with the snare then back to the
kick<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.709> snare<00:02:43.770> back<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.340> kick

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
kick and the snare back to the kick

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you're gonna play it eight times

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.300 
you're gonna play it eight times
altogether<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.410> will<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.709> bar<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
altogether and that will be a bar and a

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.250 
altogether and that will be a bar and a
half<00:02:47.520> real<00:02:48.150> slow<00:02:48.360> let<00:02:48.540> me<00:02:48.660> show<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.870> how<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.080> do

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
half real slow let me show you how to do

00:02:49.260 --> 00:03:10.820 
half real slow let me show you how to do
that<00:03:07.730> now<00:03:08.730> we're<00:03:09.150> gonna<00:03:09.269> loop<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:09.810> twice<00:03:10.200> so

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
that now we're gonna loop that twice so

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.740 
that now we're gonna loop that twice so
that's<00:03:10.950> gonna<00:03:11.130> come<00:03:11.400> around<00:03:11.670> every<00:03:12.390> three

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that's gonna come around every three

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.539 
that's gonna come around every three
bars<00:03:12.959> right<00:03:13.320> so<00:03:13.530> we're<00:03:13.620> gonna<00:03:13.739> do<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.340> do

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
bars right so we're gonna do that and do

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.310 
bars right so we're gonna do that and do
it<00:03:14.579> twice<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.239> makes<00:03:15.450> three<00:03:15.720> bars<00:03:15.959> it's

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
it twice and that makes three bars it's

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.259 
it twice and that makes three bars it's
a<00:03:16.380> real<00:03:16.470> important<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.980> catch<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.400> now

gonna hit on the and of two and on four
now<00:03:34.620> I<00:03:34.650> know<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:34.890> seems<00:03:35.070> like<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.280> lot<00:03:35.519> but

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
now I know that seems like a lot but

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.160 
now I know that seems like a lot but
stay<00:03:35.970> with<00:03:36.150> me<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:36.570> this<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.840> what<00:03:36.959> it'll<00:03:37.110> sound

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
stay with me so this is what it'll sound

00:03:37.170 --> 00:04:10.260 
stay with me so this is what it'll sound
like

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.700 

so<00:04:11.270> right<00:04:11.510> there<00:04:11.780> we've<00:04:11.960> got<00:04:12.140> this<00:04:12.290> kind<00:04:12.530> of

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
so right there we've got this kind of

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.010 
so right there we've got this kind of
this<00:04:12.950> loop<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.730> happens<00:04:14.030> twice<00:04:14.390> and<00:04:14.690> we're

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
this loop that happens twice and we're

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.930 
this loop that happens twice and we're
gonna<00:04:15.110> make<00:04:15.320> it<00:04:15.380> just<00:04:15.770> so<00:04:15.950> different<00:04:16.280> just

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
gonna make it just so different just

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.850 
gonna make it just so different just
slightly<00:04:17.330> different<00:04:17.870> enough<00:04:18.080> that<00:04:18.290> it's<00:04:18.739> a

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:18.860 
slightly different enough that it's a

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.880 
slightly different enough that it's a
three<00:04:19.250> bar<00:04:19.970> pattern<00:04:20.270> it's<00:04:20.600> a<00:04:20.660> 3<00:04:20.959> bar<00:04:21.140> groove<00:04:21.560> ok

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
three bar pattern it's a 3 bar groove ok

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.650 
three bar pattern it's a 3 bar groove ok
so<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.490> only<00:04:22.520> thing<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:23.120> want<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.480> change

so the only thing I want you to change

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.330 
so the only thing I want you to change
now<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:24.200> want<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.530> play<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.860> downbeat

now is I want you to play the downbeat

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.370 
now is I want you to play the downbeat

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
on the kick drum of every three bars so

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.920 
on the kick drum of every three bars so
to<00:04:27.440> be<00:04:27.590> one<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.220> all<00:04:28.670> right<00:04:29.000> instead<00:04:29.390> of<00:04:29.450> 1e

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
to be one and all right instead of 1e

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.740 
to be one and all right instead of 1e
and<00:04:30.110> it'll<00:04:30.500> go<00:04:30.590> 1<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.520> that's<00:04:32.360> what<00:04:32.630> it's

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
going to signify every time we're at the

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.550 
going to signify every time we're at the
downbeat<00:04:35.450> of<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.690> third<00:04:35.900> bar<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.350> other

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
downbeat of the third bar the other

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.610 
downbeat of the third bar the other
thing<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.920> want<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.280> do<00:04:37.460> is<00:04:37.730> on<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:39.140> second

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
thing I want you to do is on the second

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.010 
thing I want you to do is on the second
bar<00:04:39.860> when<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.400> play<00:04:40.640> four<00:04:41.060> on<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.510> snare<00:04:41.570> I

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
bar when you play four on the snare I

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.500 
bar when you play four on the snare I
want<00:04:42.440> you<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.590> open<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:43.070> hi-hat<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:43.970> real<00:04:44.240> slow

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
want you to open the hi-hat so real slow

00:04:44.510 --> 00:05:13.110 
want you to open the hi-hat so real slow
that's<00:04:44.720> what<00:04:44.900> this<00:04:44.990> is<00:04:45.050> going<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.320> sound

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.370 

so<00:05:14.120> all<00:05:14.300> that<00:05:14.479> happened<00:05:14.870> there<00:05:15.020> was<00:05:15.050> we<00:05:15.260> would

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
so all that happened there was we would

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.469 
so all that happened there was we would
we<00:05:15.470> took<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.710> very<00:05:15.979> simple<00:05:16.370> pattern<00:05:16.699> just<00:05:17.270> right

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
we took a very simple pattern just right

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.540 
we took a very simple pattern just right
right<00:05:17.630> foot<00:05:17.930> pretty<00:05:18.139> much<00:05:18.380> added<00:05:19.100> a<00:05:19.160> couple

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
right foot pretty much added a couple

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.159 
right foot pretty much added a couple
things<00:05:19.699> to<00:05:20.030> it<00:05:20.150> the<00:05:20.270> downbeat<00:05:20.690> of<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:20.960> first

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
things to it the downbeat of the first

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.409 
things to it the downbeat of the first
bar<00:05:21.440> of<00:05:21.560> every<00:05:21.770> three<00:05:22.010> bars<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.490> then<00:05:22.940> the

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
bar of every three bars and then the

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.840 
bar of every three bars and then the
opening<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.169> hi-hat<00:05:24.560> on<00:05:24.710> four<00:05:25.070> of<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.460> second

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
opening the hi-hat on four of the second

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.730 
opening the hi-hat on four of the second
bar<00:05:25.970> of<00:05:26.090> that<00:05:26.270> pattern<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:26.870> all<00:05:27.560> of<00:05:27.650> a<00:05:27.710> sudden

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
bar of that pattern and all of a sudden

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.409 
bar of that pattern and all of a sudden
we've<00:05:28.070> transformed<00:05:28.669> this<00:05:28.910> into<00:05:28.970> this

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
we've transformed this into this

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.260 
we've transformed this into this
hypnotic<00:05:29.870> kind<00:05:30.380> of<00:05:30.500> groove<00:05:30.830> that's<00:05:31.669> really

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
hypnotic kind of groove that's really

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.350 
hypnotic kind of groove that's really
funky<00:05:32.750> but<00:05:32.930> really<00:05:33.260> it's<00:05:33.410> just<00:05:33.500> a<00:05:33.770> series<00:05:34.190> of

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
funky but really it's just a series of

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.480 
funky but really it's just a series of
it's<00:05:35.360> a<00:05:35.479> six<00:05:35.780> beat<00:05:35.990> pattern<00:05:36.470> essentially<00:05:36.979> that

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
it's a six beat pattern essentially that

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.400 
it's a six beat pattern essentially that
you're<00:05:37.729> looping<00:05:37.910> twice<00:05:38.389> over<00:05:38.660> three<00:05:39.020> bars<00:05:39.260> so

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
you're looping twice over three bars so

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.690 
you're looping twice over three bars so
I<00:05:39.440> really<00:05:39.710> want<00:05:39.860> to<00:05:39.919> encourage<00:05:40.160> you<00:05:40.460> like

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
I really want to encourage you like

some super hard pattern genius is taking
this<00:06:00.620> central<00:06:01.220> the<00:06:01.610> everyday<00:06:02.270> and<00:06:02.539> going<00:06:03.110> hmm

this central the everyday and going hmm

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.680 
this central the everyday and going hmm
what<00:06:04.100> if<00:06:04.190> I<00:06:04.310> turn<00:06:04.550> that<00:06:04.729> sideways<00:06:05.270> and<00:06:05.510> looked

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
what if I turn that sideways and looked

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.290 
what if I turn that sideways and looked
at<00:06:05.870> it<00:06:05.990> that<00:06:06.889> is<00:06:07.190> whenever<00:06:07.580> you<00:06:07.700> start<00:06:08.000> to<00:06:08.150> go

at it that is whenever you start to go

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.779 
at it that is whenever you start to go
from<00:06:08.539> average<00:06:09.080> player<00:06:09.380> to<00:06:09.979> amazing<00:06:10.700> is

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
from average player to amazing is

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:12.580 
from average player to amazing is
whenever<00:06:11.060> you<00:06:11.150> start<00:06:11.360> taking<00:06:11.570> the<00:06:11.870> same<00:06:12.110> ideas

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
whenever you start taking the same ideas

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:47.820 
whenever you start taking the same ideas
and<00:06:12.770> reinventing<00:06:13.669> them

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.900 

hopefully<00:06:48.830> that'll<00:06:49.040> spark<00:06:49.400> some<00:06:49.670> of<00:06:49.730> your

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
hopefully that'll spark some of your

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.370 
hopefully that'll spark some of your
imagination<00:06:50.480> hopefully<00:06:50.810> that'll<00:06:50.990> get<00:06:51.260> you

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
imagination hopefully that'll get you

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.600 
imagination hopefully that'll get you
thinking<00:06:51.710> about<00:06:51.890> some<00:06:52.040> of<00:06:52.070> the<00:06:52.190> things<00:06:52.340> that

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
thinking about some of the things that

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.400 
thinking about some of the things that
you<00:06:52.790> do<00:06:53.000> everyday<00:06:53.720> that<00:06:53.990> you<00:06:54.080> can<00:06:54.200> kind<00:06:54.380> of

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.410 
you do everyday that you can kind of

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.740 
you do everyday that you can kind of
take<00:06:54.650> and<00:06:54.830> turn<00:06:54.980> sideways<00:06:55.610> and<00:06:55.880> hopefully

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
take and turn sideways and hopefully

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.930 
take and turn sideways and hopefully
that<00:06:57.410> will<00:06:57.530> take<00:06:57.740> your<00:06:57.860> playing<00:06:58.220> to<00:06:58.460> an<00:06:58.640> to

00:06:58.930 --> 00:06:58.940 
that will take your playing to an to

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.340 
that will take your playing to an to
another<00:06:59.180> level<00:06:59.390> like<00:06:59.570> these<00:06:59.720> simple<00:07:00.080> ideas

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
another level like these simple ideas

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.200 
another level like these simple ideas
can<00:07:00.530> take<00:07:00.710> it<00:07:00.860> to<00:07:00.980> another<00:07:01.070> level<00:07:01.310> if<00:07:01.760> you're

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
can take it to another level if you're

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.000 
can take it to another level if you're
tired<00:07:02.450> of<00:07:02.600> being<00:07:02.810> an<00:07:02.870> average<00:07:03.230> and<00:07:03.440> you<00:07:03.830> want

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.010 
tired of being an average and you want

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.770 
tired of being an average and you want
to<00:07:04.130> work<00:07:04.280> hard<00:07:04.640> through<00:07:04.880> some<00:07:05.060> stuff<00:07:05.300> you

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
to work hard through some stuff you

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.030 
to work hard through some stuff you
should<00:07:05.960> check<00:07:06.140> out<00:07:06.260> the<00:07:06.410> website<00:07:06.830> and<00:07:06.950> you
