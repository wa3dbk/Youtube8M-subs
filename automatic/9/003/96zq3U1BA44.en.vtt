00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.389
 and greet all shown b9 people get 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.219
 find for a gameplay of tears the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.599
 lord of the wolves so simply 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.859
 it is a weapon that can be doubted thanks 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.830
 to exotic contracts 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.910
 2 the veterans' prison so everything 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.500
 I just made a little video 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.699
 on that you have an annotation from 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.310
 now if you want to see her 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.199
 so I had a tutorial how 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.279
 in stages and where to see it and so a 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.320
 Once the contract is completed, you will have 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.059
 done between three weapons and me like you 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.230
 could see I chose from the lord 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.270
 lots so that's it finally makes you 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.070
 a video presentation so already this 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.829
 weapon does fire damage like you 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 can see it she's directly to 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.980
 365 and the only things you have 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.320
 improved its capabilities 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.360
 additional that is to say that already his 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.460
 first ability will allow it all 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.640
 simply to regenerate the points of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.559
 life of your allies in the perimeter 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.180
 so already and a capacity really that 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.440
 I find very very useful and the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.760
 last one will just give you I 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.469
 believe more ammunition I remember 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.000
 more exactly wind you could 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.280
 so already see what a weapon that fires 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.920
 wing a bag of 5 and that has a capacity 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.330
 basic of 30 we follow your 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.850
 equipment you can have more in 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.540
 the loader as well as more bullets in 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.610
 Reserve 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.009
 so here is but otherwise 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.689
 which does enormous damage to the body at 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.369
 body so report to the app both brought 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.259
 sorry it's because she better because 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.950
 that viewfinder surrender in fact are told on 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.090
 has no subprefect rey of the little 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.409
 precise place that does not tell you 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.720
 exactly where you shoot 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.479
 it's on a quoted radius so 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.340
 it's a bit of the inconvenience and 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.630
 that's what makes this tree very 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.880
 very few doors and watch the sail 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.290
 at sight I pull she moves a lot 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.579
 so it's very complicated so it's 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.619
 really a weapon to play to the body at 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.780
 body so in pvp also she is 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.479
 really huge just kill yourself in 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.939
 a burst if you do it well 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.950
 as soon as possible and simply 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.110
 the afld the fact that it's a bit to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.729
 pulses so that really lets you 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.469
 to strafe so it's really great 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.670
 useful really must me it's a real 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.200
 favorite I did well 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.610
 to learn it I think that after I 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.680
 would snipe then the little gun 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.890
 simply but it's really a very 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.319
 very good weapon for my taste 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.300
 and I think that anyway it is not used to 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.310
 nothing against aiming with this weapon 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.950
 knowing that accuracy and the same 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.840
 when we aim when we do not aim so 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.550
 they do not increase specifically or 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.080
 else you announce I hope the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.550
 gameplay you will like I wanted it 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.900
 still a little following and under the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.090
 next for a new video this is 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.090
 everything will come and it will be more everyone
