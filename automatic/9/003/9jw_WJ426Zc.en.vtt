00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
most likely if you kept them on so just

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.050 
most likely if you kept them on so just
try<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:24.690> use<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.140> cautiously<00:03:25.739> don't<00:03:26.489> go<00:03:26.790> crazy

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060
