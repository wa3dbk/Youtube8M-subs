00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.330
 Hello everyone, today I will show you how 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.309
 braid this stylish braid with which you 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.320
 just do not go unnoticed 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.780
 This hairstyle is suitable for each 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.650
 the day and on the way pick only 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.650
 matching accessories 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.090
 for extra length and volume I already 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.340
 secured false hair strands on 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.230
 barrettes now i'm just good 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.540
 comb my hair to make it easier later 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.620
 separate strands for braids on one side 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 leave a strand of hair 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.820
 2 3 centimeters wide from this strand 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.070
 we will consistently separate 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.879
 sneaky hide and seek and weave them our braid 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.680
 on the other hand here I am separating the first 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.579
 thin strand and transfer it to another 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.100
 side then I separate two more 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.050
 thin hide and seek near the face and weave 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.530
 will be one of the varieties 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.170
 french spit 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.629
 the strand is laid on the central 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.239
 close strand is laid on the central 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.309
 distant strand again transfer the center 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.390
 then separate another thin strand 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.820
 from the period we initially 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.429
 left on the other side and add it 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.780
 to the central strand 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:14.759
 Now I shift to the center near 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.179
 strand and add to it a thin strand 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.880
 hair 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.920
 which is separated to the left of the face then I 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.690
 I repeat all these steps until I reach 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.090
 the lengths that suits me 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.490
 can be woven much to tip the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.470
 you can stop in 10-15 steps 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 about weaving a few centimeters 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.979
 gently pull the extra 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.920
 strands so that they lie relatively 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.720
 free if imbibe them too much 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.720
 the pattern will simply not be visible 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.390
 fix the ends with a small rubber band and 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.620
 our hairstyle is ready my braid is lying 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.209
 over loose hair 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.519
 but if you want you can fix everything 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.409
 hair together if you liked it
