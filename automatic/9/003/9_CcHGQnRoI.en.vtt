the<00:00:15.719> launch<00:00:15.929> day<00:00:16.199> all<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:17.100> good<00:00:17.279> stuff<00:00:17.310> so

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the launch day all that good stuff so

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.429 
the launch day all that good stuff so
we're<00:00:18.449> going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> try<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.050> all<00:00:19.230> along

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
we're going to try to do this all along

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.370 
we're going to try to do this all along
tank<00:00:19.740> for<00:00:19.980> two<00:00:20.130> reasons<00:00:20.310> 1<00:00:20.789> i'm<00:00:21.390> very<00:00:21.750> lazy<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
tank for two reasons 1 i'm very lazy and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.890 
tank for two reasons 1 i'm very lazy and
more<00:00:23.369> importantly<00:00:23.880> though<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.330> real<00:00:24.480> reason

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
more importantly though the real reason

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.109 
more importantly though the real reason
is<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.550> connect<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.699> pretty<00:00:26.880> impressive

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
is that connect is a pretty impressive

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.390 
is that connect is a pretty impressive
device<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.080> if<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.710> could<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.099> all<00:00:29.250> in<00:00:29.310> one

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
device so if we could do this all in one

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.950 
device so if we could do this all in one
child<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> listening<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> everything<00:00:30.750> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
child with it listening to everything I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
child with it listening to everything I
say<00:00:30.990> perfectly<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:32.070> pretty<00:00:32.250> good<00:00:32.369> testament

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
say perfectly it's pretty good testament

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.910 
say perfectly it's pretty good testament
to<00:00:32.940> how<00:00:33.120> well<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> technology<00:00:33.870> works<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.800> we

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
to how well the technology works so we

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.830 
to how well the technology works so we
start<00:00:35.130> things<00:00:35.309> off<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:36.450> turning<00:00:36.690> on<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
start things off just turning on the

start things off just turning on the
system<00:00:37.230> no<00:00:37.980> controllers<00:00:38.520> see<00:00:39.510> where<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.660> goes

video one that's going to start right up
of<00:04:23.240> course<00:04:23.450> it's<00:04:23.599> muted<00:04:23.930> but<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:24.140> think<00:04:24.349> we<00:04:24.470> can

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
of course it's muted but I think we can

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.050 
of course it's muted but I think we can
get<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.830> general<00:04:25.130> idea

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
get the general idea

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.530 
get the general idea
so<00:04:27.020> anyway<00:04:27.470> from<00:04:27.620> here<00:04:28.060> we<00:04:29.060> can<00:04:29.090> use<00:04:29.240> hand

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
so anyway from here we can use hand

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.350 
so anyway from here we can use hand
gestures<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:30.200> fast<00:04:30.470> forward<00:04:30.680> along<00:04:31.360> relined

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
at any point start it up it could also

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.450
