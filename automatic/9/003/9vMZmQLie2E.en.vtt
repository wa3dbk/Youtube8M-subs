villains<00:00:59.199> that<00:00:59.650> were<00:01:00.089> somewhat<00:01:01.089> powerful<00:01:01.690> and

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
villains that were somewhat powerful and

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.500 
villains that were somewhat powerful and
they<00:01:02.170> were<00:01:02.229> out<00:01:02.830> to<00:01:03.220> destroy<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.760> world<00:01:04.000> and

they were out to destroy the world and

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.170 
they were out to destroy the world and
humans<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:05.619> all<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:05.890> but<00:01:06.280> they<00:01:06.880> were<00:01:06.940> also

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
humans and all that but they were also

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.630 
humans and all that but they were also
likable<00:01:07.869> a<00:01:08.049> good<00:01:08.470> number<00:01:08.619> of<00:01:08.770> them<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.340> even

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
likable a good number of them and even

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.789 
likable a good number of them and even
if<00:01:09.729> they<00:01:09.850> weren't<00:01:10.090> like<00:01:10.420> by<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.630> time<00:01:10.720> they<00:01:11.110> by

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
if they weren't like by the time they by

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.640 
if they weren't like by the time they by
the<00:01:11.860> time<00:01:12.130> their<00:01:12.369> end<00:01:12.610> was<00:01:12.970> upon<00:01:13.540> them<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:14.080> guess

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
the time their end was upon them I guess

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.190 
the time their end was upon them I guess

that no matter which one I'm watching at
the<00:01:32.799> time<00:01:32.979> but<00:01:33.359> as<00:01:34.359> of<00:01:34.570> right<00:01:34.600> now<00:01:34.719> this<00:01:34.990> is

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
the time but as of right now this is

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.080 
the time but as of right now this is
definitely<00:01:35.200> one<00:01:35.500> of<00:01:35.590> my<00:01:35.649> favorites<00:01:36.090> they're

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
definitely one of my favorites they're

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.639 
definitely one of my favorites they're
all<00:01:37.240> pretty<00:01:37.420> good<00:01:37.659> but<00:01:37.990> it's<00:01:38.289> just<00:01:38.409> been<00:01:38.619> a

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
all pretty good but it's just been a

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.830 
all pretty good but it's just been a
really<00:01:38.859> really<00:01:39.280> great<00:01:39.429> season<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:40.179> hope<00:01:40.539> there

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
really really great season I hope there

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.840 
really really great season I hope there
isn't<00:01:41.020> anybody<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.649> like<00:01:42.009> didn't<00:01:42.520> watch<00:01:42.820> it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
isn't anybody that like didn't watch it

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.389 
isn't anybody that like didn't watch it
because<00:01:43.600> there<00:01:44.049> wasn't<00:01:44.259> a<00:01:44.499> yellow<00:01:44.799> ranger<00:01:45.249> I

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
because there wasn't a yellow ranger I

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.099 
because there wasn't a yellow ranger I
really<00:01:45.999> hope<00:01:46.179> that<00:01:46.450> that<00:01:46.749> wouldn't<00:01:47.020> be

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
really hope that that wouldn't be

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.959 
really hope that that wouldn't be
grounds<00:01:47.469> for<00:01:47.530> not<00:01:47.770> watching<00:01:48.130> a<00:01:48.189> season<00:01:48.520> but
