00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.650
 and let's first accommodate our 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.420
 cupcakes we put one in the middle and we're going to 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.420
 go accommodating around 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.070
 In total there will be seven cupcakes 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.630
 that what we're going to do here we're going to 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.670
 form one as if it were a flower 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.670
 we put the bitumen in the pastry bag 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.770
 we lower them so that the air comes out 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.200
 and it's here and ready 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.760
 let's start decorating them 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.830
 starting at the center 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.830
 we are going to press and we are going to turn 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.260
 forming a flower 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.600
 let's continue doing all 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.000
 covering them with the bitumen 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.540
 starting at the center and we continue 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.540
 spinning 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.520
 and we are arranging the stems 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.790
 and here to match a bit what I'm going 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.790
 to do is I'm going to cut 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.110
 although the sizes are all all 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.570
 of the same size true 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.840
 mother nature more perfect if it is 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.730
 what 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.200
 let's put them 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.200
 in different sizes 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.420

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.909
