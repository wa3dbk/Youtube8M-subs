time<00:00:03.210> here<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:03.629> do<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.750> quick<00:00:03.840> little<00:00:04.170> 4g<00:00:04.830> test

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
time here to do a quick little 4g test

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.799 
time here to do a quick little 4g test
between<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.759> nexus<00:00:06.660> 6<00:00:06.930> 1<00:00:07.890> +1<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:09.240> galaxy

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
between the nexus 6 1 +1 and the galaxy

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.940 
between the nexus 6 1 +1 and the galaxy
a5<00:00:10.040> all<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.490> them<00:00:11.670> running<00:00:11.880> their<00:00:12.210> stock<00:00:12.950> rom

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
a5 all of them running their stock rom

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.099 
a5 all of them running their stock rom
so<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.059> get<00:00:15.269> out<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.540> box<00:00:15.750> basically

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
so what you get out the box basically

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.349 
so what you get out the box basically
and<00:00:17.000> we<00:00:18.000> can<00:00:18.150> start<00:00:18.449> off<00:00:18.600> with<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.970> a5<00:00:20.970> which

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
and we can start off with the a5 which

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.109 
and we can start off with the a5 which
is<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> right<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:23.310> are<00:00:23.340> interested<00:00:24.029> as

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
is on the right and we are interested as

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.660 
is on the right and we are interested as
well<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.430> actual<00:00:26.430> signal<00:00:27.330> information

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
well in the actual signal information

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:44.270 
well in the actual signal information
well<00:00:29.670> first<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.179> start<00:00:30.480> off<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:32.149> 4g<00:00:33.149> test

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.250 

so<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.060> to<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.180> quite<00:00:45.420> strict<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.080> this

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so I'm going to be quite strict on this

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.190 
so I'm going to be quite strict on this
test<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:46.950> give<00:00:47.310> them<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.730> shot<00:00:48.020> to<00:00:49.020> do

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
test and just give them one shot to do

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.049 
test and just give them one shot to do
it<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.450> we<00:00:51.450> can<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.380> on<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.309> three<00:00:53.730> for

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
it and we can see here on the three for

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:02.450 
it and we can see here on the three for
G<00:00:54.360> which<00:00:54.630> I'm<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.340> we're<00:00:56.340> getting<00:00:56.489> a<00:01:00.470> WoW<00:01:01.470> look

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
G which I'm on we're getting a WoW look

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.410 
G which I'm on we're getting a WoW look
like<00:01:02.610> a<00:01:02.640> good<00:01:02.970> score<00:01:03.330> then<00:01:04.820> well<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> guess<00:01:06.210> it's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
like a good score then well I guess it's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.750 
like a good score then well I guess it's
not<00:01:06.570> too<00:01:06.630> bad<00:01:07.050> eight<00:01:07.350> megabits<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.369> nowhere

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
not too bad eight megabits but nowhere

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.190 
not too bad eight megabits but nowhere
near<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:10.040> 30<00:01:11.040> megabits<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.940> was<00:01:12.300> used<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.050> my

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
near the 30 megabits I was used to on my

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.330 
near the 30 megabits I was used to on my
old<00:01:13.410> Moto<00:01:13.800> X<00:01:15.020> but<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.170> were<00:01:16.229> very<00:01:16.440> nice<00:01:16.770> upload

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
old Moto X but we were very nice upload

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.430 
old Moto X but we were very nice upload
speed<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:18.800> as<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:20.369> can<00:01:20.399> see<00:01:21.080> 12<00:01:22.080> megabits

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
speed here as you can see 12 megabits

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.350 
speed here as you can see 12 megabits
which<00:01:22.800> is<00:01:22.979> even<00:01:23.369> more<00:01:23.399> than<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> download

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
which is even more than the download

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.350 
which is even more than the download
speed<00:01:24.600> which<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.020> quite<00:01:25.470> crazy<00:01:26.090> good<00:01:27.090> for

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
speed which is quite crazy good for

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.639 
speed which is quite crazy good for
uploading<00:01:27.660> to<00:01:27.810> YouTube<00:01:28.470> though<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.649> what

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
uploading to YouTube though and what

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.670 
uploading to YouTube though and what
about<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.340> signal<00:01:33.149> information<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.649> a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
about the signal information can have a

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
about the signal information can have a
look<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.880> see<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.600> we're

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
look at that so you can see here we're

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.420 
look at that so you can see here we're
getting<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:44.600> signal<00:01:45.600> information<00:01:46.470> saying<00:01:46.830> or

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
getting a signal information saying or

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.800 
getting a signal information saying or
innate<00:01:47.940> DBM<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.369> 32a<00:01:50.369> suit<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.070> looks<00:01:53.490> like

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
innate DBM and 32a suit so it looks like

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.510 
innate DBM and 32a suit so it looks like
quite<00:01:54.810> decent<00:01:55.820> stats<00:01:56.820> they're<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.260> best

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
quite decent stats they're not the best

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.060 
quite decent stats they're not the best
obviously<00:01:59.570> could<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:00.720> some<00:02:01.080> more<00:02:01.320> bars<00:02:01.619> there

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
obviously could do some more bars there

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.020 
obviously could do some more bars there
but<00:02:02.810> should<00:02:03.810> get<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.140> through<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:05.520> Working

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
but should get you through the Working

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.990 
but should get you through the Working
Day<00:02:07.910> next<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.239> we<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:10.370> beautiful<00:02:11.370> one

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
Day next up we have the beautiful one

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.810 
Day next up we have the beautiful one
plus<00:02:12.299> one<00:02:12.600> which<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:14.010> an<00:02:14.130> awesome<00:02:14.310> phone

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
plus one which is an awesome phone

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.780 
plus one which is an awesome phone
indeed<00:02:15.269> but<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:16.380> can<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.890> how<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.250> performs

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
indeed but we can see how it performs

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.839 
indeed but we can see how it performs
when<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.120> comes<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.720> 4G

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.699 

so<00:02:25.780> far<00:02:26.700> it's<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:28.120> bit<00:02:28.659> worrying<00:02:28.959> there<00:02:29.409> with

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
so far it's a bit worrying there with

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.379 
so far it's a bit worrying there with
only<00:02:30.249> kind<00:02:30.879> of<00:02:30.969> like<00:02:31.150> one<00:02:31.450> bar<00:02:31.780> showing<00:02:32.560> up<00:02:33.389> but

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
only kind of like one bar showing up but

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:56.240 
only kind of like one bar showing up but
we<00:02:34.540> can<00:02:34.780> see<00:02:35.079> nevertheless

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.710 

so<00:02:57.020> looks<00:02:58.020> like<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:59.100> little<00:02:59.940> bit<00:03:00.120> better<00:03:00.330> there

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
so looks like a little bit better there

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.480 
so looks like a little bit better there
I<00:03:01.020> think<00:03:01.380> he's<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.830> end<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:02.220> at<00:03:02.370> about

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
I think he's going to end up at about

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:17.030 
I think he's going to end up at about
ten

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.619 

very<00:03:17.670> weird<00:03:18.000> how<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.540> kind<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.959> just<00:03:19.200> declines

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
very weird how it kind of just declines

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.190 
very weird how it kind of just declines
towards<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:21.780> end<00:03:23.000> maybe<00:03:24.000> their<00:03:24.540> FRA<00:03:24.810> telling

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
towards the end maybe their FRA telling

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.580 
towards the end maybe their FRA telling
the<00:03:25.319> data<00:03:25.590> or<00:03:25.920> something<00:03:28.159> very<00:03:29.159> weird<00:03:29.670> here

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
the data or something very weird here

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.770 
the data or something very weird here
but<00:03:31.590> his<00:03:31.739> 10<00:03:32.069> as<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.310> can<00:03:32.610> see<00:03:32.909> so<00:03:33.330> slightly

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
but his 10 as you can see so slightly

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:42.680 
but his 10 as you can see so slightly
better<00:03:33.930> than<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.200> a5<00:03:35.390> which<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.540> nice

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.840 

but<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.410> upload<00:03:43.770> doesn't<00:03:44.130> seem<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.490> be<00:03:44.580> quite

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
but the upload doesn't seem to be quite

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.240 
but the upload doesn't seem to be quite
strong<00:03:46.370> bottoming<00:03:47.370> out<00:03:47.550> at<00:03:47.880> 8:00<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.890> where

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
strong bottoming out at 8:00 so where

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.250 
strong bottoming out at 8:00 so where
looks<00:03:50.490> like<00:03:50.700> better<00:03:51.090> on<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.420> download<00:03:51.930> we're

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
looks like better on the download we're

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.310 
looks like better on the download we're
not<00:03:52.410> quite<00:03:52.620> as<00:03:52.800> good<00:03:52.980> on<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.250> upload<00:03:54.080> so<00:03:55.080> look

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
not quite as good on the upload so look

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.300 
not quite as good on the upload so look
at<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.530> signal<00:03:56.010> strength<00:03:56.660> statistics<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:02.100> we

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
at the signal strength statistics and we

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.840 
at the signal strength statistics and we
can<00:04:02.520> see<00:04:02.790> here<00:04:03.330> I<00:04:03.830> think<00:04:04.830> that's<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:05.520> roughly

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
can see here I think that's so roughly

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.570 
can see here I think that's so roughly
the<00:04:06.000> same<00:04:06.240> in<00:04:06.720> terms<00:04:07.080> of<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.470> DBM<00:04:08.010> hundred<00:04:08.520> an

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
the same in terms of the DBM hundred an

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.460 
the same in terms of the DBM hundred an
eight<00:04:08.820> with<00:04:09.390> an<00:04:09.630> su<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.380> 33<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:12.020> you<00:04:13.020> can<00:04:13.200> see

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
eight with an su of 33 and you can see

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.699 
eight with an su of 33 and you can see
here<00:04:14.090> about<00:04:15.090> midway<00:04:15.750> when<00:04:15.990> it<00:04:16.110> comes<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.590> the

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
here about midway when it comes to the

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.460 
here about midway when it comes to the
bars<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:19.280> quite<00:04:20.280> decent<00:04:20.820> were<00:04:20.910> nothing

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
bars so quite decent were nothing

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.590 
bars so quite decent were nothing
spectacular<00:04:23.990> really<00:04:25.460> last<00:04:26.460> but<00:04:26.820> not<00:04:26.970> least<00:04:27.300> we

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
spectacular really last but not least we

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.860 
spectacular really last but not least we
have<00:04:27.630> big<00:04:28.560> old<00:04:28.770> Shamu<00:04:29.990> see<00:04:30.990> how<00:04:31.260> Shamu<00:04:31.860> handles

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
have big old Shamu see how Shamu handles

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.030 
have big old Shamu see how Shamu handles
the<00:04:33.870> 4G<00:04:35.600> looks<00:04:36.600> like<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:37.230> little<00:04:37.530> bit<00:04:37.680> stronger

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
the 4G looks like a little bit stronger

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.500 
the 4G looks like a little bit stronger
for<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:39.890> reception<00:04:40.890> motorola<00:04:41.760> traditionally

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
for the reception motorola traditionally

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.350 
for the reception motorola traditionally
very<00:04:42.690> strong<00:04:43.140> in<00:04:43.320> this<00:04:43.470> aspect<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:45.060> it<00:04:45.150> should

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
very strong in this aspect so it should

00:04:45.360 --> 00:05:06.610 
very strong in this aspect so it should
help<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.780> Nexus<00:04:46.670> here

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.540 

wow<00:05:08.979> that's<00:05:09.979> pretty<00:05:10.160> poor<00:05:10.729> bro<00:05:11.949> even<00:05:12.949> I<00:05:13.250> didn't

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
wow that's pretty poor bro even I didn't

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.010 
wow that's pretty poor bro even I didn't
think<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.880> would<00:05:13.940> be<00:05:14.090> that<00:05:14.270> low<00:05:15.550> what's<00:05:16.550> this

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
think it would be that low what's this

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.840 
think it would be that low what's this
all<00:05:18.020> blown<00:05:18.320> is<00:05:18.500> completely<00:05:19.160> all<00:05:19.370> over<00:05:19.729> the

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
all blown is completely all over the

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:27.760 
all blown is completely all over the
place<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:21.220> is<00:05:22.220> crazy<00:05:23.229> haha<00:05:24.940> poor<00:05:25.940> Shamu<00:05:26.770> not

a<00:05:27.800> very<00:05:28.070> good<00:05:28.310> result<00:05:28.699> there<00:05:29.500> so<00:05:30.500> we're<00:05:30.830> you

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
a very good result there so we're you

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.250 
a very good result there so we're you
know<00:05:31.389> let's<00:05:32.389> just<00:05:32.630> have<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:32.930> look<00:05:33.020> at<00:05:33.169> the

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
know let's just have a look at the

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:42.879 
know let's just have a look at the
signal<00:05:33.740> see<00:05:34.130> wise<00:05:34.370> a<00:05:34.900> bit<00:05:35.900> crazy<00:05:38.919> and<00:05:41.680> we<00:05:42.680> got

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
signal see wise a bit crazy and we got

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:43.830 
signal see wise a bit crazy and we got
here

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
here

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.260 
here
so<00:05:44.840> getting<00:05:45.139> a<00:05:45.530> hundred<00:05:45.860> and<00:05:46.070> eight<00:05:46.220> DBM<00:05:46.940> and

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
so getting a hundred and eight DBM and

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.050 
so getting a hundred and eight DBM and
32<00:05:48.020> s<00:05:48.199> you<00:05:48.560> quite<00:05:48.949> similar<00:05:49.490> then<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.030> other

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
32 s you quite similar then to the other

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.290 
32 s you quite similar then to the other
two<00:05:50.870> and<00:05:51.520> about<00:05:52.520> halfway<00:05:52.880> in<00:05:53.240> terms<00:05:53.690> of<00:05:54.080> the

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
two and about halfway in terms of the

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.750 
two and about halfway in terms of the
reception<00:05:56.800> so<00:05:57.800> can't<00:05:58.310> really<00:05:58.460> see<00:05:58.669> anything

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
reception so can't really see anything

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.830 
reception so can't really see anything
obvious<00:05:59.419> which<00:05:59.660> would<00:05:59.930> cause<00:06:00.260> it<00:06:00.560> to<00:06:01.840> perform

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
obvious which would cause it to perform

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.700 
obvious which would cause it to perform
quite<00:06:03.110> poor<00:06:03.440> there<00:06:03.770> in<00:06:04.070> regards<00:06:04.699> to<00:06:04.820> the

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
quite poor there in regards to the

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.300 
quite poor there in regards to the
reception<00:06:06.710> signal<00:06:07.190> test<00:06:07.840> but<00:06:08.840> I<00:06:09.229> think<00:06:09.680> it's

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
reception signal test but I think it's

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.719 
reception signal test but I think it's
quite<00:06:10.720> conclusive<00:06:11.720> here<00:06:12.340> you're<00:06:13.340> gonna<00:06:13.460> get

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
quite conclusive here you're gonna get

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.250 
quite conclusive here you're gonna get
quite<00:06:14.690> nice<00:06:15.229> upload<00:06:15.889> speed<00:06:16.340> on<00:06:16.580> the<00:06:16.760> a5<00:06:17.300> as

quite nice upload speed on the a5 as

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.129 
quite nice upload speed on the a5 as
well<00:06:18.500> as<00:06:18.620> a<00:06:18.650> okay<00:06:19.610> download<00:06:20.300> speed<00:06:20.690> not

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
speed quite good on here up to 10

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.339 
speed quite good on here up to 10
megabytes<00:06:28.310> but<00:06:28.639> upload<00:06:29.570> speed<00:06:29.960> a<00:06:29.990> little<00:06:30.229> bit

megabytes but upload speed a little bit

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:34.690 
megabytes but upload speed a little bit
