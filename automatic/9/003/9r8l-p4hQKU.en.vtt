00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:07.230
 hyundai veloster a four meter 22 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.719
 long unknown in the ranks of the compact 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.380
 coupÃ©s a new evolution without 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.839
 direct predecessor extroverts outside 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.449
 like interior design solutions 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.820
 can be found both in the tin and in the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.070
 interior the view is to the rear 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.730
 however tarnished by the spoiler in the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.859
 rear window commodity looks different 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.449
 on the handling track had veloster 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.180
 now prove that he can do more than 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.960
 especially the time of the exotics 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.960
 to give face 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:49.850
 let's see, we in the sprint zero 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.850
 one hundred goes out 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.670
 you realize that the upper area already 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.670
 a bit tough it 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 the second wind is missing 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.250
 stood 13 tons thank you with 95 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.680
 in seconds it is two tenths faster 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.930
 promised on 101 of the factory 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.400
 the brakes look like the wise 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.910
 that feels good on it 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.070
 level of competition after 36 meters 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:36.970
 win the four brake discs against 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:38.950
 the drive then we'll have a look 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.520
 how the landing gear stole in 18 meters 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.520
 turns 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.350
 yes, she says a bit more in the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 curves 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.020
 not quite as precise overall 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.880
 Trouble-free driving can be 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.840
 a little bit sportier 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.350
 his 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.219
 with 63 6 km h the hyundai completes the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.219
 pylons parcours 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.560
 we sit 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.840
 it gives hyundai veloster since 2011 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.209
 in the german market and that 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.190
 special about the car is that he only 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.530
 Three doors has many manufacturers name 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.400
 their models, although three-door but mean 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.050
 actually only the 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.140
 hatchback here really has three 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.209
 doors that we look at and make 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.850
 Although only one door on the driver's side 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.830
 and here on the passenger side 2 and 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.810
 why just the passenger side 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.700
 this is a safety issue so you can 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.330
 the children or riders safely from 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.880
 walkway enter directly after 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.010
 courage to complete the extraordinary 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.459
 Door concept makes him Korean 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.810
 Germany to rarity little extra 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.900
 in the engine 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.239
 a downsizing no turbo as well as most fruits 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.099
 free of oxygen rich food 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.170
 the user is in Germany only in 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.020
 a motor variant offered and indeed 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.959
 with the 1.6 liter four-cylinder sucker 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.349
 with 140 ps and look again 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.709
 engine so goes the engine has no 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:17.170
 special sports engine actually pulls 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.780
 He's so tired throughout the rev range 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.430
 through in the upper area was even then 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.019
 additionally loud that it does not 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.840
 more so much fun out too 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.700
 turn pages uncomfortable press so 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.080
 motor is not necessarily one now 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.299
 quite a point of the car on the 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.299
 thirst he does not drink the performance with 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.989
 8.5 liters test consumption of the sucker in the 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.400
 frame does not offer hyundai for 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.799
 this car so you have to with the 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.799
 get along what the engineers developed 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.900
 have and yes so it is not quite so 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.849
 Sporty not quite so precise it notices 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.849
 in the narrow curves in mind that a 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.230
 leaning a bit more in the curve and 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.840
 which is also not on the steering ago not 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.739
 quite as precise as it could react 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.570
 quietly a little bit fine tuning 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.550
 tolerate 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.300
 There is also room for fine tuning 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.220
 inner space 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.320
 here the hyundai is missing despite 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.710
 clever design solutions to last 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.710
 consequence 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.700
 s 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.040
 cockpit is okay for this price range 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.720
 The materials are not stunning 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.870
 high quality it is still quite a lot 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.370
 it has plastic while the center console 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.580
 is quite nice designed them so 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.020
 teardrop-shaped and tapered downwards 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.340
 what stands out is the navigation system 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.150
 because it is really very good 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.710
 operated 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.450
 Here I come after a minute 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.550
 actually already without problems with cope 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.770
 and he does not even have to go behind the 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.690
 more expensive advantage is called systems by the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.730
 frighten premium manufacturers 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.860
 niche filled job done 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.470
 the veloster joins the 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.350
 Group of affordable compact coupes 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.660
 around 26,000 euros for the best 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.600
 Equipment variants are on board 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.580
 an extraordinary concept packed 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.250
 in an equally extraordinary look 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.780
 on the subject of engine and chassis, the 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.170
 Koreans, however, still room for 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.170
 improvements
