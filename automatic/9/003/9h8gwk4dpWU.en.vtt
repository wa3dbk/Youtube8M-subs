00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.440
 48 video 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.830
 previously this channel is already going to be 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.540
 only good at least as for 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.160
 inform them and to tell them and to 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.509
 answer them all you wanted to do 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.609
 that tattoos and know how 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.230
 very much more back unit the subject of 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.609
 the tattoos as well as the title of the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.140
 video these are five things that you have 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.730
 what to know before tattooing i love you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.410
 clarify that this is my most humble 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.670
 opinion and if you want to apply them too 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.289
 if you do not want to apply it is also 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.510
 correct so just veil 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.309
 enjoy it and number one is forever 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.930
 despite the fact that today our 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.940
 friend in doing does not mean that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.739
 welcomes them we can erase them when 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.570
 hit us the win is very important that 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.160
 know what you want and take the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.260
 best decision when tattooing 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.579
 so there is no repentance 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.309
 because you are really investing 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.140
 money are you investing time and over 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.030
 everything is suffering to make you that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.800
 tattoo so everything to think a 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.870
 little bit better because you're going to live with 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.850
 he for the rest of your life thinks he is 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.980
 something like a baby right now and ANB 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.440
 people approach children but think about it 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.940
 like that how is long- term health 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.589
 if it hurts I think it's the doubts more 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.150
 polemics of tattoos because some 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.799
 people say that it hurts more others than 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.080
 they say less and there are people who say that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.640
 it hurts us at all another truth that if 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.960
 there is a certain level of pain 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.909
 moment is luck because you are 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.770
 sticking needles in your skin so 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.110
 There must definitely be a 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.640
 certain number 3 costs money in 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.710
 Tattoos is not only a luxury but 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.509
 you are firmly paying an artist to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.430
 you do one of his works are 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.170
 paying your work your effort your 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.759
 creativity and above all its materials 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.159
 surely existing to all those who 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.479
 They charge very cheap but probably not 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.310
 it's going to stay as you want and 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.750
 surely they are going to mesh and you're going to 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.130
 die well maybe you do not die so 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.360
 better not to take them the risk well 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 that if I want to make a tattoo you 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.679
 I recommend that now it's money and go to 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.720
 a quality study number 4 is not a 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.310
 fashion even though they are so fashionable 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.380
 I feel that we are in something a little 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.330
 more personal and a decision of its own 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.100
 time to do it I am a war 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.750
 between being against and I'm in favor 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.280
 please because in a certain way it is a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.619
 how people in society 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.210
 may not have so many moral problems 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.799
 regarding the data and I'm against 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.630
 because people now do more than as 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.500
 cow and I think this is a fad and not 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.590
 the infinities 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.690
 it's not that easy and number 5 fear does not 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.250
 it's an option it's totally normal that 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.810
 before getting a tattoo, have a 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.250
 little bit scared me every time 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.110
 tube I'm scared but I'm not 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.030
 referring to that kind of purpose all 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.620
 moralistic fears that people always 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.020
 They use the excuse when they want 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.640
 to sit down I know a lot of people that 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.830
 you do not get a tattoo for fear of not 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.240
 get work as if it were the only 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.709
 why not a job done 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.900
 I do not know maybe it does not end until the 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.730
 secondary today if they are the people who 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.320
 they are afraid of how their 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.120
 dads when they find out that they 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.650
 they made a tattoo now it turns out that 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 young people if we are interested in what 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.680
 our parents think why because 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.330
 when you leave on Saturday, put on 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.310
 stone of your life there if you do not remember 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.930
 or mother that if you have spent years 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.460
 telling everyone to be 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.990
 they want to make a tattoo but 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.730
 in the typical fear that I do not know 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.160
 they want to do because apparently it's going to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.330
 hurt and compare the two letters to the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.730
 time they want to do it on the wrist 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.340
 with one you feel eight hours covering 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.930
 his entire band does not not this my 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.790
 days any of these fears 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.620
 moralists I recommend that you do not 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.790
 and think a little better the reasons why 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.830
 which one wants is to act if 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.510
 after all this has been overcome but 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.160
 also what you go connected the best 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.510
 your confidence and you can investigate 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.140
 really realize what is the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.490
 theater world 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.810
 this has been all for today's video 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.580
 I really hope you liked it and 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.350
 above all, serve these five 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.910
 things if none of you have thought 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.650
 in these things then I think they are 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.820
 ready to tattoo as I always leave 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.550
 my social networks in the bottom 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.050
 like facebook twitter and urges camps 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.390
 so they can follow me, they will be 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.040
 Pending all the things I do not 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.510
 forget to subscribe in German and it's 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.510
 I send a kiss up I love 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.550
 free
