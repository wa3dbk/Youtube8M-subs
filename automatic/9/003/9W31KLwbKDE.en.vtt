that<00:00:18.869> are<00:00:18.930> coming<00:00:19.410> with<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.619> wimax<00:00:20.100> module<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
that are coming with a wimax module and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 
that are coming with a wimax module and
over<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.170> some<00:00:22.680> special<00:00:23.070> ones

these are the ones on clevo and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.200 
these are the ones on clevo and
especially<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.920> one<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> bottom<00:00:26.730> is

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
especially this one on the bottom is

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.419 
especially this one on the bottom is
quite<00:00:27.480> interesting<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.560> see<00:00:28.800> it's

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
quite interesting as you can see it's

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.750 
quite interesting as you can see it's
not<00:00:29.670> connected<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> wimax<00:00:31.650> network<00:00:33.320> that<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
not connected to a wimax network that is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.799 
not connected to a wimax network that is
established<00:00:35.760> over<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> Mangaung

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
established over here at the Mangaung

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.500 
established over here at the Mangaung
hall<00:00:37.670> well<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.760> interesting<00:00:39.059> thing<00:00:39.450> about

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
hall well the interesting thing about

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.110 
hall well the interesting thing about
this<00:00:39.840> network<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.559> general<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.730> design

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
this network is in general the design

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.200 
this network is in general the design
itself<00:00:42.379> because<00:00:43.379> as<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.760> kind<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
itself because as you can see it kind of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.240 
itself because as you can see it kind of
looks<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.629> book<00:00:45.960> right<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.920> ever<00:00:46.980> put

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
looks like a book right if you ever put

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.389 
looks like a book right if you ever put
it<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> shelf<00:00:47.930> next<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.320> books<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.980> you

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
it on a shelf next to your books so you

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.580 
it on a shelf next to your books so you
won't<00:00:50.610> even<00:00:50.789> recognize<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> netbook<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
won't even recognize it as a netbook and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.889 
won't even recognize it as a netbook and
I'm<00:00:53.129> not<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.489> sure<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.850> kind<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.600> fancy

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
I'm not so sure what kind of fancy

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.080 
I'm not so sure what kind of fancy
little<00:00:55.289> thing<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:56.730> let's<00:00:56.850> take<00:00:57.059> a

little thing this is but let's take a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.240 
little thing this is but let's take a
quick<00:00:57.449> look<00:00:57.480> around<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> power

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
quick look around this we have the power

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.240 
quick look around this we have the power

and on the left of the trackpad but in
general<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:53.020> of<00:01:53.200> course<00:01:53.229> something

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
general this of course something

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.700 
general this of course something
different<00:01:54.160> and<00:01:54.429> due<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.300> this<00:01:55.720> specific<00:01:56.080> why

different and due to this specific why
next<00:01:57.100> module<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.780> just<00:01:59.110> shows<00:01:59.410> us<00:01:59.679> a<00:01:59.710> little

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
next module it just shows us a little

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.279 
next module it just shows us a little
bit<00:02:00.190> about<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.090> future<00:02:01.360> of<00:02:01.539> network<00:02:02.080> our
