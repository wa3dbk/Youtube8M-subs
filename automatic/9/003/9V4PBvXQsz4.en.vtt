you're<00:02:12.390> going<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.660> kind<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.130> take<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.310> end<00:02:14.519> of

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
you're going to kind of take the end of

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.790 
you're going to kind of take the end of
that<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.269> drag<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.750> across<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.440> make<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
that and drag it across to make the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.880 
that and drag it across to make the
little<00:02:16.980> cursive<00:02:17.550> o<00:02:17.790> now<00:02:18.510> form<00:02:18.810> ie<00:02:18.959> after<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
little cursive o now form ie after the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.610 
little cursive o now form ie after the
water<00:02:20.130> goes<00:02:20.489> down<00:02:20.819> vertically<00:02:21.630> halfway<00:02:22.260> I'm

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
water goes down vertically halfway I'm

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.009 
water goes down vertically halfway I'm
going<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.220> make<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.670> horizontal<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.810> then

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
going to make it horizontal and then

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.530 
going to make it horizontal and then
wrap<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.680> wire<00:02:25.860> around<00:02:25.940> then<00:02:26.940> after<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.390> make

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
wrap the wire around then after and make

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.089 
wrap the wire around then after and make
the<00:02:27.690> slight<00:02:27.900> curve<00:02:27.930> for<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.500> e<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:29.040> to

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
the slight curve for the e I'm going to

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.009 
the slight curve for the e I'm going to
bring<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.610> water<00:02:29.819> up<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.900> is

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
bring the water up so that it is

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.229 
bring the water up so that it is
horizontally<00:02:31.950> straight<00:02:32.280> now<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:32.730> are<00:02:33.120> going

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
horizontally straight now we are going

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.000 
horizontally straight now we are going
to<00:02:33.330> create<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.690> ring<00:02:33.870> shape<00:02:34.200> using<00:02:34.739> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
to create the ring shape using the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.240 
to create the ring shape using the
nail-polish<00:02:35.819> lid<00:02:36.420> wrap<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.380> ring<00:02:37.590> around<00:02:37.769> it

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
nail-polish lid wrap the ring around it

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.550 
nail-polish lid wrap the ring around it
here<00:02:38.549> in<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.760> crisscross<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.540> wires<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:40.230> each

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
here in a crisscross the wires on each

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.160 
here in a crisscross the wires on each
side<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.489> opposite<00:02:41.880> side<00:02:42.209> so<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
side to the opposite side so that the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.110 
side to the opposite side so that the
ring<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.440> connected<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.370> then<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:44.880> are<00:02:45.000> going

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
ring is connected and then we are going

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.000 
ring is connected and then we are going
to<00:02:45.180> trim<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.630> ends<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.959> little<00:02:46.110> bit<00:02:46.260> after<00:02:46.830> this

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
to trim the ends a little bit after this

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.569 
to trim the ends a little bit after this
although<00:02:47.459> I'm<00:02:47.819> trimming<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.920> extra<00:02:49.920> wire<00:02:50.160> I'm

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
although I'm trimming the extra wire I'm

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.670 
although I'm trimming the extra wire I'm
going<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:51.030> leave<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.269> little<00:02:51.750> bit<00:02:51.900> left<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.440> that

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
going to leave a little bit left so that

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.620 
going to leave a little bit left so that
I<00:02:52.709> can<00:02:52.920> wrap<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.160> around<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.700> ring<00:02:53.849> and<00:02:54.150> I'm

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
I can wrap it around the ring and I'm

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.630 
I can wrap it around the ring and I'm
going<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.840> do<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.049> final<00:02:55.530> trimming<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.459> to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
going to do a final trimming just to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:15.870 
going to do a final trimming just to
remove<00:02:57.239> any<00:02:57.510> wires<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.170> are<00:02:58.260> sticking<00:02:58.470> out

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.300 

now<00:03:16.880> for<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.660> last<00:03:17.960> ring<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.680> actually<00:03:18.980> was

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
now for the last ring I actually was

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.370 
now for the last ring I actually was
able<00:03:19.490> to<00:03:19.670> adjust<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:21.110> can<00:03:21.260> be

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
able to adjust it so that it can be

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.620 
able to adjust it so that it can be
either<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.740> knuckle<00:03:22.190> ring<00:03:22.370> or<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:22.760> regular

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
either a knuckle ring or just regular

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.220 
either a knuckle ring or just regular
old<00:03:24.130> ring<00:03:25.130> now<00:03:25.790> all<00:03:26.090> the<00:03:26.300> previous<00:03:26.720> steps<00:03:26.960> are

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
old ring now all the previous steps are

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.980 
old ring now all the previous steps are
similar<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.220> second<00:03:28.640> ring<00:03:28.820> but<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.840> only

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
similar to the second ring but the only

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.920 
similar to the second ring but the only
difference<00:03:30.440> is<00:03:30.710> at<00:03:31.100> the<00:03:31.370> end<00:03:31.580> I'm<00:03:32.030> going<00:03:32.090> to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
difference is at the end I'm going to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.330 
difference is at the end I'm going to
curve<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.650> little<00:03:34.400> loop<00:03:34.700> up<00:03:35.440> at<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.770> end<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.220> the

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
curve a little loop up at the end of the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.580 
curve a little loop up at the end of the
e<00:03:37.390> because<00:03:38.390> that<00:03:38.750> will<00:03:38.930> be<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.080> end<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.470> our

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
e because that will be the end of our

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.790 
e because that will be the end of our
ring<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.040> then<00:03:40.850> you're<00:03:41.300> going<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:42.140> kind<00:03:42.440> of

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
ring and then you're going to kind of

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.550 
ring and then you're going to kind of
tighten<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.670> loop<00:03:44.030> with<00:03:44.780> a<00:03:45.080> round<00:03:45.440> nose

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
tighten that loop with a round nose

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.710 
tighten that loop with a round nose
pliers<00:03:45.980> and<00:03:46.370> then<00:03:46.430> using<00:03:47.060> a<00:03:47.150> pen<00:03:47.330> I'm<00:03:47.510> going<00:03:47.660> to

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
pliers and then using a pen I'm going to

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.780 
pliers and then using a pen I'm going to
wrap<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.800> ring<00:03:49.489> around<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:52.400> are<00:03:52.430> all

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
wrap the ring around it and you are all

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.130
