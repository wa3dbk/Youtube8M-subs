00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
panel and then it evolved in another

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.270 
panel and then it evolved in another
thing<00:01:58.109> and<00:01:58.319> then<00:01:58.439> how<00:01:58.619> am<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.859> gonna<00:01:59.039> make<00:01:59.219> it

thing and then how am I gonna make it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.969 
thing and then how am I gonna make it
skate<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.420> whatever<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.929> just<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.530> drew<00:02:01.799> it

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
skate and just whatever I just I drew it

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.590 
skate and just whatever I just I drew it
that's<00:02:02.249> it<00:02:02.490> how<00:02:02.670> sick<00:02:02.939> would<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.539> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600

the first Nike I skated in was a dunk
and<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:33.240> there's<00:02:34.240> some<00:02:34.390> things<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:34.930> I

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
and so there's some things in it that I

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.990 
and so there's some things in it that I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
you know not too much aesthetically you

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.680 
you know not too much aesthetically you
can't<00:02:39.730> really<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.360> mess<00:02:40.570> with<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:41.080> got<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:41.920> I

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
can't really you mess with it I got a I

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.600 
can't really you mess with it I got a I
got<00:02:43.690> B<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.500> got<00:02:45.250> C<00:02:45.600> these<00:02:46.600> are<00:02:46.660> three<00:02:47.290> different

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
obviously I favored be a little bit more

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.560

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
because this one's the one that really

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.760 
because this one's the one that really
got<00:02:56.160> skated<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.459> then<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:57.790> these<00:02:58.209> two

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
got skated in and then this these two

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.540 
got skated in and then this these two
this<00:02:59.770> barely<00:03:00.070> did<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.350> got<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> little

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
this barely did and this got a little

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.860 
this barely did and this got a little
bit<00:03:03.640> more<00:03:03.820> but<00:03:04.000> not<00:03:04.150> quite<00:03:04.390> so<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.690> kept

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
bit more but not quite so I kept

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.840 
bit more but not quite so I kept
switching<00:03:05.080> back<00:03:05.350> between<00:03:05.530> these<00:03:05.860> two<00:03:06.730> double

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
switching back between these two double

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.760 
switching back between these two double
