00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
okay today we're gonna try a new design

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.460 
okay today we're gonna try a new design
this<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.399> going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.610> be<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.760> full<00:00:03.300> length<00:00:03.810> crimp

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
this is going to be a full length crimp

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.260 
this is going to be a full length crimp
all<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.009> way<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.370> bottom<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.970> can<00:00:06.240> and

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
all the way to the bottom of the can and

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.110 
all the way to the bottom of the can and
then<00:00:07.259> put<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.680> holes<00:00:07.919> on<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.849> we're<00:00:09.030> gonna

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
then put the holes on it and we're gonna

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.910 
then put the holes on it and we're gonna
make<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.480> just<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.750> little<00:00:09.780> bit<00:00:10.139> taller<00:00:10.440> on<00:00:10.740> this

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
make it just a little bit taller on this

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.919 
make it just a little bit taller on this
one<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.730> heats<00:00:11.940> up<00:00:12.179> just<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.690> little

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
one so that it heats up just a little

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.860 
one so that it heats up just a little
higher<00:00:13.170> but<00:00:13.500> we've<00:00:14.160> taken<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.059> we're<00:00:15.750> gonna

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
higher but we've taken and we're gonna

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.310 
higher but we've taken and we're gonna
cut<00:00:16.289> at<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.650> bottom<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.609> light<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.510> we've

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
cut at the bottom of the light and we've

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.080 
cut at the bottom of the light and we've
already<00:00:19.560> done<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.250> another<00:00:20.609> bottle

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090

already done that on another bottle
right<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.460> we're<00:00:23.460> gonna<00:00:23.519> try<00:00:23.910> crimping

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
right here and we're gonna try crimping

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.929 
right here and we're gonna try crimping
that<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:25.199> now<00:00:25.410> all<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.070> way<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.550> bottom

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.520 

pull<00:01:43.149> it<00:01:43.270> apart<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.909> it<00:01:46.030> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
pull it apart and there it is

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
sweet all the way to the bottom and now

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.929 
sweet all the way to the bottom and now
we're<00:01:50.829> going<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:50.979> come<00:01:51.250> down<00:01:51.430> here<00:01:51.670> about<00:01:51.789> a

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
we're going to come down here about a

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.919 
we're going to come down here about a
half<00:01:52.030> an<00:01:52.450> inch<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:53.340> drill<00:01:54.340> our<00:01:54.490> holes<00:01:54.929> this

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
half an inch and drill our holes this

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.109 
half an inch and drill our holes this
one<00:01:56.140> right<00:01:56.350> here<00:01:56.770> works<00:01:57.039> good<00:01:57.369> but<00:01:57.429> it's<00:01:57.820> I

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
one right here works good but it's I

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.419 
one right here works good but it's I
think<00:01:58.570> that<00:01:58.840> it'll<00:01:59.170> work<00:01:59.320> even<00:01:59.679> better<00:01:59.890> if

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
think that it'll work even better if

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.399 
think that it'll work even better if
there's<00:02:00.729> if<00:02:00.970> this<00:02:01.210> heats<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.780> can<00:02:02.049> up<00:02:02.289> a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
there's if this heats the can up a

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.700 
there's if this heats the can up a
little<00:02:02.619> more<00:02:02.829> and<00:02:03.490> so<00:02:04.119> we're<00:02:04.329> gonna<00:02:04.710> we're

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
little more and so we're gonna we're

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.969 
little more and so we're gonna we're
gonna<00:02:05.829> put<00:02:06.130> our<00:02:06.250> holes<00:02:06.490> about<00:02:06.820> 1/2<00:02:07.360> inch<00:02:07.630> down

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
gonna put our holes about 1/2 inch down

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.979 
gonna put our holes about 1/2 inch down
awesome
