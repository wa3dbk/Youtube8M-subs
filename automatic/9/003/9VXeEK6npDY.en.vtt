someone with a round face like I am it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.730 
someone with a round face like I am it
is<00:01:35.610> not<00:01:35.670> easy<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.780> us<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> pull<00:01:37.229> out<00:01:37.380> short

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
is not easy for us to pull out short
hair<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.060> why<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.450> need<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
hair so that is why we need the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.249 
hair so that is why we need the
triangular<00:01:40.320> layers<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.220> help<00:01:41.400> draw<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.750> down

triangular layers to help draw this down

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.090 
triangular layers to help draw this down
make<00:01:43.770> our<00:01:43.950> faces<00:01:44.250> look<00:01:44.520> longer<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.420> thinner

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
make our faces look longer and thinner

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.300 
make our faces look longer and thinner
