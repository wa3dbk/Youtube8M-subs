00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 hi i am give my 96 in this tutorial les 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.179
 I'm going to teach how to install framework 35 in 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.429
 windows 8 in your case because 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.860
 right now I'm working on windows 7 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.330
 but I notice something important 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.830
 you must execute it in mode 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.380
 administrator otherwise 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.570
 will perform none of their tasks 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.550
 correctly clear is that in the video 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.590
 previous I explained what functions 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.699
 you have this application but to the point 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.699
 let's go to the next 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.890
 right click 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.180
 and not run as administrator 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.180
 and I wait where I load 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.020
 all right 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.120
 and also one of them things 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.410
 offered by this program is that also 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.790
 can you activate your windows 8 can 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.790
 install net foronda board 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.479
 can take out the keys 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.479
 of computers 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.930
 and among other things more 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.500
 and they go from sar to carla in the program 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.820
 once they have it open they go to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:37.220
 an option in this point net framework 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.830
 3.5 of the click and this this disappears 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.400
 message 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.390
 if they want me to work with pleasure but for 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.390
 a day in an accept 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.680
 and they expect me to charge again 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.870
 and the time they have been opened 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.410
 they simply give it to install 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.410
 do not 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.500
 and it will appear 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.689
 this 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.950
 the 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:28.580
 what is the symbol of the system only 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.690
 they have to wait for everything to end and 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:36.170
 once the finished tri 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.690
 restart on your machine and ready 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.670
 I got a terrible mistake because 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.040
 I already have it installed in my system 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.170
 but in the case of you will not leave 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.830
 no error and once the 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.980
 installation restart your pc and ready now 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.950
 they have the framework 35 totally full and 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.300
 the advantage is that you do not need internet 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.280
 I hope you have served them this 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.860
 tutorial although I went a little fast 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.660
 because I do not have time I leave the link 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.310
 in the description of the video so that what 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.310
 download until later
