okay this is just a brief introduction

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.730 
okay this is just a brief introduction
to<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.760> differences<00:00:03.360> between<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.870> types<00:00:04.380> of

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
to the differences between the types of

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.550 
to the differences between the types of
paint<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.540> might<00:00:06.779> run<00:00:06.960> into<00:00:07.020> at<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
paint that you might run into at the

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.730 
paint that you might run into at the
store<00:00:07.950> uh<00:00:08.510> we've<00:00:09.510> been<00:00:09.719> dealing<00:00:09.990> with<00:00:10.170> acrylic

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
store uh we've been dealing with acrylic

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.560 
store uh we've been dealing with acrylic
which<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> base<00:00:11.670> for<00:00:11.940> acrylic<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.420> an

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
which and the base for acrylic is an

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.700 
which and the base for acrylic is an
acrylic<00:00:12.900> polymer<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.740> basically<00:00:15.710> everybody

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
acrylic polymer is basically everybody

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.260 
acrylic polymer is basically everybody
uses<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> same<00:00:17.190> pigment<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:17.880> other<00:00:18.029> words

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
uses the same pigment in other words

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.450 
uses the same pigment in other words
it's<00:00:18.480> ground-up<00:00:19.020> earth<00:00:19.470> or<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.010> ground-up

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
it's ground-up earth or it's ground-up

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.269 
it's ground-up earth or it's ground-up
cobalt<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.660> make<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> color<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.650> then<00:00:23.130> they

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
cobalt to make the color and then they

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.849 
cobalt to make the color and then they
suspend<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.150> vehicle<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.840> acrylic<00:00:25.680> it's

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
suspend it in a vehicle in acrylic it's

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.540 
suspend it in a vehicle in acrylic it's
it's<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.519> polymer<00:00:27.119> emulsion<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:28.220> watercolor<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
it's a polymer emulsion in watercolor it

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.350 
it's a polymer emulsion in watercolor it
is<00:00:30.000> um<00:00:31.399> it<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:33.390> gum<00:00:33.660> arabic<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.820> watercolor<00:00:35.820> is

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
is um it is gum arabic and watercolor is

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.490 
is um it is gum arabic and watercolor is
known<00:00:37.350> watercolor<00:00:38.190> never<00:00:38.520> gets<00:00:38.790> opaque<00:00:39.500> it's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
known watercolor never gets opaque it's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.470 
known watercolor never gets opaque it's
never<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> completely<00:00:41.730> cover<00:00:42.090> anything

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
never going to completely cover anything

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.520 
never going to completely cover anything
up<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.600> watercolor<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.840> really<00:00:46.260> about

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
up and so watercolor is really about

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.209 
up and so watercolor is really about
playing<00:00:46.920> around<00:00:47.300> with<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:49.200> water<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
playing around with the water in the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.260 
playing around with the water in the
color<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:52.489> another<00:00:53.489> thing<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.000> water

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
color and another thing that water

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.869 
color and another thing that water
colors<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.980> I'm<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.550> how<00:00:56.699> this

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
colors do and I'm going to see how this

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.599 
colors do and I'm going to see how this
one<00:00:57.090> works

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.620 

water<00:01:00.090> colors<00:01:00.570> also<00:01:01.670> can<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:04.250> granular<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:06.570> I'm

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
water colors also can be granular so I'm

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.160 
water colors also can be granular so I'm
going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.840> put<00:01:07.080> down<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.619> big<00:01:08.040> part<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.400> this

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
going to put down a big part of this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.219 
going to put down a big part of this
they<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.500> sedimentary<00:01:11.280> colors<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.229> that

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
they can be sedimentary colors so that

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.380 
they can be sedimentary colors so that
you<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.439> kind<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.830> start<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.390> separating

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
you can kind of start to see separating

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.670 
you can kind of start to see separating
in<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:20.000> drop<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> thing<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.140> water<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.530> here

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
in here drop a thing of water in here

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
in here drop a thing of water in here
see<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.970> about<00:01:24.119> water

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
see this is what I like about water

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.850 
see this is what I like about water
color<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.900> drop<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> water<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
color you drop in the water and you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.020 
color you drop in the water and you
start<00:01:26.189> moving<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.790> pigment<00:01:27.180> around<00:01:29.030> can't

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
start moving the pigment around can't

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.149 
start moving the pigment around can't
really<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.420> with<00:01:30.600> acrylic<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.950> do

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
really do that with acrylic it if you do

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.649 
really do that with acrylic it if you do
that<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.490> acrylic<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.119> water<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> down

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
that with acrylic if you water it down

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.810 
that with acrylic if you water it down
too<00:01:33.840> much<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.229> ruin<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> vehicle<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
too much you ruin the vehicle and it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.840 
too much you ruin the vehicle and it
isn't<00:01:36.360> going<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.810> stick<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.200> canvas<00:01:37.850> but

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
isn't going to stick to your canvas but

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
isn't going to stick to your canvas but
watercolor<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.509> made<00:01:39.869> for<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.170> sort<00:01:40.380> of

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
watercolor is made for this sort of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.319 
watercolor is made for this sort of
thing<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:40.950> made<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.520> making<00:01:41.850> edges<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
thing and it's made for making edges and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.590 
thing and it's made for making edges and
it's<00:01:42.479> made<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.140> sort<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.470> sedimentation

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
it's made for this sort of sedimentation

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.639 
it's made for this sort of sedimentation
which<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:45.869> effect<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.229> don't<00:01:46.470> get

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
which is an effect you don't get

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.510 
which is an effect you don't get
anywhere<00:01:47.070> else<00:01:48.409> you<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.979> an<00:01:50.100> opaque

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
anywhere else you can get an opaque

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.460 
anywhere else you can get an opaque
watercolor<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.689> called<00:01:51.990> wash<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:55.110> goes

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
watercolor it is called wash and it goes

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.010 
watercolor it is called wash and it goes
on<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.189> lot<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.579> watercolor<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.509> mean<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
on it's a lot like watercolor I mean it

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
on it's a lot like watercolor I mean it
it's<00:01:58.469> not<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.310> plastic<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.030> going

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
it's not going to be plastic it's going

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.120 
it's not going to be plastic it's going
to<00:02:00.390> dry<00:02:00.659> very<00:02:00.930> flat<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.619> not<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.040> have

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
to dry very flat it's not going to have

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.660 
to dry very flat it's not going to have
a<00:02:02.159> sheen<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.170> basically<00:02:04.770> opaque<00:02:05.399> and

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
a sheen but it is basically opaque and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.789 
a sheen but it is basically opaque and
if<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.939> want<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.240> know<00:02:06.329> pass<00:02:06.899> 'ti<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.710> you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
if you want to know pass 'ti but you

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.229 
if you want to know pass 'ti but you
want<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> play<00:02:08.399> around<00:02:08.550> with<00:02:08.849> some<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.119> these

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
want to play around with some of these

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.750 
want to play around with some of these
water<00:02:09.599> issues<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:11.039> do<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:11.459> gloss

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
water issues you can do it with gloss

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.670 
water issues you can do it with gloss
you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.150> certainly<00:02:12.390> water<00:02:12.810> down<00:02:13.080> gouache<00:02:13.410> and
