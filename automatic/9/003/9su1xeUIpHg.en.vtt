00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
before this game and I think when they

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.900 
before this game and I think when they
came<00:00:45.090> out<00:00:45.300> too<00:00:45.539> bad<00:00:46.520> that<00:00:47.520> they<00:00:47.670> were<00:00:47.760> no

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910

planning<00:00:48.300> there<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.870> no<00:00:49.110> planning<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.680> looked

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
planning there was no planning it looked

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.100 
planning there was no planning it looked
like<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> especially<00:00:50.700> when<00:00:51.329> miss<00:00:51.719> Paula

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
like it and especially when miss Paula

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.529 
like it and especially when miss Paula
came<00:00:52.320> out<00:00:52.530> too<00:00:52.710> bad<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.070> number<00:00:53.340> five<00:00:53.610> he<00:00:54.329> got

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539

10<00:00:54.870> runs<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.440> 32<00:00:56.100> deliveries<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.879> obviously

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
10 runs of 32 deliveries so obviously

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.479 
10 runs of 32 deliveries so obviously
the<00:00:57.480> run<00:00:57.660> rates<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.170> creeping<00:00:58.469> up<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.920> then

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489

that<00:01:06.090> why<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:07.590> never<00:01:07.890> took<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.280> batting<00:01:08.549> power

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that why they never took a batting power

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.980 
that why they never took a batting power
play<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> end<00:01:09.360> India<00:01:09.720> played

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
play but in the end India played

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
play but in the end India played
incredible<00:01:10.530> cricket<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.250> was<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> dodgy<00:01:11.939> wicked
