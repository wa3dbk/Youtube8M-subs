products<00:03:29.140> so<00:03:29.549> nothing<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.700> worry<00:03:30.879> about<00:03:32.280> then

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
products so nothing to worry about then

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.670

I<00:03:33.310> also<00:03:33.640> have<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> nice<00:03:34.390> cooling<00:03:34.720> sensation<00:03:35.080> I

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
I also have a nice cooling sensation I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.530 
I also have a nice cooling sensation I
could<00:03:38.680> say<00:03:41.099> it's<00:03:42.099> actually<00:03:42.700> cooling<00:03:43.269> more

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
could say it's actually cooling more

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:53.780 
could say it's actually cooling more
than<00:03:43.750> tingling<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:44.730> nothing<00:03:45.730> to<00:03:45.879> worry<00:03:46.090> about

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
so after applying for ten to twenty

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.280 
so after applying for ten to twenty
minutes<00:03:57.730> depends<00:03:58.480> on<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.630> personal<00:03:59.080> preference

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290
