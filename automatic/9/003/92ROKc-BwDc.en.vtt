00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:03.619 

we're<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> look<00:00:02.730> at<00:00:02.939> Kepler's<00:00:03.360> three

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
we're going to look at Kepler's three

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.079 
we're going to look at Kepler's three
laws<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.380> first<00:00:04.589> law<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.220> a<00:00:05.339> statement<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.910> how

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
laws the first law is a statement of how

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.600 
laws the first law is a statement of how
the<00:00:06.150> planets<00:00:06.690> move<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.589> planets<00:00:08.010> move<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.460> an

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
the planets move the planets move in an

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.000 
the planets move the planets move in an
elliptical<00:00:08.880> orbit<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:10.050> Sun<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.440> at<00:00:10.620> one<00:00:10.650> focus

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
elliptical orbit the Sun is at one focus

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.640 
elliptical orbit the Sun is at one focus
of<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.400> ellipse<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> path<00:00:12.690> any<00:00:13.080> planet

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
of the ellipse so the path any planet

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.860 
of the ellipse so the path any planet
takes<00:00:13.889> around<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.400> Sun<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.450> shape<00:00:15.690> of

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
takes around the Sun is in the shape of

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.099 
takes around the Sun is in the shape of
an<00:00:15.960> ellipse<00:00:16.080> an<00:00:16.529> ellipse<00:00:17.369> has<00:00:17.550> two<00:00:17.940> foci<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
an ellipse an ellipse has two foci the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.910 
an ellipse an ellipse has two foci the
Sun<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.770> at<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.070> foci<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.600> works<00:00:21.990> for<00:00:22.680> any

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
Sun is at one foci this works for any

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.670 
Sun is at one foci this works for any
system<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.939> if<00:00:24.090> an<00:00:24.750> object<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.170> going<00:00:25.439> around

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
system so if an object is going around

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.980 
system so if an object is going around
the<00:00:25.830> Earth<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.599> object<00:00:27.599> will<00:00:27.750> take<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the Earth the object will take a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.040 
the Earth the object will take a
elliptical<00:00:28.769> pattern<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:30.510> will<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.660> two

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
elliptical pattern and there will be two

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
elliptical pattern and there will be two
foci<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.189> lips<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.300> earth<00:00:33.480> would

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
foci for that lips and the earth would

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.260 
foci for that lips and the earth would
be<00:00:33.960> at<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.380> those<00:00:34.579> so<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.820> first<00:00:36.000> law<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
be at one of those so the first law is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.720 
be at one of those so the first law is
just<00:00:36.899> basically<00:00:37.380> saying<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.160> planets<00:00:38.520> don't

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
just basically saying the planets don't

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.100 
just basically saying the planets don't
go<00:00:38.850> around<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> circle<00:00:39.300> which<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.870> what

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
go around in a circle which is what

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.660 
go around in a circle which is what
everybody<00:00:40.469> believed<00:00:40.770> at<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.950> time<00:00:41.040> let's

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
everybody believed at the time let's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.299 
everybody believed at the time let's
look<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.969> second<00:00:42.329> law<00:00:42.890> Kepler's<00:00:43.890> second

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
look at the second law Kepler's second

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.170 
look at the second law Kepler's second
law<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.700> an<00:00:44.910> observation<00:00:45.690> he<00:00:46.680> noticed<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
law is an observation he noticed that a

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
law is an observation he noticed that a
straight<00:00:48.809> line<00:00:49.050> joining<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> Sun<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
straight line joining the Sun and a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.240 
straight line joining the Sun and a
planet<00:00:51.059> sweeps<00:00:51.600> out<00:00:51.750> equal<00:00:51.930> areas<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.770> equal

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
planet sweeps out equal areas in equal

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.240 
planet sweeps out equal areas in equal
intervals<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.360> time<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.500> means<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.980> if

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
intervals of time what that means is if

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.189 
intervals of time what that means is if
it<00:00:56.460> took<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.879> month<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> earth<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.079> go

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it took one month for the earth to go

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.010 
it took one month for the earth to go
from<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.250> its<00:00:59.370> orbit<00:00:59.899> it<00:01:00.899> would

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
from here to here in its orbit it would

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.720 
from here to here in its orbit it would
take<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.469> month<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> earth<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.399> go<00:01:02.520> from

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
take one month for the earth to go from

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.030 
take one month for the earth to go from
here<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.629> his<00:01:03.750> orbit<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.379> he<00:01:04.769> notice

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
here to here in his orbit and he notice

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.969 
here to here in his orbit and he notice
that<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.400> area<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.869> exactly<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.530> same<00:01:07.740> as

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that this area was exactly the same as

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.969 
that this area was exactly the same as
this<00:01:08.250> area<00:01:08.729> which<00:01:09.720> meant<00:01:10.020> since<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.740> line

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
this area which meant since this line

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.520 
this area which meant since this line
was<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.340> much<00:01:11.490> longer<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.840> didn't<00:01:13.439> have

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
was so much longer that this didn't have

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
was so much longer that this didn't have
to<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.770> quite<00:01:13.979> as<00:01:14.010> long<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> areas<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.330> be

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
to be quite as long for the areas to be

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.020 
to be quite as long for the areas to be
equal<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.259> as<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> result<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.400> planet<00:01:17.729> must<00:01:17.850> be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
equal so as a result the planet must be

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.690 
equal so as a result the planet must be
going<00:01:18.330> slowly<00:01:18.810> here<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.770> quite<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> bit<00:01:20.250> faster

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
going slowly here but quite a bit faster

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.600 
going slowly here but quite a bit faster
there<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.990> law<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.439> about<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> area's

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
there so the law is about the area's

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
there so the law is about the area's
being<00:01:23.820> equal<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.509> an<00:01:24.600> equal<00:01:24.869> period<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.200> time

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
being equal for an equal period of time

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.340 
being equal for an equal period of time
but<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.640> understanding<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.689> what

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
but the the understanding is that what

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.850 
but the the understanding is that what
it<00:01:28.680> means<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.840> planet<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.380> speeding

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it means is that the planet is speeding

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.800 
it means is that the planet is speeding
up<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.130> slowing<00:01:32.369> down<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:33.119> its<00:01:33.270> orbit<00:01:33.659> in

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
up and slowing down in its orbit in

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.600 
up and slowing down in its orbit in
order<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.409> happen<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.950> he<00:01:35.400> didn't

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
order for this to happen and he didn't

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.340 
order for this to happen and he didn't
understand<00:01:36.030> why<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.689> but<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
understand why this was but the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.770 
understand why this was but the
important<00:01:37.740> thing<00:01:37.950> was<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.490> showed<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.299> there

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
important thing was it showed that there

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
important thing was it showed that there
is<00:01:39.930> some<00:01:40.140> kind<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.439> relationship<00:01:41.040> here<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
is some kind of relationship here of the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.780 
is some kind of relationship here of the
planets<00:01:42.630> orbit<00:01:43.110> around<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.860> Sun<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.340> so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
planets orbit around the Sun and so

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.370 
planets orbit around the Sun and so
there<00:01:44.970> must<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.390> mathematical

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
there must be some mathematical

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.929 
there must be some mathematical
should<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.770> someone<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.219> figure<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.549> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
should that someone will figure out and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.380 
should that someone will figure out and
that<00:01:48.180> someone<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:48.719> Newton<00:01:50.149> Kepler's<00:01:51.149> third

the radius is going to change so we use

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.940

meters cubed per second squared so any

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
system just like the Sun you could say

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.210 
system just like the Sun you could say
controls<00:02:57.329> our<00:02:57.540> solar<00:02:57.810> system<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.709> we<00:02:58.859> have<00:02:58.980> one

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
controls our solar system so we have one

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.849 
controls our solar system so we have one
constant<00:02:59.819> for<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.120> if<00:03:00.359> I<00:03:00.870> put<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.170> earth<00:03:01.319> here

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
and I have the moon way around the earth

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.050 
and I have the moon way around the earth
or<00:03:03.870> any<00:03:04.170> satellite<00:03:04.739> it<00:03:05.010> must<00:03:05.400> also<00:03:05.639> follow

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
or any satellite it must also follow

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.449 
or any satellite it must also follow
this<00:03:06.329> law<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.440> constant<00:03:08.280> will<00:03:08.430> be

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
this law but the constant will be

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.009 
this law but the constant will be
different<00:03:08.970> because<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.389> earth<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:09.930> the

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
different because the earth is at the

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.020 
different because the earth is at the
center<00:03:10.319> it'll<00:03:10.709> be<00:03:10.799> a<00:03:10.829> constant<00:03:11.190> based<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.850> that

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
center it'll be a constant based on that

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.550 
center it'll be a constant based on that
system<00:03:12.359> and<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:13.019> would<00:03:13.109> be<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> different

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.710 
system and it would be a different
number<00:03:13.799> just<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:14.819> if<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.120> had<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.359> planet

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
number just like if I had the planet

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.569 
number just like if I had the planet
Jupiter<00:03:16.200> objects<00:03:17.010> orbiting<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.549> planet

Jupiter objects orbiting the planet

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.370 
Jupiter objects orbiting the planet
Jupiter<00:03:18.209> if<00:03:18.269> we<00:03:18.329> put<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.510> satellite<00:03:18.780> or<00:03:19.139> there's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
Jupiter if we put a satellite or there's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.349 
Jupiter if we put a satellite or there's
a<00:03:19.440> moon<00:03:19.620> around<00:03:19.680> Jupiter<00:03:19.940> then<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.180> would

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
a moon around Jupiter then it would

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.720 
a moon around Jupiter then it would
follow<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.109> law<00:03:22.410> but<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:23.190> would<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.519> a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
follow this law but it would be a

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.600 
follow this law but it would be a
different<00:03:24.000> time
