00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.899 
just looking at the gameplay alone it
we've<00:01:48.810> gotten<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.409> 9s<00:01:50.159> across<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> boards

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
we've gotten like 9s across the boards

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.179 
we've gotten like 9s across the boards
but<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.659> still<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> really<00:01:52.470> good<00:01:52.619> score<00:01:52.950> for

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
but that's still a really good score for

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.060 
but that's still a really good score for
our<00:01:53.610> Xenoblade<00:01:54.030> Chronicles<00:01:54.060> X<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:55.770> rest<00:01:55.950> of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
our Xenoblade Chronicles X the rest of

our Xenoblade Chronicles X the rest of
the<00:01:56.130> games<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.820> list<00:01:57.140> have<00:01:58.140> similar<00:01:58.890> to

the games on this list have similar to
some<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.259> think<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> closest<00:02:02.250> one

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
some of them I think the closest one

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.039 
some of them I think the closest one
that<00:02:02.759> has<00:02:02.969> similar<00:02:03.299> reviews<00:02:03.719> as<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.960> know

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
has nine eight eight and nine so it's

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.190 
has nine eight eight and nine so it's
the<00:02:11.039> same<00:02:11.220> thing<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.489> Xenoblade<00:02:12.450> Chronicles
