00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.960
 the result is the existence of roles not 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.910
 commands more than anything else 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.449
 depends on the ability to turn one 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.040

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.250
 subaru believe that or close relationship 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.500

 the maintenance of the rally team both 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.800
 highly efficient all-wheel drive vehicles 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.109
 but the differences between the sports coupe and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.109

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.860
 just jerk off she controls 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.830

 him optimized torque 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.690
 acceleration is not the maximum 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.200
 speed i.e. jet thrust 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.270
 available at any time and here is just 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.890
 saving time lied need twisting

 you press on the gas and you get short 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.709
 acceleration when required 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.709
 [music] 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.770
 you also see semi automatic 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.510
 gearbox there if at 100 thousand 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.270
 euro which is capable of switching 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.500
 transmission and ten milliseconds 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.599
 can add racing suspension 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.910
 reduced tire weight 700 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.980
 euro apiece and pour out the machine which 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.319
 held on asphalt and as glued and 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.070
 runs this track 8 seconds faster 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.800
 road cars 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.600
 [applause] 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:40.100
 [music] 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:42.110
 and of course she is capable of doing so 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.839
 so 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.839
 [applause] 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.490
 the desire to extract the maximum 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.200
 efficiency literally from each 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.250
 component these guys will always be up 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.620
 the last day 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:04:07.460
 hours and minutes I set up the technique before 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:09.850
 each stage of the rally otherwise wins 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.850
