00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.040

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.290
 of the field of the court the only thing that 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.140
 I had great admiration for the rest 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.030
 Miguel Marin for none because I have 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.460
 likes for some and I liked to play 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.350
 ronaldo liked me like messi 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.510
 without naming many players of the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.550
 Mexican soccer too but so a 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.890
 idolize someone the miguel marín mass 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.900
 after an outside is the pleasure to see the 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 football is going to be a good move a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.250
 game player sees that his cities 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.949
 premiere that football idea you like and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.710
 great technicians for Brazil 2014 is 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.200
 pekerman is tabares is vicente del 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.670
 forest what football idea do you like 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.550
 and to read it mb ​​and present is a type 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.860
 extraordinary we arrived with him I have left 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.840
 Of course he must work very well and his 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.640
 better job is to amalgamate so much 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.100
 figure and have her all happy and all 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.070
 delivered to him and that's obviously something 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.530
 I did not want to always have it 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.270
 is felipe scolari world champion 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.150
 with an assistant as for the champion of 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.739
 world is using the end that also a 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.510
 extraordinary technical as you say 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.729
 Pekerman was already champion with his with the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.909
 minor selections I think today what 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.430
 more important is that the teams 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.860
 reflect on the field what is being worked 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.060
 and of course after achieving the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.820
 objective the boys have to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.200
 drag the success of the technician does not 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.180
 it was to be out of the national team 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.759
 mexicana of the two sides of the coin 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.830
 on the one hand beating Brazil in 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.479
 london 2012 and then falling into the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.119
 Confederations Cup already in territory 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.100
 carioca that has learned from that 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.470
 Miguel Herrera learned 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.710
 being outside exactly like 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.410
 amateur I loved the brasil that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.080
 lost against the confederations I 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.520
 loved the mexico he lost against 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.530
 bashir in the confederations sorry 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.119
 because I loved it and although 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.680
 lost because he had a driving had 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.509
 a determination because he played well at 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.580
 football because the 2-0 was achieved until the 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.200
 minute 92 of the second time because the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.290
 1-0 was always constant and told me it was 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.550
 dangerous in mexico played ran was it was 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.370
 a difficult team 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.070
 It took a lot of work for Brazil to be 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.080
 can win there is confidence if that 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.820
 selection that he lost in london there is a 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.550
 70 80 percent of the selection of 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.110
 Scolari and who won in London 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.360
 that there are 60 percent of the kids 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.690
 then why not because we say 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.340
 that he reiterated to have in mind of that 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.250
 that was made at that time for 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.380
 get to be a tough opponent for it 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.330
 we are going to enter a second stage of the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.920
 interview Miguel had a word and I 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.670
 you answer the first thing that comes to you 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.970
 mind brazil-2014 a dream glass of the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.550
 world a dream come true selection 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.520
 mexicana the most proud thing that 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.569
 can have a Mexican states 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.489
 united-1994 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:49.140
 a bitterness for my soccer career 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:52.580
 neymar a good player the goal 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:58.020
 I believe that the goals of Mexico Tequila 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.940
 the national drink garotas said what 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.970
 we went to many and very handsome all 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.450
 if it is clear we were not mounted more 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.569
 can loins and be already merit we are not going to 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.849
 change the penalties could already 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.100
 some are also players samuel 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.500
 eto'o 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.650
 an extraordinary guy a guy there is that 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.080
 to be aware of carlos salcido a 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.270
 player who has come every day as the 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.710
 good wines showing their quality and 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.800
 Although his age is advancing 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.650
 always always well rafael marquez and 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.610
 good to say we compare it with a wine 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.130
 it will be a petrus of I do not know of 58 of 56 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.080
 They are the strongest wines in the world 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.230
 and more expensive because every day I see it with 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.700
 much more the areas green white and red 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.340
 the most important colors for 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.760
 any mexican cielito lindo is the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.540
 song that they have done as 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.069

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.629
 common that current what will be the 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.099
 Football proposal by Miguel Herrera 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.260
 for the balanced team world 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.269
