00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.059
 look at the requirement is to get to the room at 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.460
 quarterfinals is the famous fifth 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.220
 match 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.740
 I think that I know little is 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.780
 I've always said it and with that 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.830
 transcend and masters because nobody has already 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.200
 accomplished 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.930
 It was achieved when there were fewer teams 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.100
 mexico 70 and in mexico-86 local 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.160
 very important would be to reach that fifth 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.710
 party but the importance for soft 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.779
 associate to the end is not like that would be something 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.730
 real historical to be in this 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.430
 goes with the selection headache 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.930
 to choose those 23 because practically 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.010
 in all areas are a player or 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.150
 voice and plenty left over because the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.489
 number of players that you have to go 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.879
 in each zone at the end you do a count 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:52.239
 26 27 players and tomÃ¡s can carry 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.480
 23 then I do up to 28 we have to 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.000
 suddenly seen there in the final list 23 and 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.590
 20 I'm not going to name forms or go to 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.370
 bring the extra player to train and 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.920
 then at the end cut I prefer it 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.630
 before time make that decision and that 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.590
 those who want to convince them that they are 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.140
 are the 23 chosen to enter 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.869
 the name of the history books 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.950
 of Mexican soccer with big letters 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.710
 Much has been said about the best player 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.840
 of the state if it's not I think it has 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.700
 that be the fastest cut 4 and dm and 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.610
 more at a time like one of mine 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.289
 I do not have a lot of work time 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.270
 times have been shortened enough for 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.610
 to be able to work and make it clear 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.439
 this is what we want then if 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.390
 it is important to bring players that are 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.369
 they adapt quickly but they even do well 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.960
 things and nothing but lasting from 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.000
 system and then be a disaster in 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.439
 the court does not know we know that it 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.750
 adapt to what we intend 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.819
 forgiveness things are sent very those 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.789
 important and the mentality here is 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.950
 As I told you, it uses everything except 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.000
 lower your head and stop fighting the one 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.890
 it does it 's fried with me it does not go and it's not 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.380
 part of my team then I think that 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.909
 those guys have understood why 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.360
 I said we can go out on a court 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.420
 defeated but not defeated we are losing 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.849
 a match but we can not lose it 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.500
 attitude and determination and if you go out 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.630
 to kill on the court and the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.760
 good result as you are given by the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.670
 circumstance such as 2006 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.019
 2000 pardon in 2006 in germany that 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.150
 Argentina wins with a goal 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.739
 maxi communication as it does not come up with the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.299
 head up because you gave everything for 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.739
 you were better than the rival in a 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.480
 circumstance of those let you eliminate 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.830
 others 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.120
 you have to put the boys with is 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.239
 electrical the accuracy and with that 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.239
 mentality
