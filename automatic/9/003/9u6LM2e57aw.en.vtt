 from manufacturers he was very 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.330
 interesting tandem 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.080
 well made as a car model 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.230

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:44.850
 looks well recognizable 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.010
 This model has a separate machine. 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.360
 Headlights 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.149

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.240
 but done neatly and well 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.700
 perceived paint applied license 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.670
 marks car moldings machine has 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.900

 wipers they made a separate piece 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.130

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:32.100

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.530
 v6 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.439
 all-wheel drive version has a hitch 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.290
 to fasten the trailer and it's made 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.630
 very good he is small because 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.729
 on many 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.090
 cheap models it is not made to scale 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.799
 She looks good to this model. 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.040
 you can even put the model without a trailer 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.869
 and it will look good 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.460
 rifle wheels 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.450
 there is a hole in the middle and has 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.489
 icon disk shod in rubber tire 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.489
 the model has a light gray interior 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.430
 it is not painted but well detailed 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.810
 and if you wish, you can color 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.040
 your model will immediately change well I'm on 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.610
 his model decided to leave it in such 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.610
 top view there is a glass hatch 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.810
 pretty simple bottom and unfortunately 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.940
 bottom 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.170
 in my opinion not quite like the bottom 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.440
 all-wheel drive car because 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.830
 there is no propeller shaft on the back 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.370
 bridge 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.430
 but no less for the price for which 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.630
 Goes this model it is made on a very 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.549
 Good level I bought a model with 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.000
 trailer for 6 euros that is, you can do it yourself 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:07.860
 see the price is really small 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.470
 and consider a trailer this trailer has 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.530
 real prototype 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:20.609
 as i said this is a swedish trailer 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.870
 power 730 trailer itself is made of plastic 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.209
 and frame 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.930
 which is painted silver she 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:32.810
 made of metal paint applied and 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:38.730
 various pictures trailer name 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.980
 strips there is a small wheel that 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.390
 trailer 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.560
 stood when he was not fixed on 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.140
 there is a car on top you choke 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.820
 he made wear detail antennas and more 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.609
 whether one chock and 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.220
 the cabin of this trailer is very good 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:00.420
 worked I do not know if you can 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.209
 look through the camera he is completely 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.190
 corresponds to the prototype on the internet i 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:12.650
 found pictures of a real trailer 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:16.790
 wheelhouse and there absolutely 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.790
 identically located 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.160
 various items like a trailer and if 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.199
 paint it 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.449
 it is made of black plastic then much 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:40.180
 the model will change and it will be better 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:44.470
 look like this is a tandem written 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.820
 model name trailer trailer also has 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.520
 very well-developed wheel 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.370
 discs there is a hole disc shod in 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.419
 rubber tire 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:58.810
 Here is such a wonderful model and who 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:05.010
 collects caravans from the producer han 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:07.290
 goal he has about five different 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.070
 caravan trailer with 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:15.130
 different cars for example with 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.380
 I also saw a trailer model audi q7 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.310
 porsche cayenne but I liked it better 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.870
 volkswagen passat because somehow I 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.990
 I think that porsche cayenne pulling 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.990
 trailer doesn't look good 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.669
 but in no case pay attention to 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.990
 manufacturer of a good model for 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:37.750
 affordable price and it was a review of the model 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.700
 Sexy Posad and Trailer Trailer 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.240
