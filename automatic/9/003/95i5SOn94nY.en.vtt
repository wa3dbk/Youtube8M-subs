find<00:04:53.789> the<00:04:54.030> Blue<00:04:54.300> sink<00:04:54.599> STX<00:04:57.860> there<00:04:58.860> we<00:04:58.949> go<00:04:59.099> so

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
find the Blue sink STX there we go so

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.129 
find the Blue sink STX there we go so
once<00:04:59.520> it's<00:04:59.699> found<00:04:59.910> just<00:05:00.330> click<00:05:00.569> on<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:00.900> pair

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.279 

and<00:05:07.139> once<00:05:07.440> it's<00:05:07.620> paired<00:05:07.919> this<00:05:08.190> will<00:05:08.430> just<00:05:08.789> be

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
and once it's paired this will just be
