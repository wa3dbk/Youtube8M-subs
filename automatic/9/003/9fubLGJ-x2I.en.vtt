to show you what i'm using for weight
and<00:00:13.190> my<00:00:14.190> whole<00:00:14.370> rating<00:00:14.700> system<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.450> i<00:00:15.480> use

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
and my whole rating system that i use

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.050 
and my whole rating system that i use
it's<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.320> tangle<00:00:16.830> free<00:00:16.859> system<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.460> i<00:00:17.820> just

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
it's a tangle free system that i just

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.710 
it's a tangle free system that i just
made<00:00:18.480> myself<00:00:19.039> saw<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> couple<00:00:20.160> different

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
made myself saw a couple different

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.700 
made myself saw a couple different
systems<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.930> i<00:00:22.020> made<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.990> what<00:00:24.990> fits<00:00:25.289> best<00:00:25.410> for

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
systems and i made it what fits best for

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.310 
systems and i made it what fits best for
me<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:27.949> what<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> do<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.609> i<00:00:29.849> use<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.570> cord

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
me so what I do is I i use this cord

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.799 
me so what I do is I i use this cord
from<00:00:32.480> bass<00:00:33.480> pro<00:00:33.510> shops<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.590> PVC<00:00:34.920> cord<00:00:35.809> and

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
from bass pro shops this PVC cord and

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.799 
from bass pro shops this PVC cord and
then<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.320> crimp<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:38.399> small<00:00:39.030> homemade<00:00:39.600> wait

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
then I just crimp a small homemade wait

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.200 
then I just crimp a small homemade wait
I<00:00:40.020> make<00:00:40.200> these<00:00:40.379> weights<00:00:40.620> these<00:00:40.890> are<00:00:41.210> three

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
I make these weights these are three

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.760 
I make these weights these are three
point<00:00:42.780> seven<00:00:43.530> five<00:00:43.710> ounces<00:00:45.260> I'll<00:00:46.260> probably

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
point seven five ounces I'll probably

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.670 
point seven five ounces I'll probably
start<00:00:47.100> selling<00:00:47.520> them<00:00:47.550> soon<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.690> size

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
start selling them soon but size

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.650 
start selling them soon but size
comparison<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> redhead<00:00:51.000> ones<00:00:51.329> these<00:00:51.600> are

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
comparison to the redhead ones these are

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.830 
comparison to the redhead ones these are
their<00:00:52.649> eight<00:00:52.920> ounce<00:00:53.129> lead<00:00:53.520> weights<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.149> then

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
their eight ounce lead weights and then

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.689 
their eight ounce lead weights and then
these<00:00:54.989> are<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.430> 3.4<00:00:56.430> ounce<00:00:58.430> weights<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.640> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
these are the 3.4 ounce weights that I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.640 
these are the 3.4 ounce weights that I
use<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:01.469> video<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.899> in<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.080> pretty

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
use a I have video of them in a pretty

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.350 
use a I have video of them in a pretty
fast<00:01:04.860> flowing<00:01:05.189> stream<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:05.880> hold<00:01:06.060> well

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
fast flowing stream and they hold well

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:17.600 
fast flowing stream and they hold well
so<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:07.110> pretty<00:01:07.290> happy<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.650> them<00:01:07.860> so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.460 

so<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.640> attached<00:01:19.000> it<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.360> ground<00:01:19.570> four<00:01:20.440> feet

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
so I attached it to the ground four feet

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.430 
so I attached it to the ground four feet
of<00:01:20.909> cord<00:01:21.909> crimp<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.690> other<00:01:22.870> end<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:23.260> that<00:01:23.380> I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
of cord crimp the other end so that I

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.070 
of cord crimp the other end so that I
can<00:01:23.560> attach<00:01:24.100> to<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.370> carabiner<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:24.970> then<00:01:25.690> I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
can attach to a carabiner and then I

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.930 
can attach to a carabiner and then I
just<00:01:26.500> bought<00:01:26.740> these<00:01:27.780> these<00:01:28.780> are<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:30.640> swivel

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.690 
just bought these these are just swivel
hooks<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:31.479> people<00:01:31.840> use<00:01:31.960> for<00:01:32.200> fishing<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700
