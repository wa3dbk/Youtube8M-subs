to figure out just by hearing it and so

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.579 
to figure out just by hearing it and so
I<00:00:49.880> wanted<00:00:50.090> to<00:00:50.180> do<00:00:50.270> is<00:00:50.420> play<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:50.989> very<00:00:51.320> simple

groove play it and then then I will
break<00:00:55.790> it<00:00:55.940> down<00:00:56.089> I<00:00:56.480> will<00:00:57.050> break<00:00:57.170> down<00:00:57.230> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
break it down I will break down the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.259 
break it down I will break down the
sticking<00:00:57.800> I'll<00:00:57.920> play<00:00:58.070> it<00:00:58.160> really<00:00:58.280> slow<00:00:58.550> so

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
sticking I'll play it really slow so

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.439 
sticking I'll play it really slow so
then<00:00:59.570> you<00:01:00.140> guys<00:01:00.290> can<00:01:01.100> learn<00:01:01.519> how<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.790> push<00:01:02.239> down

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
then you guys can learn how to push down

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.390 
then you guys can learn how to push down
basically<00:01:03.050> all<00:01:03.830> right<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.040> here's<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.250> simple

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
basically all right so here's a simple

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:24.260 
basically all right so here's a simple
groove<00:01:04.670> with<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.180> blood<00:01:05.449> in<00:01:05.659> it<00:01:05.840> ready

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.539 

here<00:01:25.680> why<00:01:26.680> it's<00:01:26.799> called<00:01:27.010> the<00:01:27.130> blush<00:01:27.310> dose

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
here why it's called the blush dose

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.130 
here why it's called the blush dose
because<00:01:27.760> it<00:01:28.000> sounds<00:01:28.270> like<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.540> know<00:01:28.630> someone

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
because it sounds like you know someone

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.330 
because it sounds like you know someone
saying<00:01:29.320> pledge<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.710> blush<00:01:29.920> stuff<00:01:30.130> when

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
saying pledge the blush stuff when

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.649 
saying pledge the blush stuff when
they're<00:01:30.520> playing<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.430> first<00:01:33.700> step<00:01:33.940> to

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
they're playing the first step to

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.249 
they're playing the first step to
learning<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:35.080> ballista<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.740> playing<00:01:37.259> Swiss

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
learning the ballista is playing Swiss

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.380 
learning the ballista is playing Swiss
flam's<00:01:38.619> which<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.640> a<00:01:40.290> flam<00:01:41.290> right<00:01:42.220> left<00:01:42.520> flam

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
flam's which is a flam right left flam

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.399 
flam's which is a flam right left flam
right<00:01:44.290> left<00:01:45.180> slowly<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.540> on<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.899> flam<00:01:47.170> the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
right left slowly and on the flam the

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.020 
right left slowly and on the flam the
first<00:01:47.619> hand<00:01:47.860> comes<00:01:48.100> down<00:01:48.159> first<00:01:48.580> right<00:01:48.880> so

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
first hand comes down first right so

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.080 
first hand comes down first right so
here's<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.270> plan<00:01:50.670> first<00:01:51.670> hand<00:01:51.850> comes<00:01:52.030> down

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
here's the plan first hand comes down

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.249 
here's the plan first hand comes down
the<00:01:52.570> right<00:01:52.750> hand<00:01:52.780> comes<00:01:53.140> down<00:01:53.200> first<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:55.060> then

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the right hand comes down first and then

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.870 
the right hand comes down first and then
just<00:01:56.259> play<00:01:56.410> right<00:01:56.679> left<00:01:56.979> on<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.429> snare<00:01:57.700> so

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
just play right left on the snare so

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:27.850 
just play right left on the snare so
it's<00:01:58.000> flam<00:01:58.210> right<00:01:59.020> left<00:01:59.320> like<00:01:59.649> this

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.950 

then<00:02:28.860> what<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.190> have<00:02:29.220> that<00:02:29.460> happening<00:02:29.960> that

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
then what you have that happening that

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.520 
then what you have that happening that
right<00:02:31.230> hand<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.370> sanera<00:02:32.730> after<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.240> flam

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
right hand on the sanera after the flam

00:02:33.530 --> 00:03:30.490 
right hand on the sanera after the flam
double<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.680> okay<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.030> instead<00:02:36.300> of

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.059 

so<00:03:31.670> that's<00:03:32.670> basically<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:34.110> can<00:03:34.530> reverse

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
so that's basically it you can reverse

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.250 
so that's basically it you can reverse
the<00:03:35.310> sticking<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:36.390> for<00:03:36.629> every<00:03:36.870> right<00:03:37.050> it's

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
the sticking so for every right it's

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.780 
the sticking so for every right it's
left<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.709> for<00:03:37.800> every<00:03:37.980> left<00:03:38.190> that's<00:03:38.340> right<00:03:38.550> so

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
left and for every left that's right so

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.000 
left and for every left that's right so
at<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.030> point<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.360> flam<00:03:39.599> would<00:03:39.840> be<00:03:40.019> you<00:03:40.890> know

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
at that point the flam would be you know

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.650 
at that point the flam would be you know
left<00:03:41.400> hand<00:03:41.580> coming<00:03:41.790> down<00:03:42.000> first<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.599> then

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
left hand coming down first and then

00:03:42.660 --> 00:04:10.339 
left hand coming down first and then
left<00:03:43.470> right<00:03:43.769> like<00:03:44.340> that<00:04:08.180> in<00:04:09.180> front<00:04:09.599> of<00:04:09.720> it<00:04:10.170> so

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
left right like that in front of it so

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.199 
left right like that in front of it so
your<00:04:10.680> flaming<00:04:11.099> twice<00:04:11.400> before<00:04:11.670> playing<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
your flaming twice before playing the

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.110 
your flaming twice before playing the
phrase<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.870> it's<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.230> instead<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:14.120> instead

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
phrase so it's like instead of instead

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:34.870 
phrase so it's like instead of instead
of<00:04:15.180> blushed<00:04:15.480> it's<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:15.870> blah<00:04:16.109> blah<00:04:16.320> shtick

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.910 

the<00:04:35.880> two<00:04:36.060> different<00:04:36.420> ways<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.260> think<00:04:37.320> that

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
the two different ways that I think that

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.620 
the two different ways that I think that
it's<00:04:38.040> commonly<00:04:38.610> played<00:04:38.820> is<00:04:39.000> by<00:04:39.120> playing<00:04:39.330> right

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
it's commonly played is by playing right

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:59.200 
it's commonly played is by playing right
on<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:40.020> corner<00:04:40.230> no<00:04:40.470> right<00:04:40.980> so<00:04:41.190> that's

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.130 

reference<00:05:00.210> which<00:05:00.360> is<00:05:00.480> like<00:05:00.660> four<00:05:00.900> over<00:05:01.110> three

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
reference which is like four over three
