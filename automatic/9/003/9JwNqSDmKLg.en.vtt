this<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> way<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.200> now<00:03:43.320> Wall<00:03:43.590> Street<00:03:43.980> can

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
this is a way that now Wall Street can

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.650 
this is a way that now Wall Street can
cash<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.549> on<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:44.700> get<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.299> on<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.510> action

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
cash in on that get in on the action

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.090 
cash in on that get in on the action
also<00:03:46.049> absolutely<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.739> just<00:03:46.920> another

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
also absolutely this is just another

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.920 
also absolutely this is just another
great<00:03:47.489> with<00:03:47.610> organic<00:03:48.030> derivatives<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.630> think

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
great with organic derivatives I think

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.280 
great with organic derivatives I think
this<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.470> huge<00:03:50.070> possible<00:03:50.640> market<00:03:50.970> for<00:03:51.570> for

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
this is a huge possible market for for

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.870 
this is a huge possible market for for

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
be any one of these bankers we haven't

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.650 
be any one of these bankers we haven't
seen<00:04:58.410> really<00:04:58.680> a<00:04:58.800> bank<00:04:59.130> villain<00:04:59.700> in<00:04:59.880> the<00:05:00.270> Batman

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
seen really a bank villain in the Batman

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.660 
seen really a bank villain in the Batman
series<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.230> I<00:05:01.290> think<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.860> this<00:05:02.250> is<00:05:02.310> an

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
series and I think that this is an

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.910 
series and I think that this is an
opportunity<00:05:03.210> for<00:05:03.450> Warner<00:05:03.720> Brothers<00:05:03.750> in<00:05:04.110> DC<00:05:04.470> to

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
opportunity for Warner Brothers in DC to

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.560 
opportunity for Warner Brothers in DC to
really<00:05:05.220> kind<00:05:05.730> of<00:05:05.790> take<00:05:06.120> advantage<00:05:06.480> of<00:05:06.510> that

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
really kind of take advantage of that

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.360 
really kind of take advantage of that
opportunity<00:05:06.660> and<00:05:07.230> your<00:05:07.830> research<00:05:08.130> that<00:05:08.280> we

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
opportunity and your research that we

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.470 
opportunity and your research that we
haven't<00:05:08.610> seen<00:05:08.700> a<00:05:08.760> banker<00:05:09.120> villain<00:05:09.360> we're

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
haven't seen a banker villain we're
