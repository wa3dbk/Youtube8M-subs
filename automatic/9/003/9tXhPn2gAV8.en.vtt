 history this moment it takes two clubs have 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.230
 win no we want to win but 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.010
 it is clear that the priority objective 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.170
 it's to win 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.850
 we really want to give a 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.830
 good picture it's really great 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.339
 important so it really needs that 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.780
 of cannon we win with the way 6 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.930
 if we must win by suffering in 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.790
 not being very good, we will do it but 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.100
 we will really try to propose 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.200
 show game we know it's a 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.760
 very difficult team 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.840
 we know we have qualities we have 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.440
 good team and we did not arrive 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.210
 here for nothing we have a lot of 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.950
 qualities I think we can leave 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.580
 confident but not too much should 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.580
 clearly an excellent

 shac really has a Ukrainian team 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.910
 is a team that is very athletic 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.620

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.990

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.420
 effective really do not have any players 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.180
 who will make fantasies so that's 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.550
 really a very strong team and 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.750
 effective even on stopped phases so 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.780
 it's going to be a very difficult team to 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.780
 to play
