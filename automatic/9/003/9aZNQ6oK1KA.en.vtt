00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
they are actually an instant light

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.999 
they are actually an instant light
charcoal<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.730> me<00:00:12.599> personally<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.110> do<00:00:13.259> not<00:00:13.380> like

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
using instant light Runkles whatsoever

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.689 
using instant light Runkles whatsoever
and<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.650> reason<00:00:16.800> I'm<00:00:17.010> doing<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.279> review<00:00:17.670> on

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
and the reason I'm doing this review on

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.220 
and the reason I'm doing this review on
these<00:00:18.000> struggle<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.420> because<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.720> from<00:00:19.109> what

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
these struggle is because of from what

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.300 
these struggle is because of from what
I've<00:00:19.350> realized<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:19.770> far<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.100> they<00:00:20.279> are

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
I've realized so far is that they are

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.710 
I've realized so far is that they are
very<00:00:20.430> different<00:00:20.910> from<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.300> other<00:00:21.449> quick

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
very different from the other quick

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.019 
very different from the other quick
lights<00:00:21.960> on<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.170> market<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.710> couple<00:00:23.490> things<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
lights on the market a couple things I

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.250 
lights on the market a couple things I
want<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.240> mention<00:00:24.300> about<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.230> that

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
want to mention about that is that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.939 
want to mention about that is that
number<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:27.180> texture<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> guys

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
number one the texture of it if you guys

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.490 
number one the texture of it if you guys
can<00:00:29.130> see<00:00:29.279> here<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:30.179> not<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.570> brittle<00:00:30.990> such

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
can see here it's not that brittle such

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.110 
can see here it's not that brittle such
as<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.890> three<00:00:32.160> kings<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.520> Hollins<00:00:32.850> they're

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
as like three kings and Hollins they're

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.569 
as like three kings and Hollins they're
brittle<00:00:33.510> they're<00:00:33.750> flaking<00:00:34.250> then<00:00:35.250> they<00:00:35.370> just

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
brittle they're flaking then they just

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.860 
brittle they're flaking then they just
look<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.820> know<00:00:35.940> kind<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.180> cheap<00:00:36.420> made<00:00:36.690> these

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
look you know kind of cheap made these

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.020 
look you know kind of cheap made these
ones<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.260> very<00:00:37.739> smooth<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.730> seems<00:00:38.879> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
ones are very smooth and just seems to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.200 
ones are very smooth and just seems to
be<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.660> solid<00:00:40.320> piece<00:00:40.520> you<00:00:41.520> know<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.030> seems

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
be one solid piece you know so it seems

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.180 
be one solid piece you know so it seems
that<00:00:42.360> they<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.930> been<00:00:43.170> they<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> little

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that they have been they have a little

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.729 
that they have been they have a little
bit<00:00:44.309> more<00:00:44.460> care<00:00:44.730> may<00:00:45.260> put<00:00:46.260> into<00:00:46.440> them<00:00:46.590> while

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
bit more care may put into them while

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.470 
bit more care may put into them while
being<00:00:46.950> made<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.309> also<00:00:47.910> they<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.300> hole

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
being made and also they have this hole

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.790 
being made and also they have this hole
in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.600> middle<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.440> know<00:00:49.500> whether<00:00:49.649> if

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
in the middle I don't know whether if

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.569 
in the middle I don't know whether if
that's<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.820> airflow<00:00:51.270> most<00:00:51.899> likely

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
that's for you know airflow most likely

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.670 
that's for you know airflow most likely
but<00:00:53.579> um<00:00:53.730> yeah<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.239> these<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.020> about<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> think

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
but um yeah and these are about I think

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.910 
but um yeah and these are about I think
35<00:00:56.399> or<00:00:56.579> 38<00:00:56.969> millimeters<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:58.050> diameter<00:00:58.500> because

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
35 or 38 millimeters in diameter because

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.819 
35 or 38 millimeters in diameter because
I<00:00:59.370> held<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> three<00:01:00.570> kings<00:01:00.780> 33<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> couple

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
I held it to a three kings 33 a couple

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.170 
I held it to a three kings 33 a couple
days<00:01:01.949> ago<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:02.940> bit

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
days ago and this one was a little bit

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.579 
days ago and this one was a little bit
larger<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.660> know<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.140> come<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.439> different

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
larger I know they come in different

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
larger I know they come in different
sizes<00:01:04.739> such<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.460> like<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:05.970> come<00:01:06.090> in

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
sizes such as like I think they come in

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.550 
sizes such as like I think they come in
50<00:01:06.479> millimeter<00:01:06.840> or<00:01:06.960> something<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.380> I

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
50 millimeter or something like that I

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.740 
50 millimeter or something like that I
haven't<00:01:07.830> seen<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.640> other<00:01:08.670> sizes<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
haven't seen the other sizes of the

think a higher quality so you know the
way<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.900> they<00:02:50.020> self<00:02:50.260> ignite<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.800> a<00:02:50.830> little

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
way that they self ignite is a little

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.460 
way that they self ignite is a little
