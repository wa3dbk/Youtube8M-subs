00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
posture with the guitar you can't really

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.060 
posture with the guitar you can't really
see<00:00:22.390> what's<00:00:22.660> going<00:00:22.750> on<00:00:23.109> very<00:00:23.439> well<00:00:23.650> the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
see what's going on very well the

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.070 
see what's going on very well the
fretboard<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.789> invisible<00:00:25.269> to<00:00:25.599> me<00:00:25.689> it's<00:00:25.869> on<00:00:25.990> the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
fretboard is invisible to me it's on the

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.269 
fretboard is invisible to me it's on the
other<00:00:26.289> side<00:00:26.529> of<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:26.710> guitar<00:00:26.830> I<00:00:26.949> can't<00:00:27.189> really

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
other side of the guitar I can't really

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.130 
other side of the guitar I can't really
see<00:00:27.609> it<00:00:27.699> so<00:00:27.880> it's<00:00:28.359> very<00:00:28.480> important<00:00:28.929> that<00:00:29.050> we

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
see it so it's very important that we

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.740 
see it so it's very important that we
learn<00:00:29.439> how<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.769> see<00:00:30.130> with<00:00:30.340> our<00:00:30.369> fingers<00:00:30.880> so<00:00:31.689> I'm

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
learn how to see with our fingers so I'm

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.450

going<00:00:31.869> to<00:00:31.929> show<00:00:32.019> you<00:00:32.050> how<00:00:32.230> to<00:00:32.290> do<00:00:32.470> that<00:00:32.619> we're

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
going to show you how to do that we're

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.970 
going to show you how to do that we're
going<00:00:33.580> to<00:00:33.699> basically<00:00:34.360> play<00:00:34.750> a<00:00:35.019> C<00:00:35.320> major<00:00:35.530> scale

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
going to basically play a C major scale

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.009 
going to basically play a C major scale
but<00:00:36.850> we're<00:00:37.150> gonna<00:00:37.269> be<00:00:37.390> playing<00:00:37.510> it<00:00:37.780> from<00:00:37.930> the

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
but we're gonna be playing it from the

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.899 
but we're gonna be playing it from the
lowest<00:00:38.320> note<00:00:38.470> of<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.620> guitar<00:00:38.949> all<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.699> way<00:00:39.790> up

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:39.909 
lowest note of the guitar all the way up

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:41.880 
lowest note of the guitar all the way up
to<00:00:40.030> this<00:00:40.150> the<00:00:40.570> high-pitched<00:00:41.049> East<00:00:41.379> ring<00:00:41.620> here

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
to this the high-pitched East ring here

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.149 
to this the high-pitched East ring here
so<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.989> that<00:00:44.110> looks<00:00:44.170> like<00:00:44.379> is<00:00:44.680> exactly

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.130 
so what that looks like is exactly
what's<00:00:45.339> written<00:00:45.489> in<00:00:45.699> the<00:00:45.729> in<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.390> PDF<00:00:46.809> in

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
you're practicing this scale now as a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.729 
you're practicing this scale now as a
warm-up<00:02:20.480> one<00:02:20.810> other<00:02:20.930> thing<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.230> can<00:02:21.409> do<00:02:21.590> with

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
warm-up one other thing you can do with

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.990 
warm-up one other thing you can do with
this<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.269> play<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:25.370> second<00:02:25.730> thing<00:02:25.849> that's

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
this is play the second thing that's

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.039 
this is play the second thing that's
written<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.299> front<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.569> you<00:02:26.659> which<00:02:26.870> is

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
written in front of you which is

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.509 
written in front of you which is
basically<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.590> same<00:02:27.799> scale<00:02:28.129> but<00:02:28.189> we're

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
basically the same scale but we're

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.460 
basically the same scale but we're
playing<00:02:28.819> back<00:02:29.120> down<00:02:29.359> on<00:02:29.540> every<00:02:29.750> string<00:02:30.049> so<00:02:30.349> we

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
playing back down on every string so we

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:45.199 
playing back down on every string so we
go<00:02:30.620> down<00:02:32.530> then<00:02:33.530> we<00:02:33.650> move<00:02:33.829> to<00:02:33.859> the<00:02:34.040> next<00:02:34.159> string

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.250 

basically<00:02:46.209> what<00:02:46.330> that<00:02:46.360> does<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.020> gives<00:02:47.110> you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
basically what that does is it gives you

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.750 
basically what that does is it gives you
four<00:02:47.500> notes<00:02:47.709> on<00:02:47.890> every<00:02:48.100> string<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.580> when<00:02:48.700> you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
four notes on every string so when you

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.400 
four notes on every string so when you
alternate<00:02:49.150> pick<00:02:49.390> everything's<00:02:49.900> really<00:02:50.260> well

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
alternate pick everything's really well

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.230 
alternate pick everything's really well
organized<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.280> when<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:51.640> play<00:02:51.850> through<00:02:52.120> that

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
organized so when you play through that

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:03.720 
organized so when you play through that
in<00:02:52.540> time<00:02:52.959> it'll<00:02:53.260> sound<00:02:53.380> like<00:02:53.470> this<00:03:02.550> so<00:03:03.550> it's<00:03:03.670> a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
in time it'll sound like this so it's a

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.670 
in time it'll sound like this so it's a
fun<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.330> actually<00:03:04.720> pretty<00:03:04.959> decent<00:03:05.140> sounding

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
fun and actually pretty decent sounding
