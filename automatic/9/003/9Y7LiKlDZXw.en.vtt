00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
of the truck and wetting it down so it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
of the truck and wetting it down so it
helps<00:00:54.420> cool<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.690> pigs<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.320> they're<00:00:55.530> moved<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
helps cool the pigs as they're moved the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.459 
helps cool the pigs as they're moved the
amount<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.180> room<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.230> another

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
one that we've looked at very carefully

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.420 
one that we've looked at very carefully
just<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.050> people<00:01:01.260> riding<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> back<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.340> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and turning a corner if you have too

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.870 
and turning a corner if you have too
much<00:01:07.020> room<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.010> from<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.430> side<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
much room you can go from one side to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.670 
much room you can go from one side to
another<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.840> don't<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> pigs<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
another and we don't want the pigs to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.530 
another and we don't want the pigs to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
have to do that either if they have too

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.910 
have to do that either if they have too

much room they might fall they might

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.219 
much room they might fall they might
injure<00:01:14.220> themselves<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.509> balance<00:01:15.930> then

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
injure themselves so it's a balance then

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.280 
injure themselves so it's a balance then
