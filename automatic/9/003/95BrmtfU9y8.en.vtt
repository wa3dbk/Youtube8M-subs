00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.390
 hello good friends in this tutorial os 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.189
 I want to show how I lead 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.689
 rod with we have retractable because 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.580
 this is important 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.230
 you can buy directly the probos 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.930
 that they have with your plastic to pass the 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.000
 mother's life would be the energy to the 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.070
 final goal but good after much 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.519
 time and observe types of rig their 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.739
 assembly you have known that after 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.890
 spend the mother there by the rolling at 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.110
 turn when having the revolving door has 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.379
 normally less rubbing if nailed a 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.649
 good capture of the subject of why it happens 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.110
 this because in animals fish and fish 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.079
 and catches like carved tend to play 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.510
 with the food before ingesting it I heard it 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.079
 to say is that they move and pull with the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.960
 Lead from lead tends more to friction 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.570
 that if it only happens with the good roll already 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.800
 I'm going to show you how I ride it 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.800
 same I hope next 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.110
 the first thing I take are these 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.600
 this retractable stretch that you can 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.970
 buy in good fishing stores the 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.550
 brand matters little 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.010
 and yours that you fuck me but I'm for 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.480
 mania I alone with the first one that I do 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.740
 I always leave the joint of the one who has 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.360
 left over 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.340
 what I do is I always have the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.550
 measures with gestures 2 that would be the measure 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.070
 and short out there once and short could 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.820
 cut as straight as possible or not too 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.010
 it depends on you as well in the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
 120 lead rod theme 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.810
 grams 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.640
 usually comes with the opening 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.030
 completely closed about coming 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.890
 completely closed so with the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.210
 quotations do a little strength and 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.770
 see in this case I already have it almost 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.140
 open now I just had to make a 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.619
 little deal is already open once 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.810
 that we have it that way the rolling and 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.600
 the light is introduced we would go through this 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.090
 part and we would leave it there and now for 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.570
 that does not escape us with the pincers 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.570
 we would take 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.660
 and we would learn to gather again 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.160
 the truth that it costs me a little to squeeze 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.160
 because as 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.370
 good so we have it closed as well 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.800
 you can see it does not escape anymore 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.210
 for him 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.770
 the rum and very well now comes the 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.020
 next part the next part is 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.670
 introduce the thermo shrink thermo 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.830
 retractable is the tube that is used to 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.180
 the dentists' electricity and the 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.970
 true that works very well in these 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.340
 cases induces retractable terror there are 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.560
 up to that area right up to the center of 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.170
 in itself the of the assembly are left is 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.850
 here in this area and now good this is 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.500
 important now that you know you have 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.960
 to apply heat but you just have to 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.570
 apply heat if you apply the fire 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.130
 in an area and not the maria and from site 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.160
 I would have deserved to burn eisel we have 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.380
 retractable and the truth that will remain 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.390
 very well it has to be at all times 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.680
 moving in agreement 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.780
 you have to apply the heat 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.940
 applying the heat little by little as without 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.670
 think little by little until you see that 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.650
 we have retractable it is adjusting the 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.450
 rod is adjusting the rod 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.360
 you are correcting a bit if you know that 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.220
 go there 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.829
 I am fixed either it has practically been 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.420
 trailer you can give a little more if 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.370
 it is a bit black in some area 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.459
 nothing happens what you can not burn 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.109
 he tackled it in fixos this is the 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.349
 maximum tone says we have rule has 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.349
 He says 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.700
 so it has to be 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.560
 this is the assembly of what he wants 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.710
 say that then the mother thread will go through 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.100
 rolling hole and rotating this 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.100
 you can see it 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.069
 but this turns if you see it fixed tour the 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.330
 rolling rotates as if it were a spinning top 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.190
 turns what you want to say is that the thread 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.680
 inside could throw the gilt one 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.180
 capture anywhere without 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.180
 there would be good resistance 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.359
 Well I hope you liked it is 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.590
 easy is simple I know that many people do not 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.209
 know how to do it I know that others who are 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.340
 professionals in the subject to know how to do 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.560
 this is good enough but this video 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.759
 It is very marked for those who 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.070
 you are starting so you can see what 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.150
 simple that is to mount a lead of 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.800
 rod against retractable robbery 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.960
 nothing I hope you liked the video 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.060
 if you liked it as always to give the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.949
 and follow me on my channel and keep going up 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.210
 videos for you all 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.210
 a greeting carry fast 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.999
