00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
can take a break or so you know he can

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
can take a break or so you know he can
take<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> break<00:01:59.700> every<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.689> two<00:02:00.810> hours

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
take a break every you know two hours

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.340 
take a break every you know two hours
you<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.100> ten<00:02:02.310> minutes<00:02:03.229> every<00:02:04.229> time

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
you know for like ten minutes every time

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.810

you<00:02:04.469> take<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.649> break<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.189> think<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.549> kind<00:02:05.759> of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you take a break I think that's kind of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.969 
you take a break I think that's kind of
lame<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.750> sort<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.049> defeats<00:02:07.500> the

lame you know it sort of defeats the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.610 
lame you know it sort of defeats the
the<00:02:09.489> actual<00:02:10.119> goal<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.720> defeats<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.290> purpose

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
the actual goal it defeats the purpose

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.440 
the actual goal it defeats the purpose
of<00:02:11.920> trying<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.250> set<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.430> record<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.940> having<00:02:13.120> this

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
of trying to set a record of having this
