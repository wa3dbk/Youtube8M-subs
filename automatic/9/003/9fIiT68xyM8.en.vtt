just<00:01:19.890> make<00:01:20.040> sure<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.369> drive<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:20.909> fast<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.330> you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
just make sure you drive as fast as you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.719 
just make sure you drive as fast as you
can<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.600> try<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> get<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> next<00:01:22.590> car<00:01:22.979> so

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
now I have one car left and I do

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.410 
now I have one car left and I do
overshoot<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.640> obviously<00:01:26.759> let<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
overshoot it you can obviously let the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080 
overshoot it you can obviously let the
cars<00:01:27.630> pass<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.170> or<00:01:28.350> try<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> hit<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.820> other

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
cars pass you or try to hit you in other

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.539 
cars pass you or try to hit you in other
ways<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.049> found<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.770> driving<00:01:32.430> it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
ways but I found that just driving it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.850 
ways but I found that just driving it
taking<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> pretty<00:01:33.390> easily<00:01:33.689> touching<00:01:34.680> cars

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
taking it pretty easily touching cars

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.069 
taking it pretty easily touching cars
from<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.100> side<00:01:35.430> was<00:01:35.729> definitely<00:01:36.210> my<00:01:36.479> best<00:01:36.720> bet

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
from the side was definitely my best bet

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.950 
from the side was definitely my best bet
and<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> did<00:01:38.159> use<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> rewind<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.420> not

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and here I did use a rewind so it's not

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.450 
and here I did use a rewind so it's not
important<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.650> use<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> rewind<00:01:41.220> that's
