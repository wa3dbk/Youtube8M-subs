helps a bit now to access your bank you
usually<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.619> find<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.100> bank<00:01:47.960> person<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.109> every

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
usually can find a bank person in every

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.429 
usually can find a bank person in every
main<00:01:49.799> city<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.759> are<00:01:50.789> also<00:01:51.060> other<00:01:51.439> spots

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
main city there are also other spots

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.719 
main city there are also other spots
where<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:52.770> find<00:01:52.979> them<00:01:53.219> but<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.579> is

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
where you can find them but this is

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.209 
where you can find them but this is
probably<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.119> best<00:01:54.359> way<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.659> find<00:01:55.049> them<00:01:55.289> so<00:01:55.530> if

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
probably the best way to find them so if

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.429 
probably the best way to find them so if
you<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:56.759> main<00:01:56.939> city<00:01:57.329> look<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:58.079> for

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you go to your main city look out for

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.950 
you go to your main city look out for
this<00:01:59.070> symbol<00:01:59.460> here<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.999> can<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> highlight<00:02:00.810> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this symbol here I can I highlight it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.709 
this symbol here I can I highlight it
it's<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:02.039> a<00:02:02.070> golden<00:02:02.789> circle<00:02:03.390> was<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.689> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
it's like a golden circle was like a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.080 
it's like a golden circle was like a
money<00:02:04.020> back<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.380> top<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.399> reseed<00:02:05.880> right

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
money back on top you can reseed right

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.180 
money back on top you can reseed right
now<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.659> like<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:07.710> highlighting

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
now because it's like not highlighting

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.990 
now because it's like not highlighting
properly<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.830> they're<00:02:10.830> usually<00:02:10.860> pretty<00:02:11.580> easy

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
properly but they're usually pretty easy

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.470

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
put any us on this deck so make sure

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.190 
put any us on this deck so make sure
every<00:03:03.030> time<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.269> put<00:03:03.480> something<00:03:03.720> into<00:03:04.049> your

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
inventory you actually have only one

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.750 
inventory you actually have only one
stack<00:03:07.409> of<00:03:07.530> each<00:03:07.680> item<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.370> don't<00:03:08.549> waste

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
stack of each item so you don't waste

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.089 
stack of each item so you don't waste
some<00:03:09.030> inventory<00:03:09.450> space<00:03:09.900> because<00:03:10.560> you<00:03:10.950> don't

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
some inventory space because you don't

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.069 
some inventory space because you don't

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
have a lot of here in this one I think

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.960 
have a lot of here in this one I think
you<00:03:13.379> can<00:03:13.560> upgrade<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:13.950> later<00:03:14.250> on<00:03:14.340> with<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
you can upgrade it later on with the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.800 
you can upgrade it later on with the
with<00:03:15.840> some<00:03:16.079> real<00:03:16.889> money<00:03:17.129> but<00:03:17.489> I'm<00:03:18.060> done<00:03:18.599> I'm

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
with some real money but I'm done I'm

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.849 
with some real money but I'm done I'm
not<00:03:19.019> going<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.260> talk<00:03:19.379> about<00:03:19.530> this<00:03:19.739> here<00:03:20.450> now

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
not going to talk about this here now

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.659 
not going to talk about this here now
you<00:03:22.859> can<00:03:23.040> also<00:03:23.250> as<00:03:23.669> a<00:03:23.730> side<00:03:23.879> note<00:03:24.090> create

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
you can also as a side note create

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.250 
you can also as a side note create
separated<00:03:26.669> stashes<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.449> for<00:03:27.720> example<00:03:27.810> you

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
separated stashes so for example you

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.319 
separated stashes so for example you
want<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.500> trade<00:03:28.769> something<00:03:29.069> with<00:03:29.370> someone<00:03:29.609> but

want to trade something with someone but

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.330 
want to trade something with someone but
you<00:03:30.419> only<00:03:30.510> want<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> give<00:03:30.989> him<00:03:31.109> one<00:03:31.349> you<00:03:32.129> can

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
you only want to give him one you can

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.780 
you only want to give him one you can
hold<00:03:32.579> out<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:33.750> Alt<00:03:33.930> key<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.410> then<00:03:35.069> just<00:03:35.340> left

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
hold out the Alt key and then just left

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.550 
hold out the Alt key and then just left
click<00:03:36.150> on<00:03:36.329> your<00:03:36.449> item<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:36.989> drag<00:03:37.199> it<00:03:37.379> to<00:03:37.410> a

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
click on your item and drag it to a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.129 
click on your item and drag it to a
different<00:03:37.829> field<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.609> let<00:03:38.699> go<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.959> will

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
different field and let go and it will

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.500 
different field and let go and it will
ask<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.560> how<00:03:41.160> big<00:03:41.400> your<00:03:41.639> second<00:03:42.120> state<00:03:42.299> should

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
ask you how big your second state should

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.180 
ask you how big your second state should
be<00:03:42.629> so<00:03:42.900> let's<00:03:43.049> say<00:03:43.199> one<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.859> creates<00:03:44.129> the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
be so let's say one and it creates the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.229 
be so let's say one and it creates the
