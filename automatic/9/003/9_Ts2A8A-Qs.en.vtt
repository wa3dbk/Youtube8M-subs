00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.539
 from boy one dreams of this kind of thing and 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.539

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.560
 edition 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.000
 in fact that between chivas to the basic forces with the first objective 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.140
 Y 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.520
 and good faith and understand them 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.110
 the rules that are said to be passed within 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.890
 of what these two basic that go step by step 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.800
 they were going to go by roads says if this year I was fulfilled mini object that has 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.180
 objectives I have always been 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.310
 my virtue of the treaty is looking for opposite goal 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.020
 since from chipiona place maybe my function is not forward 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.350
 I want their metal interlocking but they always act 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.890
 liked to step on the wide area dare to try 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.980
 long distance shots and 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.660
 equal not to finish the moves that trying and daring as 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.660
 as to fall the goals and is that I feel 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.500
 very good airs 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.270
 is a fundamental part of what in chivas 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.900
 percent always teach me their part in the area an advantage we have of 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.070
 be Mexican and we know that 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.760
 that not everything in other teams in Mexico 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.740
 more than anything the position in which he placed to it there is always a vacancy 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.570
 Some foreigner is 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.720
 is this is difficult 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.150
 play that portion but well I feel lucky to 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.960
 to be able to take this from to score goals to be able to compete with that kind of 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.100

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.449
 I think 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.769
 that always each each person will never have their opinion 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.469

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.059

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:47.559

 Now that things are being given to me 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.559
 what remains to be thanked and and continue the same way 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.109
