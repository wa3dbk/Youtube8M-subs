00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I'm using my webcam so might not be the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.720 
I'm using my webcam so might not be the
best<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:27.260> anyway<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.590> shouldn't<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.429> is

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
best but anyway I shouldn't this is

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.780 
best but anyway I shouldn't this is
pretty<00:00:30.029> awesome<00:00:30.740> um<00:00:31.880> if<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.000> take<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.360> apart

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
pretty awesome um if you take this apart

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.930 
pretty awesome um if you take this apart
you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.239> there's<00:00:36.570> actually<00:00:37.579> there's<00:00:38.579> two

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
you can see there's actually there's two

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.639 
you can see there's actually there's two
buttons<00:00:39.780> there's<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:41.300> there<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.989> one<00:00:43.079> there

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
buttons there's one there and one there

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.000 
buttons there's one there and one there
and<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:48.059> problem<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.719> when<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.140> extend<00:00:49.680> it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and the problem is when you extend it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.400 
and the problem is when you extend it
the<00:00:50.730> button<00:00:51.030> who<00:00:51.210> loosely<00:00:51.690> can't<00:00:51.960> press<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the button who loosely can't press it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.220 
the button who loosely can't press it
anymore<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.149> flip<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.270> around<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:55.050> all

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
anymore so you flip it around and do all

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.869 
anymore so you flip it around and do all
that<00:00:55.260> stuff<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:58.140> um<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.800> figured<00:00:59.430> I'm<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.820> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
that stuff but um I figured I'm going to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.149 
that stuff but um I figured I'm going to
get<00:01:00.660> past<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.230> um<00:01:01.969> if<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.830> there's<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.949> bunch

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
wire and bend it in like an L shape and

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.039 
wire and bend it in like an L shape and
put<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.470> in<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:53.220> hole<00:01:53.520> put<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.329> short<00:01:54.659> end<00:01:54.840> of

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
put it in that hole put the short end of

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.499 
put it in that hole put the short end of
the<00:01:55.110> L<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.770> hole<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.969> long<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.479> leave

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the L in the hole and the long I leave

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.170 
the L in the hole and the long I leave
it<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.920> looks<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.490> that<00:02:02.180> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
it like this so it looks like that and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.780 
it like this so it looks like that and
then

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.980 

and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.750> take<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.050> little<00:02:07.290> piece<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.770> hot<00:02:08.009> glue

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
and then take a little piece of hot glue

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.910 
and then take a little piece of hot glue
hot<00:02:09.990> glue<00:02:10.200> gun<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:12.180> put<00:02:12.510> some<00:02:13.230> glue<00:02:13.470> under

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
hot glue gun and you put some glue under

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890 
hot glue gun and you put some glue under
it<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.340> once<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.670> dries<00:02:15.000> put<00:02:15.450> some<00:02:15.660> glue

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
it and once that dries put some glue

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.540 
it and once that dries put some glue
over<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.860> make<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.340> nice<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.670> sturdy

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
over it just to make it nice and sturdy

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.160 
over it just to make it nice and sturdy
and<00:02:20.550> then<00:02:20.730> if<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:20.970> want<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.360> see<00:02:21.630> mine<00:02:21.840> was<00:02:22.050> I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
and then if you want to see mine was I

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.350 
and then if you want to see mine was I
was<00:02:22.290> falling<00:02:22.500> down<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.190> put<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> table

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
was falling down you can put a table

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.340 
was falling down you can put a table
Hawkwood<00:02:24.990> right<00:02:25.200> there<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.540> it'll<00:02:27.540> hold<00:02:28.080> that

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
Hawkwood right there and it'll hold that

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.460 
Hawkwood right there and it'll hold that
in<00:02:28.530> place<00:02:28.560> nicely<00:02:29.360> it's<00:02:30.360> really<00:02:30.630> not<00:02:30.900> much<00:02:31.140> it

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
in place nicely it's really not much it

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:39.080 
in place nicely it's really not much it
stays<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:34.050> then<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.160> do<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.490> like<00:02:36.240> this<00:02:38.090> or

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
stays so then you can do it like this or

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.590 
stays so then you can do it like this or
when<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.840> extend<00:02:40.320> it<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:41.490> know<00:02:41.820> push<00:02:42.420> it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
when you extend it you know push it

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:49.340 
when you extend it you know push it
there<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.959> it<00:02:46.170> works<00:02:46.410> great<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:48.420> it's<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.140> for

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
there and it works great so it's it for

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.680 
there and it works great so it's it for
