00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
DSL is supposed to be like two amps at

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.990 
DSL is supposed to be like two amps at
one<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.250> plexi<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:25.109> jcm800<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.820> you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
one the plexi and the jcm800 and as you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240 
one the plexi and the jcm800 and as you
all<00:00:27.150> know<00:00:27.359> that's<00:00:27.720> impossible<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.590> you're

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
all know that's impossible to do you're

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.919 
all know that's impossible to do you're
not<00:00:29.400> gonna<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.609> able<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.820> capture<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.359> true

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
not gonna be able to capture the true

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.720 
not gonna be able to capture the true
original<00:00:31.080> tones<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.830> each<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.099> those<00:00:32.189> heads<00:00:32.520> in

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
original tones of each of those heads in

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.970 
original tones of each of those heads in
one<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.510> these<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.649> pretty<00:00:34.800> good

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
one of these but it's a pretty good

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.340 
one of these but it's a pretty good
approximation<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.239> both<00:00:36.450> amps<00:00:36.899> kind<00:00:37.290> of

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
approximation of what both amps kind of

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.590 
approximation of what both amps kind of
sound<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.149> even<00:00:39.149> though<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.450> not

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
sound like and even though it's not

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.510 
sound like and even though it's not
exactly<00:00:39.660> light<00:00:40.260> complexity<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:40.950> exactly<00:00:41.280> like

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
exactly light complexity or exactly like

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.569 
exactly light complexity or exactly like
an<00:00:41.670> 800<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:43.110> has<00:00:43.290> its<00:00:43.469> own<00:00:43.649> distinctive<00:00:44.370> voice

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
an 800 it has its own distinctive voice

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.979 
an 800 it has its own distinctive voice
which<00:00:44.850> i<00:00:44.969> think<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.239> very<00:00:45.270> beautiful<00:00:45.840> we're

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
which i think is very beautiful we're

going to show that here now this is an

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.819 
going to show that here now this is an
unlisted<00:00:48.450> channel<00:00:48.960> we're<00:00:49.079> going<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.649> from

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
unlisted channel we're going to go from

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
unlisted channel we're going to go from
this<00:00:49.980> SG<00:00:50.430> into<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:53.300> right<00:00:54.300> now<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.510> just

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
this SG into here and right now I just

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.520 
this SG into here and right now I just
want<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> talk<00:00:55.170> about<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.590> distortions<00:00:57.530> so

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
want to talk about the distortions so

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:47.140 
want to talk about the distortions so
we're<00:00:58.680> gonna<00:00:58.770> start<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.570> bridge<00:01:00.570> pickup

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:02:18.870 

and<00:01:47.450> now<00:01:47.570> switch<00:01:47.630> over<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.410> right

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.860 

and

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.280 

as<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.140> can<00:02:29.260> see<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.650> green<00:02:30.010> channel<00:02:31.110> has<00:02:32.110> a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
as you can see the green channel has a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.770 
as you can see the green channel has a
has<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.650> kind<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.610> throaty<00:02:34.060> or<00:02:34.299> kind<00:02:34.720> of

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
has a kind of a throaty or kind of

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.320 
has a kind of a throaty or kind of
meteor<00:02:35.080> sound<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.830> then<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.330> second

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
meteor sound to it then the second

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.050 
meteor sound to it then the second
channel<00:02:37.569> readout<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.200> those<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:39.060> obviously

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
channel readout of those and obviously

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.580 
channel readout of those and obviously
going<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.360> use<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.569> red<00:02:40.750> for<00:02:40.930> more<00:02:41.080> distortion

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
going to use the red for more distortion

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.509 
going to use the red for more distortion
but<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.670> green<00:02:42.909> Channel<00:02:43.360> distortion<00:02:44.370> or<00:02:45.370> they

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
but the green Channel distortion or they

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.300 
but the green Channel distortion or they
call<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.620> classic<00:02:48.129> gain<00:02:48.569> crunch<00:02:49.569> mode

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
call it the the classic gain crunch mode

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.520 
call it the the classic gain crunch mode
that<00:02:51.310> really<00:02:51.640> suits<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.810> know<00:02:52.930> people<00:02:53.349> well

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
that really suits you know people well

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:12.260 
that really suits you know people well
for<00:02:53.769> doing<00:02:53.829> things<00:02:54.129> like<00:02:54.280> classic<00:02:54.790> rocks

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.640 

so<00:03:13.270> there's<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.480> lot<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.660> definition<00:03:14.410> with<00:03:14.530> the

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
so there's a lot of definition with the

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.500 
so there's a lot of definition with the
notes<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.700> have<00:03:15.730> there<00:03:16.090> with<00:03:16.300> the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
notes that you have there with the

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:34.949 
notes that you have there with the
classic<00:03:17.290> game<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:18.040> ultra<00:03:18.340> game<00:03:18.490> channel

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.690 

it<00:03:35.500> gives<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.769> a<00:03:35.829> lot<00:03:35.980> more<00:03:36.159> to<00:03:36.250> source<00:03:36.489> and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
it gives you a lot more to source and

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.979 
it gives you a lot more to source and
play<00:03:36.819> around<00:03:37.030> with<00:03:37.209> but<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.450> want<00:03:37.629> to<00:03:37.689> do<00:03:37.780> some

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
lot of tongue shaping but otherwise it's

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.270 
lot of tongue shaping but otherwise it's
going<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.620> be<00:03:53.680> plenty<00:03:54.640> distortion<00:03:55.269> for<00:03:55.829> 80%<00:03:56.829> of

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
going to be plenty distortion for 80% of

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.510 
going to be plenty distortion for 80% of
guitar<00:03:57.700> players

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.100 

but<00:04:04.520> just<00:04:04.730> in<00:04:04.880> case<00:04:05.150> it's<00:04:05.630> not<00:04:05.840> enough

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
but just in case it's not enough

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.440 
but just in case it's not enough
distortion<00:04:06.590> for<00:04:06.770> you<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.430> can<00:04:07.610> boost<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:08.000> and

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
distortion for you you can boost it and

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.790 
distortion for you you can boost it and
what<00:04:08.570> I'm<00:04:08.660> going<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:08.900> boost<00:04:09.050> it<00:04:09.230> with<00:04:09.350> now<00:04:09.560> is

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
what I'm going to boost it with now is

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.520 
what I'm going to boost it with now is
the<00:04:09.950> tube<00:04:10.190> screamer<00:04:10.370> clone<00:04:10.850> on<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.150> 750<00:04:11.930> so

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
the tube screamer clone on the 750 so

00:04:12.530 --> 00:05:02.180 
the tube screamer clone on the 750 so
let's<00:04:13.370> start<00:04:13.640> without<00:04:13.820> it<00:04:14.150> on<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.810> green

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:46.830 

not<00:05:03.190> bad<00:05:03.430> for<00:05:03.760> a<00:05:04.500> digital<00:05:05.500> device<00:05:06.010> giving<00:05:06.760> you

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.530 

it's<00:05:47.380> not<00:05:47.530> bad<00:05:47.800> it's<00:05:48.070> just<00:05:48.750> different<00:05:49.750> feel

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
it's not bad it's just different feel

00:05:51.540 --> 00:06:15.309 
it's not bad it's just different feel
alright<00:05:52.540> so<00:05:52.660> now<00:05:52.840> switch<00:05:53.710> over<00:05:53.920> the<00:05:54.100> red

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:07:11.710 

in<00:06:16.319> the<00:06:16.409> right<00:06:16.590> spot

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:11.720 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:20.030 

Hey

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.040 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.360 

you<00:07:20.730> get<00:07:20.880> the<00:07:21.000> idea<00:07:21.330> I<00:07:21.650> think<00:07:22.650> the<00:07:22.770> DSL<00:07:23.250> has

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
you get the idea I think the DSL has

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.280 
you get the idea I think the DSL has
been<00:07:23.520> discontinued<00:07:24.210> recently<00:07:25.020> so<00:07:25.230> you

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.290 
been discontinued recently so you

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.440 
been discontinued recently so you
probably<00:07:25.530> pick<00:07:25.770> up<00:07:25.890> a<00:07:25.980> used<00:07:26.220> one<00:07:26.430> or<00:07:26.790> pretty

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:27.450 
probably pick up a used one or pretty

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.290 
probably pick up a used one or pretty
good<00:07:27.630> deal<00:07:28.130> but<00:07:29.130> like<00:07:29.310> I<00:07:29.400> said<00:07:29.610> it's<00:07:29.820> not<00:07:30.030> any

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 
good deal but like I said it's not any

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.730 
good deal but like I said it's not any
better<00:07:30.570> or<00:07:30.750> any<00:07:30.810> worse<00:07:30.990> than<00:07:31.410> any<00:07:31.560> of<00:07:31.650> the

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 
better or any worse than any of the

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.170 
better or any worse than any of the
other<00:07:31.920> Marshalls<00:07:32.490> it's<00:07:32.580> just<00:07:32.790> a<00:07:32.850> different

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
other Marshalls it's just a different

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.730 
other Marshalls it's just a different
flavor<00:07:33.300> which<00:07:34.020> everybody<00:07:34.380> would<00:07:34.530> stop

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.740 
flavor which everybody would stop

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.620 
flavor which everybody would stop
 arguing<00:07:35.430> about<00:07:35.580> it<00:07:35.880> and<00:07:36.060> just<00:07:36.090> get

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.630 
 arguing about it and just get

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.270 
 arguing about it and just get
one<00:07:36.690> because<00:07:37.530> it's<00:07:37.680> not<00:07:37.830> going<00:07:38.010> to<00:07:38.070> do<00:07:38.160> you

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 
one because it's not going to do you

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.520 
one because it's not going to do you
wrong
