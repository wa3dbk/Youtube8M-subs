power<00:00:16.830> widget<00:00:17.009> lite<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.519> original<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.269> got<00:00:18.509> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
power widget lite is original I got the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.720 
power widget lite is original I got the
full<00:00:18.810> version<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.740> ended<00:00:20.099> up<00:00:20.189> getting<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
full version just ended up getting it

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.570 
full version just ended up getting it
just<00:00:21.599> because<00:00:22.189> figure<00:00:23.189> out<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
just because figure out what was the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.390 
just because figure out what was the
reason<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.119> either<00:00:24.630> way<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.220> light

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
reason but either way it's the light

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.669 
reason but either way it's the light
works<00:00:26.669> just<00:00:26.910> fine<00:00:27.179> if<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.019> want<00:00:28.199> just<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.470> light

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
works just fine if you want just a light

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.349 
works just fine if you want just a light
I<00:00:28.980> think<00:00:29.339> the<00:00:29.400> power<00:00:29.580> which<00:00:29.789> originally<00:00:30.150> cost

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
I think the power which originally cost

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.320 
I think the power which originally cost
me<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.689> 99<00:00:31.079> cent<00:00:31.430> for<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.579> one<00:00:32.730> but

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
me like 99 cent for this one but

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.970 
me like 99 cent for this one but
basically<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:34.020> pretty<00:00:34.290> cool<00:00:34.440> because<00:00:34.500> it

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
basically it's pretty cool because it

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.360 
basically it's pretty cool because it
allows<00:00:35.220> you<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> customize<00:00:35.790> whatever<00:00:36.750> kind<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
allows you to customize whatever kind of

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.450 
allows you to customize whatever kind of
icons<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.580> want<00:00:38.850> for<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:40.080> Wi-Fi<00:00:40.770> Bluetooth

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
icons you want for your Wi-Fi Bluetooth

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.180 
icons you want for your Wi-Fi Bluetooth
GPS<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.440> five<00:00:43.770> icons

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
GPS and if you can see I have five icons

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.450 
GPS and if you can see I have five icons
here<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.600> they're<00:00:46.080> only<00:00:46.110> taking<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.800> three

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
here and they're only taking up three

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.240 
here and they're only taking up three
spaces<00:00:47.730> instead<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.330> four<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.440> that's<00:00:49.800> one

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
spaces instead of four so that's one

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.220 
spaces instead of four so that's one
part<00:00:50.400> i<00:00:50.520> really<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.880> about<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.210> um<00:00:51.540> for

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
part i really like about it um for

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.640 
part i really like about it um for
instance<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.220> wanted<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.820> normally<00:00:54.720> do

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
instance if you wanted to normally do

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.270 
instance if you wanted to normally do
that<00:00:55.920> i<00:00:56.210> would<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.720> use<00:00:58.380> power<00:00:58.800> control

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that i would have to use power control

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
that i would have to use power control
now<00:00:59.430> power<00:00:59.670> control<00:01:00.060> is<00:01:00.330> what<00:01:00.660> comes<00:01:01.020> with

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
now power control is what comes with

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.160 
now power control is what comes with
your<00:01:01.770> Android<00:01:02.220> smartphone<00:01:02.600> if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.019> never

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
your Android smartphone if you never

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.570 
your Android smartphone if you never
looked<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.339> through<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
looked at it I'm going through the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
looked at it I'm going through the
widgets<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.620> is

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
widgets for you right now and it is

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.640 
widgets for you right now and it is
right<00:01:08.190> here<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.120> that's<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.780> typical<00:01:10.350> power

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
right here so that's your typical power

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.310 
right here so that's your typical power
control<00:01:11.160> how<00:01:11.820> power<00:01:12.150> widget<00:01:12.450> works<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.230> a

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
control how power widget works is just a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.290 
control how power widget works is just a
little<00:01:13.560> bit<00:01:13.680> different<00:01:14.070> power<00:01:14.670> control<00:01:15.090> is

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
little bit different power control is

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.410 
little bit different power control is
set<00:01:15.750> by<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> manufacturer<00:01:17.370> so<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.120> this<00:01:18.240> case

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
set by the manufacturer so in this case

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.899 
set by the manufacturer so in this case
its<00:01:18.720> stock<00:01:19.020> google<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.670> touch

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
its stock google but if you have touch

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.000 
its stock google but if you have touch
with<00:01:21.120> sense<00:01:21.510> and<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.810> want<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.440> a<00:01:22.590> set

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
with sense and you want that it's a set

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.790 
with sense and you want that it's a set
ones<00:01:23.760> that<00:01:24.030> they<00:01:24.210> chose<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.770> instance

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
ones that they chose so for instance

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.780 
ones that they chose so for instance
this<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.520> Wi-Fi<00:01:27.030> Bluetooth<00:01:27.659> GPS<00:01:28.640> but<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
this one is Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS but you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.649 
this one is Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS but you
know<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.940> like<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.930> more<00:01:31.200> such<00:01:31.620> as<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:33.540> know

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
know I like a bit more such as you know

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.570 
know I like a bit more such as you know
telling<00:01:34.050> my<00:01:34.200> battery<00:01:34.710> life<00:01:34.890> things<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.400> that

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
telling my battery life things like that

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.399 
telling my battery life things like that
and<00:01:35.850> also<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:36.510> don't<00:01:36.630> want<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.870> take<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.170> all

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and also I don't want to take up all

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.260 
and also I don't want to take up all
four<00:01:37.740> slots<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.550> takes<00:01:38.820> up<00:01:39.060> four

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
four slots because this takes up four

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.860 
four slots because this takes up four
slots<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.490> power<00:01:41.490> power<00:01:42.150> which<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> allows<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
slots so power power which it allows you

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.330 
slots so power power which it allows you
to<00:01:42.960> take<00:01:43.080> up<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.350> slot<00:01:43.680> two<00:01:44.490> slots<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:46.340> three

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
to take up one slot two slots or three

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.230 
to take up one slot two slots or three
four<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.330> even<00:01:48.390> six<00:01:48.900> on<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.110> tablet<00:01:49.620> so<00:01:50.240> allows

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
four or even six on a tablet so allows

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.360 
four or even six on a tablet so allows
you<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.600> lot<00:01:51.870> of<00:01:51.900> things<00:01:52.260> in<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.860> smaller

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
you to get a lot of things in a smaller

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.610 
you to get a lot of things in a smaller
field<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.260> an<00:01:55.409> idea

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
field and just so you can have an idea

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.830 
field and just so you can have an idea
of<00:01:55.650> what<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.890> looks<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.299> I'm<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
of what it looks like I'm just going to
