00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.230 
from the haunted house level in Mario 64
is<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.290> bane<00:05:50.680> of<00:05:50.710> my<00:05:51.010> existence<00:05:51.730> it<00:05:51.880> gets<00:05:52.090> me

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
is the bane of my existence it gets me

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.180 
is the bane of my existence it gets me
every<00:05:52.750> time<00:05:52.780> even<00:05:53.410> when<00:05:53.530> I<00:05:53.560> know<00:05:53.650> it's<00:05:53.860> coming

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
every time even when I know it's coming

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.520 
every time even when I know it's coming
I<00:05:54.610> guess<00:05:55.030> it's<00:05:55.240> because<00:05:55.360> it<00:05:55.630> happens<00:05:56.020> just

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
I guess it's because it happens just

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.890 
I guess it's because it happens just
after<00:05:57.100> you<00:05:57.400> expected<00:05:57.970> to<00:05:58.150> or<00:05:58.540> maybe<00:05:58.720> just

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
after you expected to or maybe just

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.420 
after you expected to or maybe just
because<00:05:59.200> the<00:05:59.320> sound<00:05:59.620> is<00:05:59.770> terrifying<00:06:00.310> in

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
because the sound is terrifying in

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.230 
because the sound is terrifying in
itself<00:06:00.880> I<00:06:02.280> don't<00:06:03.280> know<00:06:03.520> it's<00:06:03.760> probably<00:06:04.120> just

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
itself I don't know it's probably just

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.180 
itself I don't know it's probably just
because<00:06:04.390> it's<00:06:04.660> a<00:06:04.720> freaking<00:06:05.290> piano<00:06:05.650> with<00:06:05.950> teeth

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
because it's a freaking piano with teeth

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.300 
because it's a freaking piano with teeth
in<00:06:06.370> it<00:06:06.460> Mario<00:06:06.820> 64<00:06:07.480> to<00:06:08.290> make<00:06:08.440> matters<00:06:08.770> worse<00:06:08.830> it
