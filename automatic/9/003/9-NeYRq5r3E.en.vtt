00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.950
 I had already been asked for a lot and this 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.559

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.700

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.119
 I wanted to bring it quickly so as not to leave 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.680
 abandoned channel because lately I've 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.470
 been busy you know in things of 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.900

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.420
 but I am going to be the portal there and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.370
 good guys today we are going to do the portal 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.760
 to the dimension of the diamond what 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.290
 I wanted it to be that portal because 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.390
 this series had it a little abandoned and 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.670
 this is a series of portals that I 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.269
 as you know I have done as three 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.190
 nothing more videos but that I teach them 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.339
 a portal and we enter the programs like this 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.030
 that we are going to start this portal as 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:05.239
 you know you have to put 1 2 3 4 or me 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.780
 here because as a 4x4 of like 4 like 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.030
 in 4 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.240
 ok that sounded a little perverse 3 and 4 is 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.610
 that everything is 4 and look at this is 4 not here 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 are 2 and already here is the portal made 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.430
