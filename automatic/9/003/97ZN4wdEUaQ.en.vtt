Pandora's<00:01:47.700> chest<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.659> order<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> make

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
Pandora's chest and in order to make

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.690 
Pandora's chest and in order to make
Pandora's<00:01:49.470> chest<00:01:49.740> i<00:01:49.950> believe<00:01:50.340> you're<00:01:50.520> just

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
Pandora's chest i believe you're just

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.270 
Pandora's chest i believe you're just
going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> need<00:01:51.060> different<00:01:51.890> logs<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.130> guess

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
going to need different logs I guess

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.010 
going to need different logs I guess
different<00:01:53.610> types<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.850> wood<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.420> don't<00:01:54.869> really

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
different types of wood I don't really

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.959 
different types of wood I don't really
think<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.380> matters<00:01:55.710> too<00:01:55.740> much<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.310> basically

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
think it matters too much but basically

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.030 
think it matters too much but basically
just<00:01:57.119> following<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.659> pattern<00:01:58.140> as<00:01:58.290> seen<00:01:58.710> in

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
just following this pattern as seen in

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.999 
just following this pattern as seen in

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
gets set on fire including myself

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.610 
gets set on fire including myself
actually<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.510> was<00:03:39.599> actually<00:03:39.750> pretty<00:03:40.170> insane

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
actually it was actually pretty insane

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.890 
actually it was actually pretty insane
not<00:03:40.980> gonna<00:03:41.159> lie<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.090> let<00:03:42.330> me<00:03:42.390> actually<00:03:42.510> go<00:03:42.750> into

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
not gonna lie so let me actually go into

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.500 
not gonna lie so let me actually go into
game<00:03:43.170> mode<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:44.060> disregard<00:03:45.060> what's<00:03:45.239> said<00:03:45.390> in

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
game mode and disregard what's said in

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.539 
game mode and disregard what's said in
the<00:03:45.540> chat<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.379> I<00:03:46.440> guess<00:03:46.650> if<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:47.159> were<00:03:47.340> to

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
the chat but I guess if I were to

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.789 
the chat but I guess if I were to
actually<00:03:47.819> step<00:03:48.480> off<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:49.080> this<00:03:49.200> place<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.620> might

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
actually step off of this place I might

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.929 
actually step off of this place I might
actually<00:03:49.980> end<00:03:50.129> up<00:03:50.280> banging<00:03:50.489> those<00:03:51.290> yo<00:03:52.909> okay<00:03:53.909> I

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
actually end up banging those yo okay I

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.399 
actually end up banging those yo okay I
guess<00:03:54.150> no<00:03:54.330> nevermind<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.989> guess<00:03:55.140> there's<00:03:55.319> a

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
guess no nevermind I guess there's a

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.080 
guess no nevermind I guess there's a
glitch<00:03:55.739> in<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.950> smart<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.549> guess<00:03:56.700> that's<00:03:56.939> what

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
glitch in the smart I guess that's what

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.940 
glitch in the smart I guess that's what
the<00:03:57.269> Mon<00:03:57.780> developer<00:03:58.230> still<00:03:58.409> needs<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.620> work<00:03:58.650> on
