mind having that control it's going to

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.730 
mind having that control it's going to
make<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.520> big<00:00:40.670> difference<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.650> moving<00:00:42.650> these

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
going to have to stop and reposition a

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.820 
going to have to stop and reposition a
little<00:00:50.000> bit<00:00:50.180> watching<00:00:51.170> out<00:00:51.290> for<00:00:51.440> them<00:00:51.530> as<00:00:51.710> we

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
little bit watching out for them as we

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.460 
little bit watching out for them as we
go<00:00:51.860> cut<00:00:52.640> from<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.850> center<00:00:53.150> to<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.270> outside

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
go cut from the center to the outside

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.390 
go cut from the center to the outside
question<00:00:54.470> should<00:00:54.710> we<00:00:54.740> hide<00:00:54.980> them<00:00:55.010> now<00:00:55.370> or

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
question should we hide them now or

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.150 
question should we hide them now or
later<00:00:56.170> right<00:00:57.170> now<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:57.560> a<00:00:57.650> little<00:00:57.680> bit<00:00:57.980> of<00:00:58.070> an

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
later right now it's a little bit of an

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.280 
later right now it's a little bit of an
awkward<00:00:58.280> space<00:00:58.790> it's<00:00:59.000> really<00:00:59.510> close<00:00:59.720> in<00:00:59.990> here

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
awkward space it's really close in here

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.170 
awkward space it's really close in here
and<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:00.800> don't<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.550> know<00:01:01.580> I<00:01:01.670> really<00:01:01.970> want<00:01:02.150> you

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
and I don't you know I really want you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.999 
and I don't you know I really want you
to<00:01:02.270> show<00:01:02.510> this<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.110> do<00:01:03.320> this<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:03.830> think

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
to show this and do this and I think

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.530 
to show this and do this and I think
that's<00:01:04.159> a<00:01:04.220> little<00:01:04.339> too<00:01:04.549> close<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.030> let's<00:01:05.239> just

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
that's a little too close so let's just

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.070 
that's a little too close so let's just
kind<00:01:05.659> of<00:01:05.810> get<00:01:06.470> through<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.979> center<00:01:07.250> part<00:01:07.490> and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
kind of get through the center part and

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.720 
kind of get through the center part and
when<00:01:09.080> we're<00:01:09.230> further<00:01:09.710> away<00:01:09.890> from<00:01:10.010> that<00:01:10.340> start

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
when we're further away from that start

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.250 
when we're further away from that start
I<00:01:11.090> think<00:01:11.690> that's<00:01:11.900> when<00:01:12.110> we'll<00:01:12.290> hide<00:01:12.470> them

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
I think that's when we'll hide them

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.770 
I think that's when we'll hide them
right<00:01:14.770> now<00:01:14.890> josh<00:01:15.190> is<00:01:15.220> just<00:01:15.580> really<00:01:16.180> carefully

little Aryan fire I really enjoy
starting<00:02:01.790> from<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.090> center<00:02:02.300> you<00:02:02.630> guys<00:02:03.050> so

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
starting from the center you guys so

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.860 
starting from the center you guys so
much<00:02:03.350> more<00:02:03.680> room<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.130> maneuver<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.060> block<00:02:05.300> and

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
much more room to maneuver the block and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.390 
much more room to maneuver the block and
what<00:02:06.170> do<00:02:06.230> you<00:02:06.320> think<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:06.620> scale<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.280> is

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
what do you think this scale this is

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.249 
what do you think this scale this is
pretty<00:02:07.640> tight<00:02:07.850> you're<00:02:08.060> right<00:02:08.240> center<00:02:08.690> all

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
pretty tight you're right center all

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.110 
pretty tight you're right center all
this<00:02:09.440> skills<00:02:09.740> not<00:02:09.890> too<00:02:10.009> bad<00:02:10.220> it's<00:02:10.580> what<00:02:10.910> will

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
this skills not too bad it's what will

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.730 
this skills not too bad it's what will
you<00:02:11.210> say<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.390> one<00:02:11.630> fourth<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.960> an<00:02:12.080> inch<00:02:12.140> yeah

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
you say is one fourth of an inch yeah

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.530 
you say is one fourth of an inch yeah
it's<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.250> quarter<00:02:13.490> inch<00:02:15.970> just<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.060> quarter<00:02:17.390> inch

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
it's a quarter inch just a quarter inch

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.660 
it's a quarter inch just a quarter inch
of<00:02:17.840> space<00:02:18.200> between<00:02:18.710> all<00:02:18.980> those<00:02:19.250> lines<00:02:19.490> of

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
of space between all those lines of

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.850 
of space between all those lines of
stitching<00:02:19.880> but<00:02:20.390> at<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.140> same<00:02:21.320> time<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.800> know

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
stitching but at the same time you know

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.650 
stitching but at the same time you know
having<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.640> slower<00:02:22.880> speed<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.480> you're

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
having a slower speed and you're

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.240 
having a slower speed and you're
maintaining<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.290> kind<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:24.590> slow<00:02:24.770> speed<00:02:25.070> on

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
maintaining that kind of slow speed on

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.590 
maintaining that kind of slow speed on
the<00:02:25.340> machine<00:02:25.610> that's<00:02:25.910> really<00:02:26.209> working<00:02:26.510> out

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
the machine that's really working out

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:42.780 
the machine that's really working out
for<00:02:26.840> you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.880 

I<00:02:42.879> think<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.569> can<00:02:43.719> make<00:02:43.900> me<00:02:44.019> even<00:02:44.290> go<00:02:44.409> faster

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
I think you can make me even go faster

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.770 
I think you can make me even go faster
than<00:02:45.040> where<00:02:45.159> you're<00:02:45.280> at<00:02:45.430> right<00:02:45.459> now<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:46.569> still

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
than where you're at right now you still

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.110 
than where you're at right now you still
got<00:02:46.959> all<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.260> too<00:02:47.500> much<00:02:47.650> yeah<00:02:48.549> I<00:02:48.819> find<00:02:49.060> that

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
got all this too much yeah I find that

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.149 
got all this too much yeah I find that
medium<00:02:49.540> there<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.290> go<00:02:55.469> at<00:02:56.469> this<00:02:56.650> point<00:02:56.980> you're

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
medium there you go at this point you're

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.649 
medium there you go at this point you're
nearly<00:02:57.430> out<00:02:57.609> of<00:02:57.700> point<00:02:57.909> where<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.150> can<00:02:58.390> hide

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
nearly out of point where you can hide

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.360 
nearly out of point where you can hide
it<00:02:58.930> okay<00:02:59.230> let<00:02:59.439> me<00:02:59.530> just<00:02:59.560> come<00:02:59.859> back<00:03:00.040> at<00:03:00.220> around

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
it okay let me just come back at around

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.339 
it okay let me just come back at around
again<00:03:05.849> so<00:03:06.849> as<00:03:07.090> these<00:03:07.299> weekly<00:03:07.689> you<00:03:07.900> shapes<00:03:08.170> are

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
again so as these weekly you shapes are

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.289 
again so as these weekly you shapes are
getting<00:03:08.680> bigger<00:03:08.980> what<00:03:09.400> do<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.549> think<00:03:09.730> Josh<00:03:09.970> a

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
getting bigger what do you think Josh a

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.349 
getting bigger what do you think Josh a
lot<00:03:10.989> easier<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.560> lot<00:03:11.889> easier<00:03:12.099> because<00:03:12.969> it's<00:03:13.269> a

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
lot easier a lot easier because it's a

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:19.460 
lot easier a lot easier because it's a
bigger<00:03:13.540> scale<00:03:13.930> yes

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.760 

and<00:03:19.890> this<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.400> actually<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.820> spiral<00:03:21.510> too<00:03:21.870> but

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
and this is actually a spiral too but

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.860 
and this is actually a spiral too but
does<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:22.950> feel<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.520> spiral<00:03:23.880> no<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.510> doesn't

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
does it feel like a spiral no it doesn't

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.110 
does it feel like a spiral no it doesn't
which<00:03:24.990> is<00:03:25.140> nice<00:03:25.350> so<00:03:25.680> it's<00:03:26.640> not<00:03:26.760> nearly<00:03:27.000> as

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
which is nice so it's not nearly as

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.760 
which is nice so it's not nearly as
challenging<00:03:27.750> as<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.900> other<00:03:28.110> spirals<00:03:28.620> would

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
challenging as the other spirals would

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.010 
challenging as the other spirals would
learn<00:03:29.040> not<00:03:29.550> at<00:03:29.760> all<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.330> should<00:03:30.840> i<00:03:30.870> would

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
learn not at all I should i would

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.720 
learn not at all I should i would
recommend<00:03:31.470> tackling<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.220> first<00:03:32.520> before

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
recommend tackling this first before

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.900 
recommend tackling this first before
beginning<00:03:33.270> your<00:03:33.420> basic<00:03:33.990> spiral<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.950> just

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
beginning your basic spiral just just

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.790 
beginning your basic spiral just just
the<00:03:36.090> simple<00:03:36.510> side<00:03:36.780> spirals<00:03:37.260> in<00:03:37.380> circles<00:03:37.710> and

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
the simple side spirals in circles and

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.310 
the simple side spirals in circles and
so<00:03:38.010> yes<00:03:38.520> because<00:03:38.820> this<00:03:38.910> really<00:03:39.230> helps<00:03:40.230> you

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
so yes because this really helps you

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.300 
so yes because this really helps you

you<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.450> spiral<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.020> better<00:03:46.200> turn

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
you have to the spiral you better turn

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.080 
you have to the spiral you better turn
it<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.740> lot<00:03:46.920> more<00:03:46.950> what<00:03:47.490> this<00:03:47.640> is<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.820> lot<00:03:47.970> more

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
it a lot more what this is a lot more

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.940 
it a lot more what this is a lot more
gentle<00:03:48.480> turning<00:03:48.810> yeah<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.710> a<00:03:49.770> lot<00:03:49.890> more
