00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.069
 hi this is the video site team 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.719
 test.com I will present you the test 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.530
 of iphone or kz2 myprotein so that's 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.269
 in the family of flu 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.929
 so these are the systems that you 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.050
 allow to work more 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.550
 effectively 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.859
 actually it's going to limit the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.689
 fatigue at the level of seizures and so that 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.170
 also helps isolate muscles 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.329
 work and so these assistants 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.739
 sent here with a hook so 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.129
 inside it's metal 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:45.120
 that's pretty big enough to support 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.350
 a bar at ease there so it's cdu 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:53.129
 who knew then that's the finish and is 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.360
 not too bad and finally here so that's 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.100
 at the wrist level so you have a 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.590
 system of straps with a scratch and 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.090
 like the others here a part that little 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.750
 thick foam years for wrists 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:13.670
 so this system is used especially 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.140
 so for all that is traction 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.759
 raised from the ground where I finally go 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.950
 all they use a bar and that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.710
 So you can precisely power 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.750
 work without letting go 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.340
 it's with the help of saying since in 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.450
 do it quite often when you start 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.090
 an exercise after a while you 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.380
 let go I particularly think about the pushups 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.360
 because either you have the maquis 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.130
 slip either because there is pain 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.470
 who are starting to arrive at the level of 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.630
 soft deposits then the fingers that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.000
 loose fight thanks to that you're going 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.490
 to be able to continue more 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.470
 long time other exercises 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.780
 when I put it here it is 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.270
 like this you hung that you 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.490
 put on that level and are that it 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.820
 marry perfectly in the palm of the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.110
 hand and so you grab the bar 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:08.000
 so here I am going to show you 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.340
 immediately an example here you slide 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.950
 your wrist inside the loop 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.200
 you put the hook in the middle of the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.410
 good hand afterwards or that you put there or 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.680
 the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.940
 that's you seeing in the middle of 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.980
 you'll be fine there so seems the gold 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.380
 as I say it pushes 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.310
 perfectly well wrists she in 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.350
 moussa reinforcement that avoids hurting there I 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.830
 am ready to work on I have 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.030
 slipped so off the hook 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:43.790
 Moreover I will show you to get 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:49.550
 seize it's solid good so it's enough 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:53.540
 to squeeze his hold around the bar and 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.370
 there you will be able to work if you 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.450
 let go thac ba you can try to 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:04.250
 continue as well and then you 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.660
 could also be able to arcep had 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.850
 no drawbar to show you 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.190
 but also if you are tired of 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.049
 slipped faction so off the hook sarah bar 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.610
 of traction and so you will be able to 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.920
 really work without too much 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.540
 fatigue at catch level since the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.910
 hook there it'll help you 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.000
 keep ahead now in 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.010
 position 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.019
 So here you have seen 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.519
 the effectiveness of this product in situation 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.200
 real 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.489
 so after to you to see the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.099
 what exercises you will be able to 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.560
 adapt this accessory but hey it 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.569
 answer that promises are held 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.709
 I think that indeed 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:50.129
 relieves a lot when exercising or 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.959
 so you do not have to let go and 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.780
 this fact you can grappelli a few 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.580
 additional repetitions and while 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.590
 having an insulator forgiving the muscle 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.810
 work here is the criticism that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.910
 I had however there is always at the 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.170
 critics since a product 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.910
 to be adapted to the greatest number but has 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.819
 always who are not happy so there 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.380
 Finally promises it reads here at 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.239
 the badr stop the metal bar in 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.820
 quarters did all this so go she 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.780
 is curved if it arrives so far here and 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.290
 there you see it's because by force 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.150
 actually the testers are afraid of that 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.850
 comes out but it breaks with the 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.290
 good time well just like I say that 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.380
 of the future will tell us but I am 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.419
 pretty confident sent the tissues and that 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.190
 even touched her presents a certain 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.000
 solidity 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.979
 these liquids my see so I'm pretty 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.479
 confident at this level there is actually the 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.240
 second criticism is that for me 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.200
 me is to marry perfectly so the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.910
 palm of the hand or did this happen 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.110
 really at the fingertips now 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.630
 I like your testers who is a bit 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.460
 much smaller so at the finest and 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.919
 who find it too big she would have 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.830
 loved to bryant had our size 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.560
 so I do not know if you think like 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.810
 him so to test to see but hey in 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.280
 all together were satisfied and 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.570
 it's an interesting accessory because 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.510
 that finally me this is the first time that 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.600
 I saw this form of flu 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.979
 I saw some packages and this one at 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.900
 early it's true we do not know too much 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.460
 how to use it initially but good 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.630
 once we understand the principle 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:28.560
 it becomes the ideal accessory 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.000
 So here I advise you to test the to 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.200
 it's not very expensive 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.680
 that it makes you there too that makes you a 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.870
 service 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.599
 and then I tell you see you soon for 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.599
 other tests on video test.com hi
