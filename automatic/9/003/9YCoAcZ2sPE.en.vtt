with my chod rigs and my hinge diff rigs
in<00:00:16.320> an<00:00:16.440> effective<00:00:16.830> manner<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.609> let's<00:00:17.760> take<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
in an effective manner so let's take a

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.160 
in an effective manner so let's take a
look<00:00:18.119> at<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.270> put<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.779> little<00:00:18.990> bit<00:00:19.080> of

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
look at I put it in a little bit of

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.800 
look at I put it in a little bit of
detail<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:20.189> from<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> outside<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.359> chod<00:00:21.539> wavy

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
detail so from the outside the chod wavy

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.230 
detail so from the outside the chod wavy
bin<00:00:21.960> looks<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.260> bit<00:00:22.289> like<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.590> pop-up<00:00:22.859> tub<00:00:23.240> it's

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
bin looks a bit like a pop-up tub it's

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.460 
bin looks a bit like a pop-up tub it's
got<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.480> screw<00:00:25.460> top<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:27.109> which<00:00:28.109> helps<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
got this screw top on it which helps to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.160 
got this screw top on it which helps to
keep<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.010> contents<00:00:29.490> inside<00:00:29.750> dry<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
keep the contents inside dry and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.490 
keep the contents inside dry and
protected<00:00:32.899> basically<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> lid

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
protected basically you see as the lid

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.280 
protected basically you see as the lid
comes<00:00:34.710> off<00:00:36.530> we<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.829> which<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> handle

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
comes off we have this which is a handle

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.950 
comes off we have this which is a handle
just<00:00:40.290> pops<00:00:40.500> off<00:00:40.680> there<00:00:41.239> then<00:00:42.239> inside<00:00:42.600> there

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
just pops off there then inside there

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.080 
just pops off there then inside there
this<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.559> rubber<00:00:43.680> cap<00:00:43.950> comes<00:00:44.190> out<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.940> all

want<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.490> create<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> chod<00:01:33.659> rig<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.710> can

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
want to create in the chod rig you can

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.460 
want to create in the chod rig you can
pick<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> one<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.310> best<00:01:35.460> suits<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:37.290> can

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.210 
pick the one that best suits you you can
simply<00:01:37.909> secure<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> swivel<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> pin<00:01:40.220> you

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
simply secure the swivel with a pin you

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.920 
simply secure the swivel with a pin you
can<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> hook<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.600> goes<00:01:42.810> on

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
can see it here the hook just goes on

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.010 
can see it here the hook just goes on
this<00:01:43.110> profiled<00:01:44.100> retention<00:01:45.060> bar<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.780> stops

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
this profiled retention bar that stops

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
this profiled retention bar that stops
the<00:01:46.170> hook<00:01:46.290> from<00:01:46.409> being<00:01:46.649> able<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.270> slip<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the hook from being able to slip on the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.719 
the hook from being able to slip on the
bar<00:01:48.720> because<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.170> has<00:01:49.259> these<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.729> ridges

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
bar because it has these little ridges

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.749 
bar because it has these little ridges
that<00:01:51.329> keeps<00:01:51.509> them<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.930> separate<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.490> name

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
that keeps them all separate as the name

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.980 
that keeps them all separate as the name
suggests<00:01:53.939> known<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.509> good<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.720> chod

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
suggests known is this good for chod

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.260 
suggests known is this good for chod
rigs<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.470> also<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.310> other<00:01:56.850> rigs<00:01:57.149> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
rigs it's also good for other rigs that
