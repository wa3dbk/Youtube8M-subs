00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.630
 or the grandmother girls that I'll be the 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.710
 today welcome again to me 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.550
 channel today I bring you 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.090
 simple makeup a bit like I do not 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.029
 You know it 's a wine color but I put it 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.320
 very low already diffuse it so that it does not 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.390
 see so strong is that using this 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.480
 coss palette so decent that is the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.890
 number 2 is not pronounced not very well 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.110
 well I will use a brush that 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.210
 have a little precision but thin 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.579
 a little thinner and we're going to mark 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.189
 all the arch we will give edge to all 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.470
 our nice eye and good 

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:55.159
 we are going to apply the color and we are going to 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.960
 go blurring at the same time that 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.290
 I like it so that the eye looks 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.509
 little rounder and bigger that helps 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.280
 quite also ok let's do like this 

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:05.600
 applying a little more color then 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.970
 I'm going to use this tav palette 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.130
 although it is a very similar color but it is 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.200
 a little more intense and we will apply 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.930
 a little more in and with a brush 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.810
 to blur we are going to blur little 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.750
 little and if you need to color it 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.190
 you put in little taps for 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.190
 go blurring the new 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.180
 ok since we have blurred we are going to 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.340
 put a little more color as 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.950
 can see if you can touch 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.740
 you need to blur it and you want to achieve 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.690
 some dithering a bit more of a 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.140
 little more intense or that looks better 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.440
 our our smoked are going to put 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.020
 but let's do it in circular shapes 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.260
 and gently to be able to achieve an effect 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.510
 of a very nice smoky and then we are going to 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.229
 blur again with one more brush 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.000
 soft and wider that helps a lot 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.810
 then we are going to blur the part of 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.099
 in also 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.810
 ok let's put good let's go now to 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.730
 take a color like golden brown 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.230
 burnt my color burned and we're going to 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.270
 put in the center to this you can 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.830
 vary in color even only to 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.670
 little touches let's put the color 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.670
 gently 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.140
 then let's take a shadow in cream 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.300
 that has brightness and loose shine what 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.610
 you want me I wanted to put only 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.030
 little touches just to not put something 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.130
 so dramatic or more exaggerated 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.230
 even this makeup I think that what 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.690
 You can wear it on the day because good yo 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.340
 I did this on the day to leave 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.520
 now the same color we are going to put it 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.520
 under 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.050
 and we are going to apply more color and the 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.050
 then we will blur 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.900
 because then I'm going to use these 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.120
 luxe lashes and those that are the baby 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.310
 doll are some eyelashes that are loose and 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.230
 open they make you look 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.819
 a little more of this awake a little 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.579
 more open I do not like them very much 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.420
 False eyelashes and the truth yes yes 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.420
 love these 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.920
 then I will use mask let's 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.600
 put up top I'll put little 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.090
 nothing more and as you can see I miss it 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.280
 delineated this time I like I wanted a 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.350
 look for something simpler day but with 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.530
 color so I did not want to put the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.720
 eyeliner and well well let's do 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.000
 also down below if I take advantage of 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.410
 area pretty mascara because yes yes I 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.410
 like the way he looks 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.959
 now with a cream color or something light 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.840
 let's put on the eyebrow bone and 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.660
 let's blur with the color below 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.220
 let's use a brown pencil he cited 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.220
 whatever you have and we are going to delineate 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.220
 is the way that I am using the day of 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.410
 today is in 912 it's a soft lipstick and like 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.870
 I tell you that makeup I used it for 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.530
 the day so I did not want a lipstick so 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.530
 exaggerated 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.710
 and well that's how my look looked like 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.480
 I hope you liked girls 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.630

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.630
