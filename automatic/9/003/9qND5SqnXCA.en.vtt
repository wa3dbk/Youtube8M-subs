goes I'm killing rampages and yeah so

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.670 
goes I'm killing rampages and yeah so
naturally<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.030> only<00:01:48.270> choice

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
naturally I was a the only choice

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
naturally I was a the only choice
everyone<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.070> were<00:01:50.189> others<00:01:50.490> but

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
everyone and then there were others but

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
everyone and then there were others but
then<00:01:50.820> she<00:01:50.939> killed<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.210> competition<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.170> we

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
then she killed the competition so we

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.749 
then she killed the competition so we
were<00:01:53.130> males<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.689> were<00:01:54.810> stuck<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.290> her<00:01:55.409> I

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
were males do we were stuck with her I

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.700 
were males do we were stuck with her I
think<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.909> also<00:01:57.060> felt<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.479> her<00:01:58.110> voice<00:01:58.380> was

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
think we also felt that her voice was

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.350 
think we also felt that her voice was
professional<00:01:59.310> enough<00:01:59.520> sounding<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.210> also

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
professional enough sounding but also

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.590 
professional enough sounding but also
kind<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.939> it's<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> very<00:02:03.090> difficult<00:02:03.299> role

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
kind of like it's a very difficult role

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.800 
kind of like it's a very difficult role
because<00:02:03.899> you're<00:02:04.439> not<00:02:04.560> seen<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:06.090> it's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
because you're not seen it's it's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.719 
because you're not seen it's it's
