00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
paypal email address you obviously found

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060 
paypal email address you obviously found
that<00:00:48.330> out<00:00:48.450> because<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:48.990> more<00:00:49.740> you<00:00:49.830> watching

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that out because some more you watching

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.360 
that out because some more you watching
this<00:00:50.130> video<00:00:50.400> and<00:00:52.070> once<00:00:53.070> you've<00:00:53.190> done<00:00:53.310> that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
this video and once you've done that

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.870 
this video and once you've done that
you'll<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.240> to<00:00:54.450> wear<00:00:54.660> start<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.880> restart

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
you'll have to wear start and restart

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.450 
you'll have to wear start and restart
because<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:58.110> you<00:00:58.230> don't<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.560> it<00:00:59.100> just

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
because if you don't do that it just

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.550 
because if you don't do that it just
keeps<00:00:59.580> popping<00:01:00.000> up<00:01:00.090> saying<00:01:00.300> no<00:01:01.020> matches<00:01:01.410> found

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
keeps popping up saying no matches found

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.250 
keeps popping up saying no matches found
so<00:01:01.860> it's<00:01:02.010> probably<00:01:02.160> best<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.580> that<00:01:02.610> and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
so it's probably best to do that and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.570 
so it's probably best to do that and
then<00:01:04.260> after<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.860> after<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.400> restart

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
then after you after you restart

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.730 
then after you after you restart
everything<00:01:05.940> go<00:01:06.300> back<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.480> feed<00:01:06.780> 14<00:01:07.050> or<00:01:07.230> to<00:01:07.620> buy

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
everything go back to feed 14 or to buy

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.880 
everything go back to feed 14 or to buy
and<00:01:08.370> click<00:01:09.210> Edit<00:01:09.390> script<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.560> comes<00:01:10.770> up

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890

7<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.950> isn't<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.280> same<00:02:13.490> for<00:02:13.640> everyone

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
7 this isn't the same for everyone

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.330 
7 this isn't the same for everyone
everybody's<00:02:14.990> monitor<00:02:15.319> is<00:02:15.440> differently<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.250> if

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
everybody's monitor is differently so if

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.530 
everybody's monitor is differently so if
you're<00:02:16.459> running<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:16.970> year<00:02:17.270> no

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
you're running this on a year no

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.110 
you're running this on a year no
notebook<00:02:18.410> it's<00:02:19.280> always<00:02:19.459> going<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.730> be<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.880> lot

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
found I need to make the next coordinate

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.110 
found I need to make the next coordinate
that<00:02:36.770> this<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.160> this<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.550> going<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.730> be<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.940> end

their 536 so if I to save that right now

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.780 
their 536 so if I to save that right now
that<00:02:50.780> that's<00:02:51.080> basic<00:02:51.500> sick<00:02:51.739> basically<00:02:52.670> it
