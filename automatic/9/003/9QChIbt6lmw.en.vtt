contracts<00:00:20.460> mode<00:00:20.580> was<00:00:20.760> inspired<00:00:21.240> by<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:22.320> way

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
contracts mode was inspired by the way

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.620 
contracts mode was inspired by the way
that<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.740> community<00:00:23.160> was<00:00:23.340> using<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.119> old

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
that the community was using the old

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.689 
that the community was using the old
games<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.320> hit<00:00:25.439> man<00:00:25.619> franchise<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.369> create

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
games and hit man franchise to create

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.550 
games and hit man franchise to create
kind<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.060> new<00:00:27.269> alternative<00:00:28.080> hits<00:00:28.260> on

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
kind of new alternative hits on

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.720 
kind of new alternative hits on
characters<00:00:29.369> within<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> game<00:00:30.679> so<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:32.309> were

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
characters within the game so we were

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.310 
characters within the game so we were
using<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> starting<00:00:33.750> point<00:00:34.050> for

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
using that as a starting point for

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.500 
using that as a starting point for
actually<00:00:34.680> creating<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.700> call<00:00:35.760> contracts

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
actually creating what we call contracts

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.840 
actually creating what we call contracts
which<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.500> basically<00:00:37.980> asking<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> simple

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
which is basically asking the simple

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.459 
which is basically asking the simple
question<00:00:39.180> us<00:00:39.300> what<00:00:39.750> would<00:00:39.809> happen<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.230> any

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
question us what would happen if any

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.840 
question us what would happen if any
character<00:00:41.010> would<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> game<00:00:41.489> could<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.820> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
character would in the game could be a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.470 
character would in the game could be a
target<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:43.290> kind<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.530> took<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.829> from<00:00:43.950> there

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
a lot of people were asking us why we

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.780 
a lot of people were asking us why we
had<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.470> kill<00:01:07.710> fasano<00:01:08.130> they<00:01:08.400> were<00:01:08.520> they<00:01:08.700> were

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
had to kill fasano they were they were

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.620 
had to kill fasano they were they were
saying<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.060> would<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.240> kept<00:01:09.420> him<00:01:09.540> alive

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
saying they would have kept him alive

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.740 
saying they would have kept him alive
but<00:01:10.070> we<00:01:11.070> actually<00:01:11.159> killed<00:01:11.520> him<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.630> they

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
but we actually killed him and they

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.670 
but we actually killed him and they
suggested<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.290> should<00:01:13.320> kill<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
suggested that we should kill the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
suggested that we should kill the
sergeant<00:01:14.070> instead<00:01:14.340> almost<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
sergeant instead almost like a as a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.440 
sergeant instead almost like a as a
revenge<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.110> fasano<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:18.119> sounds<00:01:18.330> like<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
revenge for fasano so that sounds like a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.060 
revenge for fasano so that sounds like a
pretty<00:01:18.600> good<00:01:18.750> sort<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.290> contract<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.799> set<00:01:19.979> up

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
pretty good sort of contract to set up

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.050 
pretty good sort of contract to set up
so<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.430> we're<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.729> show<00:01:20.759> here

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
so that's what we're going to show here

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.980 
so that's what we're going to show here
we're<00:01:21.210> going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.390> actually<00:01:21.509> try<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.780> take

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
we're going to actually try and take

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.780 
we're going to actually try and take
down<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.320> sergeant

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.789 

basically<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:26.000> sergeant<00:01:26.930> Meyer<00:01:27.110> as<00:01:27.409> his<00:01:27.590> name

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
basically the sergeant Meyer as his name

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.130 
basically the sergeant Meyer as his name
is<00:01:28.009> turned<00:01:28.939> out<00:01:29.119> he<00:01:29.360> is<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.479> pretty<00:01:29.689> good<00:01:29.930> and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
is turned out he is a pretty good and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.319 
is turned out he is a pretty good and
interesting<00:01:30.470> target<00:01:31.040> within<00:01:31.369> this<00:01:31.610> part<00:01:32.270> of

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
interesting target within this part of

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.719 
interesting target within this part of
the<00:01:32.420> game<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:32.869> he<00:01:32.990> was<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.200> very<00:01:33.530> natural<00:01:33.799> part

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
the game so he was a very natural part

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.969 
the game so he was a very natural part
of<00:01:34.850> of<00:01:35.330> what<00:01:35.689> we<00:01:35.840> call<00:01:35.990> featured<00:01:36.409> contracts

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
of of what we call featured contracts

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.920 
of of what we call featured contracts
which<00:01:37.759> we<00:01:37.909> have<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.180> every<00:01:38.270> section<00:01:38.570> of<00:01:38.750> the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
which we have in every section of the

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:50.280 
which we have in every section of the
game

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.750 

there's<00:01:51.290> a<00:01:51.380> door<00:01:51.650> here<00:01:51.680> marked<00:01:52.190> at<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.400> exit

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
there's a door here marked at the exit

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.900 
there's a door here marked at the exit
which<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:53.270> different<00:01:53.720> one<00:01:53.870> from<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.170> story

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
which is a different one from the story

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.910 
which is a different one from the story
so<00:01:55.910> essentially<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:56.720> means<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:57.110> a<00:01:57.470> section

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
that was simply an like an A to B

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.620 
that was simply an like an A to B

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
you can see we have a small window of

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.920 
you can see we have a small window of
opportunity<00:04:50.380> where<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:52.360> sergeant<00:04:52.780> was

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
opportunity where the sergeant was

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.640 
opportunity where the sergeant was
unguarded<00:04:53.770> which<00:04:54.700> we<00:04:55.630> took<00:04:55.780> advantage<00:04:56.020> of<00:04:56.350> and

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
unguarded which we took advantage of and

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.400 
unguarded which we took advantage of and
trying<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.160> get<00:04:57.280> out<00:04:57.600> without<00:04:58.600> being<00:04:58.990> spotted

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
trying to get out without being spotted

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.260 
trying to get out without being spotted
here<00:05:00.040> you<00:05:00.310> can<00:05:00.460> see<00:05:00.610> there's<00:05:00.820> lots<00:05:01.120> of

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
here you can see there's lots of

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.860 
here you can see there's lots of
attention<00:05:01.450> of<00:05:01.810> on<00:05:02.020> on<00:05:02.860> us<00:05:03.480> but<00:05:04.480> it's<00:05:04.630> still

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
attention of on on us but it's still

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.110 
attention of on on us but it's still
possible<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:05.470> get<00:05:05.650> out<00:05:05.850> they're<00:05:06.850> probably

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
possible to get out they're probably

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.580 
possible to get out they're probably
going<00:05:07.330> to<00:05:07.420> find<00:05:07.570> his<00:05:07.750> body<00:05:07.900> pretty<00:05:08.200> soon<00:05:08.410> if

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
going to find his body pretty soon if

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.340 
going to find his body pretty soon if
they<00:05:08.650> didn't<00:05:08.950> do<00:05:09.010> it<00:05:09.040> already<00:05:10.080> which<00:05:11.080> makes

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
they didn't do it already which makes

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.900 
they didn't do it already which makes
things<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.800> little<00:05:11.890> more<00:05:12.220> difficult<00:05:12.460> and

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
things a little more difficult and

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.040 
things a little more difficult and
delicate<00:05:13.630> as<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:15.310> AI<00:05:15.450> the<00:05:16.450> patterns<00:05:16.810> of<00:05:16.960> the

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
way that they react is not really

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.010 
way that they react is not really

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
predictable in the way that you don't

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.110 
predictable in the way that you don't
know<00:05:32.140> where<00:05:32.470> they<00:05:32.650> will<00:05:32.800> go<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.220> if<00:05:33.640> they<00:05:33.880> send

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
know where they will go and if they send

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.610 
know where they will go and if they send
out<00:05:34.210> search<00:05:34.450> parties<00:05:34.480> after<00:05:35.140> you<00:05:35.200> it<00:05:35.320> actually

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
out search parties after you it actually

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.770 
out search parties after you it actually
gets<00:05:35.770> pretty<00:05:36.610> difficult<00:05:36.820> to<00:05:37.240> predict

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
gets pretty difficult to predict

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:45.380 
gets pretty difficult to predict
whatever<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.560> AI<00:05:38.650> is<00:05:38.890> up<00:05:39.040> to

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.930 

we<00:05:46.390> should<00:05:46.600> earn<00:05:46.830> a<00:05:47.830> pretty<00:05:48.220> big<00:05:48.400> payoff<00:05:48.730> here

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
we should earn a pretty big payoff here

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.180 
we should earn a pretty big payoff here
and<00:05:49.210> most<00:05:49.780> of<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.020> in<00:05:50.080> 47<00:05:50.590> seconds<00:05:50.920> as<00:05:51.040> well

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
and most of you in 47 seconds as well

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.460 
and most of you in 47 seconds as well
which<00:05:51.340> is<00:05:51.370> always<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:51.730> nice<00:05:51.910> touch<00:05:52.150> so<00:05:53.080> what

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
which is always a nice touch so what

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.570 
which is always a nice touch so what
we're<00:05:53.590> going<00:05:53.680> to<00:05:53.770> do<00:05:53.890> now<00:05:54.070> is<00:05:54.250> we're<00:05:54.400> going<00:05:54.520> to

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
we're going to do now is we're going to

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.910 
we're going to do now is we're going to
take<00:05:54.760> a<00:05:55.000> different<00:05:55.210> section<00:05:55.900> of<00:05:56.290> the<00:05:56.470> level

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
take a different section of the level

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.090 
take a different section of the level
that<00:05:57.010> we<00:05:57.130> first<00:05:57.340> showed<00:05:57.610> and<00:05:58.920> create<00:05:59.920> the

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
that we first showed and create the

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.730 
that we first showed and create the
contract<00:06:00.520> and
