00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
without having it bolted to something

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.830 
without having it bolted to something
it's<00:00:32.489> really<00:00:32.790> important<00:00:33.269> to<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.449> it<00:00:33.629> rolled

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
it's really important to have it rolled

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.630 
it's really important to have it rolled
into<00:00:34.050> something<00:00:34.500> shop<00:00:35.010> floor<00:00:35.400> would<00:00:35.610> be

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
into something shop floor would be

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.850 
into something shop floor would be
better<00:00:35.940> than<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.180> pallet<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> pallet<00:00:37.650> does

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
better than a pallet but a pallet does

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.450 
better than a pallet but a pallet does
work

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
work

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.410 
work
so<00:00:39.420> we've<00:00:40.140> already<00:00:40.260> broke<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.650> bead<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.610> so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
so we've already broke the bead and so

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.719 
so we've already broke the bead and so
now<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.900> got<00:00:43.049> a<00:00:43.080> tire<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.650> rim<00:00:43.799> which<00:00:44.549> is

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
now it's got a tire on the rim which is

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:46.460 
now it's got a tire on the rim which is
actually<00:00:45.089> the<00:00:45.180> easy<00:00:45.390> part<00:00:45.570> breaking<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.290> bead

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
actually the easy part breaking the bead

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.469 
actually the easy part breaking the bead
is<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.830> hard<00:00:47.100> part<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:48.299> the<00:00:48.540> tool<00:00:48.979> simply<00:00:50.479> into

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
is the hard part so the tool simply into

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:52.280 
is the hard part so the tool simply into
the<00:00:51.600> tire

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290
