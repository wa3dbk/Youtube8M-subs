little<00:00:47.280> bit<00:00:47.399> shorter<00:00:47.760> I've<00:00:47.879> edited<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.329> some

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
little bit shorter I've edited out some

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.900 
little bit shorter I've edited out some
parts<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:49.770> at<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.550> point<00:00:50.579> it

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
parts just because at one point it

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.970 
parts just because at one point it
eventually<00:00:51.149> gets<00:00:51.449> down<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.050> only<00:00:52.649> having

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
eventually gets down to only having

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.709 
eventually gets down to only having
three<00:00:53.160> teammates<00:00:53.760> which<00:00:54.090> slowed<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.539> game

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
three teammates which slowed the game

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.410 
three teammates which slowed the game
down<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.260> bit<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> kind<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.059> took<00:00:57.270> out

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
down a little bit so I kind of took out

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.760 
down a little bit so I kind of took out
some<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.719> more<00:00:57.870> boring<00:00:58.170> parts<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
some of the more boring parts and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.979 
some of the more boring parts and
altogether<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.059> commentary<00:01:00.510> doesn't<00:01:00.870> need
