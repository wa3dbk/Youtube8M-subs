side are asymmetric on the left side we

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.510 
side are asymmetric on the left side we
put<00:01:47.950> most<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.549> the<00:01:48.670> wirings<00:01:49.590> Ocwen<00:01:50.590> fuses<00:01:51.220> and

most of the things are put here that's

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.219 
most of the things are put here that's
why<00:01:54.430> this<00:01:54.670> side<00:01:54.909> is<00:01:55.060> bigger<00:01:55.240> than<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.659> right

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
why this side is bigger than the right
