00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.700
 hello friends welcome you to myself 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.360
 a flashlight and wanted to show you today how 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.840
 beautifully arrange 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.900
 iron pipe stand and make very 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.660
 that parquet screensaver 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.689
 wooden hexagon column which 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.210
 teaches and will merge with the floor in my 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.730
 case here and the promenade if this 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.260
 the marker bu on the floor then for even less was 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.079
 noticeably but we always 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.890
 quite discreetly and beautifully pretty 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.800
 entry from the red iron pipe now 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.370
 show you exactly the same pipe was 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.230
 This propping bask simply she as 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.370
 would be in this more lively place like you 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.910
 see this scary enough anymore 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.000
 trumpet 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.379
 I had to do I store 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.570
 saw such some sold 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.219
 finishing sets such that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.769
 served in 100 were worth it languages would 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.619
 ugly same time me just 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.040
 then parquet is made and stayed there 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:16.890
 quite a lot of boards like this 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.210
 there are somewhere September 9 centimeter over there 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.610
 I decided to make such a hexagon and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.530
 calculated with the reminders will sit that is 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.310
 this is our pipe was somewhere around eight 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.920
 and a half centimeters saints not in 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:35.009
 general and mental school knowledge we 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:37.020
 we draw a hexagon a little bit not painted 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.020
 well in total we get 6 cycles per 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.240
 all six corners we have 360 ​​degrees from on 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.860
 6 it turns out that we have each of the corners 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.549
 domestic ex-agronets 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.470
 so how are we doing here is the connection 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.720
 accordingly, it will be necessary to divide 60 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.110
 for another 2, that is 30 degrees 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.950
 30 degrees 30 degrees that is 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.290
 set to 2 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.840
 need to be exactly kind of played what 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.850
 get these here what get here 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.680
 these are ripe, that is, I will show you right now 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.100
 An example of how it looks about inside 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.660
 this pipe is basically even here 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.510
 spare see this pipe could have been 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.320
 a thicker pipe it wrap means these 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.280
 this three and a half inch strips 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.910
 here is the surface itself 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.740
 try on and thito tito 80 meters and 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.560
 a couple of millimeters that have been here for more 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.890
 there is a stock if you see a principle 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.560
 shot at least significantly that video 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.050
 short we can a little bit here i wanted 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.690
 talk again about such a quick 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.110
 here is a digital protractor I can not 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.010
 rejoice this is one of the former 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.630
 mongrel need space up to 300 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.880
 dollars my workshop 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.520
 I have already seen that the guys and Andrei Markevich 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.530
 such you bought them yard misha bought 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.600
 and a amar 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.370
 rand right also showed in my opinion 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.860
 such a thing too i mean i see that 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.610
 already almost all got them 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.090
 Well here I highly recommend it and have her 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.080
 accuracy to the tenth degree 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.600
 features you make any there 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.360
 boxes of caskets where they are very necessary 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.070
 exact here are these cuts for services 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.830
 Of course such accuracy as in the boxes 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.910
 there is no need but at least the most important 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.670
 so that you make the angle as close as possible to 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.980
 Zna how to find 60 degrees or 30 minutes 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.650
 which side to look at yourself saying 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.810
 you're always the main thing he was not 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.799
 dumber than 30 because if he will 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.799
 dumber than 30 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.320
 301 say there is a problem starts here 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.030
 what can he begin to mean 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.220
 open connection that is you 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.540
 there will be a little sharper there say 29 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.970
 half this is nothing i 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.580
 will open inside but it's not so scary 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.920
 Ie 100 vshivkova closes when we 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.360
 put the side four then so here. 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.450
 . right here so 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.830
 the theory that nettle and of course the body need 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.790
 will lower a little bit it's just in 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.280
 for the purpose of setting so and strongly raised and 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.330
 that's just the most like to here 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.130
 you can see a little bit even 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.770
 vak curled in the corner of his own 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.780
 such make cut well of course if you 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.670
 need more subtly whom he there it will be 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.650
 no longer applicable or say if you 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.760
 parquet used which is not covered 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.650
 until then yes it will be it at all 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.160
 disgrace that we need at 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.830
 gluing together 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.570
 it is very desirable to have 2 doorstep me not 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.890
 was I somehow managed 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.200
 one do it well it was very 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.200
 uncomfortable say one 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.550
 that is, when you when it's all 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.650
 glued together 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.450
 it is desirable to have some sort of such 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.460
 hammer with very thin such 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.970
 carnations 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:47.110
 I just make electrical tape 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.030
 it is desirable to have another such paint 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.640
 i.e. first smear here with glue 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.560
 I grab the tape like this 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.030
 those tavistok evernote seeds along and 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.110
 such is so grabbed 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.310
 This is for the fact that then I am wider 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.729
 little body with will not be already 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:08.930
 and this is such a width let's say I did 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:12.880
 and 6 somewhere places all by them and then 100 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:23.330
 just the tape was not glued to the tree and 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:25.370
 then here's how the cup is so right that so 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.930
 turns of 2030 so she just 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.290
 specifically pulled in this place she 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.240
 pretty big so form 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.220
 experience because every turn there 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.370
 Adds a couple of kilos 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.080
 let's say compression 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.880
 at home you are twisting though 123 become such 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.340
 stretch on the verge of a foul already on the verge 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.800
 gap it is clear that it is because 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.780
 tightened captain that is every seam 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.780
 even when she was 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.840
 glued it just seams generally still there 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.610
 when the spirit of the future even thought it was not 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.830
 get so soon straight right and everything is well 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.720
 just not find anything out so much this 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.810
 the design is firmly on top so small 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.990
 there and me with carnations too under 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:12.139
 under this and so basically everything keeps 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.220
 glue on a vest 8 but worth all the problems 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:18.070
 type did not go 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:20.090
 that is, and this did not become that is 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.090
 just show you the conclusion 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:25.310
 approximately as from such parquet which 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:29.139
 dressed you're talking on top of somewhere to 80 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:32.270
 centimeters and here it turns out inside she 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:35.210
 you see somewhere inside size 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.100
 is obtained by the positions of labor that is in it 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.430
 it will be possible to hold everything there 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.199
 it will be between 11 and 12 mm 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:46.910
 1 and a half centimeters on there you can 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:49.370
 put in 11 just like those times I repeat 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.830
 that there is nothing complicated in general 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.710
 absolutely no, and perhaps the most important thing 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.940
 do it just enough accurate 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.419
 along the whole 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:03.110
 as if the boards so that Barry’s parquet 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:05.690
 much like propellers and that the angle was 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.270
 it was approaching those ones as close as possible and 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.130
 definitely not more than 30 degrees i.e. if 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:13.010
 there will be scared less than a recipe 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:17.450
 nothing but everything will be greater than that type of goal 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:19.330
 most gather at 6 corners and start 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:23.860
 stitches will start to form 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:26.240
 that's all do not regret 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.340
 tape when you're moto this and 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.720
 bigger place six seven eight places 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.090
 that's the way along the column 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.060
 grab how do you feel that 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:37.250
 you will feel that there will be even 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.370
 you can see how the glue will start right out of 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:43.130
 I applied some stitches just worth to 

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.050
 her by type pva like tytbond 1 or that 

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.849
 band 2 I do not remember exactly but of course 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.560
 if there you have no mouth and grow big 

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:51.590
 put it into a boutique because the case 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.810
 This he me tame those so damp and here is 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.479
 already yellow such a taytbond 2 he has and 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.729
 my thirst and grow into this gray there already 

00:07:56.479 --> 00:08:02.569
 just need to buy more 

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:04.360
 they are gay 

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:08.559
 share such a little trick 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.559
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
