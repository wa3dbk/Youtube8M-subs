everybody mic back here part two of how

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.470 
everybody mic back here part two of how
to<00:00:02.850> solve<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.360> Rubik's<00:00:03.750> Cube<00:00:04.609> part<00:00:05.609> one<00:00:05.790> we

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
to solve a Rubik's Cube part one we

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.629 
to solve a Rubik's Cube part one we
solved<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.930> top<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.770> left<00:00:07.980> one<00:00:08.189> out<00:00:08.220> for<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
solved the top you left one out for the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.549 
solved the top you left one out for the
case<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.150> we<00:00:09.269> can<00:00:09.480> do<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.750> bottom<00:00:09.900> all<00:00:10.410> right

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
case and we can do the bottom all right

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.000 
case and we can do the bottom all right
then

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
in the back here this becomes the top

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.830 
in the back here this becomes the top
and<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.340> bottom<00:00:29.460> becomes<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> side<00:00:30.330> because

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and the bottom becomes the side because

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
this is on the wrong side this cube

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.240 
this is on the wrong side this cube
belongs<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.620> belongs<00:00:52.949> here

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
belongs here and this one belongs here

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.180 
belongs here and this one belongs here
so<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.870> first<00:00:55.140> maneuver<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.039> we're

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
so on the first maneuver that we're

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.099 
so on the first maneuver that we're
going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.430> learn<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> bottom<00:00:57.539> portion<00:00:57.750> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
going to learn for the bottom portion of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.650 
going to learn for the bottom portion of
the<00:00:58.199> puzzle<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.820> all<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.210> maneuver

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the puzzle and this is all this maneuver

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.720 
the puzzle and this is all this maneuver
does<00:01:00.870> without<00:01:01.350> messing<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.070> topic<00:01:02.280> takes

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
does without messing up the topic takes

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
does without messing up the topic takes
the<00:01:03.239> top<00:01:03.480> two<00:01:03.809> from<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.140> perspective<00:01:04.409> these

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the top two from this perspective these

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.000 
the top two from this perspective these
top<00:01:05.159> two<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.530> switches<00:01:07.530> them<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.830> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
top two and switches them like that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.300 
top two and switches them like that
without<00:01:08.820> messing<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> top<00:01:09.869> okay<00:01:10.830> now

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
without messing up the top okay now

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.080 
without messing up the top okay now
here's<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.640> pattern<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> switch<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:14.090> down

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
here's that pattern to switch these down

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.940 
here's that pattern to switch these down
there

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
there

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.580 
there
bring<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> face<00:01:17.310> back<00:01:17.960> put<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.110> back<00:01:19.350> up

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
bring the face back put this back up

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.480 
bring the face back put this back up
here<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:22.290> want<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.220> piece<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
here now you want to get this piece that

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550 
here now you want to get this piece that
came<00:01:23.729> from<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> top<00:01:24.030> turn<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.080> hides<00:01:25.350> it

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
came from the top turn it so it hides it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.330 
came from the top turn it so it hides it
back<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:26.090> turn<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:28.979> made<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
back there turn this you just made the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.530 
back there turn this you just made the
switch<00:01:29.579> now<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.030> want<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> put<00:01:30.360> everything

right<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.890> this<00:01:55.890> move<00:01:56.689> when<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.810> don't<00:01:57.990> have

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
right here this move when you don't have

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.560 
right here this move when you don't have
any<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.530> or<00:01:58.740> yawa<00:01:59.040> just<00:02:00.000> hold<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> cube

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
any of that or yawa just hold the cube

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.719 
any of that or yawa just hold the cube
there<00:02:00.719> remember<00:02:01.110> here's<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> white<00:02:01.799> lift<00:02:02.579> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
there remember here's the white lift it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.130 
there remember here's the white lift it
back<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.090> you're<00:02:03.210> dealing<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.719> bottom

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
back so you're dealing with the bottom

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560 
back so you're dealing with the bottom
at<00:02:04.259> your<00:02:04.439> face<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> maneuver<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
at your face this is the maneuver to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.229 
at your face this is the maneuver to
just<00:02:06.780> flip<00:02:07.079> these<00:02:07.229> blocks<00:02:07.680> around<00:02:08.149> until<00:02:09.149> they

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
just flip these blocks around until they

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.089 
just flip these blocks around until they
get<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.479> right<00:02:09.629> color<00:02:09.869> when<00:02:10.530> there's<00:02:10.709> no<00:02:10.860> car

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
get the right color when there's no car

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.949 
get the right color when there's no car
to<00:02:11.280> go<00:02:11.430> by<00:02:11.640> if<00:02:11.849> there<00:02:12.000> was<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.209> yellow<00:02:12.510> you

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
to go by if there was one yellow you

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.890 
to go by if there was one yellow you
keep<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.290> down<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.560> bottom

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
keep it down the bottom

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.449 
keep it down the bottom
my<00:02:13.959> corner<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.439> it<00:02:14.560> would<00:02:14.650> solve<00:02:14.829> it<00:02:15.040> one<00:02:15.189> try

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
my corner and it would solve it one try

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.059 
my corner and it would solve it one try
sometimes<00:02:16.239> you<00:02:16.420> get<00:02:16.540> two<00:02:16.810> sometimes<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:17.980> get

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
sometimes you get two sometimes you get

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.780 
sometimes you get two sometimes you get
two<00:02:18.250> up<00:02:18.430> here<00:02:19.290> when<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.379> get<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.680> up<00:02:20.860> here<00:02:21.099> you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
two up here when you get to up here you

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.220 
two up here when you get to up here you
do<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.000> maneuver<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.450> couple<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.780> times<00:02:22.989> until

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
do the maneuver a couple of times until

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.899 
do the maneuver a couple of times until
you<00:02:23.439> get<00:02:23.560> one<00:02:23.709> yell<00:02:23.920> but<00:02:24.159> anyway<00:02:24.489> let's<00:02:24.760> just

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
you get one yell but anyway let's just

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.089 
you get one yell but anyway let's just
start<00:02:25.180> right<00:02:25.480> from<00:02:25.510> here<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.019> this<00:02:26.829> is<00:02:27.010> the

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
start right from here and this is the

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.050 
start right from here and this is the
manoeuvre<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.610> switch<00:02:27.879> the<00:02:28.390> blocks<00:02:28.629> around

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
manoeuvre to switch the blocks around

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.679 
manoeuvre to switch the blocks around
top<00:02:31.980> back<00:02:32.980> clockwise<00:02:33.599> top<00:02:34.599> back<00:02:35.430> lock<00:02:36.430> wise

top back clockwise top back lock wise

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.360 
top back clockwise top back lock wise
then<00:02:37.689> you<00:02:37.750> put<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.109> piece<00:02:38.319> back<00:02:38.349> bring<00:02:39.189> this

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
then you put the piece back bring this

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.369 
then you put the piece back bring this
down<00:02:39.609> match<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.450> piece<00:02:40.689> that<00:02:40.900> let's<00:02:41.079> go<00:02:41.290> up

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
down match the piece that let's go up

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:48.330 
down match the piece that let's go up
here<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:43.510> say<00:02:45.629> done<00:02:46.629> now<00:02:47.590> look<00:02:47.799> see<00:02:48.129> now<00:02:48.280> we

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
here to say done now look see now we

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.369 
here to say done now look see now we
have<00:02:48.549> one<00:02:48.730> yellow<00:02:48.970> whenever<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:49.989> one<00:02:50.260> of

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
have one yellow whenever you have one of

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.449 
have one yellow whenever you have one of
the<00:02:50.470> colors<00:02:50.859> on<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.000> center<00:02:52.769> always<00:02:53.769> have<00:02:54.250> it

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
the colors on the center always have it

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.509 
the colors on the center always have it
to<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.790> bottom<00:02:55.120> right<00:02:55.560> okay<00:02:56.560> once<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.400> do

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
to the bottom right okay once you do

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.879 
to the bottom right okay once you do
that<00:02:57.549> you<00:02:58.239> do<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.540> maneuver<00:02:58.750> again<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.470> these

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
that you do the maneuver again and these

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:09.990 
that you do the maneuver again and these
should<00:03:00.069> come<00:03:00.250> out<00:03:00.459> now<00:03:08.220> there<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.400> go<00:03:09.549> you<00:03:09.909> got

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
should come out now there you go you got

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.270 
should come out now there you go you got
all<00:03:10.150> your<00:03:10.359> corners<00:03:10.750> bottom<00:03:11.200> corners<00:03:11.560> done<00:03:11.709> now

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
all your corners bottom corners done now

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.009 
all your corners bottom corners done now
sometimes<00:03:12.790> it's<00:03:13.030> easier<00:03:13.359> sometimes<00:03:13.599> you<00:03:13.900> got

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
sometimes it's easier sometimes you got

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.020 
sometimes it's easier sometimes you got
to<00:03:14.049> do<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.319> few<00:03:14.500> more<00:03:14.650> times<00:03:14.709> play<00:03:15.700> with<00:03:15.939> it

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
to do it a few more times play with it

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.670 
to do it a few more times play with it
until<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.359> understand<00:03:16.989> how<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.230> pattern

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
until you understand how the pattern

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.050 
until you understand how the pattern
works<00:03:17.859> so<00:03:18.069> you<00:03:18.190> know<00:03:18.340> where<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.579> pieces<00:03:18.910> need

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
works so you know where the pieces need

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.210 
works so you know where the pieces need
to<00:03:19.120> be<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.629> solve<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.989> bottom<00:03:20.260> quickly<00:03:20.590> okay

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
to be to solve the bottom quickly okay

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.979 
to be to solve the bottom quickly okay
you<00:03:21.609> know<00:03:21.730> which<00:03:21.879> way<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.090> turn<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.480> before<00:03:22.750> you

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
you know which way to turn it before you

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.869 
you know which way to turn it before you
start<00:03:23.230> your<00:03:23.349> pattern<00:03:23.650> okay<00:03:24.160> just<00:03:24.519> practice

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
start your pattern okay just practice

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.930 
start your pattern okay just practice
now<00:03:25.680> what<00:03:26.680> we're<00:03:26.829> gonna<00:03:26.980> do<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.699> we're<00:03:27.849> gonna

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.759 
now what we're gonna do is we're gonna
solve<00:03:28.269> for<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.599> centers<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.169> mean<00:03:29.620> they're

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
solve for the centers I mean they're

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.170 
solve for the centers I mean they're
here<00:03:30.010> but<00:03:30.099> they're<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.340> wrong<00:03:30.459> colors<00:03:30.819> the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
here but they're the wrong colors the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.939 
here but they're the wrong colors the
way<00:03:31.329> you<00:03:31.389> do<00:03:31.629> that<00:03:31.810> is<00:03:31.989> use<00:03:32.169> this<00:03:32.379> kick<00:03:32.680> so

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
way you do that is use this kick so

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.170 
way you do that is use this kick so
let's<00:03:33.129> flip<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.579> cube<00:03:34.359> back<00:03:34.659> up<00:03:34.870> alright

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
let's flip the cube back up alright

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.229 
let's flip the cube back up alright
there's<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.359> white<00:03:37.540> now<00:03:38.290> I'm<00:03:38.440> gonna<00:03:38.680> find<00:03:38.949> a

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
there's the white now I'm gonna find a

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.640 
there's the white now I'm gonna find a
yellow<00:03:40.239> somewhere<00:03:40.870> here<00:03:41.230> we<00:03:41.349> go

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
yellow somewhere here we go

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.680 
yellow somewhere here we go
blue<00:03:41.829> Nieves<00:03:42.280> yells<00:03:42.459> on<00:03:42.609> the<00:03:42.699> bottom<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.629> know

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
blue Nieves yells on the bottom you know

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.319 
blue Nieves yells on the bottom you know
is<00:03:43.870> looking<00:03:44.169> for<00:03:44.379> this<00:03:44.739> strip

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
is looking for this strip

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.330 
is looking for this strip
so<00:03:46.329> I'll<00:03:46.389> bring<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:46.750> around<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:47.199> the<00:03:47.229> key<00:03:47.560> see

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
so I'll bring it around to the key see

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.860 
so I'll bring it around to the key see
the<00:03:48.489> yellow<00:03:48.729> the<00:03:48.970> part<00:03:49.209> on<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.389> bottom<00:03:49.569> that<00:03:49.810> I

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870

happen to go in there good luck you got
one<00:05:18.070> more<00:05:18.310> left<00:05:19.290> now<00:05:20.290> this<00:05:20.590> is<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:20.800> little<00:05:21.220> bit

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
one more left now this is a little bit

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.220 
one more left now this is a little bit
of<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.550> pattern<00:05:21.820> that<00:05:22.830> is<00:05:23.830> easy<00:05:24.310> for<00:05:24.700> for<00:05:25.390> when

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
of a pattern that is easy for for when

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.850 
of a pattern that is easy for for when
there's<00:05:26.410> one<00:05:26.560> left

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
there's one left

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.650 
there's one left
here's<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.280> way<00:05:27.400> you<00:05:27.460> do<00:05:27.700> it<00:05:27.820> to<00:05:28.120> find<00:05:28.300> a<00:05:28.450> color

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
here's the way you do it to find a color

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.910 
here's the way you do it to find a color
that's<00:05:28.870> on<00:05:28.960> top<00:05:29.200> you<00:05:29.470> want<00:05:29.620> to<00:05:29.680> bring<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:29.890> to

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
that's on top you want to bring it to

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.590 
that's on top you want to bring it to
the<00:05:30.070> face<00:05:30.250> like<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.580> other<00:05:30.730> way<00:05:30.880> see<00:05:31.420> that

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
the face like the other way see that

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.330 
the face like the other way see that
right<00:05:31.720> there<00:05:31.750> just<00:05:32.620> bring<00:05:32.860> it<00:05:32.980> over<00:05:33.040> here<00:05:33.190> to

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
right there just bring it over here to

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.240 
right there just bring it over here to
the<00:05:33.520> face<00:05:33.670> there<00:05:34.480> we<00:05:34.600> go<00:05:34.750> now<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.950> way<00:05:36.100> it

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
the face there we go now the way it

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.460 
the face there we go now the way it
works<00:05:36.460> is<00:05:36.730> if<00:05:37.330> it's<00:05:37.540> on<00:05:37.660> this<00:05:37.780> side<00:05:37.840> turn<00:05:38.290> this

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
works is if it's on this side turn this

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.260 
works is if it's on this side turn this

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
it'll be two more patterns to solve the

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.920 
it'll be two more patterns to solve the
center

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930
