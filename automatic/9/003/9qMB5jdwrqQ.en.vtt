00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
bottom is already glued so it has a

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.260 
bottom is already glued so it has a
special<00:00:33.530> lure<00:00:33.980> that<00:00:34.100> will<00:00:34.399> glue<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.760> box<00:00:34.969> this

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
special lure that will glue the box this

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.050 
special lure that will glue the box this
way<00:00:35.539> and<00:00:35.840> then<00:00:36.410> this<00:00:36.649> way<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:37.670> when

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
hold a little bit of weight and then you

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.940 
hold a little bit of weight and then you
get<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.000> top<00:00:50.210> set<00:00:50.540> up<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.960> it's<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.500> tuck<00:00:51.710> top

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
get the top set up and it's the tuck top

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.880 
get the top set up and it's the tuck top
for<00:00:52.700> folding<00:00:53.060> it<00:00:53.149> in<00:00:53.239> like<00:00:53.420> this

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
for folding it in like this

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.160 
for folding it in like this
click<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.760> it's<00:00:55.880> a<00:00:55.940> tuck<00:00:56.180> top<00:00:56.450> Autobot<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.110> I

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
click so it's a tuck top Autobot and I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.710 
click so it's a tuck top Autobot and I
would<00:00:57.350> say<00:00:57.590> that<00:00:57.920> half<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.910> boxes<00:00:59.390> we<00:00:59.510> make

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
would say that half the boxes we make

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.420 
would say that half the boxes we make
for<00:00:59.899> retail<00:01:00.230> applications<00:01:00.829> or<00:01:01.010> this<00:01:01.160> style

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
for retail applications or this style

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.999 
for retail applications or this style
and<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.450> reason<00:01:02.780> again<00:01:02.870> for<00:01:03.380> it<00:01:03.440> is<00:01:03.559> it's<00:01:03.860> a

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
and the reason again for it is it's a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.399 
and the reason again for it is it's a
speed<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:04.699> you<00:01:05.089> can<00:01:05.299> use<00:01:05.600> that<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.899> can<00:01:06.049> lock

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
speed that you can use that you can lock

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.380 
speed that you can use that you can lock
it<00:01:06.649> into<00:01:06.829> place<00:01:07.100> on<00:01:07.460> an<00:01:07.700> assembly<00:01:08.000> line<00:01:08.180> and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
it into place on an assembly line and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.350 
it into place on an assembly line and
it's<00:01:09.200> got<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.560> security<00:01:09.950> on<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.370> bottom<00:01:10.729> you

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
it's got the security on the bottom you

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.210 
it's got the security on the bottom you
wouldn't<00:01:11.960> want<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.229> use<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:12.680> if<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:12.979> were

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
wouldn't want to use this if you were

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.039 
wouldn't want to use this if you were
gonna<00:01:13.340> put<00:01:13.580> high<00:01:13.790> graphics<00:01:14.390> on<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.720> bottom

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
gonna put high graphics on the bottom

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.050 
gonna put high graphics on the bottom
you<00:01:15.170> need<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.530> space<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:16.610> can<00:01:16.760> see<00:01:16.909> you

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
you need it that space you can see you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.730 
you need it that space you can see you
still<00:01:17.360> have<00:01:17.570> some<00:01:17.780> space<00:01:17.930> there's<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.440> barcode

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
still have some space there's a barcode

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.310 
still have some space there's a barcode
on<00:01:18.979> here<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:20.420> could<00:01:20.630> put<00:01:20.780> some<00:01:20.990> different

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
on here you could put some different

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.810 
on here you could put some different
things<00:01:21.440> in<00:01:21.680> here<00:01:21.860> but<00:01:22.040> having<00:01:22.280> like<00:01:22.520> full

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
things in here but having like full

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.710 
things in here but having like full
graphics<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.840> little<00:01:24.350> bit<00:01:24.470> tricky<00:01:25.570> but<00:01:26.570> it

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
graphics a little bit tricky but it

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.690 
graphics a little bit tricky but it
steps<00:01:26.900> up<00:01:27.140> nice<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.650> sits<00:01:27.920> flat<00:01:28.369> on<00:01:28.640> a

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
steps up nice it sits flat on a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.390 
steps up nice it sits flat on a
countertop<00:01:29.060> like<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.680> it's<00:01:30.860> like<00:01:31.159> I<00:01:31.190> say

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
countertop like that and it's like I say

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.950 
countertop like that and it's like I say
it's<00:01:31.549> secure<00:01:31.940> so<00:01:32.119> those<00:01:32.270> are<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.540> two<00:01:32.720> big

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
it's secure so those are the two big

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.700 
it's secure so those are the two big
reasons<00:01:33.170> speed<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.100> security<00:01:35.229> anyway<00:01:36.229> if<00:01:36.530> you

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
reasons speed and security anyway if you

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.260 
reasons speed and security anyway if you
think<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:37.100> might<00:01:37.280> need<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:37.520> tuck<00:01:37.850> top<00:01:38.030> on<00:01:38.240> a

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
think you might need a tuck top on a

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.570 
think you might need a tuck top on a
bottom<00:01:38.689> we<00:01:38.869> could<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.890> know<00:01:39.920> structurally
