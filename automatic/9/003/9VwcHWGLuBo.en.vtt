00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.230
 very good carries the extra tag and 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.299
 I hope that this great perfectly 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.820
 welcome to a new video on my channel 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.550
 we are in the fourth and last episode 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:28.000
 of sipe I walk with the four of us 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.590
 x 50 pr semiautomatic sniper and 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.150
 first blood that we actually take 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.890
 we are playing a game since always 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.989
 I usually play in the domain and I was 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.040
 coming out to take bravo, that is, I was 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.140
 going to take bravo 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.530
 but it's not all by teams there's no bragg 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.530
 or what to take 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.430
 they are coming out from behind 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:52.470
 we are going to plant an infection here 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.470
 target tactics 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.310
 or get in here 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.930
 I know back there semiautomatic goal scorer 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.890
 what 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.050
 normally kills a shot normally to 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.750
 unless you give it to the party for the 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.680
 lower parts normally usually kill 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.680
 one shot 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.579
 this good is a good position with 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.159
 the insertion is because if they change 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.569
 spawn from one place to another as always 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.020
 you can decide to leave to the left 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.800
 sun and to the right 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.490
 and now I'm getting everything 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.409
 everything here if we get into the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.030
 good site 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.960
 once you have nothing in nothing and here 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.960
 we are we are 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.979
 I will not go out 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.400
 my team's is a chimera have broken 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.480
 this bread is broken 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.480

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.100

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.240
 well that's what I want 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.230
 in fact, how to put the salt is the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.939
 solution 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.939
 And I felt 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.320

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.000

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.000
 lucid lights 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 when 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.590

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.920

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.510
 snipers that I like 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.860

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.140
