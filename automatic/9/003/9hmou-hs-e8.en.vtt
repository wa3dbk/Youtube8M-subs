hi<00:00:11.160> everyone<00:00:11.610> I've<00:00:12.090> had<00:00:12.389> several<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.900> you

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
hi everyone I've had several of you

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.560 
hi everyone I've had several of you
write<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.830> me<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.040> ask<00:00:14.280> me<00:00:14.490> how<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.179> made<00:00:15.389> my

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
write to me and ask me how I made my

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.599 
write to me and ask me how I made my
pyramid<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> thought<00:00:17.279> I'd<00:00:17.430> put

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
pyramid and so I thought I'd put

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.420 
pyramid and so I thought I'd put
together<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.970> tutorial<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.869> show<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.529> how<00:00:20.369> to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
together a tutorial and show you how to

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.790 
together a tutorial and show you how to
construct<00:00:20.699> one<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.270> your<00:00:21.390> own<00:00:21.529> first<00:00:22.529> I'll

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
construct one of your own first I'll

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.279 
construct one of your own first I'll
show<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.490> finished<00:00:23.730> piece<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:25.140> is

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
show you the finished piece and this is

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.279 
show you the finished piece and this is
it<00:00:25.439> here<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.949> as<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.539> opens<00:00:27.869> up

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
it here and as you can see it opens up

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.849 
it here and as you can see it opens up
and<00:00:29.390> on<00:00:30.390> your<00:00:30.570> base<00:00:30.779> here<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.590> put<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
and on your base here I have put a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.670 
and on your base here I have put a
message<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.420> all<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:33.989> constructed

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
message and it's all really constructed

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.290 
message and it's all really constructed
of<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.579> piece<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.180> cardstock<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.969> let<00:00:39.180> me

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
of just one piece of cardstock so let me

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.139 
of just one piece of cardstock so let me
set<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.690> aside<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.469> show<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> how<00:00:41.940> it's

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
set this aside and show you how it's

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.440 
set this aside and show you how it's
made<00:00:42.620> you'll<00:00:43.620> need<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.980> start<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.579> two

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
made you'll need to start with two

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.200 
made you'll need to start with two
squares<00:00:46.260> now<00:00:46.890> I'm<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.579> template

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
squares now I'm going to make a template

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.830 
squares now I'm going to make a template
is<00:00:48.360> what<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.600> doing<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.539> depending<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.660> how

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
is what I'm doing and depending on how

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.770 
is what I'm doing and depending on how
big<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.289> want<00:00:52.320> your<00:00:52.649> pyramid<00:00:53.460> that's<00:00:54.390> how<00:00:54.629> big

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
big you want your pyramid that's how big

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.819 
big you want your pyramid that's how big
you<00:00:54.899> make<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.199> squares

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you make your squares

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.990 
you make your squares
I<00:00:55.860> made<00:00:56.219> my<00:00:56.430> squares<00:00:56.820> four<00:00:57.210> inches<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.579> can

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
I made my squares four inches so you can

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.790 
I made my squares four inches so you can
make<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.480> smaller<00:01:00.840> especially<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.649> want

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
make your smaller especially if you want

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.889 
make your smaller especially if you want
to<00:01:01.949> use<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.460> twelve<00:01:02.760> by<00:01:02.940> twelve<00:01:02.969> piece<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.660> paper

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to use a twelve by twelve piece of paper

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.020 
to use a twelve by twelve piece of paper
you'll<00:01:04.530> probably<00:01:04.739> want<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> make<00:01:05.220> them<00:01:05.460> three

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you'll probably want to make them three

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.050 
you'll probably want to make them three
inch<00:01:06.180> squares<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.500> put<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.250> aside<00:01:08.549> that's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
inch squares so put one aside that's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.359 
inch squares so put one aside that's
going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.540> base<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> second

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
going to be your base and on the second

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.340 
going to be your base and on the second
one<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.760> want<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.049> want<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
one what you want to do if you want to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.469 
one what you want to do if you want to
put<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> mark<00:01:13.890> along<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> edges<00:01:14.580> at<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
put a mark along one of the edges at the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.749 
put a mark along one of the edges at the
halfway<00:01:15.689> point<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.740> since<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.430> four

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
halfway point so since this is a four

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.600 
halfway point so since this is a four
inch<00:01:18.000> square<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.890> put<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> little

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
inch square I'm going to put a little

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.370 
inch square I'm going to put a little
mark<00:01:20.909> here<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> top<00:01:21.890> at<00:01:22.890> two<00:01:23.220> inches<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
mark here at the top at two inches and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.840 
mark here at the top at two inches and
then<00:01:25.380> I'm<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.680> draw<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> line<00:01:26.310> from<00:01:26.640> this

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
then I'm going to draw a line from this

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.450 
then I'm going to draw a line from this
corner<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.659> corner<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:29.220> two

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
corner in this corner up to that two

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.260 
corner in this corner up to that two
inch<00:01:29.670> mark

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
inch mark

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.170 
inch mark
so<00:01:30.509> put<00:01:30.900> my<00:01:30.990> ruler<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.909> put<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> other

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
so put my ruler on it and put the other

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.850 
so put my ruler on it and put the other
end<00:01:33.420> down<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> corner<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:36.740> do<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
end down here on the corner and do the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.280 
end down here on the corner and do the
same<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> other<00:01:38.369> side<00:01:38.610> here

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.620 

so<00:01:44.010> essentially<00:01:44.400> you've<00:01:44.670> got<00:01:44.850> your<00:01:45.060> triangle

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
so essentially you've got your triangle

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.890 
so essentially you've got your triangle
here<00:01:46.940> hold<00:01:47.940> it<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.120> to<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> camera<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.810> can

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
here hold it up to the camera so you can

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.470 
here hold it up to the camera so you can
see<00:01:49.260> how<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.980> just<00:01:50.040> did<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.330> you're

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
see how I just did that and now you're

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.570 
see how I just did that and now you're
going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.690> cut<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.170> out<00:01:52.440> when<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.370> get<00:01:53.490> it

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
going to cut this out when you get it

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.670 
going to cut this out when you get it
cut<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:53.910> it's<00:01:54.150> going<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.390> obviously<00:01:54.680> look

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
cut out it's going to obviously look

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.650 
cut out it's going to obviously look
like<00:01:55.890> this

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
like this

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.510 
like this
okay<00:01:57.660> now<00:01:57.930> these<00:01:58.110> are<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.350> basic<00:01:59.040> pieces<00:01:59.190> you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
okay now these are the basic pieces you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.930 
okay now these are the basic pieces you
need<00:01:59.730> to<00:01:59.970> make<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.600> draw<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:01.050> your<00:02:01.260> pyramid<00:02:01.940> so

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
need to make to draw out your pyramid so

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.230 
need to make to draw out your pyramid so
now<00:02:03.120> you<00:02:03.180> need<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.450> big<00:02:04.080> piece<00:02:04.260> of<00:02:04.290> paper<00:02:05.240> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
now you need a big piece of paper and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.660 
now you need a big piece of paper and
you're<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.900> first<00:02:07.320> lay<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.310> square

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
you're going to first lay your square

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.740 
you're going to first lay your square
down<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.710> draw<00:02:10.710> around<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:13.520> oops<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.790> I'm

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
down and draw around that oops and I'm

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.420 
down and draw around that oops and I'm
trying<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.080> go<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> little<00:02:16.470> fast<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:17.010> camera

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
trying to go a little fast on camera

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.370 
trying to go a little fast on camera
here<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.670> my<00:02:18.360> lines<00:02:18.600> might<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:19.020> be<00:02:19.140> real

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
here so my lines might not be real

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.120 
here so my lines might not be real
straight<00:02:19.770> but<00:02:20.160> you'll<00:02:20.910> get<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> idea<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:22.130> now

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
straight but you'll get the idea and now

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.190 
straight but you'll get the idea and now
take<00:02:23.400> your<00:02:23.550> triangle<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.360> you're<00:02:25.050> going<00:02:25.170> to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
take your triangle and you're going to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.640 
take your triangle and you're going to
line<00:02:25.500> you'll<00:02:25.950> notice<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:28.140> base<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
line you'll notice that the base of the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.930 
line you'll notice that the base of the
triangle<00:02:28.890> you're<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.430> line<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.730> up

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
triangle you're going to line that up

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.120 
triangle you're going to line that up
with<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:31.200> top<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.890> your<00:02:32.460> square<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.709> you're

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
with the top of your square and you're

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.750 
with the top of your square and you're
going<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> draw<00:02:35.550> your<00:02:35.730> triangle<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:38.430> get<00:02:38.580> done

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760

it kind of looks like a house and now
you're<00:02:41.280> going<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.490> line<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:42.540> line<00:02:42.840> up<00:02:43.110> with

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
you're going to line this line up with

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.120 
you're going to line this line up with
the<00:02:43.650> edge<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.950> your<00:02:44.100> triangle<00:02:44.370> over<00:02:44.610> here<00:02:45.090> and

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
out of some lightweight cardboard and

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.870 
out of some lightweight cardboard and
you<00:06:17.539> can<00:06:17.690> save<00:06:17.990> those<00:06:18.259> and<00:06:18.590> use<00:06:19.280> them<00:06:19.490> as<00:06:19.729> your
