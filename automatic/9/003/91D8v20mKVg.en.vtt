00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the grommets will be placed we simply

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.709 
the grommets will be placed we simply
cut<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> strip<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.680> material<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.030> hemmed

the edges and then sewed it to the top

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.750 
the edges and then sewed it to the top
to<00:00:45.300> create<00:00:45.739> reinforcement<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> curtain

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
to create reinforcement for the curtain

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.299 
to create reinforcement for the curtain
grommets<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.989> grommet<00:00:49.410> should<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.710> placed<00:00:50.070> in

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
grommets the grommet should be placed in

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.580 
grommets the grommet should be placed in
at<00:00:50.430> least<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.879> 4-inch<00:00:51.329> header<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.989> two<00:00:52.350> layers

at least a 4-inch header and two layers

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.639 
at least a 4-inch header and two layers
is<00:00:52.920> sufficient<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.850> reinforcement<00:00:54.649> then

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
is sufficient for a reinforcement then

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.619 
is sufficient for a reinforcement then
on<00:00:55.890> all<00:00:56.190> three<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> other<00:00:56.879> edges<00:00:57.149> we'll

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
on all three of the other edges we'll

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.959 
on all three of the other edges we'll
just<00:00:57.840> create<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.230> double<00:00:58.770> hem<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.550> complete

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
just create a double hem to complete

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.319 
just create a double hem to complete

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
a template that you can use to trace

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.980 
a template that you can use to trace
where<00:01:08.520> each<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.119> these<00:01:09.210> grommets<00:01:09.510> will<00:01:09.869> be

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
where each one of these grommets will be

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.340

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
inches to eight inches apart we've

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.240 
inches to eight inches apart we've
already<00:01:18.060> measured<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.350> top<00:01:19.619> edge<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.100> our

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
already measured the top edge of our

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
already measured the top edge of our
sour<00:01:20.880> curtain<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.990> now<00:01:22.290> we're<00:01:22.500> using

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
sour curtain here and now we're using

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.640 
sour curtain here and now we're using
the<00:01:22.920> template<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.549> mark<00:01:23.880> each<00:01:24.119> location<00:01:24.990> for

grommets once all the locations are

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.170 
grommets once all the locations are
marked<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.770> simply<00:01:32.220> time<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.790> cut<00:01:33.030> out
