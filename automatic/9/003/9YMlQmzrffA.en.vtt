00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.850 
honest let's have a look around the car
has<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.030> sort<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.420> nice<00:02:08.539> faded<00:02:09.050> red<00:02:09.410> into

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
has that sort of nice faded red into

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.490 
has that sort of nice faded red into
white<00:02:10.099> scheme<00:02:10.840> as<00:02:11.840> he's<00:02:11.989> saying<00:02:12.230> there's<00:02:12.410> the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
white scheme as he's saying there's the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.960 
white scheme as he's saying there's the
side<00:02:12.709> there's<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.160> back<00:02:13.310> with<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.640> rookie

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
side there's the back with the rookie

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.339 
side there's the back with the rookie
stripe<00:02:14.239> he<00:02:14.420> certainly<00:02:14.569> has<00:02:14.780> been<00:02:14.900> driving

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
stripe he certainly has been driving

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.559 
stripe he certainly has been driving
like<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> rookie<00:02:15.709> this<00:02:15.920> year<00:02:16.270> it's<00:02:17.270> been<00:02:17.390> round

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
like a rookie this year it's been round

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.390 
like a rookie this year it's been round
again<00:02:17.810> there's<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.110> other<00:02:18.200> side<00:02:18.470> shows<00:02:19.250> not

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
again there's the other side shows not

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.290 
again there's the other side shows not
very<00:02:19.550> nice<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.819> white<00:02:19.940> wheels<00:02:20.150> and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
very nice of the white wheels and

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.680 
very nice of the white wheels and
there's<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.690> front<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.260> think<00:02:22.599> don't<00:02:23.599> if

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
there's the front and I think don't if

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.180 
there's the front and I think don't if
you<00:02:23.780> guys<00:02:23.930> have<00:02:24.080> agree<00:02:24.349> but<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.680> think<00:02:25.010> that

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
you guys have agree but I think that

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.800 
you guys have agree but I think that
front<00:02:25.459> end<00:02:25.670> looks<00:02:25.819> pretty<00:02:26.150> well<00:02:26.390> put<00:02:26.629> together

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
front end looks pretty well put together

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.690 
front end looks pretty well put together
I<00:02:27.290> mean<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.099> show<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.310> we're<00:02:28.459> happy<00:02:28.580> to

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.430 
I mean just to show you we're happy to

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
talk about there's such basic terms and

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
say yeah that's a good point that they

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.369 
say yeah that's a good point that they
didn't<00:02:32.090> put<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.480> headlights<00:02:32.720> on<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.170> roof

car<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:07.070> continue<00:03:07.520> impressing<00:03:08.150> and

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
car to continue impressing and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.240 
car to continue impressing and
dumbfounding<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:08.990> critics<00:03:09.350> it's<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.950> simple

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
dumbfounding the critics it's a simple

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.560 
dumbfounding the critics it's a simple
kind<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.430> scheme<00:03:10.700> there's<00:03:11.090> no<00:03:11.209> kind<00:03:11.450> of

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
kind of scheme there's no kind of

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.720 
kind of scheme there's no kind of
diviners<00:03:12.050> or<00:03:12.200> fancy<00:03:12.560> patterns<00:03:12.860> on<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.010> this<00:03:13.610> is

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
diviners or fancy patterns on it this is

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.100 
diviners or fancy patterns on it this is
definitely<00:03:13.940> one<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.240> simpler<00:03:14.600> variety

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
definitely one of the simpler variety

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.050 
definitely one of the simpler variety
although<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.590> do<00:03:15.830> like<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:16.400> very<00:03:16.489> much<00:03:16.610> as<00:03:17.000> you

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
although I do like it very much as you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.780 
although I do like it very much as you
can<00:03:17.150> see<00:03:17.270> it's<00:03:17.420> front<00:03:17.660> red<00:03:18.319> fading<00:03:19.280> into<00:03:19.580> white

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
can see it's front red fading into white

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.040 
can see it's front red fading into white
at<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.030> back<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.690> traditional

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
at the back and it's the traditional

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.900 
at the back and it's the traditional
target<00:03:21.500> colors<00:03:21.770> of<00:03:21.920> red<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.220> white<00:03:22.250> they're

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
target colors of red and white they're

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.340 
target colors of red and white they're
taking<00:03:23.209> on<00:03:23.300> many<00:03:23.480> different<00:03:23.660> forms<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.200> used

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
taking on many different forms it used

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.660 
taking on many different forms it used
to<00:03:24.410> be<00:03:24.470> white<00:03:24.680> with<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.950> dominant<00:03:25.370> color<00:03:25.489> and

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
to be white with the dominant color and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.610 
to be white with the dominant color and
then<00:03:25.790> red<00:03:26.000> was<00:03:26.209> secondary<00:03:26.600> back<00:03:27.290> in<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.500> days

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
then red was secondary back in the days

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.350 
then red was secondary back in the days
when<00:03:27.800> it<00:03:27.860> was<00:03:27.950> on<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.130> I'm<00:03:28.220> 41<00:03:28.670> with<00:03:29.300> the
