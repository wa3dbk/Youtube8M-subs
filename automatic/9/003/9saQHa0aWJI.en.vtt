magnesium<00:05:07.450> okay<00:05:08.169> and<00:05:08.950> that's<00:05:09.430> probably<00:05:09.960> why<00:05:10.960> a

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
magnesium okay and that's probably why a

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.930 
magnesium okay and that's probably why a
lot<00:05:11.350> of<00:05:11.380> people<00:05:11.680> are<00:05:11.770> having<00:05:12.160> pain<00:05:12.490> in<00:05:12.790> their

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
lot of people are having pain in their

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.930 
lot of people are having pain in their
legs<00:05:13.090> I'm<00:05:13.510> saying<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:14.140> could<00:05:14.350> be<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.940> what

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
legs I'm saying it could be and what

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.900 
legs I'm saying it could be and what
they<00:05:16.030> call<00:05:16.270> restless<00:05:17.230> leg<00:05:17.560> syndrome<00:05:17.910> that's

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
they call restless leg syndrome that's

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.180 
they call restless leg syndrome that's
probably<00:05:19.360> due<00:05:19.600> to<00:05:19.630> calcium<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:21.610> magnesium

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
probably due to calcium and magnesium

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.440 
probably due to calcium and magnesium
deficiency<00:05:24.190> you<00:05:24.820> gotta<00:05:25.000> take<00:05:25.180> them<00:05:25.300> together
