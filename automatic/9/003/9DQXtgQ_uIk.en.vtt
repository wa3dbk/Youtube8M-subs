00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
least this would be impressive if the

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.300 
least this would be impressive if the
actual<00:06:27.910> movie<00:06:28.420> consisted<00:06:29.230> of<00:06:29.350> five<00:06:29.710> second

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
actual movie consisted of five second

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.150 
actual movie consisted of five second
animated<00:06:30.760> clips<00:06:31.270> looped<00:06:31.750> over<00:06:31.960> and<00:06:32.380> over<00:06:32.710> but

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
animated clips looped over and over but

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.970 
animated clips looped over and over but
alas<00:06:33.520> it<00:06:33.850> does<00:06:34.240> not<00:06:34.420> and<00:06:34.750> this<00:06:35.200> sucks

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
alas it does not and this sucks

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.060 
alas it does not and this sucks
so<00:06:36.370> that's<00:06:36.970> it<00:06:37.240> possibly<00:06:37.900> the<00:06:38.230> new<00:06:38.380> contender

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 
so that's it possibly the new contender

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.090 
so that's it possibly the new contender
for<00:06:39.340> the<00:06:39.460> worst<00:06:39.670> game<00:06:40.000> ever<00:06:40.210> but<00:06:41.110> before<00:06:41.770> I<00:06:41.800> go
