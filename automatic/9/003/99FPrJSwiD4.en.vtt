the cool think of that bubble is its
weight<00:00:26.090> because<00:00:27.080> it's<00:00:27.289> less<00:00:27.560> than<00:00:27.770> 900<00:00:28.279> grams

weight because it's less than 900 grams

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:48.060 
weight because it's less than 900 grams
that<00:00:29.329> means<00:00:29.660> you<00:00:29.840> can<00:00:30.020> move<00:00:30.259> much<00:00:30.590> faster

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.649 

another<00:00:49.070> important<00:00:49.699> thing<00:00:49.879> is<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.180> unique

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
cutting style of the blade that means

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.890 
cutting style of the blade that means
that<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.409> can<00:00:54.589> use<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:54.979> bigger<00:00:55.309> surface<00:00:56.239> in
