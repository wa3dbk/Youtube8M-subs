00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
to figure out my just general way of

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.010 
to figure out my just general way of
painting<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.240> makes<00:02:33.420> sense<00:02:33.600> like<00:02:33.840> do<00:02:33.990> I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
painting if that makes sense like do I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.020 
painting if that makes sense like do I
add<00:02:34.380> color<00:02:34.800> first<00:02:35.130> should<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.430> go<00:02:35.580> black<00:02:35.820> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
add color first should I go black and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.210 
add color first should I go black and
white<00:02:36.210> then<00:02:36.600> add<00:02:36.750> collar<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.920> know<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.100> get

white then add collar you know to get

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.250 
white then add collar you know to get
the<00:02:38.310> value<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.760> correct<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.270> yeah<00:02:39.480> but<00:02:40.020> I'm<00:02:40.140> i
