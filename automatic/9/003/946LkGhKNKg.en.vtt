purpose so that relating it to call of
duty<00:01:50.069> they<00:01:50.880> put<00:01:51.119> flaws<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.409> these<00:01:52.590> games<00:01:52.890> so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
duty they put flaws in these games so

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.059 
duty they put flaws in these games so
that<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:55.130> excited<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.459> the<00:01:56.759> next<00:01:56.970> game

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
that we excited for the next game

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.429 
that we excited for the next game
therefore<00:01:59.069> it<00:01:59.429> turns<00:01:59.819> out<00:02:00.179> that<00:02:00.299> get<00:02:01.170> really

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
therefore it turns out that get really

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.339 
therefore it turns out that get really
hyper<00:02:01.709> for<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:03.030> someone<00:02:03.899> they<00:02:04.020> promote

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
hyper for it which someone they promote

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.059 
hyper for it which someone they promote
it<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:05.310> will<00:02:05.549> lead<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:06.679> more<00:02:07.679> in<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> next

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
it it will lead to the more in the next

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.780 
it it will lead to the more in the next
game<00:02:08.340> sells<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> was<00:02:11.160> thinking<00:02:11.310> about<00:02:11.579> it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
game sells so I was thinking about it

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.289 
game sells so I was thinking about it
and<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.500> found<00:02:13.500> it<00:02:13.709> plausible<00:02:14.040> because<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:15.060> don't

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
and I found it plausible because I don't

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.569 
and I found it plausible because I don't
think<00:02:15.360> we'll<00:02:15.629> ever<00:02:15.690> find<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.579> definitely

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
think we'll ever find it definitely

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.170 
think we'll ever find it definitely
using<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.120> why<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:19.829> call<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.190> duty<00:02:20.549> games<00:02:20.819> have

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
using on why the call of duty games have

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.960 
using on why the call of duty games have
it's<00:02:21.389> false<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.959> don't<00:02:22.769> think<00:02:22.829> a<00:02:23.250> game<00:02:23.790> will

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
it's false I don't think a game will

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.420 
it's false I don't think a game will
ever<00:02:24.150> be<00:02:24.420> perfect<00:02:24.959> because<00:02:25.220> we'll<00:02:26.220> always

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
ever be perfect because we'll always

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.340 
ever be perfect because we'll always
find<00:02:26.850> something<00:02:27.209> that's<00:02:27.540> wrong<00:02:27.810> even<00:02:28.230> in

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
find something that's wrong even in

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.910 
find something that's wrong even in
videos<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:30.840> really<00:02:31.470> really<00:02:31.620> well

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
videos that I just really really well

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.610 
videos that I just really really well
made<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.430> mean<00:02:32.819> or<00:02:33.450> anything<00:02:33.480> that's<00:02:34.049> what<00:02:34.380> main

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
made I mean or anything that's what main

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.400 
made I mean or anything that's what main
we'll<00:02:34.829> find<00:02:35.100> some<00:02:36.030> product<00:02:36.510> defect<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.200> mean

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
we'll find some product defect I mean

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.620 
we'll find some product defect I mean
that's<00:02:37.769> just<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.340> how<00:02:39.410> humans<00:02:40.410> work

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
that's just I think how humans work

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.590 
that's just I think how humans work
I<00:02:41.690> only<00:02:42.620> say<00:02:42.860> it's<00:02:43.010> plausible<00:02:43.420> not<00:02:44.420> only

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
I only say it's plausible not only

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.450 
I only say it's plausible not only
because<00:02:44.840> we'll<00:02:45.440> never<00:02:45.590> know<00:02:46.870> also<00:02:47.870> because

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
because we'll never know also because

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.970 
because we'll never know also because
the<00:02:49.460> game<00:02:49.730> support<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.410> developers

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
the game support that the developers

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.730 
the game support that the developers
have<00:02:52.970> for<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.450> Call<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.660> Duty<00:02:54.050> series<00:02:54.230> aren't

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.900 
have for the Call of Duty series aren't
always<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.130> greatest<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:56.140> mean<00:02:57.370> let's<00:02:58.370> look<00:02:58.730> at

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
always the greatest I mean let's look at

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.830 
always the greatest I mean let's look at
modern<00:02:59.150> warfare<00:02:59.540> 2<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:02.180> took<00:03:02.330> forever<00:03:02.630> for

modded lobbies on ps3 I mean they put

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.250 
modded lobbies on ps3 I mean they put
out<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.250> patch<00:03:22.730> but<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.360> can<00:03:23.540> still<00:03:23.750> host<00:03:23.960> them

wanted to know if quickscoping and I

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.070 
wanted to know if quickscoping and I
know<00:04:12.610> that<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.060> fact<00:04:13.300> that<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:13.630> will<00:04:13.780> never

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
know that the fact that you will never

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.069 
know that the fact that you will never
get<00:04:14.319> it<00:04:14.440> perfect<00:04:14.590> on<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.950> first<00:04:14.980> try<00:04:15.520> but<00:04:16.079> even

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
get it perfect on the first try but even

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.340 
get it perfect on the first try but even
with<00:04:17.230> the<00:04:17.320> foam<00:04:17.500> loss<00:04:17.709> patch<00:04:18.040> it<00:04:18.340> seems<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.940> I

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
with the foam loss patch it seems that I

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.400 
with the foam loss patch it seems that I
just<00:04:20.350> can't<00:04:20.769> really<00:04:20.980> use<00:04:21.190> other<00:04:21.459> guns<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.970> mean

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
just can't really use other guns I mean

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.409 
just can't really use other guns I mean
you<00:04:23.410> can't<00:04:23.650> really<00:04:23.830> use<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.460> PM<00:04:25.060> 63<00:04:25.870> or<00:04:26.880> Mac<00:04:27.880> 11
