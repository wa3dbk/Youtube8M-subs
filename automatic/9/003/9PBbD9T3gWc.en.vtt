00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
it comes to sunscreen I think a lot of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.209 
it comes to sunscreen I think a lot of
Irish<00:00:36.180> people<00:00:36.239> are<00:00:36.630> because<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.770> don't<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
Irish people are because we don't have a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.340

I saw this I was very very excited it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.289 
I saw this I was very very excited it
was<00:01:21.840> actually<00:01:22.110> sent<00:01:22.290> me<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> review<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.210> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
was actually sent me for a review and I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.700 
was actually sent me for a review and I
did<00:01:24.509> try<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.750> out<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.170> came<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> great

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
did try it out and it came in a great

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.039 
did try it out and it came in a great
time<00:01:25.979> because<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.939> weather<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.570> sunny<00:01:27.840> so

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
time because the weather was so sunny so

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:28.969 
time because the weather was so sunny so
I<00:01:28.080> put<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.530> test

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
I put it to the test

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.910 
I put it to the test
and<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.000> particular<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.630> SPF<00:01:31.140> 30<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and this one in particular is SPF 30 and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.120 
and this one in particular is SPF 30 and
as<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> said<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.590> protectant<00:01:34.590> against

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
as I said it is and protectant against

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.690 
as I said it is and protectant against
UVB<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.540> UVA<00:01:37.200> rays<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> does<00:01:38.520> protect

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
UVB and UVA rays so it does protect

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.600 
UVB and UVA rays so it does protect
against<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.390> those<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.960> its<00:01:40.110> SPF<00:01:40.590> 30<00:01:41.100> which<00:01:41.460> is

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
against to those and its SPF 30 which is

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.719 
against to those and its SPF 30 which is
quite<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> good<00:01:42.360> number<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:43.619> Ireland<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.220> think<00:01:44.490> I

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
quite a good number in Ireland I think I

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.100 
quite a good number in Ireland I think I
think<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> minimum<00:01:45.450> you're<00:01:45.720> supposed<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
think the minimum you're supposed to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.280 
think the minimum you're supposed to
wear<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.680> 15<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:48.119> I'm<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.329> mistaken<00:01:48.720> something

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290

just like a squeezy tube and I'll pour

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.610 
just like a squeezy tube and I'll pour
out<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.220> just<00:02:41.250> looks<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:41.760> cream<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.620> a
