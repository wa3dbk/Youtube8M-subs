hey<00:00:04.060> everyone<00:00:04.359> today<00:00:04.540> I'd<00:00:04.840> like<00:00:04.870> to<00:00:05.020> present

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.109 
hey everyone today I'd like to present

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.110 
hey everyone today I'd like to present
my<00:00:05.410> latest<00:00:05.560> puzzle<00:00:06.069> the<00:00:06.279> Kirby<00:00:06.580> copter<00:00:06.880> scoop

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 
my latest puzzle the Kirby copter scoop

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.480 
my latest puzzle the Kirby copter scoop
it<00:00:07.840> was<00:00:07.960> designed<00:00:08.290> by<00:00:08.380> myself<00:00:08.559> in<00:00:08.950> SolidWorks

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.490 
it was designed by myself in SolidWorks

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.110 
it was designed by myself in SolidWorks
and<00:00:09.760> 3d<00:00:10.120> printed<00:00:10.389> at<00:00:10.480> Shapeways<00:00:11.759> as<00:00:12.759> you<00:00:12.999> can

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
and 3d printed at Shapeways as you can

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.549 
and 3d printed at Shapeways as you can
obviously<00:00:13.360> tell<00:00:13.450> from<00:00:13.900> the<00:00:14.049> title<00:00:14.200> and<00:00:14.440> the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
obviously tell from the title and the

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.020 
obviously tell from the title and the
looks<00:00:14.740> of<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:14.919> puzzle<00:00:15.249> it<00:00:15.610> is<00:00:15.759> a<00:00:15.789> hybrid

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.030 
looks of the puzzle it is a hybrid

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.840 
looks of the puzzle it is a hybrid
between<00:00:16.450> the<00:00:16.630> Kirby<00:00:16.990> copter<00:00:17.380> and<00:00:17.700> the<00:00:18.700> Scoob

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
between the Kirby copter and the Scoob

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.030 
between the Kirby copter and the Scoob
so<00:00:21.850> like<00:00:22.030> any<00:00:22.470> hybrid<00:00:23.470> puzzle<00:00:23.740> you<00:00:23.800> can<00:00:23.830> do

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
so like any hybrid puzzle you can do

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.600 
so like any hybrid puzzle you can do
both<00:00:24.190> kirby<00:00:24.760> copter<00:00:25.060> turns<00:00:27.360> as<00:00:28.360> well<00:00:29.140> as<00:00:29.610> scoob

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
both kirby copter turns as well as scoob

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.739 
both kirby copter turns as well as scoob
towns<00:00:30.880> like<00:00:31.270> so<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:33.460> with<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.180> kirby<00:00:34.450> copter

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:34.749 
towns like so and with the kirby copter

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:38.939 
towns like so and with the kirby copter
you<00:00:34.929> can<00:00:35.050> also<00:00:35.170> do<00:00:35.350> regular<00:00:35.579> jumbling<00:00:37.859> so<00:00:38.859> it

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
you can also do regular jumbling so it

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.970 
you can also do regular jumbling so it
can<00:00:39.070> jump<00:00:39.280> like<00:00:39.370> a<00:00:39.550> normal<00:00:39.940> curvy<00:00:40.300> copter

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
can jump like a normal curvy copter

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.560 
can jump like a normal curvy copter
however<00:00:41.980> what's<00:00:42.550> interesting<00:00:42.850> is<00:00:43.120> due<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:43.390> the

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
however what's interesting is due to the

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.349 
however what's interesting is due to the
hybrid<00:00:44.469> geometry<00:00:45.039> the<00:00:45.730> jumbling<00:00:46.059> is<00:00:46.179> a<00:00:46.210> lot

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:46.359 
hybrid geometry the jumbling is a lot

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.069 
hybrid geometry the jumbling is a lot
more<00:00:46.480> interesting<00:00:46.749> than<00:00:47.199> just<00:00:47.760> curvy<00:00:48.760> copter

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
more interesting than just curvy copter

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.599 
more interesting than just curvy copter
jumbling<00:00:50.079> because<00:00:50.769> what<00:00:50.949> you<00:00:51.039> can<00:00:51.159> do<00:00:51.309> is<00:00:51.429> you

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
jumbling because what you can do is you

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.160 
jumbling because what you can do is you
can<00:00:51.730> do<00:00:51.789> a<00:00:51.819> curvy<00:00:52.120> copter<00:00:52.359> turn<00:00:52.510> like<00:00:52.690> so<00:00:52.929> and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
can do a curvy copter turn like so and

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.799 
can do a curvy copter turn like so and
then<00:00:53.949> you<00:00:54.010> can<00:00:54.039> do<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.219> skew<00:00:54.429> turn<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:57.780> then<00:00:58.780> you

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
then you can do a skew turn and then you

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.989 
then you can do a skew turn and then you
can<00:00:59.109> continue<00:00:59.769> doing<00:01:00.010> curvy<00:01:00.399> copter<00:01:00.670> turns<00:01:00.850> as

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:00.999 
can continue doing curvy copter turns as

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:06.929 
can continue doing curvy copter turns as
well<00:01:04.920> well<00:01:05.920> you<00:01:06.010> can<00:01:06.130> also<00:01:06.250> do<00:01:06.520> if<00:01:06.640> you<00:01:06.759> can<00:01:06.880> do

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
well well you can also do if you can do

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.819 
well well you can also do if you can do
a<00:01:07.000> single<00:01:07.210> scoop<00:01:07.540> turn<00:01:07.780> and<00:01:07.990> then<00:01:08.560> you<00:01:08.680> can

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
a single scoop turn and then you can

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.050 
a single scoop turn and then you can
just<00:01:08.950> move<00:01:09.070> on<00:01:09.189> to<00:01:09.250> curvy<00:01:09.579> copter<00:01:09.850> towns

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
just move on to curvy copter towns

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:18.240 
just move on to curvy copter towns
around<00:01:10.750> these<00:01:10.979> trapezoids<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.979> you<00:01:18.130> can

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
around these trapezoids and you can

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.130 
around these trapezoids and you can
continue<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.670> jumble<00:01:19.119> it<00:01:19.210> like<00:01:19.329> that<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.869> by

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
continue to jumble it like that and by

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.350 
continue to jumble it like that and by
combining<00:01:20.530> both<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:21.640> scoop<00:01:21.880> towns<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:22.299> the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
combining both the scoop towns and the

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.569 
combining both the scoop towns and the
curvy<00:01:22.630> copter<00:01:22.869> turns<00:01:23.110> it<00:01:23.680> can<00:01:23.829> jumble<00:01:24.189> in<00:01:24.250> many

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
curvy copter turns it can jumble in many

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.420 
curvy copter turns it can jumble in many
many<00:01:24.820> crazy<00:01:25.149> ways<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:26.350> also<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.740> feature<00:01:27.159> which

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
many crazy ways and also a feature which

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.550 
many crazy ways and also a feature which
also<00:01:27.610> enables<00:01:28.270> more<00:01:28.450> jumping<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:29.320> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
also enables more jumping is the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.069 
also enables more jumping is the
curvature<00:01:29.890> as<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.670> can<00:01:30.789> see<00:01:31.000> if<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.810> ignore

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
curvature as you can see if you ignore

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.380 
curvature as you can see if you ignore
the<00:01:32.200> scoop<00:01:32.439> cuts<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.430> Kirby<00:01:33.729> copter<00:01:34.030> aspect

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
the scoop cuts the Kirby copter aspect

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.209 
the scoop cuts the Kirby copter aspect
isn't<00:01:34.570> proportional<00:01:35.320> like<00:01:35.979> on<00:01:36.130> the

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
isn't proportional like on the

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.599 
isn't proportional like on the
mass-produced<00:01:36.670> variation<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.340> this<00:01:39.460> is

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
mass-produced variation and this is

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.209 
mass-produced variation and this is
because<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.539> can<00:01:40.570> do<00:01:40.840> these<00:01:41.049> moves<00:01:41.380> where<00:01:42.130> you

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
because you can do these moves where you

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.399 
because you can do these moves where you
can<00:01:42.340> turn<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:42.789> and<00:01:43.090> then<00:01:43.240> like<00:01:43.420> this<00:01:43.659> without

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
can turn this and then like this without

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.529 
can turn this and then like this without
this<00:01:44.680> being<00:01:44.890> a<00:01:44.950> force<00:01:45.250> mover<00:01:45.609> tool<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.420> is

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
this being a force mover tool this is

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.130 
this being a force mover tool this is
impossible

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
impossible

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.999 
impossible
on<00:01:47.469> the<00:01:47.740> helicopter<00:01:48.460> cube<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.829> it<00:01:50.920> is

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
on the helicopter cube but it is

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.270 
on the helicopter cube but it is
possible<00:01:51.280> on<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:52.119> Kirby<00:01:52.420> copter<00:01:52.840> but<00:01:53.560> pieces

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
possible on the Kirby copter but pieces

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.300 
possible on the Kirby copter but pieces
are<00:01:54.490> pushed<00:01:54.700> outwards<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:56.350> relies<00:01:56.590> on<00:01:56.920> the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
are pushed outwards and it relies on the

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.969 
are pushed outwards and it relies on the
tension<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.840> therefore<00:01:59.200> what<00:01:59.499> you<00:01:59.619> can<00:01:59.829> do

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
tension and so therefore what you can do

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.550 
tension and so therefore what you can do
these<00:02:00.159> sorts<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.549> moves<00:02:00.789> on<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.289> curvy

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
these sorts of moves on in the curvy

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.649 
these sorts of moves on in the curvy
copter<00:02:02.950> these<00:02:03.490> pieces<00:02:03.759> get<00:02:03.999> pushed<00:02:04.240> down<00:02:04.329> and

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
copter these pieces get pushed down and

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.370 
copter these pieces get pushed down and
so<00:02:04.929> it<00:02:05.320> can<00:02:05.920> be<00:02:06.070> very<00:02:06.219> hard<00:02:06.399> to<00:02:06.520> turn<00:02:07.380> numbers

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
so it can be very hard to turn numbers

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.590 
so it can be very hard to turn numbers
on<00:02:08.560> this<00:02:08.740> puzzle

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
on this puzzle

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.640 
on this puzzle
the<00:02:11.600> turns<00:02:11.840> completely<00:02:12.020> legal<00:02:15.880> like<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.650> and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
the turns completely legal like so and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.559 
the turns completely legal like so and
this<00:02:18.800> enables<00:02:19.220> for<00:02:19.370> even<00:02:19.640> more<00:02:19.760> jungling

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
this enables for even more jungling
