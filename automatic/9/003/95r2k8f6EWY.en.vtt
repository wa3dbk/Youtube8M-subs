and<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.699> an<00:00:35.820> abnormality<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.510> seen<00:00:36.780> almost

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
and if an abnormality is seen almost

always<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.100> needle<00:00:38.430> biopsy<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.089> performed

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
always a needle biopsy is performed

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.689 
always a needle biopsy is performed
prior<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.230> surgery<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.519> most

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
prior to surgery so one of the most

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.910 
prior to surgery so one of the most
typical<00:00:41.970> times<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.930> someone<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.409> after<00:00:43.890> a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
typical times I see someone is after a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.439 
typical times I see someone is after a
needle<00:00:44.220> biopsy<00:00:44.730> when<00:00:44.909> the<00:00:45.000> cancer<00:00:45.360> has

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
needle biopsy when the cancer has

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.240 
needle biopsy when the cancer has
already<00:00:45.570> been<00:00:45.870> diagnosed<00:00:46.470> and<00:00:46.769> then<00:00:46.829> we're

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
already been diagnosed and then we're

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.799 
already been diagnosed and then we're
able<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.790> long<00:00:48.059> comprehensive

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
able to have a long comprehensive

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.869 
able to have a long comprehensive
discussion<00:00:49.170> about<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.280> results<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
discussion about the results of the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.310 
discussion about the results of the
needle<00:00:51.120> biopsy<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.720> how<00:00:51.839> to<00:00:51.900> treat<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
needle biopsy and how to treat the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.560 
needle biopsy and how to treat the
cancer<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.859> the<00:00:53.460> other<00:00:53.609> hand<00:00:53.910> some<00:00:54.180> women<00:00:54.420> come

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
cancer on the other hand some women come

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.810 
cancer on the other hand some women come
in<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.840> an<00:00:54.930> indeterminate<00:00:55.559> problem<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
in with an indeterminate problem like a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.450 
in with an indeterminate problem like a
nipple<00:00:57.030> discharge<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:58.170> an<00:00:58.260> abnormal<00:00:58.949> imaging

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
nipple discharge or an abnormal imaging

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
nipple discharge or an abnormal imaging
finding<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.000> can't<00:01:00.269> be<00:01:00.359> reached<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.930> needle

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
finding that can't be reached for needle

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.770 
finding that can't be reached for needle
biopsy<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.250> discuss<00:01:02.640> various<00:01:02.850> options<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
biopsy so we discuss various options to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.469 
biopsy so we discuss various options to
to<00:01:04.530> treat<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.949> problem<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.610> hopefully<00:01:06.030> rule

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to treat that problem and hopefully rule

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.990 
to treat that problem and hopefully rule
out<00:01:06.660> cancer<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.710> generally<00:01:08.399> speaking<00:01:08.700> that

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
out cancer but generally speaking that

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.730 
out cancer but generally speaking that
if<00:01:09.360> someone<00:01:09.720> gets<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> point<00:01:10.440> of<00:01:10.500> needing

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
if someone gets to the point of needing

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
if someone gets to the point of needing
an<00:01:10.920> operation<00:01:11.520> you'd<00:01:11.940> like<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.300> operation

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
an operation you'd like that operation

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.230 
an operation you'd like that operation
to<00:01:12.899> be<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.050> single<00:01:13.500> comprehensive<00:01:13.979> surgery<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
to be a single comprehensive surgery to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.900 
to be a single comprehensive surgery to
address<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.690> problem<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.160> procedure<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
address the problem not a procedure to

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.330 
address the problem not a procedure to
diagnose<00:01:18.479> cancer<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.259> then<00:01:19.500> another<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.190> to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
diagnose cancer and then another one to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.400 
diagnose cancer and then another one to
treat<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.670> cancer<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> radiologists<00:01:22.350> are

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
treat the cancer so the radiologists are

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.890 
treat the cancer so the radiologists are
involved<00:01:22.740> very<00:01:23.369> early<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.210> patients

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
involved very early on and patients

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140 
involved very early on and patients
often<00:01:25.259> come<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.770> surgeon<00:01:26.280> with<00:01:26.759> some

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
often come to a surgeon with some

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.880 
often come to a surgeon with some
element<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.110> diagnosis<00:01:28.740> already

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.550 

I<00:01:33.979> think<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.120> initial<00:01:35.840> visit<00:01:36.050> with<00:01:36.440> the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
I think the initial visit with the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.160 
I think the initial visit with the
patient<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.250> family<00:01:37.659> describing<00:01:38.659> what

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
patient and the family describing what

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.820 
patient and the family describing what
is<00:01:39.590> involved<00:01:40.460> in<00:01:41.260> diagnosing<00:01:42.260> their<00:01:42.409> cancer

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
is involved in diagnosing their cancer

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.649 
is involved in diagnosing their cancer
treating<00:01:43.250> their<00:01:43.400> cancer<00:01:43.820> and<00:01:43.850> explaining<00:01:44.570> the

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
treating their cancer and explaining the

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.960 
treating their cancer and explaining the
steps<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:45.170> take<00:01:45.380> care<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.830> is<00:01:46.159> extremely

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
steps to take care of it is extremely

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.570 
steps to take care of it is extremely
important<00:01:47.450> visit<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.409> usually<00:01:49.100> that<00:01:49.250> visit

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
important visit and I usually that visit

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.690 
important visit and I usually that visit
takes<00:01:49.790> me<00:01:50.000> an<00:01:50.780> hour<00:01:50.930> hour<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.680> 15<00:01:52.070> minutes<00:01:52.490> and

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
takes me an hour hour and 15 minutes and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.910 
takes me an hour hour and 15 minutes and
I<00:01:53.030> really<00:01:53.479> try<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:53.780> when<00:01:54.140> I<00:01:54.170> speak<00:01:54.710> to<00:01:54.770> a

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
I really try to when I speak to a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.770 
I really try to when I speak to a
patient<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.430> family<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:55.910> try<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.300> pretend<00:01:56.750> like

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
patient and family I try to pretend like

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.570 
patient and family I try to pretend like
there's<00:01:56.990> absolutely<00:01:57.590> nothing<00:01:57.800> else<00:01:58.070> going<00:01:58.430> on
