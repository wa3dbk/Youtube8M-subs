 daily shrimp 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.590
 yo people welcome to a new one 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.150
 via first person story mode 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.070
 today we will continue to be valuable 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.869
 stayed but I find this one 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.939
 little bit apart 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.220
 what the farc today is probably there 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.650
 a short episode all what the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.279

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.460
 to record you with capture card 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
 move a bit of speessen 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.989
 middle case michael is a good boy 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.579
 and then his wife goes to help his wife 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.649
 just that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.809
 try to get the supplies what that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.699
 is always a challenge in itself 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.809
 of course because all those people here 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.820

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.289

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.450
 where she naturally sat behind a connoisseur 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.280
 we lose something on the cheese cream 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.130
 police lose skills I got it 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.400

 frequently 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.740
 trained in gta so it must go a long way 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.030

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.710
 salts from you to be me months mouse 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.060

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.280

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.040
 tools to have things I'm working on it now 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.939

 I run sting will mark things and then 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.939
 they might be a good idea 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.310
 if not first with the tennis zucchini 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.590
 We are now on our way to difficult because 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.939
 he already has a text message to me 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.770
 so we look at what he has in store 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.820
 he has to call us back home 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.979

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.020
 crewmember and lures like a house 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.560
 going to do we can choose him as one 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.770
 from our crew mine 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.440
 but we are still at that point 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.239
 pussy watch this big boy watch him 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.520

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.040

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.970
 of the injured 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.220
 at least you are the first now 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.019
 I'm tired of it 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.790
 group that ship police officer just for a moment 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.390

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.440
 angina

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.920
 police or do it may do where is tae 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.100
 I lpg 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.690
 just look this for l also this looks 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.280
 as a second-hand store according to 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.660
 that is me too 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.910
 the snow didn't have to be anything else 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.230
 Leicester gets angry again that's your time 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.790
 wasting and stuff 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.230
 and thereby of course no sense at all 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.540
 we also waste our own time 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.850
 for me and how we got the lady 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.400
 you now get it out of your car like I do it 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.930
 yourself for you and I'm going to find a store 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.819
 where they do 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.959
 sell decent clothes for that 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.459
 is what we need for the next 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.850
 mission I do not know what the intended mission 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.959
 but yes apparently it must have got it 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.510
 also not made up 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.959
 this closes the more up I think we here 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.630
 are ready 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.340

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.920
 got glasses with the camera shudder and 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.800
 In-store scanning is what I am concerned about 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.810
 do research 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.780
 it can be difficult to look through the camera 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.060
 what it looks like on the inside I think and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.520
 then there are researchers once 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:25.430
