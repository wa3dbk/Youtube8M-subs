00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.449
 what is life like on a submarine 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.399
 what does your dinner look like 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:16.399
 Zealand not in unique opportunity to take a look 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:20.910
 we are at the center of this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.739
 submarines suspended from the ball and 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.199
 the whale 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.099
 gem with the operational side on one side 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.190
 the side with which the see walk have around the boat 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.000
 and on this side have the technical side of the boat 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.350
 and yes, monitor and control the boat with it 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.810
 to pay it 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.810
 very easy to say 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.000
 we are back in work for work, the kitchen is as it is actually called 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.670
 prepare all those 62 meals for the honor 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.490
 yes indeed there is cooking here and here three times a day cooking takes place 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.920
 for the 62 crew members 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.430
 and besides 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.840
 for all sorts of things provided on the seats 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.800
 yes this is true me 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.760
 but what food is made for us 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.220
 but it's not that big anymore 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.690
 if it does 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.450
 yes it is indeed it is 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.310
 dishes and you also get the submarine feeling in one by one 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.600
 small 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.490
 spacious 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.320
 but it is the food that meets that well 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.220
 and already it goes in the machine or must it be done by hand 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.840
 no that always goes well with the country 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 the band consists of three floors 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.200
 the front 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.990
 space of the submarine 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.330
 and after it says it all 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.399
 and see here 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.090
 the four places on earth 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.840
 the weapon of the whale class can 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.190
 we launch 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.210
 not really a very cozy room of course 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.150
 it's an even the interest we can escape and stay here too 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.930
 it is the incidental fact that we have here 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.130
 our weapons and weather 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.550
 a submarine is very compact that doesn't make it any easier 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.559
 we are here in nl 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.709
 but from that I must say 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.079
 yes indeed a warm space 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.669
 this is the engine room 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:26.499
 and yes there are at stake game equipment hence it is very hot 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.569
 racers in other spaces 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.809
 how I find this space where we are now 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:35.659
 one of his kidneys in london makes it up to jewels stay 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 something where we recreationists and 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.909
 and in some cases also sleep 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.540
 the pirate site crawls all its shell from carpet on the table there indeed 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.639
 Searje wants a bit of fun and looks 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.579
 therefore a dress people 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.909
 a the regime 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.849
 this is a very nice time it is the damster period
