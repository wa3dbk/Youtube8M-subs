00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.250
 the idea of ​​putting the exhibition together 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.710
 these three specific art is a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.150
 co-ordination and other 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.730
 school arts 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.369
 how can you make an exhibition without 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.519
 fifth place with several artists and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.519
 even show the panorama of a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.949
 good comic a good illustration a good 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.930
 structure made in this area mines general 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.710
 in the space of the house 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.840
 divided the three com comic moments 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.890
 illustration and sculpture 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.110
 our presenting position is original 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.780
 it has differential with the other 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.320
 positions because the visitor it can 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.420
 approximate material of the artist 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.800
 understand the subtlety of each behind 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.980
 each technique 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.469
 the first person who was easy to be 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.260
 selected first was the teacher of 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.080
 sculpture is scallop because it is very 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.080
 Difficult yet you have several writers 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.750
 in the pop market entertainment area 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.570
 culture here that have this type of 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.530
 quality that has so much production 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.530
 material produced 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.799
 I studied it in their comics is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.170
 all the Russians who had at the time 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:38.100
 between basic drawing illustration painting 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.840
 animation blender script and also did the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.200
 first I was in the first class of the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.200
 technical course 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.390
 I'm very very fan very in love 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.340
 by video game cinema is love the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.170
 character exists here so I wanted 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.970
 make my characters I wanted 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.549
 to tell my characters as real as 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.759
 to those who were on TV, then 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:06.030
 sculpture, the structure ended up doing 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.920
 sculpture that come back to take a 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.259
 New, come back and have a chat. 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.400
 So I think it's really cool that they 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.370
 They inspire and they like the justification to 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.930
 People have similar tastes and to talk to 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.790
 true all my team all team 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.160
 that I have today that works with me 16 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.880
 people are students are students of 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.850
 school 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.590
 so I think I can motivate them 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.200
 They like it, it's very cool too. 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.959
 school relation 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.819
 anyone who wants to try to have 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.170
 want to look for a little bit of 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.799
 study that I think also without study 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.750
 It's not work, but you study, and after that 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.750
 a heart with a will 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.670
 now in the illustration area 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.090
 we also ended up choosing a lot 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.860
 on the subject of the illustration of the super 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.530
 superhero hero is the subject of 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.959
 exposure and from there we went for 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.019
 degree of technical quality and people 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.239
 found Alexandre Edson this degree of 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.980
 quality 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.500
 when you can work with one you can 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.860
 make projects with friends even more 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.819
 friends to the next and intimate is sensational 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.459
 because it's me and two other people 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.500
 shared the same love for their 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:32.840
 comic by the heroes in the case 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.549
 there I am particularly stopped with the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.160
 traditional work 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:41.900
 I like I have to do with the 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:45.470
 contact duckling terça oo papel 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.700
 I really like digital work but the 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.560
 my beach and it was traditional even 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.290
 I'm really excited about 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.540
 to work in a bikini but I like 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.410
 much to do with the criticism I also think 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.730
 body that I can risk is I am 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:07.609
 using my work and the last one was 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.310
 more difficult to choose was which quadri 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:13.340
 of the great beautiful horizon that has 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.280
 career has market growth 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.349
 of style in technique 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:24.020
 it's several new ones we chose a tone 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:26.870
 very underrated few people are 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.570
 repairing the armadillo that gangs time 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.770
 and there came the choice of alan pierre 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.150
 the administrator I prefer the two 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.510
 together with what it is because the market 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.680
 of comics for being run he is 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.680
 very interesting 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.270
 so I prefer it once in a while 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.050
 the extraction institute where I can 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.550
 work though the drawing has one thing 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.919
 that I consider people very wrong 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.259
 they start using and people who 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.350
 from December to those who understand 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:00.130
 also a silly is good I have this 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.900
 word I think and radici drawing is 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.300
 training and dedication 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.070
 if you want if you train a lot 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.300
 dedicated and move on 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.300
 you can reach 100
