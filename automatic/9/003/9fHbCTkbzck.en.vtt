 hello how about how are you welcome to 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.160
 a new good video let's see today 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.739
 how do you do this little piece of paper that 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.930
 it's quite curious and flashy I've 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:36.739
 called magic circle but it's more 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.899
 known as rotating pop-up what 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.300
 First you will download and print the 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.449
 template the paper has to be strong 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.550
 because otherwise it will not work well I leave you 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.239
 several links in the information of the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.030
 there are more simple videos 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.269
 learn and a little bit harder but 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.170
 not too much we will fold the paper by the 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.170
 center line 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:07.850
 with scissors we will cut through where 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.850
 Indicates in each drawing 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.680
 i 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.680
 ah 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.700
 ah 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 we now have to mark all the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 lines as indicated in the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700
 template 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.409
 ah 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.870
 we will mark them firmly 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.000
 in which it puts of mountain form it 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.430
 it gives up and in which it puts 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.640
 valley form on the contrary down 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.830
 when they are all well marked we have 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.290
 that folding the paper it's best to go 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.140
 gently rotating the figure at the same time 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.860
 that we are adapting the folds towards 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.590
 the site that are marked at the end 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.590
 there must be a figure with this form 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.700
 to make the effect we will only have to 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.700
 open and close the paper 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.230
 in the event that we make the template 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.690
 more complicated this is how it is 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.540
 good and nothing else I hope that I have 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.390
 liked this new video this time with a 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.629
 work on paper very entertaining and with 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.590
 a pretty showy result come 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.590
 until next time
