 applied to the plastics in the rubbers and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.939
 leather is a service that takes time to 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.520
 about 30 minutes to run 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.990
 by rehydrating leather this product 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.659
 here if he will do what he will 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.030
 protect the bank will protect in case 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.270
 leather to prevent this leather from 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.189
 dirt and dirt gets im- 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.890
 creating a movie on it 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.930
 besides this protection the leather will also 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.210
 absorb this product causing the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.560
 durability and useful life of that that 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.420
 material and does last longer than 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.310
 habitual 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.909
 then this service and if it constitutes the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.530
 cleaning and finally moisturizing now 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.290
 Let's meet the sanitation service. 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.259
 interior design is a service 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.509
 fabric bench to ceiling cleaning of 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.799
 door side carpet 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.379
 in short, we do a cleaning 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.760
 the vehicle to a service that is 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.099
 to delete background 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.870
 the bacteria remove the dirt is a 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.360
 very easy and simple service to be 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.950
 applied and if it is applied 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.189
 in parts 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.110
 the county would not look at the fabric too much 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.120
 the part of the bank in the case here 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.360
 seat 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.950
 after applying the event with a brush 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.060
 It has to be a soft bristle brush 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.540
 to avoid damaging the fabric it is 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.909
 brushing in a lightweight way only for 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.659
 make the product and act in the 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.359
 dirt 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:53.639
 so I come with the machine and do the 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:56.040
 removal service and not 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.200
 has a time to be performed 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.730
 It is recommended to be done when something falls 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.269
 on the bench when some dirt is 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.269
 visible
