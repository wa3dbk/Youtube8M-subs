00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
put a little bit air back into it now be

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.020 
put a little bit air back into it now be
awesome<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.190> we<00:02:05.280> could<00:02:05.340> get<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.730> that<00:02:05.760> ride

awesome if we could get it to that ride
height<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.660> that's<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.080> low

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
height but I think that's a little low

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.730 
height but I think that's a little low
you'll<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.540> higher<00:02:09.750> vena<00:02:09.990> 67<00:02:10.649> it's

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
you'll be a little higher vena 67 it's

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.900
