think in this review to test it out song
and<00:00:35.110> review<00:00:36.110> this<00:00:36.530> helicopter<00:00:37.570> yeah<00:00:38.570> so<00:00:38.750> messy

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
and review this helicopter yeah so messy

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.490 
and review this helicopter yeah so messy
this<00:00:39.559> is<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.830> belt<00:00:40.280> CP<00:00:40.670> version<00:00:41.180> one<00:00:41.500> you

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
this is the belt CP version one you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.439 
this is the belt CP version one you
might<00:00:42.860> know<00:00:43.070> there<00:00:43.460> are<00:00:43.579> two<00:00:43.760> versions<00:00:43.970> out

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
might know there are two versions out

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.520 
might know there are two versions out
there<00:00:44.480> right<00:00:44.960> now<00:00:45.579> that's<00:00:46.579> I<00:00:46.760> I<00:00:47.360> like<00:00:48.170> this<00:00:48.320> one

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
there right now that's I I like this one

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.299 
there right now that's I I like this one
better<00:00:48.860> actually

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
better actually

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.139 
better actually
at<00:00:49.970> least<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.269> looks<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.540> it<00:00:50.659> and<00:00:51.079> as<00:00:52.040> we<00:00:52.220> used

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
at least the looks of it and as we used

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.060 
at least the looks of it and as we used
to<00:00:53.210> do<00:00:53.359> we<00:00:53.600> will<00:00:53.870> start<00:00:54.350> off<00:00:54.440> with<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.649> negative

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
to do we will start off with a negative

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.400 
to do we will start off with a negative
so<00:00:55.460> this<00:00:55.579> helicopter<00:00:56.020> maybe<00:00:57.020> you<00:00:57.109> can<00:00:57.260> say

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
so this helicopter maybe you can say

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.740 
so this helicopter maybe you can say
some<00:00:57.940> yeah<00:00:59.559> he<00:01:00.559> says<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:01.699> has<00:01:01.940> weak<00:01:02.210> servos

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
some yeah he says it has weak servos

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.510 
some yeah he says it has weak servos
yeah<00:01:03.550> it's<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:06.020> server's<00:01:06.380> they<00:01:06.619> are<00:01:06.679> pretty

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
yeah it's the server's they are pretty

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.469 
yeah it's the server's they are pretty
weak<00:01:07.789> if<00:01:08.660> you<00:01:09.039> wanted<00:01:10.039> it<00:01:10.160> would<00:01:10.610> fly<00:01:10.880> 3db

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
weak if you wanted it would fly 3db

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.810 
weak if you wanted it would fly 3db
circuitry<00:01:12.140> need<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.410> buy<00:01:12.560> there<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.610> table

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
circuitry need to buy there the table

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.700 
circuitry need to buy there the table
our<00:01:14.060> servos<00:01:15.520> but<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.670> fu<00:01:16.940> yes<00:01:17.240> is<00:01:17.390> fly<00:01:17.539> like<00:01:17.780> no

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
our servos but the fu yes is fly like no

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.990 
our servos but the fu yes is fly like no
hope<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:19.250> like<00:01:19.869> it's<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:21.020> miserable<00:01:21.759> day<00:01:22.759> or

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
as I know from the cars the micro servos

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.600 
as I know from the cars the micro servos
are<00:01:28.759> worse<00:01:29.000> than<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.360> big<00:01:29.509> ones<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.610> haven't

it's when it's right over a box is the
there's<00:02:51.930> workplace<00:02:52.350> as<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.650> see<00:02:52.800> here<00:02:53.090> you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
there's workplace as you see here you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.200 
there's workplace as you see here you
need<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.360> lovely<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:56.310> know<00:02:56.430> level<00:02:57.030> in

in the neutral mode as we show here and

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.330 
in the neutral mode as we show here and
now<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.940> positives<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:09.420> counts<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
now to the positives it counts the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.550 
now to the positives it counts the
velocity<00:03:11.880> comes<00:03:12.180> with<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.630> brushless<00:03:13.140> motor

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
velocity comes with a brushless motor

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.170 
velocity comes with a brushless motor
and<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:14.730> free<00:03:15.570> s<00:03:15.900> lipo<00:03:16.500> which<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.550> where<00:03:17.970> the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
and a free s lipo which is where the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.020 
and a free s lipo which is where the
first<00:03:18.540> helicopter<00:03:19.490> yeah<00:03:20.490> it's<00:03:20.850> really

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
first helicopter yeah it's really

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.970 
first helicopter yeah it's really
powerful<00:03:21.510> there's<00:03:21.870> no<00:03:22.050> need<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.350> upgrade<00:03:22.560> this

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
powerful there's no need to upgrade this

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.460 
powerful there's no need to upgrade this
you<00:03:23.459> can<00:03:23.700> buy<00:03:24.240> a<00:03:24.270> better<00:03:24.540> battery<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.290> have

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
you can buy a better battery so you have

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.850 
you can buy a better battery so you have
so<00:03:26.430> get<00:03:26.640> longer<00:03:26.940> runtime<00:03:27.380> one<00:03:28.380> time<00:03:28.650> it's

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
so get longer runtime one time it's

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.660 
so get longer runtime one time it's
about<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.730> would<00:03:29.940> say<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:31.140> can<00:03:31.410> fly<00:03:31.650> 10<00:03:32.280> minutes

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
about I would say you can fly 10 minutes

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
aluminum and the skids landing skids

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.800 
aluminum and the skids landing skids
they<00:04:08.820> are<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.260> carbon<00:04:10.260> fiber<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:11.540> some<00:04:12.540> course

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
they are in carbon fiber and some course

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.500 
they are in carbon fiber and some course
here<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.320> fly<00:04:13.500> bar<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.489> some<00:04:14.790> other<00:04:15.030> things

here the fly bar and some other things

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.560 
here the fly bar and some other things
the<00:04:16.260> rest<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.500> plastics<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:18.269> is<00:04:18.359> pretty

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
the rest is plastics and that is pretty

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.830 
the rest is plastics and that is pretty
good<00:04:18.750> because<00:04:19.260> if<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.739> crash<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:21.479> spare

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
good because if you crash the spare

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.659 
good because if you crash the spare
parts<00:04:22.109> are<00:04:22.200> very<00:04:22.500> cheap<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:22.950> is<00:04:23.190> helicopter

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
parts are very cheap and is helicopter

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.640 
parts are very cheap and is helicopter
and

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
and

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.600 
and
the<00:04:26.930> remembrance<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.290> mayonnaise<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:29.190> made

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
the remembrance the mayonnaise is made

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.650 
the remembrance the mayonnaise is made
of<00:04:30.030> light<00:04:30.750> wood<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:32.550> if<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:33.060> crash<00:04:33.300> with<00:04:33.510> it

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
of light wood so if you crash with it

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.200 
of light wood so if you crash with it
they<00:04:34.350> like<00:04:34.949> better<00:04:35.400> yeah<00:04:35.850> they<00:04:36.060> really

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
they like better yeah they really

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.980 
they like better yeah they really
explode<00:04:36.630> it's<00:04:37.440> about<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.800> tree<00:04:38.669> so<00:04:38.940> if<00:04:39.870> you

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
explode it's about a tree so if you

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.629 
explode it's about a tree so if you
craft<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.380> would<00:04:40.530> break<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:41.280> might<00:04:41.430> want<00:04:41.610> to

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
craft a would break you might want to

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.060 
craft a would break you might want to
get<00:04:41.760> the<00:04:42.030> core<00:04:42.300> of<00:04:42.330> a<00:04:42.449> fiber<00:04:42.770> they<00:04:43.770> can<00:04:43.949> break

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
get the core of a fiber they can break

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.290 
get the core of a fiber they can break
too<00:04:44.280> but<00:04:44.550> there<00:04:44.820> are<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.510> lot<00:04:45.570> more<00:04:45.720> durable

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
too but there are a lot more durable

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.240 
too but there are a lot more durable
yeah<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.540> then<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.229> might<00:04:49.410> destroy

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
yeah and then you might destroy

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.810 
yeah and then you might destroy
something<00:04:50.820> else<00:04:51.000> if<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.870> have<00:04:52.160> durable<00:04:53.220> yeah

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
something else if you have durable yeah

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.439 
something else if you have durable yeah
exactly

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
exactly

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.280 
exactly
now<00:04:54.750> if<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.050> crash<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:57.750> place<00:04:57.930> explode

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
now if you crash the the place explode

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.719 
now if you crash the the place explode
you<00:04:58.470> might<00:04:58.710> say<00:04:59.160> something<00:04:59.520> here<00:04:59.850> in<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:01.729> air

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
you might say something here in the air

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.090 
you might say something here in the air
overhead<00:05:03.000> but<00:05:03.960> if<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.169> have<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:04.350> corner<00:05:04.800> fiber

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
overhead but if you have a corner fiber

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.700 
overhead but if you have a corner fiber
something<00:05:06.139> will<00:05:07.139> break<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.860> instant<00:05:08.220> so<00:05:08.520> I

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
something will break the instant so I

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.650 
something will break the instant so I
like<00:05:10.710> the<00:05:10.919> wooden<00:05:11.490> blades<00:05:11.790> in<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.330> airship

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
like the wooden blades in the airship

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.129 
like the wooden blades in the airship
yeah<00:05:13.169> they<00:05:13.320> were<00:05:13.410> person<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:14.660> buy<00:05:15.660> new<00:05:15.870> this

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
yeah they were person to buy new this

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.770 
yeah they were person to buy new this
pair<00:05:16.350> for<00:05:17.930> tracks<00:05:18.930> of<00:05:19.080> skaters<00:05:19.470> yeah<00:05:20.600> maybe<00:05:21.600> we

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
pair for tracks of skaters yeah maybe we

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.879 
pair for tracks of skaters yeah maybe we
should<00:05:21.810> say<00:05:22.139> that<00:05:22.320> this<00:05:22.440> is<00:05:22.500> not<00:05:22.770> from

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
should say that this is not from
