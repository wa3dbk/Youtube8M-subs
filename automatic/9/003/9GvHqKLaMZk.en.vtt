00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
where it shouldn't be the big question

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.780

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
a top-flight quarterback and therefore a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.160 
a top-flight quarterback and therefore a
high<00:00:38.250> draft<00:00:38.550> pick<00:00:38.790> most<00:00:39.210> teams<00:00:39.450> now<00:00:39.660> say<00:00:39.899> maybe
