00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:02.659 
all right today what I have here is uh

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.200 
all right today what I have here is uh
what<00:00:03.659> I'm<00:00:03.780> doing<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.259> uh<00:00:04.580> taking<00:00:05.580> apart<00:00:06.000> this

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
what I'm doing is uh taking apart this

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.970 
what I'm doing is uh taking apart this
microwave<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:06.960> had<00:00:07.140> in<00:00:07.259> my<00:00:07.379> store<00:00:07.680> said<00:00:07.950> that

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
microwave that had in my store said that

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.799 
microwave that had in my store said that
I<00:00:08.160> don't<00:00:08.340> know<00:00:08.790> use<00:00:09.120> anymore<00:00:09.420> everything

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
I don't know use anymore everything

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.730 
I don't know use anymore everything
worked<00:00:10.460> but<00:00:11.460> uh<00:00:11.870> the<00:00:12.870> microwave<00:00:13.380> would<00:00:13.500> just

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
worked but uh the microwave would just

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.589 
worked but uh the microwave would just
put<00:00:13.920> off<00:00:14.040> too<00:00:14.219> much<00:00:14.370> heat<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> kitchen<00:00:15.210> so

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
put off too much heat in the kitchen so

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.689 
put off too much heat in the kitchen so
when<00:00:15.960> I'm<00:00:16.080> about<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> new<00:00:16.529> smaller<00:00:17.130> microwave

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
when I'm about a new smaller microwave

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.529 
when I'm about a new smaller microwave
and<00:00:17.970> I'm<00:00:18.690> taking<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.140> apart<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:20.359> go<00:00:21.359> these

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and I'm taking it apart and I go these

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.929 
and I'm taking it apart and I go these
parts<00:00:21.960> here

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
parts here

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.220 
parts here
I'm<00:00:23.939> not<00:00:24.150> electrician<00:00:24.720> or<00:00:24.750> anything<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.140> think

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
I'm not electrician or anything I think

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.500 
I'm not electrician or anything I think
is<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.529> capacitor<00:00:26.160> there's<00:00:27.119> some<00:00:27.269> kind<00:00:27.480> of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
is the capacitor there's some kind of

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.730 
is the capacitor there's some kind of
transformer<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.429> heavy<00:00:29.789> man<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
transformer this thing is heavy man is

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.490 
transformer this thing is heavy man is
this<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.949> where<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> weight<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
this is where to all the weight of the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.299 
this is where to all the weight of the
frickin<00:00:34.500> microwave<00:00:34.980> come<00:00:35.219> from<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:36.200> says

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
frickin microwave come from it says

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.639 
frickin microwave come from it says
since<00:00:38.309> 2005<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.360> microwave<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.500> got

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
since 2005 on that microwave and I got

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.110 
since 2005 on that microwave and I got
some<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:41.730> motor<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:43.670> cooling<00:00:44.670> fan<00:00:44.879> motor

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
some little motor here cooling fan motor

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.299 
some little motor here cooling fan motor
whatever<00:00:45.450> was<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> think<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.920> was<00:00:47.010> made<00:00:47.190> in

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
whatever was so I think it was made in

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.430 
whatever was so I think it was made in
2005<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:50.149> if<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.270> turn<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.840> some<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.199> wind

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
2005 but if we turn up some kind of wind

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
2005 but if we turn up some kind of wind
generator<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.399> something<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> don't

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
generator with this or something I don't

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.819 
generator with this or something I don't
know<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.289> doing<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.739> this

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
know but what I'm doing with this

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.000 
know but what I'm doing with this
microwave<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> uh<00:00:57.379> I'm<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> take<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.920> all

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
microwave is uh I'm going to take it all

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.070 
microwave is uh I'm going to take it all
apart<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.949> I<00:01:02.149> want<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> use<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> stainless

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
apart and I want to use the stainless

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.960 
apart and I want to use the stainless
steel<00:01:04.110> off<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.650> microwave<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.489> cover<00:01:05.729> some

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
steel off this microwave to cover some

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:14.200 
steel off this microwave to cover some
panels<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.790> I'm<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.000> MacGyver<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:12.350> is<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
panels so I'm going to MacGyver it is a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.850 
panels so I'm going to MacGyver it is a
different<00:01:15.210> stainless<00:01:15.630> steel<00:01:15.810> thing<00:01:16.170> plates

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
different stainless steel thing plates

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.969 
different stainless steel thing plates
and<00:01:17.040> air<00:01:17.130> cut<00:01:17.340> them<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.580> into<00:01:17.820> smaller<00:01:18.180> plates

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
and air cut them up into smaller plates

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.469 
and air cut them up into smaller plates
so<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.520> make<00:01:20.700> my<00:01:20.850> 88<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> generator<00:01:23.479> so

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
so I can make my 88 to a generator so

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.670 
so I can make my 88 to a generator so
that's<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.170> doing<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:27.439> I'll<00:01:28.439> be

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that's what I'm doing now and I'll be

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.719 
that's what I'm doing now and I'll be
videotaping<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.100> bottom<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
videotaping as I do it the bottom of the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.940 
videotaping as I do it the bottom of the
microwave<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> let's<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.590> what's<00:01:34.770> under

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
microwave and let's see what's under

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
microwave and let's see what's under
door<00:01:35.250> number<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:38.299> some<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.600> sheet<00:01:39.869> metal

that is stainless steel actually this is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.830 
that is stainless steel actually this is
pretty<00:01:46.229> light<00:01:46.470> now

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.020

whatever that is but this is a
underneath<00:02:04.460> microwave<00:02:05.460> we<00:02:05.820> ever<00:02:05.939> wondered

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
underneath microwave we ever wondered

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.410 
underneath microwave we ever wondered
this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:10.099> Samuel<00:02:11.099> microwave<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:12.209> I'm

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
this is a Samuel microwave that I'm

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.140 
this is a Samuel microwave that I'm
dismantling<00:02:13.050> just<00:02:13.650> for<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> stainless<00:02:14.220> steel

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.059 

final<00:02:18.150> product<00:02:21.590> that's<00:02:22.590> what<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:22.830> microwave

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
final product that's what a microwave

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.660 
final product that's what a microwave
looks<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.790> when<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:24.299> got<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:28.670> think

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
looks like when this we got it I think

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.030 
looks like when this we got it I think
it's<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:29.970> stainless<00:02:30.420> steel<00:02:33.860> figure<00:02:34.860> if<00:02:34.980> I

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
it's this stainless steel figure if I

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.330 
it's this stainless steel figure if I
just<00:02:35.930> cut<00:02:36.930> some<00:02:36.959> circles<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.739> here<00:02:37.950> makes<00:02:38.190> more

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
just cut some circles in here makes more

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.360 
just cut some circles in here makes more
washers<00:02:40.280> maybe<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.489> said<00:02:41.730> square<00:02:42.299> side<00:02:42.569> there

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
washers maybe you said square side there

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:51.559 
washers maybe you said square side there
also<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:48.360> add<00:02:49.049> more<00:02:49.410> place<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.569> little

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
also to add more place to my little

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.900 
also to add more place to my little
generator<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.230> have

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
generator that I have

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.949 
generator that I have
anyways<00:02:53.910> that's<00:02:54.120> what's<00:02:54.359> left<00:02:54.510> over<00:02:54.690> when<00:02:54.900> you

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
anyways that's what's left over when you

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.199 
anyways that's what's left over when you
take<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> microwave<00:02:55.709> apart<00:02:56.070> there's<00:02:56.549> actually

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
take a microwave apart there's actually

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.970 
take a microwave apart there's actually
this<00:02:57.329> microwave<00:02:57.690> was<00:02:57.930> nothing<00:02:58.290> wrong<00:02:58.440> with<00:02:58.650> it

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
this microwave was nothing wrong with it

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.949 
this microwave was nothing wrong with it
it<00:02:59.519> was<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> sanyo<00:03:00.470> here's<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.709> door<00:03:02.780> it's<00:03:03.780> got
