00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
the same platform as the Komodo okay so

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.990 
the same platform as the Komodo okay so
they<00:01:13.240> can<00:01:13.390> put<00:01:13.570> it<00:01:13.659> into<00:01:13.900> your<00:01:14.110> left<00:01:14.650> hand

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000

they can put it into your left hand
I'll<00:01:16.240> retrieve<00:01:16.720> as<00:01:16.900> well<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.060> high-speed

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
I'll retrieve as well it is a high-speed

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.330 
I'll retrieve as well it is a high-speed
rail<00:01:19.810> at<00:01:20.110> six<00:01:21.100> point<00:01:21.250> two<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.610> one<00:01:21.870> ratio<00:01:23.340> so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
rail at six point two to one ratio so

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.660 
rail at six point two to one ratio so
basically<00:01:24.730> every<00:01:25.600> time<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.050> turn<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.320> crank

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
basically every time you turn the crank

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.160 
basically every time you turn the crank
one<00:01:27.670> we're<00:01:28.030> going<00:01:28.120> to<00:01:28.180> reel<00:01:28.510> in<00:01:29.280> 31.5<00:01:30.280> inches

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170

easy just hold the real solid and twist
the<00:01:57.090> side<00:01:57.270> plate<00:01:57.510> down<00:01:57.869> towards<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> ground

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the side plate down towards the ground

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950 
the side plate down towards the ground
okay<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.460> pops<00:01:59.700> off<00:01:59.880> okay<00:02:00.450> nice<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:00.750> easy

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
cool once you take that off the spool

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.300 
cool once you take that off the spool
actually<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.520> come<00:02:05.700> out

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
actually just come out

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.600 
actually just come out
and<00:02:07.610> that's<00:02:07.880> how<00:02:08.060> we<00:02:08.119> adjust<00:02:08.539> our<00:02:09.610> braking

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
and that's how we adjust our braking

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.650 
and that's how we adjust our braking
system<00:02:10.940> okay<00:02:11.240> awesome

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
system okay awesome

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.780 
system okay awesome
it's<00:02:11.810> quite<00:02:12.080> simple<00:02:12.500> because<00:02:12.830> it's<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.370> zero<00:02:13.640> to

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
it's quite simple because it's a zero to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.540 
it's quite simple because it's a zero to
six<00:02:14.530> instead<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.650> pumping<00:02:15.830> weights<00:02:16.160> pushing

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
six instead of pumping weights pushing

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.430 
six instead of pumping weights pushing
in<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.760> out<00:02:16.850> just<00:02:17.540> zero<00:02:17.720> two<00:02:17.810> six<00:02:17.990> zero<00:02:18.170> is

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
in and out just zero two six zero is
