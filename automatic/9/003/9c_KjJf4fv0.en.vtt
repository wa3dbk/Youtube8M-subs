00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
stainless steel in here now which is

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.980 
stainless steel in here now which is
going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> help<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:48.570> sharpenings

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
going to help with with sharpenings

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.240 
going to help with with sharpenings
actually<00:01:49.290> holds<00:01:49.500> an<00:01:49.770> edge<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> little<00:01:50.040> bit

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
actually holds an edge a little bit

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.249 
actually holds an edge a little bit
longer<00:01:50.490> that's<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.329> nice<00:01:51.450> hard<00:01:51.720> steel<00:01:51.960> so

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
longer that's a nice hard steel so

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.740 
longer that's a nice hard steel so
they'll<00:01:52.740> get<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> benefits<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.750> this

skate here so you guys know is youth 12

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.999 
skate here so you guys know is youth 12
and<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.689> raid<00:01:57.899> them<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.350> weighed<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:58.920> on

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
and we raid them we weighed this here on

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.490 
and we raid them we weighed this here on
a<00:01:59.070> grand<00:01:59.340> scale<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.850> only<00:01:59.939> came<00:02:00.210> up<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:01.350> far

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
a grand scale and it only came up as far

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.870 
a grand scale and it only came up as far
as<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.270> was<00:02:03.420> maybe<00:02:03.659> close<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.880> 300

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880

as performance again I'll give it a 4

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.850 
as performance again I'll give it a 4
because<00:03:41.450> just<00:03:41.660> like<00:03:41.720> any<00:03:41.930> other<00:03:41.989> ski<00:03:42.350> it's<00:03:42.739> not

the<00:03:56.900> steel<00:03:57.170> elements<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:57.650> is<00:03:57.709> just<00:03:58.100> one

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
the steel elements this is just one

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.550 
the steel elements this is just one
molded<00:03:59.450> piece<00:03:59.600> in<00:03:59.840> other<00:03:59.989> words<00:04:00.140> of<00:04:00.230> steel<00:04:00.410> is

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
molded piece in other words of steel is

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.380 
molded piece in other words of steel is
actually<00:04:00.860> molded<00:04:01.160> with<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.760> holder<00:04:02.030> itself
