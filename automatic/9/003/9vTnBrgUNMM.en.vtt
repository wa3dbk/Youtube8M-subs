finished<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.880> finish<00:02:28.120> on<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.300> front<00:02:28.510> here

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
finished the finish on the front here

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.840 
finished the finish on the front here
yeah<00:02:29.110> yeah<00:02:29.380> this<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.800> thing<00:02:30.310> we<00:02:30.430> develop<00:02:30.760> our

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
yeah yeah this is a thing we develop our

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.380 
yeah yeah this is a thing we develop our
stealth<00:02:31.150> powerful

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
stealth powerful

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.100 
stealth powerful
most<00:02:33.069> in<00:02:34.069> walls<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.490> on<00:02:34.580> walls<00:02:34.819> have<00:02:35.330> fairly

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
most in walls and on walls have fairly

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.080 
most in walls and on walls have fairly
wide<00:02:36.350> battles<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.370> problem<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.760> with<00:02:37.910> that

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
wide battles the problem is with that

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.070 
wide battles the problem is with that
you<00:02:38.270> get

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
you get

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.140 
you get
a<00:02:40.140> coloration<00:02:40.710> from<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.310> front<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.700> back

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
a coloration from the front of the back

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.270 
a coloration from the front of the back
and<00:02:42.569> what<00:02:42.750> our<00:02:42.780> acoustic<00:02:43.170> chaps<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.829> factory

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
and what our acoustic chaps the factory

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.850 
and what our acoustic chaps the factory
have<00:02:44.370> developed<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.840> people<00:02:46.140> still<00:02:46.379> baffled

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
have developed the people still baffled

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.619 
have developed the people still baffled
and<00:02:47.159> they<00:02:47.220> looked<00:02:47.519> at<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.760> frequencies<00:02:48.329> the

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
and they looked at the frequencies the

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.920 
and they looked at the frequencies the
radio<00:02:49.379> off<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.980> front<00:02:50.159> of<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.430> battle<00:02:50.930> and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
radio off the front of the battle and

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.280 
radio off the front of the battle and
they've<00:02:52.110> designed<00:02:52.439> this<00:02:52.640> acute<00:02:53.640> material

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
they've designed this acute material

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.199 
they've designed this acute material
which<00:02:55.290> specifically<00:02:55.769> absorbs<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.519> so<00:02:57.090> they

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
which specifically absorbs that so they

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.729 
which specifically absorbs that so they
sound<00:02:57.390> very<00:02:57.540> very<00:02:57.780> clean<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.560> image

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
sound very very clean in the image

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.920 
sound very very clean in the image
properly<00:02:59.099> otherwise<00:02:59.489> they'd<00:03:00.090> sound<00:03:00.329> a<00:03:00.599> little

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
properly otherwise they'd sound a little

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.539 
properly otherwise they'd sound a little
bit<00:03:01.109> like<00:03:01.290> someone<00:03:01.680> shouting<00:03:02.099> through<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> cup

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
bit like someone shouting through a cup

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.390 
bit like someone shouting through a cup
so<00:03:03.390> they<00:03:03.510> sound<00:03:03.750> less<00:03:04.019> less<00:03:04.260> much<00:03:04.739> less<00:03:04.769> valid

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
so they sound less less much less valid

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.309 
so they sound less less much less valid
and<00:03:05.670> more<00:03:05.879> like<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.060> true<00:03:06.510> monitor

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
and more like a true monitor

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.589 
and more like a true monitor
it<00:03:08.680> looks<00:03:08.890> like<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.069> sealed<00:03:09.549> box<00:03:09.819> unit<00:03:10.120> there<00:03:10.390> so

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
it looks like a sealed box unit there so

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.750 
it looks like a sealed box unit there so
i<00:03:10.870> take<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.290> that<00:03:11.319> can<00:03:11.530> go<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.859> wall<00:03:12.099> or<00:03:12.340> on<00:03:12.370> what

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
i take it that can go in wall or on what

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.369 
i take it that can go in wall or on what
it's<00:03:12.939> it's<00:03:13.269> not<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.450> sealed<00:03:13.689> box<00:03:13.930> because<00:03:14.230> it's

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
it's it's not a sealed box because it's

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.619 
it's it's not a sealed box because it's
got<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:15.639> vent<00:03:15.849> is<00:03:15.999> in<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.180> front<00:03:16.359> to

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
got a the vent is in the front to

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.629 
got a the vent is in the front to
transmission<00:03:16.989> line<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.920> it's<00:03:18.069> an<00:03:18.159> extended

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
transmission line so it's an extended

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.750 
transmission line so it's an extended
line

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
line

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.059 
line
it's<00:03:20.330> called<00:03:20.540> an<00:03:20.629> H<00:03:20.750> line<00:03:21.049> because<00:03:21.560> normally<00:03:22.040> I

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
it's called an H line because normally I

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.780 
it's called an H line because normally I
loudspeakers<00:03:22.760> would<00:03:23.000> be

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
loudspeakers would be

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.580 
loudspeakers would be
the<00:03:25.329> drive<00:03:25.599> unit<00:03:25.900> would<00:03:26.019> appear<00:03:26.230> in<00:03:26.349> the<00:03:26.409> front

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
the drive unit would appear in the front

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.090 
the drive unit would appear in the front
of<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.739> cabinet

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
of the cabinet

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.260 
of the cabinet
folded<00:03:28.910> line<00:03:29.120> would<00:03:29.360> extend<00:03:29.630> from<00:03:29.930> behind

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
folded line would extend from behind

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.020 
folded line would extend from behind
the<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.870> main<00:03:32.050> base<00:03:32.320> unit<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.130> then<00:03:33.400> down<00:03:33.700> and

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
the the main base unit and then down and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.770 
the the main base unit and then down and
then<00:03:34.090> out<00:03:34.420> towards<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.960> front<00:03:35.200> but<00:03:35.980> with<00:03:36.160> the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
then out towards the front but with the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.880 
then out towards the front but with the
with<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.810> way<00:03:38.110> for<00:03:38.380> it's<00:03:38.470> very<00:03:38.560> very

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
with the way for it's very very

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.920 
with the way for it's very very
difficult<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.370> do<00:03:39.490> that<00:03:39.730> because<00:03:40.180> going<00:03:40.840> to

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
difficult to do that because going to

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.660 
difficult to do that because going to
put<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.140> into<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.380> wall<00:03:41.560> you're<00:03:41.590> radiating<00:03:42.280> from

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
put it into a wall you're radiating from

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.130 
put it into a wall you're radiating from
the<00:03:42.790> rear<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:43.450> have<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.720> have<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:43.840> friends

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
the rear so you have to have the friends

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.710 
the rear so you have to have the friends
of<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.830> event<00:03:45.790> in<00:03:45.910> front<00:03:46.210> but<00:03:46.420> there's<00:03:46.600> no

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
of the the event in front but there's no

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.930 
of the the event in front but there's no
depth<00:03:47.020> of<00:03:47.320> cabinet<00:03:47.800> so<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.370> can't<00:03:48.640> have<00:03:48.760> the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
depth of cabinet so you can't have the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.030 
depth of cabinet so you can't have the
line<00:03:49.510> extending<00:03:50.050> away<00:03:50.140> from<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.560> drive<00:03:50.770> in<00:03:50.950> it

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
line extending away from the drive in it

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.330 
line extending away from the drive in it
so<00:03:51.430> what<00:03:51.580> we've<00:03:51.730> built<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.300> an<00:03:52.420> H<00:03:52.570> line<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.920> it's

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
so what we've built is an H line so it's

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.310 
so what we've built is an H line so it's
from<00:03:55.030> behind<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.390> base<00:03:55.540> unit<00:03:55.720> you've<00:03:56.080> got

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
from behind the base unit you've got

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.270 
from behind the base unit you've got
partitions<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:57.250> create<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.940> out<00:03:58.030> shape

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
partitions that create the out shape

that's<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.580> proof<00:05:06.729> in<00:05:06.879> the<00:05:06.939> pudding

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
that's the proof in the pudding

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.420 
that's the proof in the pudding
yeah<00:05:08.510> well<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:09.290> think<00:05:09.590> it<00:05:09.800> goes<00:05:09.949> with<00:05:10.100> it<00:05:10.190> seeing

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
yeah well I think it goes with it seeing

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.129 
yeah well I think it goes with it seeing
if<00:05:10.580> it<00:05:10.699> if<00:05:10.850> it<00:05:10.940> can<00:05:11.060> be<00:05:11.090> used<00:05:11.389> for<00:05:11.479> professional

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139
