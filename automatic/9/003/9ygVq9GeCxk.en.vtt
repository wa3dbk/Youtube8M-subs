00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.750
 unmanned aerial vehicles one of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.660
 significant technical developments 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.330
 our time of flying pollutant 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.950
 measuring device that in case of disaster 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.130
 directly in the hazard zone analyzes 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.439
 by way of camera copter the 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.270
 examine buildings for damage or damage 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.740
 equipped with infrared technology 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.080
 detect burglars 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.250
 the application possibilities of this technology 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.359
 are diverse and the industry is booming 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.070
 the special thing about the technology is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.040
 certainly that easy to use 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.640
 is almost everyone and that one 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.500
 Things from the air must be able to inspect 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.660
 previously so beside the possibility even 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.850
 it was not existent it is venues 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.469
 developers of civilian drones and as 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.719
 one of four experts to one 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.520
 Talk of the cdu csu group in the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.500
 German Bundestag invited 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.309
 it is about the possible use of this 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.739
 technology in the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.079
 development cooperation, for example 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.430
 in the fight against illegal poaching in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.470
 African nature reserves 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:10.020
 panacea but now find it 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.939
 as a real option to order for more than 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.299
 the technology is really relative 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.549
 quickly developed and on it 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.680
 The donkey donkey is shirked by the horse 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.330
 federal college lausanne sid 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.540
 but many more besides 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.610
 applications in africa where 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 the infrastructure is very bad and 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.869
 using drones, for example, medicines 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.210
 be delivered to remote areas 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.790
 We can have a wing on this 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.460
 The eth zurich he develops can be up to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.100
 two kilograms over 120 kilometers 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.509
 transport and costs just 900 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.509
 euro in production 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.560
 in addition to the many possibilities there are 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.870
 but so far unsolved problems there 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.210
 So security issues are integration 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.960
 from tons of airspace insurance 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.369
 liability is also an issue in many 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.800
 countries are not even considered 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.039
 and then perhaps the hardest 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.770
 point is the question how do we get it 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.630
 towards the civilian use of drones too 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.680
 in the perception of the military 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.830
 use to separate 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.270
 it is the future we will be above all 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.760
 in the medical field 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.230
 care area and the like also in 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.810
 development cooperation, however 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.160
 certainly also have a potential here 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.190
 What happens in the next ten years 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.830
 will develop on the North Sea island 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.989
 juist has the future in the meantime 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.269
 already started last year 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.280
 here was the island pharmacy cartridge 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.670
 supplied with some medications 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.160
 so far only 14 months trial in 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.810
 a few years may be quite a bit 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.810
 everyday service
