either<00:00:53.219> way<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.879> opinion<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.539> at<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.780> same

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
either way my opinion but at the same

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.689 
either way my opinion but at the same
time<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.319> thought<00:00:55.649> Chris<00:00:55.890> Algieri<00:00:56.069> deserved

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699

the<00:00:56.850> fight<00:00:57.059> more<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.539> thought<00:00:57.899> he<00:00:58.050> was<00:00:58.170> boxing

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.680 
the fight more I thought he was boxing
really<00:00:58.890> well<00:00:59.069> I<00:00:59.309> thought<00:00:59.879> he<00:01:00.030> was<00:01:00.149> sending<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
really well I thought he was sending a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450 
really well I thought he was sending a
lot<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.989> shots<00:01:01.199> he<00:01:01.379> landed<00:01:01.859> more<00:01:02.039> shots<00:01:02.339> than

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
lot of shots he landed more shots than

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.640 
lot of shots he landed more shots than
through<00:01:02.969> some<00:01:03.149> provodnikov<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.929> Wilson

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
through some provodnikov I Wilson

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.260 
through some provodnikov I Wilson
provodnikov<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.370> my<00:01:05.489> opinion<00:01:05.760> wasn't<00:01:06.000> really

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
provodnikov in my opinion wasn't really

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.040 
provodnikov in my opinion wasn't really
doing<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.540> much<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:07.380> me<00:01:07.580> I<00:01:08.990> could<00:01:09.990> have

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
doing that much to me I could have

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.380 
doing that much to me I could have
easily<00:01:10.229> scored<00:01:10.800> this<00:01:10.920> fight<00:01:11.250> more<00:01:11.670> towards

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
easily scored this fight more towards

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.050 
easily scored this fight more towards
with<00:01:13.259> some<00:01:13.439> provodnikov<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> said<00:01:14.759> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
with some provodnikov but like I said it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.010 
with some provodnikov but like I said it
could<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.360> gone<00:01:15.509> either<00:01:15.570> way<00:01:15.780> depending

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
could have gone either way depending

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.050 
could have gone either way depending
what<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.820> feel<00:01:18.030> like
