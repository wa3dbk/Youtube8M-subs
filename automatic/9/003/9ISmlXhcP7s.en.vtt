00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
you guys updated with my thought process

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.250 
you guys updated with my thought process
on<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.629> point<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.079> time

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
on this and at this point in time

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590 
on this and at this point in time
there's<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> couple<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.610> different<00:00:45.090> options

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
there's a couple of different options

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.540 
there's a couple of different options
that<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.780> think<00:00:46.140> could<00:00:46.410> actually<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:47.280> what's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that I think could actually be what's

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
that I think could actually be what's
going<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.180> option<00:00:48.690> number<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:49.260> which<00:00:49.500> i<00:00:49.680> think

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
going on option number one which i think

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.910 
going on option number one which i think
is<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.370> most<00:00:50.700> likely<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.719> when<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.379> say<00:00:52.620> most

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
is the most likely and when I say most

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.200 
is the most likely and when I say most
likely<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.399> mean<00:00:53.789> probably<00:00:55.280> 99.999%<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.969> case

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
likely I mean probably 99.999% the case

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.139 
likely I mean probably 99.999% the case
and<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.230> Sony<00:00:58.649> North<00:00:59.010> America<00:00:59.730> most

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and that is this Sony North America most

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.290 
and that is this Sony North America most
likely<00:01:00.809> took<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.410> Christmas<00:01:02.070> vacation<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.059> if

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
likely took a Christmas vacation and if

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.020 
likely took a Christmas vacation and if
that<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.870> case<00:01:03.899> then<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.680> should<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.640> my

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that is the case then they should if my

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.420 
that is the case then they should if my
calculations<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.840> correct<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.860> back<00:01:08.220> in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
calculations are correct be back in

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.789 
calculations are correct be back in
their<00:01:08.549> office<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.240> monday<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.020> work<00:01:10.409> should

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
their office this monday in work should

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.340 
their office this monday in work should
resume<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.490> normal<00:01:11.549> as<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.780> option<00:01:13.320> number

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
resume as normal as for option number

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.340 
resume as normal as for option number
two<00:01:14.040> there<00:01:14.430> might<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:15.330> been<00:01:16.020> an

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
two there might have actually been an

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.920 
two there might have actually been an
issue<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> update<00:01:17.610> for<00:01:18.150> north<00:01:18.390> america

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
issue with the update for north america

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.170 
issue with the update for north america
on<00:01:19.080> playstation<00:01:19.799> 4<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.150> case

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
on playstation 4 and if that is the case

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.270 
on playstation 4 and if that is the case
then<00:01:21.420> sony<00:01:21.900> would<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.320> sent<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.619> back<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
then sony would have sent that back to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.789 
then sony would have sent that back to
4j<00:01:23.670> studios<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.600> we<00:01:24.780> already<00:01:24.960> know<00:01:25.320> 4j

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
4j studios and as we already know 4j

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.219 
4j studios and as we already know 4j
Studios<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.759> holiday<00:01:26.970> break<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.200> that

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
Studios is on holiday break so if that

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.990 
Studios is on holiday break so if that
is<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.770> case<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:29.159> again<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.430> think<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
is the case which again I think is the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.569 
is the case which again I think is the
more<00:01:30.150> unlikely<00:01:30.750> case<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.680> PlayStation<00:01:32.310> 4

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
more unlikely case because PlayStation 4

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.880 
more unlikely case because PlayStation 4
already<00:01:32.820> got<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.390> for<00:01:33.570> Europe<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.680> is

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
already got it for Europe but if that is

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.980 
already got it for Europe but if that is
the<00:01:35.100> case<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.790> means<00:01:35.939> when<00:01:36.240> 4j<00:01:36.600> Studios

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the case then that means when 4j Studios

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.870 
the case then that means when 4j Studios
comes<00:01:37.290> back<00:01:37.500> into<00:01:37.680> their<00:01:37.860> studio<00:01:38.220> most<00:01:38.520> likely

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
comes back into their studio most likely

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.609 
comes back into their studio most likely
this<00:01:39.060> Monday<00:01:39.450> they'll<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> get<00:01:40.259> back<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
this Monday they'll have to get back to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.920 
this Monday they'll have to get back to
work<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.220> update<00:01:41.670> fix<00:01:42.180> whatever<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.720> bug

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.880 
testing again so with all of this set I
definitely<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.290> those<00:01:49.560> two

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
definitely think it's one of those two

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.460 
definitely think it's one of those two
options<00:01:50.100> unless<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:51.240> some<00:01:51.270> reason<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:52.170> taking

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
options unless for some reason is taking

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.200 
options unless for some reason is taking
an<00:01:52.560> abnormal<00:01:52.770> amount<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.490> time<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.790> test<00:01:54.030> this

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
an abnormal amount of time to test this

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.929 
an abnormal amount of time to test this
thing<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.659> perhaps<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:56.100> might<00:01:56.369> actually<00:01:56.670> be

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
thing or perhaps it might actually be

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.520 
thing or perhaps it might actually be
released<00:01:57.420> whenever<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> PlayStation<00:01:58.439> Store

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
last Tuesday so they had to wait a full

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.760 
last Tuesday so they had to wait a full
week<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.390> release<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.259> with<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.740> that
