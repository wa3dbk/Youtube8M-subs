the<00:05:19.099> plug<00:05:19.399> in<00:05:19.639> there<00:05:19.819> constantly<00:05:20.329> so<00:05:21.109> that<00:05:21.289> the

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:21.499 
the plug in there constantly so that the

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.249 
the plug in there constantly so that the
skin<00:05:21.889> will<00:05:22.099> actually<00:05:22.939> start<00:05:23.209> building<00:05:23.749> up<00:05:23.959> and

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
skin will actually start building up and

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.739 
skin will actually start building up and
you<00:05:24.859> know<00:05:24.969> building<00:05:25.969> up<00:05:26.149> and<00:05:28.089> staying<00:05:29.089> at<00:05:29.359> an

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:29.749 
you know building up and staying at an

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:31.089 
you know building up and staying at an
inch<00:05:30.019> of<00:05:30.169> five<00:05:30.379> eighths<00:05:30.619> rather<00:05:30.919> than

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
inch of five eighths rather than

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:32.889 
inch of five eighths rather than
shrinking<00:05:31.759> up<00:05:31.849> the<00:05:31.939> night<00:05:32.089> time<00:05:32.299> and<00:05:32.569> then<00:05:32.719> me

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:32.899 
shrinking up the night time and then me

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:34.899 
shrinking up the night time and then me
trying<00:05:33.289> to<00:05:33.379> re-expand<00:05:33.979> it<00:05:34.159> when<00:05:34.579> I<00:05:34.639> put<00:05:34.879> my

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
i'm trying to keep it at an inch of five

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.979 
i'm trying to keep it at an inch of five
eighths<00:05:40.149> rather<00:05:41.149> than<00:05:41.269> having<00:05:41.479> to<00:05:41.629> go<00:05:41.809> through

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:41.989 
eighths rather than having to go through

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:43.539 
eighths rather than having to go through
this<00:05:42.019> shrinking<00:05:43.009> stretching<00:05:43.429> stretching

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:43.549 
this shrinking stretching stretching

00:05:43.549 --> 00:05:45.539 
this shrinking stretching stretching
stretching<00:05:43.759> process<00:05:44.209> over<00:05:44.749> and<00:05:44.839> over<00:05:44.959> again

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:45.549 
stretching process over and over again

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:47.499 
stretching process over and over again
so<00:05:46.549> that's<00:05:46.729> been<00:05:46.909> working<00:05:47.089> out<00:05:47.299> pretty

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
so that's been working out pretty

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.419 
so that's been working out pretty
decently<00:05:47.959> i'm<00:05:48.079> going<00:05:48.199> to<00:05:48.289> try<00:05:48.349> to<00:05:48.469> you<00:05:49.069> know<00:05:49.099> do
