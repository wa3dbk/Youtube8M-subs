at TV set be interesting to see when we

at TV set be interesting to see when we

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
get it through for a review and of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.250 
get it through for a review and of
course<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.690> SV<00:00:40.170> LED<00:00:40.800> TV<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.239> using<00:00:42.930> local

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
course with the SV LED TV is using local

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.410 
course with the SV LED TV is using local
dimming<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> LEDs<00:00:44.460> are<00:00:44.700> behind<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
dimming so the LEDs are behind the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.690 
dimming so the LEDs are behind the
screen<00:00:45.690> not<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> edges<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.920> Samsung's

of recent range and this little

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.290

demonstration<00:00:49.500> shows<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.250> how<00:00:50.820> those<00:00:51.030> work

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
demonstration shows you how those work

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.540 
demonstration shows you how those work
how<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.870> local<00:00:52.289> deming<00:00:52.559> works<00:00:52.739> see<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
how the local deming works see we have a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
how the local deming works see we have a
normal<00:00:53.730> image<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> flowers<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.530> as

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
normal image with the flowers on here as

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.340 
normal image with the flowers on here as
you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.010> nice<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> black<00:00:57.289> against<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
you can see nice and black against the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.500 
you can see nice and black against the
very<00:00:58.949> bright<00:00:59.340> image<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.940> if<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> move<00:01:00.300> across

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
very bright image and if you move across

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330 
very bright image and if you move across
what<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.350> here<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
what you can actually see here is that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.210 
what you can actually see here is that
the<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.420> actual<00:01:03.750> pattern<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:05.070> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the this is the actual pattern this is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 
the this is the actual pattern this is
just<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.549> backlight<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.900> showing<00:01:07.110> any

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
just the backlight it's not showing any

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.750 
just the backlight it's not showing any
of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> details<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.100> gives<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> an<00:01:08.430> idea<00:01:08.490> how

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
of the details but gives you an idea how

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.460 
of the details but gives you an idea how
the<00:01:08.909> local<00:01:09.270> dimming<00:01:09.420> works<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.439> course

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the local dimming works and of course

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.960 
the local dimming works and of course
one<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> issues<00:01:11.040> were<00:01:11.280> local<00:01:11.580> dimming<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
one of the issues were local dimming is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.359 
one of the issues were local dimming is
if<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.840> look<00:01:12.990> around<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.380> edges<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:14.159> get<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
if you look around the edges you get a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.920 
if you look around the edges you get a
halo<00:01:14.610> effect<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.780> light

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
halo effect and as you can see the light

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.899 
halo effect and as you can see the light
is<00:01:16.080> stepping<00:01:16.500> off<00:01:16.650> there<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> technology

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
is stepping off there but the technology

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.359 
is stepping off there but the technology
on<00:01:18.210> board<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.570> certainly<00:01:18.900> helping<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.950> combat

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
on board is certainly helping to combat

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.490 
on board is certainly helping to combat
that<00:01:20.400> issue<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.150> move<00:01:21.360> back<00:01:21.540> across<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that issue and we move back across you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.969 
that issue and we move back across you
can<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.860> these<00:01:23.610> lines<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.119> fairly

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
can see that these lines are fairly

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.770 
can see that these lines are fairly
fairly<00:01:25.979> straight<00:01:26.340> doesn't<00:01:27.240> seem<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.479> be<00:01:27.600> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
fairly straight doesn't seem to be that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
fairly straight doesn't seem to be that
