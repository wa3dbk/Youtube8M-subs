00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
odd-eyes is in there as well so he just

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.210

that's<00:01:42.869> kind<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> main<00:01:43.590> things

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
that's kind of one of the main things

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.249 
that's kind of one of the main things
too<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.259> keep

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and they talk about that I'm not sure

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
and they talk about that I'm not sure
what<00:01:53.729> episode<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.390> last<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.079> was

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
what episode was the last one it was

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.870 
what episode was the last one it was
something<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.740> or<00:01:56.189> not<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> last<00:01:56.729> one

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
something like that or not the last one

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.240 
something like that or not the last one
but<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.119> few<00:01:57.540> episodes<00:01:57.659> back<00:01:57.990> where<00:01:58.649> they<00:01:59.040> talk

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
but a few episodes back where they talk

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.980 
but a few episodes back where they talk
about<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.610> well<00:01:59.759> where<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.119> know<00:02:00.540> they

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
about this as well where you know they

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.030 
about this as well where you know they
actually<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.259> go<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> extract<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.890> then<00:02:01.979> you

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
actually just go to extract and then you

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.789 
actually just go to extract and then you
can<00:02:02.159> repin<00:02:02.430> lonesome<00:02:02.790> next<00:02:03.630> turn<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.469> they

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
can repin lonesome next turn so they

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.749 
can repin lonesome next turn so they
kind<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.009> how<00:02:05.130> about<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.430> bit<00:02:05.610> more<00:02:05.700> I

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
kind of how about this little bit more I

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.770 
kind of how about this little bit more I
guess<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.060> make<00:02:06.149> sure<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.540> everyone

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
guess to make sure that everyone

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.520 
guess to make sure that everyone
understands

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
understands

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.809 
understands

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
work which is which is good on that

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.219 
work which is which is good on that
that's<00:02:09.119> good<00:02:09.330> since<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.840> new<00:02:10.020> type<00:02:10.200> of

that's good since it's a new type of

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.300 
that's good since it's a new type of
summoning<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.740> stuff<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.130> will<00:02:11.220> help

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
summoning and stuff and that will help

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.510 
summoning and stuff and that will help
out<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> lot<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.940> people<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:13.130> yeah<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.459> just

out a lot of people and yeah so you just
use<00:02:14.760> build<00:02:15.030> up<00:02:15.150> monstrously<00:02:15.630> he's<00:02:15.959> able<00:02:16.080> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
use build up monstrously he's able to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.699 
use build up monstrously he's able to

get five basically the extranet two and
before<00:02:19.709> we<00:02:19.890> get<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.430> course<00:02:20.550> these

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
before we get to that of course these

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.010 
before we get to that of course these
clip<00:02:21.300> mates<00:02:21.480> they're<00:02:21.690> actually<00:02:21.930> pretty

clip mates they're actually pretty

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.330 
clip mates they're actually pretty
interesting<00:02:22.290> art<00:02:22.590> tap<00:02:22.770> it's<00:02:22.980> why<00:02:23.069> I've<00:02:23.190> talked

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
interesting art tap it's why I've talked

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.040 
interesting art tap it's why I've talked
about<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.520> little<00:02:23.640> bit<00:02:23.760> less<00:02:23.940> time<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.600> seems

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
about a little bit less time to it seems

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.820 
about a little bit less time to it seems
like<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.290> gonna<00:02:25.380> be<00:02:25.500> one<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.620> those<00:02:25.680> are

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
like it's gonna be one of those are

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.920 
like it's gonna be one of those are
attempts<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.760> we<00:02:26.970> probably<00:02:27.510> won't<00:02:27.720> ever

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
attempts to that we probably won't ever

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.120 
attempts to that we probably won't ever
see<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.350> don't<00:02:28.470> think<00:02:28.680> there's<00:02:28.800> been<00:02:28.860> anything

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
see I don't think there's been anything

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.380 
see I don't think there's been anything
announced<00:02:29.430> on<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.670> mesh<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.940> becoming<00:02:30.180> real

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
announced on the mesh to becoming real

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.699 
announced on the mesh to becoming real
cards<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.870> it's<00:02:31.230> probably<00:02:31.440> for<00:02:31.530> good<00:02:31.590> reason

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
cards and it's probably for good reason

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.590 
cards and it's probably for good reason
because<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.550> don't<00:02:32.760> know<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.330> would<00:02:33.420> have<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
because I don't know you would have to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.790 
because I don't know you would have to
completely<00:02:33.900> change<00:02:34.020> them<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.530> think<00:02:34.590> to

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
completely change them I think to

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.199 
completely change them I think to
actually<00:02:34.860> make<00:02:35.100> them<00:02:35.250> work<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.970> real<00:02:36.090> game

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
actually make them work in the real game

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.000 
actually make them work in the real game
to<00:02:36.390> that's<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.660> was<00:02:36.750> looking<00:02:36.989> through<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.890> know

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
to that's I was looking through you know

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.440 
to that's I was looking through you know
and<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.370> course<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.730> painted<00:02:39.000> child<00:02:39.180> different

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
and of course I painted child different

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.970 
and of course I painted child different
cards<00:02:39.630> used<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.200> they're<00:02:40.500> interesting<00:02:40.800> for

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
cards used and they're interesting for

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.199 
cards used and they're interesting for
the<00:02:41.070> anime<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.519> don't<00:02:41.820> see<00:02:41.940> if<00:02:42.030> they<00:02:42.120> could

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
the anime I don't see if they could

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
had any card or spell cards that it

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.540 
had any card or spell cards that it
would<00:04:52.710> have<00:04:52.770> mattered<00:04:52.830> but<00:04:53.100> i<00:04:53.160> believe<00:04:53.310> it's

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
would have mattered but i believe it's

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.490 
would have mattered but i believe it's
like<00:04:53.640> all<00:04:53.790> spells<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.120> traps<00:04:54.180> get<00:04:54.930> added<00:04:55.380> back

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
like all spells and traps get added back

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.110 
like all spells and traps get added back
to<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.710> hand<00:04:55.920> when<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.160> attacks<00:04:56.580> or<00:04:56.850> something

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
to the hand when it attacks or something

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.810 
to the hand when it attacks or something
like<00:04:57.240> that<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.860> so<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:58.920> course<00:04:59.070> with<00:04:59.370> that<00:04:59.580> it

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
like that and so of course with that it

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.860 
like that and so of course with that it
was<00:04:59.940> strong<00:05:00.120> enough<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.390> chose<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.690> stake

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
was strong enough to chose the stake

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.900 
was strong enough to chose the stake
center<00:05:00.990> tag<00:05:01.260> to<00:05:01.740> win<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:01.980> duel<00:05:02.130> pretty<00:05:02.760> simple

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
center tag to win the duel pretty simple

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.300 
center tag to win the duel pretty simple
on<00:05:03.180> that<00:05:03.330> but<00:05:04.050> yeah<00:05:04.200> everything<00:05:04.980> ends<00:05:05.280> a

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
on that but yeah everything ends a

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.770 
on that but yeah everything ends a
little<00:05:05.400> better<00:05:05.610> Michio<00:05:06.000> kind<00:05:06.330> of<00:05:06.420> stops

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
little better Michio kind of stops

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.690 
little better Michio kind of stops
acting<00:05:06.900> like<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.110> jerk<00:05:07.710> at<00:05:07.920> the<00:05:07.980> end<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.460> kind

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
acting like a jerk at the end of a kind

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.550 
acting like a jerk at the end of a kind
of<00:05:08.760> realizes<00:05:09.240> that<00:05:09.270> he<00:05:09.570> was<00:05:09.720> kind<00:05:09.930> of<00:05:09.990> being<00:05:10.470> a

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
of realizes that he was kind of being a

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.110 
of realizes that he was kind of being a
little<00:05:10.710> bit<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:10.860> jerk<00:05:11.040> on<00:05:11.100> that<00:05:11.280> and<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.730> guess

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
little bit of jerk on that and I guess

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.160 
little bit of jerk on that and I guess
we'll<00:05:12.240> be<00:05:12.330> in<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.450> tournament<00:05:12.810> so<00:05:12.900> I<00:05:12.930> hope<00:05:13.050> we

in Syria that's what I got from that and

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.860 
in Syria that's what I got from that and
also<00:05:50.100> usually<00:05:50.460> looks<00:05:50.940> like<00:05:51.060> she's<00:05:51.240> a<00:05:51.270> training

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
don't get it of course as many views as

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.800 
don't get it of course as many views as
some<00:06:41.000> of<00:06:41.060> the<00:06:41.120> other<00:06:41.240> stuff<00:06:41.300> I<00:06:41.510> do<00:06:41.630> on<00:06:41.720> this

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
some of the other stuff I do on this

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.470 
some of the other stuff I do on this
channel<00:06:41.870> but<00:06:42.560> i<00:06:43.010> still<00:06:43.700> hope<00:06:44.120> that<00:06:44.300> maybe

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
channel but i still hope that maybe

they'll<00:06:44.720> eventually<00:06:44.870> gained<00:06:45.320> a<00:06:45.350> little<00:06:45.590> bit

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
they'll eventually gained a little bit

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.800 
they'll eventually gained a little bit
and<00:06:45.980> I<00:06:46.730> thinks<00:06:47.030> because<00:06:47.150> not<00:06:47.510> many<00:06:47.570> people<00:06:47.780> are

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
and I thinks because not many people are

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.900 
and I thinks because not many people are
given<00:06:48.110> a<00:06:48.260> archive<00:06:48.830> a<00:06:48.860> chance<00:06:49.190> and<00:06:49.460> I<00:06:49.520> really<00:06:49.790> do

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
given a archive a chance and I really do

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.000 
given a archive a chance and I really do
say<00:06:50.120> go<00:06:50.360> ahead<00:06:50.480> check<00:06:50.810> it<00:06:51.140> out<00:06:51.380> I<00:06:51.620> think<00:06:51.860> it's<00:06:51.950> a

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
say go ahead check it out I think it's a

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.250 
say go ahead check it out I think it's a
lot<00:06:52.130> better<00:06:52.280> than<00:06:52.820> a<00:06:52.850> sale<00:06:53.360> or<00:06:53.480> zexal<00:06:53.900> again<00:06:54.140> I

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:54.260 
lot better than a sale or zexal again I

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.890 
lot better than a sale or zexal again I
just<00:06:54.290> say<00:06:54.530> both<00:06:54.710> sayings<00:06:55.070> on<00:06:55.190> that<00:06:55.340> and<00:06:55.900> yeah
