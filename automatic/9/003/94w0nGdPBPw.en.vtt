00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
just suddenly comes out of nowhere how

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.799 
just suddenly comes out of nowhere how
does<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.649> work<00:00:56.030> it's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.149> fusion<00:00:57.390> art<00:00:57.660> that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
does that work it's a fusion art that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.510 
does that work it's a fusion art that
usually<00:00:58.230> utilizes<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> contamination

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
usually utilizes the contamination

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.260 
usually utilizes the contamination
affect<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.840> contaminoid<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.609> contamination

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
affect the contaminoid the contamination

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.060 
affect the contaminoid the contamination
effect<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.840> an<00:01:03.989> effect<00:01:04.320> where<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.559> phonons

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
effect it's an effect where the phonons

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.800 
effect it's an effect where the phonons
and<00:01:05.339> elements<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.850> matter<00:01:06.060> separate<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
and elements of matter separate and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.789 
and elements of matter separate and
refuse<00:01:07.229> together

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
refuse together

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.830 
refuse together
I<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> fusion<00:01:09.119> property<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
I like the fusion property of the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.520 
I like the fusion property of the
materials<00:01:10.320> used<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.650> synthesis<00:01:11.720> yes<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:13.110> only

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
materials used in synthesis yes not only

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830 
materials used in synthesis yes not only
are<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.950> phonons<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.520> living<00:01:14.790> things<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.600> or

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
are the phonons of living things in or

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
are the phonons of living things in or
in<00:01:16.110> organic<00:01:17.009> materials<00:01:17.460> different<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
in organic materials different but so

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.609 
in organic materials different but so
are<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.570> elements<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.049> comprise<00:01:19.140> them

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
are the elements that comprise them

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.410 
are the elements that comprise them
utilizing<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.610> difference<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.090> temporarily

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
utilizing that difference I temporarily

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.660 
utilizing that difference I temporarily
fused<00:01:22.200> my<00:01:22.409> spear<00:01:22.710> into<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> outer<00:01:23.220> layer<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
fused my spear into the outer layer of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.880 
fused my spear into the outer layer of
my<00:01:23.820> right<00:01:24.030> arm<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.500> take<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.710> out

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
my right arm and then you take it out

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.819 
my right arm and then you take it out
when<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.070> need<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.369> huh<00:01:26.520> that's<00:01:26.759> convenient
