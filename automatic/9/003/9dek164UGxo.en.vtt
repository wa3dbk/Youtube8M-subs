hi this is just a short video about UV
protection<00:00:06.509> filters<00:00:08.540> now<00:00:09.540> one<00:00:09.719> type<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.080> can

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
protection filters now one type you can

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.419 
protection filters now one type you can
get<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.650> tiffin<00:00:11.610> UV<00:00:12.240> filters<00:00:12.980> which<00:00:13.980> normally

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
get is tiffin UV filters which normally

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.859 
get is tiffin UV filters which normally
cheaper<00:00:14.940> than<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> rest<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.199> ones<00:00:16.440> like

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
about 20 to 30 bands for one of these

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.760 
about 20 to 30 bands for one of these
and<00:00:29.810> for<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.869> basic<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.529> these<00:00:32.600> is<00:00:33.600> about<00:00:33.840> 8

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and for a basic one of these is about 8

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.380 
and for a basic one of these is about 8
to<00:00:35.130> 15<00:00:37.520> so<00:00:39.050> for<00:00:40.050> my<00:00:40.170> basic<00:00:40.760> kit<00:00:41.760> lens<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.210> got

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
to 15 so for my basic kit lens I got

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
to 15 so for my basic kit lens I got
when<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.540> first<00:00:42.780> bought<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.079> camera<00:00:46.579> because

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
when I first bought the camera because

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.630 
when I first bought the camera because
it's<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:48.620> very<00:00:49.620> expensive<00:00:49.950> lens<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:52.640> just

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
it's not very expensive lens I just

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.529 
it's not very expensive lens I just
bought<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.000> cheap<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.520> cheap<00:00:56.760> tiffen<00:00:57.180> filler

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
bought the cheap the cheap tiffen filler

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.830 
bought the cheap the cheap tiffen filler
for<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.079> one

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.820 

now<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> says<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.160> this<00:01:05.640> UV<00:01:06.120> protector<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:08.640> does

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
now it says on this UV protector it does

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.710 
now it says on this UV protector it does
take<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> bit<00:01:10.980> of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.690> ultraviolet<00:01:12.690> light

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
take a bit of the ultraviolet light

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.390 
take a bit of the ultraviolet light
before<00:01:14.090> also<00:01:15.090> helps<00:01:15.630> against<00:01:19.400> reflections

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
before also helps against reflections

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.740 
before also helps against reflections
and<00:01:20.610> stuff<00:01:21.980> but<00:01:22.980> most<00:01:23.160> people<00:01:23.610> will<00:01:24.510> just<00:01:24.660> use

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and stuff but most people will just use

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.570 
and stuff but most people will just use
it<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:26.700> protect<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.270> lens<00:01:28.340> there's<00:01:29.340> nothing

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
it to protect the lens there's nothing

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.950 
it to protect the lens there's nothing
worse<00:01:29.760> than<00:01:29.790> having<00:01:29.940> to<00:01:30.180> keep<00:01:30.360> cleaning<00:01:30.690> this

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
worse than having to keep cleaning this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.580 
worse than having to keep cleaning this
and<00:01:31.680> worrying<00:01:31.950> about<00:01:32.040> scratching<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:33.590> I'll

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and worrying about scratching it I'll

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.630 
and worrying about scratching it I'll
get<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.010> water<00:01:35.580> Lord<00:01:35.970> anything<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.369> buying

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
get in water Lord anything on so buying

get in water Lord anything on so buying
one<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.760> these<00:01:38.940> is<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.869> lot<00:01:40.080> cheaper<00:01:40.110> than

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
one of these is a lot cheaper than

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.170 
one of these is a lot cheaper than
buying<00:01:41.580> a<00:01:41.850> new<00:01:41.940> one<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.180> these<00:01:43.760> so<00:01:44.760> basically

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
that's the cheap version of that and

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.070 
that's the cheap version of that and
when<00:02:25.709> you've<00:02:25.800> got<00:02:25.950> them<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:28.410> can<00:02:28.560> use<00:02:28.770> your

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
when you've got them on you can use your

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.260 
when you've got them on you can use your
caps<00:02:31.080> as<00:02:31.290> well

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
caps as well

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.720 
caps as well
fits<00:02:33.270> perfectly<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.489> more<00:02:38.670> expensive

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
fits perfectly but on the more expensive

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.500 
fits perfectly but on the more expensive
lenses<00:02:40.190> what<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.520> my<00:02:42.950> Sigma<00:02:44.060> 10<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.180> 21

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
lenses what this is my Sigma 10 to 21

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.880 
lenses what this is my Sigma 10 to 21
millimeter<00:02:46.050> wide<00:02:46.290> angle<00:02:46.680> lens<00:02:48.410> so<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.440> helped

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
millimeter wide angle lens so I helped

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.890 
millimeter wide angle lens so I helped
it<00:02:49.980> for<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.910> more<00:02:51.090> expensive<00:02:51.360> filler<00:02:51.720> for

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
it for the more expensive filler for

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.830 
it for the more expensive filler for
this<00:02:51.989> one<00:02:53.030> it's<00:02:54.030> supposed<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.390> work<00:02:54.540> better

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
this one it's supposed to work better

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.979 
this one it's supposed to work better
than<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.110> cheaper<00:02:55.500> one<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:57.570> it's<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:57.840> the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
than the cheaper one so it's just the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:05.060 
than the cheaper one so it's just the
same<00:02:58.020> value<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.350> at<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.560> top<00:03:04.739> end<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
same value this is at the top end of the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.670 
same value this is at the top end of the
price<00:03:05.280> range<00:03:05.310> because<00:03:06.049> it's<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.170> very<00:03:07.380> large

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
price range because it's a very large

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.699 
price range because it's a very large
surface<00:03:08.160> area<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.700> think<00:03:09.480> this<00:03:09.600> was<00:03:09.810> 77

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
surface area I think this was 77

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.840 
surface area I think this was 77
millimeters<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.100> price<00:03:14.310> goes<00:03:14.519> up<00:03:14.670> with<00:03:14.820> a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
millimeters so the price goes up with a

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:28.820 
millimeters so the price goes up with a
size<00:03:15.090> obviously<00:03:19.100> silly<00:03:22.640> screws<00:03:23.640> on<00:03:23.790> there<00:03:27.830> it

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
size obviously silly screws on there it

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.970 
size obviously silly screws on there it
also<00:03:28.920> helps<00:03:29.670> if<00:03:29.820> you're<00:03:29.940> worrying<00:03:30.180> about

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
also helps if you're worrying about

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.210 
also helps if you're worrying about
dropping<00:03:31.980> your<00:03:32.100> lens<00:03:32.310> or<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:34.860> if<00:03:34.950> one<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.160> these

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
dropping your lens or so if one of these

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.170 
dropping your lens or so if one of these
gets<00:03:35.459> cracked

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
gets cracked

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.310 
gets cracked
I<00:03:36.239> think<00:03:37.140> this<00:03:37.260> lens<00:03:37.470> was<00:03:37.709> about<00:03:38.989> 350<00:03:39.989> o<00:03:42.320> more

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
I think this lens was about 350 o more

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.199 
I think this lens was about 350 o more
than<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.620> pound<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.950> I'd<00:03:47.070> much<00:03:47.250> rather

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
than that pound so I'd much rather

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.759 
than that pound so I'd much rather
out<00:03:48.420> 20<00:03:48.840> pounds<00:03:49.140> for<00:03:49.200> another<00:03:50.030> protector<00:03:51.769> then

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
out 20 pounds for another protector then

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.980 
out 20 pounds for another protector then
close<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.130> 400<00:03:53.489> quid<00:03:53.610> for<00:03:53.730> another<00:03:53.970> lens

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
close to 400 quid for another lens

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.030 
close to 400 quid for another lens
so<00:03:56.440> that's<00:03:56.590> your<00:03:56.710> basic<00:03:56.860> uses<00:03:57.460> of<00:03:58.020> UV

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
so that's your basic uses of UV

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.780 
so that's your basic uses of UV
