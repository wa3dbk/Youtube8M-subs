oxf<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.620> easier<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.120> XF<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> just

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
oxf so it's easier so the XF is just

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.569 
oxf so it's easier so the XF is just
circling<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> dance<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.370> waiting

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
circling and the dance is just waiting

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.150 
circling and the dance is just waiting
there<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.110> don't<00:00:40.379> know<00:00:40.440> who<00:00:40.620> could<00:00:40.920> when<00:00:41.129> I

there so I don't know who could when I

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.550 
there so I don't know who could when I
mean<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:41.579> both<00:00:41.730> look<00:00:41.910> very<00:00:42.200> powerful

and<00:00:49.550> it's<00:00:49.970> just<00:00:50.180> still<00:00:50.330> circling<00:00:50.810> so<00:00:51.110> we<00:00:51.260> don't

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
and it's just still circling so we don't

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.010 
and it's just still circling so we don't
know<00:00:51.530> who<00:00:51.740> could<00:00:52.070> win<00:00:52.400> oh<00:00:55.630> well<00:00:56.630> it<00:00:56.780> kind<00:00:56.990> of
