so this is where i'm going to start
reading<00:02:06.229> may<00:02:06.409> here<00:02:06.740> with<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:08.539> bobby<00:02:08.720> pins<00:02:09.080> see

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
reading may here with the bobby pins see

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.150 
reading may here with the bobby pins see
how<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:10.429> X<00:02:10.789> or<00:02:11.360> crosses<00:02:12.110> will<00:02:12.830> come<00:02:13.040> about

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
how the X or crosses will come about

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.390 
how the X or crosses will come about
again<00:02:14.170> securing<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.349> other<00:02:15.530> one<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:16.220> bring

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
again securing the other one you bring

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.960 
again securing the other one you bring
it<00:02:16.580> through<00:02:17.379> continuing<00:02:18.379> on<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:19.400> site<00:02:19.730> I

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
it through continuing on that site I

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.660 
it through continuing on that site I
will<00:02:20.239> be<00:02:20.390> stopping<00:02:20.799> roughly<00:02:21.799> at<00:02:21.950> about<00:02:21.980> behind

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
will be stopping roughly at about behind

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.839 
will be stopping roughly at about behind
the<00:02:22.849> ear<00:02:23.120> by<00:02:23.750> doing<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.709> just<00:02:25.310> have<00:02:25.610> that

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
the ear by doing so I just have that

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.140 
the ear by doing so I just have that
texture<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.720> hold<00:02:27.019> that<00:02:27.739> Mohawk<00:02:28.340> e<00:02:28.549> field<00:02:28.879> and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
texture to hold that Mohawk e field and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.210 
texture to hold that Mohawk e field and
I<00:02:29.450> can<00:02:29.599> let<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:29.780> curl<00:02:30.379> come<00:02:30.739> right<00:02:30.920> back<00:02:31.160> down

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
I can let that curl come right back down

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.839 
I can let that curl come right back down
so<00:02:32.030> it<00:02:32.150> will<00:02:32.299> just<00:02:32.330> kind<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:33.019> high<00:02:33.379> end<00:02:33.890> and

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
so it will just kind of high end and

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.850 
so it will just kind of high end and
mask<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.510> little<00:02:35.750> bit<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.019> bobby<00:02:36.200> pins<00:02:36.620> that

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
mask a little bit of the bobby pins that

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.369 
mask a little bit of the bobby pins that
I<00:02:36.920> put<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:38.030> again<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:38.720> you're<00:02:39.019> if<00:02:39.230> you're

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
I put in so again if you're if you're

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.530 
I put in so again if you're if you're
you<00:02:39.920> know<00:02:39.950> not<00:02:40.250> sure<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.879> if<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.269> want<00:02:41.480> to

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
you know not sure of it if you want to

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.289 
you know not sure of it if you want to
re-secure<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.140> with<00:02:42.440> one<00:02:42.680> bobby<00:02:42.920> pin<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:44.060> bring

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
re-secure it with one bobby pin to bring

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.259 
re-secure it with one bobby pin to bring
that<00:02:44.480> out<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:45.379> see<00:02:45.769> how<00:02:46.099> much<00:02:46.730> more<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.180> a

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
that out so you see how much more of a

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.440 
that out so you see how much more of a
fauxhawk<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.560> feel<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.160> way<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.879> like<00:02:50.420> a

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
fauxhawk to feel that way I like a

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.740 
fauxhawk to feel that way I like a
little<00:02:50.750> bit<00:02:50.930> how<00:02:51.700> see<00:02:52.700> how<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:52.910> curl<00:02:53.329> flows

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
little bit how see how the curl flows

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.039 
little bit how see how the curl flows
here<00:02:54.290> we've<00:02:54.560> got<00:02:54.590> a<00:02:54.799> nice<00:02:55.099> type<00:02:56.060> of<00:02:56.269> feel<00:02:56.569> wait
