00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:14.560
I decided to join Frontrunners to obtain experience 
 in management. Frontrunners help to inspire confidence

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:19.872
in myself so I can use the skill gained to 
 support and inspire the Deaf communities worldwide. 

00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:27.503
The aim of participating in Frontrunners is that I want 
 to learn how to gain confidence and leadership.

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:33.851
To learn to work with Deaf people from a variety of countries 
 and to develop work ethics for job opportunities in the future.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:40.133
The reason behind this is that in Belgium, it is difficult to find 
 a stable job and it's challenging to have a strong foundation

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.250
of the Deaf community to last for the future generations. I 
 want to enhance skills from Frontrunners such as having

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:51.533
confidence in myself, to obtain good work ethics for better 
 future career opportunities and most importantly to share

00:00:52.217 --> 00:00:55.217
my knowledge to strengthen the Deaf communities and its associations. 

00:00:58.297 --> 00:01:11.097
Frontrunners is an 'International Deaf Youth Leadership Training 
 Program' which is located in Castberggaard, Denmark.

00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:17.093
Who can participate in Frontrunners? The interested participants must 
 be in the age range of 18-30. 

00:01:17.588 --> 00:01:20.088
They come from all over the world and a maximum of 
 20 people is allowed for each yearly course. 

00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:30.018
The program in Frontrunners has three modules. The first module 
 is at Castberggaard for the duration of three months.

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:40.760
The Frontrunners are taught Deaf-related topics such as Leadership, Personal Development, Deafhood and also

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:50.170
Project Management in which we will put to the test for the 
 second module. We are given the opportunity to invent a 

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:58.070
project to accomplish in Module 2. It can be located in our 
 home country or in any developing countries. The aims of 

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:04.580
the project can be to support the Deaf communities, associations 
 and schools to develop and grow successfully. 

00:02:05.113 --> 00:02:13.110
When the project is finished in 3 months we all return to 
 Castberggaard. In Module 3, we focus on our projects and

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:18.480
analyze the progress. Altogether the Frontrunners course run 
 for a total of 9 months. 

00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:27.680
Now I will be interviewing two people. They are former Frontrunners. 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.230
The question I will ask them is what 
 have they achieved after studying in Frontrunners?

00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:44.980
Hi, I'm bengie. I was in the Frontrunners 3 team. Its been about 
 five years since I was involved with the Frontrunners program. 

00:02:46.176 --> 00:02:52.680
Nowadays I work for a variety of jobs such as 
 Deaf magazines and designing for several organizations. 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:58.230
I also currently work here at Castberggaard for a short 
 time. Looking back on my experience at Frontrunners,

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:04.430
it has been a great influence in my ability to have strong 
 teamwork skill, to contribute discussions, to take a look at 

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:10.320
myself and discover my identity. One big impact would 
 be personal development and having more confidence to

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.880
know that I can do anything and not to be limited 
 like I was before. Those times were good times. 

00:03:20.096 --> 00:03:29.100
Hello, my name is Davy and I was in the 
 Frontrunners 6 team. My experience upon completing Frontrunners

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:36.370
and returning to Italy, it was the power of knowledge from 
 Frontrunners that enabled me to support my country. 

00:03:37.221 --> 00:03:44.620
From the range of topics that they taught us, I was able to 
 share it with the Deaf community by hosting workshops  

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.720
for the Deaf youths about topics that was taught at Frontrunners. 

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:54.230
Being able to share the knowledge is significant with big 
 thanks to Frontrunners for the knowledge. Thank you. 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.500
We, the Frontrunner 8, aim to inspire the world!
