00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.800
 Hello, I'm going to prepare a pizza with a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.230
 base a base of puff pastry and goes to 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.579
 be a goat cheese pizza I'm going to 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.570
 explain what ingredients 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:30.210
 we need we are going to need a mass 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.110
 of puff pastry that comes precooked 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.470
 you can use if you want a pizza dough 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.780
 we will need a fried tomato cheese 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.500
 goat cheese mozzarella 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.019
 mushrooms a few strips of bacon and then 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 I'm going to spice it up with a little 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:53.280
 oregano and rosemary salt and garnish 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.199
 final with some stuffed olives we are going to 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.470
 start preparing the most the first thing that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.500
 I have done is to put the oven to 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.479
 preheat to 200 degrees the mass the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.280
 I just pulled out of the fridge is a 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.280
 bit hard but it is handled better 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.390
 we are going to puncture the surface well with 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.310
 whole of adding a few tablespoons of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.290
 tomato is compatible 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.329
 you do not need to put too much 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.229
 It also goes to everyone 's taste to me 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.520
 like to paint it but that the tomato 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.990
 just be a little bit now that we're going 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.850
 to spread a layer of mozzarella cheese 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.399
 also to taste of each one as it goes to 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.760
 not carry enough ingredients on top 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.190
 I'm going to exceed the cheese 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.120
 now some cheese slices are added 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.640
 from paula 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.040
 the amount you want the following is 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.920
 distribute the bacon strips that we have 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.370
 we cut them as we distribute 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.370
 like 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.240
 when we have the bacon, we are going to 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.370
 add some more rolled mushrooms 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.070
 it is worth fine sheets because if not 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.080
 they would make a lot of water and that's how we'll get 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.090
 that we will do once divided the 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.270
 mushrooms and seasoned with a 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.150
 little bit of oregano 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.190
 I'm also happy with each one and 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.450
 we finished with some rosemary leaves 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.050
 in the goat cheese 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.470
 also a tourist and now I'm going to 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.540
 introduce in the oven at 200 degrees that 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.480
 I'm already preheated and I'm going to cook it 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.150
 until you see that the puff pastry is 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.860
 it has begun to brown and that all the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.730
 surface of the pizza has been cooked 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.099
 as you can see I have it halfway up 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.340
 now I close after 25 minutes in 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.410
 the oven the pizza is already finished 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.210
 I'm going to place some black lolitas for 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.210
 decorate 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.060
 and you can serve it better to eat it 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.100
