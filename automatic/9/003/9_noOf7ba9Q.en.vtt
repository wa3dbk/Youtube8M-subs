hi<00:00:00.900> I'm<00:00:01.110> George<00:00:01.439> Bright<00:00:01.740> and<00:00:01.770> today<00:00:02.220> we're

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
hi I'm George Bright and today we're

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.949 
hi I'm George Bright and today we're
going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.669> take<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:02.939> first<00:00:03.179> steps<00:00:03.419> in<00:00:03.659> putting

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
going to take the first steps in putting

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:27.160 
going to take the first steps in putting
solar<00:00:04.200> panels<00:00:04.620> up<00:00:04.799> on<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.370> roof

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.420 

first<00:00:28.170> thing<00:00:28.350> we<00:00:28.470> want<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.070> figure<00:00:29.279> out

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
first thing we want to do is figure out

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.160 
first thing we want to do is figure out
how<00:00:29.940> many<00:00:30.000> panels<00:00:30.360> we<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.660> fit<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:30.930> the<00:00:31.020> roof

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
how many panels we can fit on the roof

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.650 
how many panels we can fit on the roof
and<00:00:31.349> where<00:00:31.920> they're<00:00:32.099> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> go<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:33.360> way<00:00:33.480> we

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
and where they're going to go the way we

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.200 
and where they're going to go the way we
do<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.230> by<00:00:34.650> making<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.130> sketch<00:00:35.489> taking<00:00:36.090> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
do that is by making a sketch taking it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.700 
do that is by making a sketch taking it
up<00:00:36.330> to<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> roof<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:37.020> tape<00:00:37.200> measure<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
up to the roof with the tape measure and

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.250 
up to the roof with the tape measure and
then<00:00:38.100> seeing<00:00:38.610> where<00:00:39.150> all<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.629> dimensions<00:00:40.080> are

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
then seeing where all the dimensions are

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.430 
then seeing where all the dimensions are
looking<00:00:40.770> from<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.460> ridge<00:00:42.150> line<00:00:42.449> to<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
looking from the ridge line to the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.130 
looking from the ridge line to the
gutters<00:00:43.890> or<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.760> eaves<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.870> want<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
gutters or the the eaves and we want to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.869 
gutters or the the eaves and we want to
measure<00:00:46.260> out<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.559> these<00:00:47.100> numbers<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.790> we

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
measure out all these numbers so that we

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.180 
measure out all these numbers so that we
can<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.540> how<00:00:49.050> many<00:00:49.350> panels<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.980> fit

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
can see just how many panels we can fit

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.070 
can see just how many panels we can fit
on<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.580> roof

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
on the roof

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.840 
on the roof
now<00:00:52.080> what<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> did<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.129> drew<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
now what I did here is I drew up a

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
now what I did here is I drew up a
sketch<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.390> my<00:00:54.690> computer<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.470> can<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
sketch on my computer but you can do it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
sketch on my computer but you can do it
by<00:00:56.220> hand<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.790> doesn't<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.269> be<00:00:57.390> that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
by hand it doesn't have to be that

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.700 
by hand it doesn't have to be that
accurate<00:00:57.900> you<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.110> need<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> place<00:00:58.409> to<00:00:58.440> write

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
accurate you just need a place to write

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.530 
accurate you just need a place to write
down<00:00:58.860> your<00:00:59.010> numbers<00:00:59.400> but<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.330> helpful

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
down your numbers but a really helpful

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.590 
down your numbers but a really helpful

and then measure out from there when

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.810 
and then measure out from there when
you're<00:01:49.649> surveying<00:01:50.039> your<00:01:50.159> roof<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
you're surveying your roof one of the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.370 
you're surveying your roof one of the
things<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.119> want<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.359> keep<00:01:51.479> an<00:01:51.630> eye<00:01:51.749> on<00:01:51.929> is<00:01:52.109> any

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
things you want to keep an eye on is any

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.830 
things you want to keep an eye on is any
potential<00:01:52.979> obstructions<00:01:53.789> both<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.659> this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
potential obstructions both like this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.749 
potential obstructions both like this
heating<00:01:55.259> vent<00:01:55.469> here<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.009> like<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
heating vent here and like that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.849 
heating vent here and like that
satellite<00:01:57.390> dish<00:01:57.420> satellite<00:01:58.229> dish<00:01:58.710> is

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
satellite dish satellite dish is

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.410 
satellite dish satellite dish is
actually<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.189> bigger<00:01:59.429> problem<00:01:59.729> because<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.270> can

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
actually a bigger problem because it can

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.330 
actually a bigger problem because it can
cast<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.840> shadow<00:02:00.869> across<00:02:01.530> your<00:02:01.799> panels<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
cast a shadow across your panels and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.359 
cast a shadow across your panels and
that's<00:02:02.789> not<00:02:02.999> good<00:02:03.829> number<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.920> cities<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:05.340> in

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
that's not good number of cities here in

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.190 
that's not good number of cities here in

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
panels on the roof you want to think

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.550 
panels on the roof you want to think
about<00:02:27.000> whether<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.270> want<00:02:27.300> them<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.690> run<00:02:27.870> along

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
about whether you want them to run along

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.860 
about whether you want them to run along
the<00:02:28.800> e<00:02:28.830> basically<00:02:29.550> east-west<00:02:30.120> where<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the e basically east-west where the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.460 
the e basically east-west where the
weather<00:02:31.049> want<00:02:31.290> them<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.590> run<00:02:31.799> north

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
weather want them to run north

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.590 
weather want them to run north
south<00:02:32.650> from<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.280> ridge<00:02:33.580> line<00:02:33.850> down<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
south from the ridge line down to the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.870 
south from the ridge line down to the
eave<00:02:34.900> now<00:02:35.770> this<00:02:36.010> makes<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.310> difference<00:02:36.340> because

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
eave now this makes a difference because

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.080 
eave now this makes a difference because
usually<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:38.170> rafters<00:02:38.770> run<00:02:39.100> north-south<00:02:39.670> I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
usually the rafters run north-south I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.660 
usually the rafters run north-south I
run<00:02:40.240> from<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.690> ridge<00:02:40.840> line<00:02:41.080> down<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:42.220> eave

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
run from the ridge line down to the eave

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.670 
run from the ridge line down to the eave
and<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.480> means<00:02:43.690> you<00:02:43.810> want<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.170> rails<00:02:44.440> that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
and that means you want the rails that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.170 
and that means you want the rails that
you<00:02:44.770> mount<00:02:44.890> your<00:02:44.980> solar<00:02:45.250> panels<00:02:45.640> on<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:46.000> run

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
you mount your solar panels on to run

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.210 
you mount your solar panels on to run
perpendicular<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.500> helps<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.010> spread

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
perpendicular to that helps you spread

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.820 
perpendicular to that helps you spread
the<00:02:48.460> load<00:02:48.640> out<00:02:48.670> across<00:02:49.270> multiple<00:02:49.750> rafters

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.380 

well<00:02:53.830> now<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.550> we're<00:02:54.670> down<00:02:54.790> off<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.240> roof

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
well now that we're down off the roof

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.270 
well now that we're down off the roof
let's<00:02:55.750> go<00:02:55.960> inside<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.530> figure<00:02:56.680> out<00:02:56.740> just<00:02:56.830> how

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
let's go inside and figure out just how

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.070 
let's go inside and figure out just how
many<00:02:57.340> panels<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.180> put<00:02:58.330> up<00:02:58.360> there<00:03:04.050> well<00:03:05.050> I

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
many panels we can put up there well I

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.390 
many panels we can put up there well I
hope<00:03:05.320> you're<00:03:05.500> good<00:03:05.620> at<00:03:05.709> Tetris<00:03:06.130> because

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
hope you're good at Tetris because

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.760 
hope you're good at Tetris because
that's<00:03:06.610> our<00:03:06.730> next<00:03:06.970> step<00:03:07.330> we're<00:03:07.959> going<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.440> take

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
that's our next step we're going to take

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.170 
that's our next step we're going to take
all<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.130> measurements<00:03:09.550> we<00:03:09.640> had<00:03:09.820> on<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.060> roof

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
all the measurements we had on the roof

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.300 
all the measurements we had on the roof
turn<00:03:10.720> them<00:03:10.900> into<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.170> high<00:03:11.530> quality<00:03:11.800> drawing

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
turn them into a high quality drawing

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.460 
turn them into a high quality drawing
and<00:03:12.610> then<00:03:12.880> we're<00:03:13.209> going<00:03:13.390> to<00:03:13.480> move<00:03:13.990> around

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
and then we're going to move around

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.770 
and then we're going to move around
these<00:03:14.830> solar<00:03:15.100> panels<00:03:15.190> until<00:03:16.090> we<00:03:16.209> can<00:03:16.390> fit<00:03:16.600> as

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
these solar panels until we can fit as

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.690 
these solar panels until we can fit as
many<00:03:16.990> as<00:03:17.230> possible<00:03:17.320> into<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.040> most<00:03:18.310> ideal

many as possible into the most ideal
locations<00:03:19.330> on<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.600> roof<00:03:19.780> now<00:03:20.050> we're<00:03:20.680> going<00:03:20.830> to

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
locations on the roof now we're going to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.830 
locations on the roof now we're going to
make<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.040> scale<00:03:21.430> drawing<00:03:21.670> of<00:03:22.060> our<00:03:22.209> roof<00:03:22.540> and

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
together a parts list but we're gonna

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:40.670 
together a parts list but we're gonna
