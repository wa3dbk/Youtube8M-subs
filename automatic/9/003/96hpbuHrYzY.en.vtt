00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
review it really fast for me so I put my

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.620 
review it really fast for me so I put my
channel<00:01:02.969> back<00:01:03.270> slow<00:01:03.629> motion<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.710> slow

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
channel back slow motion is just slow

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.039 
channel back slow motion is just slow
motion<00:01:07.070> this<00:01:08.070> figure<00:01:08.580> has<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.479> many<00:01:09.630> points<00:01:09.900> of

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
motion this figure has so many points of

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.840 
motion this figure has so many points of
articulation<00:01:10.369> let's<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.520> look<00:01:11.610> at<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
articulation let's just look at the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.600 
articulation let's just look at the
figure<00:01:12.119> first<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.500> head<00:01:13.710> rotates<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
figure first of all the head rotates the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.749 
figure first of all the head rotates the
head<00:01:15.150> actually<00:01:15.390> pops<00:01:15.689> off<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.759> just

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
head actually pops off so that's just

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.490 
head actually pops off so that's just
the<00:01:17.850> Bucky<00:01:18.119> catmull<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:19.110> everything
