by taking the sculpting class last week

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.430 
by taking the sculpting class last week
because<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:13.480> saves<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.770> much<00:02:15.010> on<00:02:15.280> clay<00:02:15.700> and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
because it saves you so much on clay and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.870 
because it saves you so much on clay and
I<00:02:17.440> kind<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:17.980> knew<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.190> little<00:02:18.490> bit<00:02:18.640> about

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
I kind of knew a little bit about

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.690 
I kind of knew a little bit about
balking<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.480> out<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:20.350> not<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.010> extent<00:02:21.250> as

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
balking it out but not to the extent as

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.130 
balking it out but not to the extent as
you<00:02:21.880> can<00:02:22.030> see<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.420> almost<00:02:22.599> looks<00:02:22.959> like<00:02:23.050> it's

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140
