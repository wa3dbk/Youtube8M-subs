00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.330
 a new video of me in this 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.670
 video there is now a review on a 7 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.670
 port usb 3.0 hub a lot of fun 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.860
 These have come from the home hutu and 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.330
 is a seven port usb 3.0 has that 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.250
 is it just shoots that have 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.680
 about the connecting cable which of course 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.350
 also to the pc 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.270
 best, of course, to a 3.0 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.160
 USB connection then is also the 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.840
 speed accordingly 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.280
 Of course, the speed of 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.160
 usb 3.0 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.260
 so you have then from a usb 3 there 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.670
 seven connections made on the 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.870
 back we have the two 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.390
 Connections one for the 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.399
 Connection cable for the pc company 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.489
 then we have the connection for 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.540
 the power supply is enclosed 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.420
 Connecting cable has a length of about 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.920
 a meter and now that's all 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.290
 yes, just to the laptop 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.149
 I have already connected 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.860
 not now that included nester 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.910
 that's what you usually need 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.860
 Not 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.660
 you just need the net now 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.190
 devices with a higher voltage so 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.840
 which require a higher voltage 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.210
 then you also need that 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.130
 power supply because it stops by then synonymous 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.470
 a higher voltage finally has 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.179
 now just the usb stick here 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.399
 the number 3 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.319
 then you can already see the lights 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.119
 lammchen here the whole goes of course 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.069
 even if I am with the others 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.869
 connect ports 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.849
 Now I just have my iphone 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.130
 connected and can then here 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.810
 also normal charge the ipad 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.759
 However, I noticed that can 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.840
 me at this place so in this hub 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.910
 do not charge 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.679
 I would have been very sad too 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.539
 if i now this the net then 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.810
 I can also put the ipad now 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:53.780
 not at the main recordings of the usb hub 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.789
 is made of high quality plastic and it 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.099
 really very well processed too 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.420
 I like the design of the hubs 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.520
 example also with the lamps and 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.649
 light up if we stick us or usb now 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.060
 other devices here one stretches that 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.300
 I really like it a lot 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.560
 the other one has no driver 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.209
 install for the habs or you can 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.700
 yes just after the pc or 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.590
 mac and then can be used immediately 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.380
 become the speed that is 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.150
 Of course the most important thing about usb 3 and 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.489
 Although I have the whole time on my pc 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.830
 amanda tested mc I have no 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.630
 usb 3 points 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.460
 That's why I have the whole thing 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.340
 once tested in the pc and although I have 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.990
 there of course a usb3 ports and 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.570
 I then connected it and 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.510
 then have files on the hard disk 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.010
 copied and time is just that 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.200
 same as when I use the hard drive 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.120
 connect directly to my pc so 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.160
 do not pass through the port then let 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.140
 the time is still the same and 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.270
 so you can just the port 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.220
 connect your pc and would not have 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.500
 fear that the performance then 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.960
 suffering in my video I have 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.850
 yes, the hub with seven USB connections 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.830
 shown if you but the small 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.460
 Variant of it would like to have four 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.140
 connections 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.750
 then have a look on the channel of 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.790
 jd over he also has in the video 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.500
 made a very nice video look 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.540
 every time here if it is on the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.140
 found neither of finch then we come to 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.180
 Video 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.920
 and then you can do this too 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.350
 video times look that's just the the 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.990
 smaller variant of it in the upper right in 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.060
 the corner fini the video of ayew 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.040
 germany looks at you necessarily 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.930
 make even he has to a video 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.370
 just click on send and made 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.130
 then you come to the video 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.190
 otherwise with the number at bauer the 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.640
 provided with this us bgh
