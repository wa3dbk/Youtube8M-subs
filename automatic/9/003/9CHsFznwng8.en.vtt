the<00:01:35.579> peritoneum<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> lining

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
the peritoneum is the lining

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.740 
the peritoneum is the lining
if<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.470> peritoneum<00:01:40.920> gets<00:01:41.340> dried<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
if the peritoneum gets dried up the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.810 
if the peritoneum gets dried up the
whole<00:01:42.960> body<00:01:43.229> gets<00:01:43.380> tied<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:43.829> could<00:01:44.790> be

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
whole body gets tied up could be

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.179 
whole body gets tied up could be
anywhere<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.869> lung<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.890> dried<00:01:47.159> up

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
anywhere in the lung if it is dried up

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.870 
anywhere in the lung if it is dried up
it<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.329> cause<00:01:48.600> your<00:01:48.780> lung<00:01:48.960> cancer<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.880> even

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
it can cause your lung cancer is even

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.399 
it can cause your lung cancer is even
poor<00:01:51.090> peritoneum<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.460> cancer<00:01:53.880> state

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
poor peritoneum can be in a cancer state

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.990 
poor peritoneum can be in a cancer state
so<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.560> has<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.890> be<00:01:55.979> very<00:01:56.009> careful<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.939> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
so one has to be very careful not to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.020 
so one has to be very careful not to
take<00:01:57.420> something<00:01:57.869> very<00:01:58.200> dry<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.460> time<00:01:59.700> dry

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
anything to make this lubricant some

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.930 
anything to make this lubricant some
sort<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.319> lubricant<00:02:10.890> should<00:02:11.069> be<00:02:11.160> there<00:02:11.370> so

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
sort of lubricant should be there so

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.190 
sort of lubricant should be there so
there's<00:02:12.150> no<00:02:12.330> problem

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
there's no problem

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.309 
there's no problem
on<00:02:13.290> this<00:02:13.740> chakra<00:02:14.300> because<00:02:15.300> first<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.900> all<00:02:16.080> it

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
on this chakra because first of all it

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.490 
on this chakra because first of all it
loses<00:02:16.920> your<00:02:17.099> discretion<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.959> don't<00:02:18.959> understand

things<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.489> don't<00:02:20.640> know<00:02:20.819> what<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.209> you

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
things you don't know what to do you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.690 
things you don't know what to do you
mean<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.440> mean<00:02:22.650> good<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.310> don't<00:02:23.520> do

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
mean it you mean good but you don't do

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.100 
mean it you mean good but you don't do
when<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.060> achieve<00:02:24.180> something<00:02:24.599> it's

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
when you achieve something it's

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.100 
when you achieve something it's
something<00:02:26.390> not<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.630> good

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
something not so good

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.260 
something not so good
the<00:02:28.620> reason<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.069> your<00:02:29.220> discretion<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.970> poor

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
the reason is your discretion is poor

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:39.400 
the reason is your discretion is poor
for<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.410> must<00:02:31.680> not<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:32.209> made<00:02:33.209> right<00:02:33.840> I
