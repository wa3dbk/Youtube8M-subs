in<00:02:44.950> some<00:02:45.130> areas<00:02:45.430> picked<00:02:45.640> up<00:02:45.730> six<00:02:46.090> inches<00:02:46.299> the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
in some areas picked up six inches the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.509 
in some areas picked up six inches the
northern<00:02:47.110> Keys<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:48.099> could<00:02:48.220> see<00:02:48.310> some<00:02:48.430> of

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
northern Keys you could see some of

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.009 
northern Keys you could see some of
those<00:02:48.579> bands<00:02:48.849> actually<00:02:49.209> just<00:02:49.360> south<00:02:49.599> of<00:02:49.720> Miami

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
those bands actually just south of Miami

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.259 
those bands actually just south of Miami
now<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:50.980> we<00:02:51.129> will<00:02:51.340> see<00:02:51.610> still<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:52.000> spread<00:02:52.239> of

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
now so we will see still the spread of

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.420 
now so we will see still the spread of
maybe<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.660> half<00:02:52.870> inch<00:02:53.049> to<00:02:53.349> a<00:02:53.799> couple<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.220> inches

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
maybe a half inch to a couple of inches

of rain a some localized areas and the

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.020 
of rain a some localized areas and the
winds<00:02:56.440> should<00:02:56.680> start<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.069> decrease<00:02:57.340> here

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
winds should start to decrease here

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.420 
winds should start to decrease here
later<00:02:58.269> on<00:02:58.329> today<00:02:58.750> now<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.500> course<00:02:59.709> the<00:03:00.250> big

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
Gulf and it's going to intensify it will

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.300 
Gulf and it's going to intensify it will
continue<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.870> intensify<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.920> know<00:03:05.980> Guzman

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
continue to intensify you know Guzman

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.640 
continue to intensify you know Guzman
fluctuations<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.150> course<00:03:07.420> but<00:03:08.170> as<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.470> heads

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
fluctuations of course but as it heads

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.920 
fluctuations of course but as it heads
towards<00:03:08.980> Texas<00:03:09.280> we<00:03:10.060> may<00:03:10.209> be<00:03:10.269> dealing<00:03:10.540> with<00:03:10.690> a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
towards Texas we may be dealing with a

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.539
