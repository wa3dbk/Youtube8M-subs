help much if at all there are a number
of<00:01:00.720> possible<00:01:01.229> reasons<00:01:01.409> for<00:01:01.860> this<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:03.000> very

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
of possible reasons for this but very

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.420 
of possible reasons for this but very
likely<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.080> cause<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> few<00:01:05.100> very

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
likely the cause is one of a few very

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.429 
likely the cause is one of a few very
common<00:01:06.000> mistakes<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.750> first-time

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
common mistakes that first-time

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.130 
common mistakes that first-time
marathoners<00:01:08.160> make<00:01:08.370> with<00:01:08.700> their<00:01:08.940> form<00:01:09.330> so

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
marathoners make with their form so

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.050 
marathoners make with their form so
let's<00:01:10.470> take<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> look<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.130> Julia<00:01:11.460> demonstrates

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
let's take a look as Julia demonstrates

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.420 
let's take a look as Julia demonstrates
these<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
these and

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.180 
these and
the<00:01:13.610> correct<00:01:13.910> way<00:01:14.000> of<00:01:14.120> running<00:01:14.770> all<00:01:15.770> right<00:01:16.040> the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
the correct way of running all right the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.800 
the correct way of running all right the
first<00:01:16.400> really<00:01:16.760> common<00:01:17.120> running<00:01:17.390> form<00:01:17.660> mistake

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
first really common running form mistake

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.260 
first really common running form mistake
is<00:01:18.170> running<00:01:18.440> upright<00:01:18.710> there's<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.790> difference

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
is running upright there's a difference

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.990 
is running upright there's a difference
between<00:01:20.390> slouching<00:01:21.230> and<00:01:21.260> leaning<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.340> so

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
between slouching and leaning and so

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.450 
between slouching and leaning and so
we're<00:01:23.690> not<00:01:23.870> saying<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:24.410> should<00:01:24.620> slouch<00:01:25.040> but

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
we're not saying you should slouch but

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.650 
we're not saying you should slouch but
when<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:25.730> run<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.180> have<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.480> lean<00:01:26.630> forward

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
when you run you have to lean forward

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.320 
when you run you have to lean forward
from<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.380> ankles<00:01:27.830> and<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.760> amount<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.210> you

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
from the ankles and the amount that you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.440 
from the ankles and the amount that you
lean<00:01:29.540> depends<00:01:29.930> on<00:01:30.050> your<00:01:30.200> speed<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:31.820> see

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
lean depends on your speed so you see

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.170 
lean depends on your speed so you see
Julia<00:01:32.900> running<00:01:33.680> upright<00:01:34.160> now

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
Julia running upright now

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.870 
Julia running upright now
now<00:01:36.140> let's<00:01:36.440> take<00:01:36.650> a<00:01:36.710> look<00:01:36.980> at<00:01:37.160> her<00:01:37.370> leaning

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
now let's take a look at her leaning

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.580 
now let's take a look at her leaning
forward<00:01:38.420> from<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.720> ankles

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.770 

the<00:01:44.590> second<00:01:45.070> common<00:01:45.610> running<00:01:46.210> form<00:01:46.570> mistake

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
the second common running form mistake

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.930 
the second common running form mistake
is<00:01:47.350> over<00:01:47.740> striding<00:01:48.280> you<00:01:48.550> may<00:01:48.670> have<00:01:48.790> heard

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
is over striding you may have heard

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.710 
is over striding you may have heard
about<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:49.300> one

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
about this one

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.300 
about this one
that<00:01:50.110> means<00:01:50.350> landing<00:01:50.770> with<00:01:50.860> your<00:01:50.890> foot<00:01:51.190> in

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
that means landing with your foot in

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.620 
that means landing with your foot in
front<00:01:51.490> of<00:01:51.580> your<00:01:51.700> hip<00:01:51.910> joint<00:01:52.150> rather<00:01:52.360> than

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
front of your hip joint rather than

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.040 
front of your hip joint rather than
underneath<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:54.090> let's<00:01:55.090> take<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.360> look<00:01:55.600> at<00:01:55.750> Julia

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
underneath it let's take a look at Julia

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:03.010 
underneath it let's take a look at Julia
over<00:01:56.320> striding

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.560 

and<00:02:03.109> now<00:02:04.100> let's<00:02:04.369> take<00:02:04.579> a<00:02:04.640> look<00:02:04.880> at<00:02:05.030> her<00:02:05.149> landing

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
and now let's take a look at her landing

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.820 
and now let's take a look at her landing

the third common running for mistake is

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.510 
the third common running for mistake is
heel<00:02:13.690> striking<00:02:14.170> which<00:02:14.740> means<00:02:15.010> landing<00:02:15.400> on

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
heel striking which means landing on

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.860 
heel striking which means landing on

the fourth common running form mistake

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.500 
the fourth common running form mistake
is<00:02:48.160> pulling<00:02:48.490> your<00:02:48.610> shoulders<00:02:49.030> back<00:02:49.240> and

is pulling your shoulders back and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.690 
is pulling your shoulders back and
swinging<00:02:49.780> your<00:02:50.020> arms<00:02:50.320> forward<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.250> backwards

that is front to back reading depends on

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.370 
that is front to back reading depends on
account<00:02:55.210> of<00:02:55.270> rotation<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.020> upper<00:02:56.260> and

account of rotation of the upper and

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.260 
account of rotation of the upper and
lower<00:02:56.440> body<00:02:56.800> which<00:02:57.160> generates<00:02:57.610> power<00:02:57.910> for

this<00:03:01.090> counter<00:03:01.480> rotation<00:03:01.810> makes<00:03:02.170> your<00:03:02.350> arm

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
this counter rotation makes your arm

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.400 
this counter rotation makes your arm
swing<00:03:02.740> on<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.070> diagonal<00:03:03.460> pathway<00:03:04.120> not<00:03:04.480> front<00:03:05.170> to

course<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.550> like<00:03:29.700> action<00:03:30.240> you'll<00:03:30.480> restrict

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
course it like action you'll restrict

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.930 
course it like action you'll restrict
