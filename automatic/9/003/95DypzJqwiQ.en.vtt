something<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:14.130> not<00:03:14.310> going<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.580> be<00:03:14.670> even

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
something it's not going to be even

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.449 
something it's not going to be even
touching<00:03:15.870> your<00:03:16.020> screen<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:16.980> that's<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> case

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
touching your screen so that's the case

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.460 
touching your screen so that's the case
with<00:03:17.670> this<00:03:17.820> also<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.600> can<00:03:18.630> use<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.110> slimmer

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
with this also you can use the slimmer

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.920 
with this also you can use the slimmer
case<00:03:19.800> inside<00:03:20.280> so<00:03:20.610> that's<00:03:20.730> kind<00:03:21.030> of<00:03:21.090> nice<00:03:21.270> but

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
case inside so that's kind of nice but

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.240 
case inside so that's kind of nice but
so<00:03:22.170> if<00:03:22.260> you're<00:03:22.320> going<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.590> be<00:03:22.680> removing<00:03:23.130> your

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
so if you're going to be removing your

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.010 
so if you're going to be removing your
case<00:03:23.459> often<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.120> you're<00:03:24.209> looking<00:03:24.780> at<00:03:24.900> these

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
case often and you're looking at these

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.780 
case often and you're looking at these
two<00:03:25.200> different<00:03:25.440> cases<00:03:25.590> go<00:03:26.220> with<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> system

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
two different cases go with the system

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.120 
two different cases go with the system
wise<00:03:26.970> it's<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.420> same<00:03:27.660> price<00:03:27.959> it's<00:03:28.380> a<00:03:28.530> great

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
wise it's the same price it's a great

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.130 
wise it's the same price it's a great
case<00:03:29.400> they're<00:03:29.730> about<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.150> exact<00:03:30.450> same<00:03:30.750> as<00:03:30.930> far

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
case they're about the exact same as far

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.500 
case they're about the exact same as far
as<00:03:31.260> weight<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.739> bulk<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.370> very<00:03:33.030> similar

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
as weight and bulk just very similar

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.810 
as weight and bulk just very similar
type<00:03:33.780> cases<00:03:34.080> next<00:03:35.010> up<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.489> griffin

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
type cases next up this is the griffin

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.720 
type cases next up this is the griffin
survivor<00:03:36.000> it's<00:03:36.590> 49.95<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:37.980> same<00:03:38.190> price<00:03:38.400> these

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
survivor it's 49.95 so same price these

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.960 
survivor it's 49.95 so same price these
previous<00:03:39.239> two<00:03:39.510> it's<00:03:40.440> dust<00:03:40.980> proof<00:03:41.310> its<00:03:41.610> splash

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
previous two it's dust proof its splash

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.509 
previous two it's dust proof its splash
resistant<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:42.870> no<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.140> is<00:03:43.260> not<00:03:43.440> waterproof<00:03:43.920> but

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
resistant so no it is not waterproof but

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.810 
resistant so no it is not waterproof but
it<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.739> splash<00:03:46.739> resistant<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.519> know<00:03:47.700> if

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
it is splash resistant so you know if

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.759 
it is splash resistant so you know if
you're<00:03:47.970> on<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.239> rain<00:03:48.450> or<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:48.870> any<00:03:48.989> everyday

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
you're on the rain or for any everyday

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.199 
you're on the rain or for any everyday
work<00:03:50.040> up<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.489> then<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.760> know<00:03:50.880> if<00:03:51.030> you're

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
work up and then you know if you're

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.720 
work up and then you know if you're
swimming<00:03:52.200> or<00:03:52.440> whatnot<00:03:52.680> you're<00:03:53.459> going<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.670> be

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
swimming or whatnot you're going to be

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.020 
swimming or whatnot you're going to be
totally<00:03:53.910> fine<00:03:54.209> with<00:03:54.390> this<00:03:54.540> case<00:03:55.670> very<00:03:56.670> very

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
totally fine with this case very very

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.940 
totally fine with this case very very
protective<00:03:57.570> like<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.050> has<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.380> tab<00:03:58.620> so

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
protective like that it has the tab so

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.560 
protective like that it has the tab so
it<00:03:59.040> can<00:03:59.190> still<00:03:59.430> have<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.700> splash<00:03:59.970> resistant

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
it can still have the splash resistant

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.530 
it can still have the splash resistant
and<00:04:00.750> whatnot<00:04:01.470> but<00:04:01.500> still<00:04:01.890> have<00:04:02.010> easy<00:04:02.190> access

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
and whatnot but still have easy access

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.790 
and whatnot but still have easy access
obviously<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.690> not<00:04:03.810> splash<00:04:04.170> resistant<00:04:04.709> when

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
obviously it's not splash resistant when

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.800 
obviously it's not splash resistant when
the<00:04:04.890> tabs<00:04:05.100> are<00:04:05.280> opened<00:04:05.580> up<00:04:05.730> but<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:06.600> do<00:04:06.720> have

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
the tabs are opened up but you do have

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.259 
the tabs are opened up but you do have
quick<00:04:07.080> access<00:04:07.400> pretty<00:04:08.400> good<00:04:08.580> spilt<00:04:08.880> in<00:04:09.030> screen

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
quick access pretty good spilt in screen

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.180 
quick access pretty good spilt in screen
protector<00:04:09.720> but<00:04:09.870> again<00:04:10.110> you're<00:04:10.500> going<00:04:11.070> to<00:04:11.130> be

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
protector but again you're going to be

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.310 
protector but again you're going to be
losing<00:04:11.489> just<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:12.000> tad<00:04:12.239> bit<00:04:12.269> of<00:04:12.600> functionality

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
losing just a tad bit of functionality

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.680 
losing just a tad bit of functionality
with<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.739> but<00:04:13.980> it's<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.790> good<00:04:14.910> case<00:04:15.209> that's

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
with that but it's a good case that's

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.229 
with that but it's a good case that's
49.95

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
49.95
