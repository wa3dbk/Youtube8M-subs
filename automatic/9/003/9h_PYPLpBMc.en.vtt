was<00:02:13.379> going<00:02:13.590> back<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.190> sides<00:02:14.910> because

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
was going back on the sides because

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.240 
was going back on the sides because
since<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:15.900> gets<00:02:16.200> stretched<00:02:16.530> out<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.129> gets

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
since this gets stretched out it gets

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.270 
since this gets stretched out it gets
the<00:02:17.489> most<00:02:17.640> damage<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.590> went<00:02:19.590> back<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.129> with

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
the most damage I went back in with

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.000 
the most damage I went back in with
water<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.910> bingo<00:02:21.480> coiled<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.620> didn't

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
water and bingo coiled it and I didn't

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.910 
water and bingo coiled it and I didn't
add<00:02:23.160> any<00:02:23.550> product<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.420> because<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.410> made<00:02:25.680> sure<00:02:25.709> I

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
add any product so because I made sure I

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.430 
add any product so because I made sure I
put<00:02:26.190> enough<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.090> first<00:02:27.330> time<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.349> if

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
put enough in the first time so that if

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.670 
put enough in the first time so that if
I<00:02:28.560> had<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.830> go<00:02:29.010> back<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.690> fix<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.959> side<00:02:31.200> curls

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
I had to go back and fix the side curls

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.729 
I had to go back and fix the side curls
I<00:02:32.099> just<00:02:32.430> added<00:02:32.610> water<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.930> record<00:02:34.380> well

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
I just added water and it record well

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.440 
I just added water and it record well
pre<00:02:35.459> pretty<00:02:36.330> well<00:02:36.569> on<00:02:36.930> its<00:02:37.110> own<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:38.459> that's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
pre pretty well on its own and that's

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.180 
pre pretty well on its own and that's
about<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.260> if<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.530> want<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.709> see<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> back

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
about it so if you want to see the back

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.250 
about it so if you want to see the back
here<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.170> definitely<00:02:43.170> opened<00:02:43.920> up<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.370> lot<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:45.260> i

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
here it definitely opened up a lot and i

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.630 
here it definitely opened up a lot and i
actually<00:02:47.099> prefer<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:48.390> have<00:02:48.630> my<00:02:48.660> hair<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:50.250> way

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
actually prefer to have my hair this way

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.190 
actually prefer to have my hair this way
a<00:02:51.420> lot<00:02:51.959> bigger<00:02:52.380> with<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> lot<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.700> volume<00:02:54.200> the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
a lot bigger with a lot of volume the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.830 
a lot bigger with a lot of volume the
only<00:02:55.410> reason<00:02:55.709> why<00:02:55.860> don't<00:02:56.310> take<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.819> here<00:02:57.599> on

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
only reason why don't take it here on

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.830 
only reason why don't take it here on
the<00:02:58.340> first<00:02:59.340> day<00:02:59.549> I<00:02:59.579> style<00:03:00.030> is<00:03:00.239> because<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.750> i

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
the first day I style is because if i

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.900 
the first day I style is because if i
take<00:03:01.079> it<00:03:01.260> here<00:03:01.709> on<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> first<00:03:02.250> day<00:03:02.579> it<00:03:02.790> really

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
take it here on the first day it really

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.910 
take it here on the first day it really
has<00:03:03.209> nowhere<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.810> go<00:03:03.840> because<00:03:04.290> they'll<00:03:04.739> just

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
has nowhere to go because they'll just

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.490 
has nowhere to go because they'll just
get<00:03:05.099> bigger<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.610> bigger<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:06.090> bigger<00:03:06.500> more

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
get bigger and bigger and bigger more

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.350 
get bigger and bigger and bigger more
curl<00:03:07.860> separation<00:03:08.459> will<00:03:08.579> occur<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.150> it'll

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
curl separation will occur and it'll

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.979 
curl separation will occur and it'll
just<00:03:09.390> look<00:03:09.780> like<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.260> huge<00:03:10.709> frizz<00:03:11.099> ball<00:03:11.340> and

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
just look like a huge frizz ball and

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.870 
just look like a huge frizz ball and
that<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> look<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:14.160> just<00:03:14.310> not<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.549> look

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
that is a look to is just not a look

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.349 
that is a look to is just not a look
that<00:03:15.180> I'm<00:03:15.329> crazy<00:03:15.720> about<00:03:16.549> but<00:03:17.549> this<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.150> pretty

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
that I'm crazy about but this is pretty

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.289 
that I'm crazy about but this is pretty
much<00:03:18.630> where<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.019> like<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.470> have<00:03:19.859> my<00:03:20.130> hair<00:03:20.519> it's

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
much where I like to have my hair it's

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.479 
much where I like to have my hair it's
big<00:03:21.690> but<00:03:22.079> you<00:03:22.230> still<00:03:22.560> see<00:03:22.859> a<00:03:22.889> lot<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.160> curl

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
big but you still see a lot of curl

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.170 
big but you still see a lot of curl
definition<00:03:23.790> uh<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:26.430> see<00:03:26.609> i'll<00:03:26.730> show<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
definition uh you see i'll show you the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.720 
definition uh you see i'll show you the
back<00:03:27.389> again<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:29.579> opens<00:03:30.329> up<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.600> lot<00:03:30.630> here<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.769> on

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
back again it opens up a lot here and on

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.379 
back again it opens up a lot here and on
the<00:03:32.910> top<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.660> does<00:03:34.019> as<00:03:34.260> well<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.760> keeps<00:03:36.209> the

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
the top it does as well but it keeps the

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.319 
the top it does as well but it keeps the
curl<00:03:36.630> so<00:03:36.930> there's<00:03:37.859> a<00:03:37.950> lot<00:03:38.130> of<00:03:38.190> separation<00:03:39.030> but

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
curl so there's a lot of separation but

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.170 
curl so there's a lot of separation but
you<00:03:39.480> still<00:03:39.840> see<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.799> pattern<00:03:41.310> it's<00:03:41.670> not<00:03:41.940> like

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
you still see the pattern it's not like

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
you still see the pattern it's not like
a<00:03:42.209> huge<00:03:42.630> frizz<00:03:43.079> out<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:44.870> that's<00:03:45.870> what<00:03:46.170> I

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
a huge frizz out and that's what I

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.800 
a huge frizz out and that's what I
appreciate<00:03:46.769> with<00:03:47.040> about<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.940> curl<00:03:48.180> cream<00:03:48.420> is

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
appreciate with about the curl cream is

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.680 
appreciate with about the curl cream is
that<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.410> really<00:03:49.739> defines<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.850> chrome<00:03:51.389> well

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
that it really defines the chrome well

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.059 
that it really defines the chrome well
and<00:03:52.109> it<00:03:52.350> still<00:03:52.799> maintains<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:54.389> curl<00:03:54.630> shape

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
and it still maintains the curl shape

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.460 
and it still maintains the curl shape
even<00:03:56.069> days<00:03:56.579> after<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.150> style<00:03:57.660> with<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.139> so

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
even days after I style with it so

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.879 
even days after I style with it so
that's<00:03:58.739> pretty<00:03:59.160> important<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.030> with

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
that's pretty important and with

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.379 
that's pretty important and with
considering<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:02.010> fact<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.430> it's<00:04:02.790> been<00:04:03.150> very

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
considering the fact that it's been very

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.660 
considering the fact that it's been very
humid<00:04:03.959> today<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.709> it's<00:04:05.340> going<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.579> be<00:04:05.639> very

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
humid today and it's going to be very

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.000 
humid today and it's going to be very
very<00:04:06.540> humid<00:04:07.019> tomorrow<00:04:07.170> like<00:04:07.590> it's<00:04:07.799> gonna<00:04:07.920> be

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
very humid tomorrow like it's gonna be

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.780 
very humid tomorrow like it's gonna be
97<00:04:08.670> degrees<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.000> crazy<00:04:09.930> humidity<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.790> we'll

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
97 degrees and crazy humidity so we'll

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.199 
97 degrees and crazy humidity so we'll
see<00:04:12.060> how<00:04:12.090> my<00:04:12.450> hair<00:04:12.690> looks<00:04:12.989> after<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:14.209> but

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
see how my hair looks after that but

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.409 
see how my hair looks after that but
what<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.660> will<00:04:16.440> probably<00:04:16.799> do<00:04:17.310> is<00:04:17.700> keep<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.239> up

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
what I will probably do is keep it up

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.310 
what I will probably do is keep it up
the<00:04:19.349> entire<00:04:19.769> day<00:04:20.190> when<00:04:21.030> I'm<00:04:21.120> out<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.750> bring<00:04:22.200> it

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
the entire day when I'm out and bring it

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.260 
is good to have a curl cream because the
