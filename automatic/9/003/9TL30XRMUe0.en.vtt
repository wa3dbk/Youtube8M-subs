00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
have the manifold all mounted and in the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.220 
have the manifold all mounted and in the
burner<00:01:46.040> assembly<00:01:46.130> itself<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.480> can<00:01:47.660> see<00:01:47.690> here

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
burner assembly itself you can see here

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.560 
burner assembly itself you can see here
that<00:01:48.260> this<00:01:49.000> thick<00:01:50.000> carbon<00:01:50.450> here<00:01:50.660> is<00:01:52.570> pretty

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
that this thick carbon here is pretty

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.960 
that this thick carbon here is pretty
nasty<00:01:53.780> stuff<00:01:54.050> alright<00:01:54.950> guys<00:01:55.160> that<00:01:55.490> don't<00:01:55.700> ever

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
nasty stuff alright guys that don't ever

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.170 
nasty stuff alright guys that don't ever
take<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.479> bottom<00:01:57.050> pan<00:01:57.290> off<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.830> they<00:01:58.790> rebuild

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
take the bottom pan off and they rebuild

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.510 
take the bottom pan off and they rebuild
an<00:01:59.300> engine<00:01:59.390> they<00:01:59.750> put<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.050> right<00:02:00.140> back<00:02:00.320> on<00:02:00.590> and

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
an engine they put it right back on and

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.890 
an engine they put it right back on and
that's<00:02:01.729> about<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.150> worst<00:02:02.240> thing<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:02.570> can<00:02:02.690> do

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
that's about the worst thing you can do

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.230 
that's about the worst thing you can do
because<00:02:03.110> during<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.130> cleaning<00:02:04.340> process<00:02:04.610> if

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
because during the cleaning process if

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.730 
because during the cleaning process if
you're<00:02:05.360> doing<00:02:05.600> an<00:02:05.720> aqueous<00:02:05.960> cleaning<00:02:06.560> like<00:02:06.680> a

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
you're doing an aqueous cleaning like a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.530 
you're doing an aqueous cleaning like a
pressure<00:02:07.220> washer<00:02:07.670> or<00:02:07.729> something<00:02:08.209> like<00:02:08.300> that

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
pressure washer or something like that

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.260 
pressure washer or something like that
the<00:02:09.320> stuff<00:02:09.530> will<00:02:09.679> get<00:02:09.770> loosened<00:02:10.130> up<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.580> then

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
the stuff will get loosened up and then

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.940 
the stuff will get loosened up and then
it'll<00:02:11.780> fall<00:02:11.930> down<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.290> bottom<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.709> pan

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
it'll fall down the bottom of the pan

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.920 
it'll fall down the bottom of the pan
and<00:02:12.980> if<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.400> don't<00:02:13.580> remove<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.940> pan<00:02:14.180> then

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
and if you don't remove the pan then

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.710 
and if you don't remove the pan then
it's<00:02:15.050> going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.320> go<00:02:15.410> in<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.680> new<00:02:15.830> engine<00:02:16.190> and

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
it's going to go in the new engine and

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.470 
it's going to go in the new engine and
cause<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.050> fail<00:02:18.730> our<00:02:19.730> cleaning<00:02:20.090> cycle<00:02:20.390> is

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
cause it to fail our cleaning cycle is

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.690 
cause it to fail our cleaning cycle is
all<00:02:20.570> finished<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.410> as<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:22.340> can<00:02:22.459> kind<00:02:22.580> of

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
all finished up and as you can kind of

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.980 
all finished up and as you can kind of
see<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:22.970> bottom<00:02:23.240> of<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.360> thing<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.780> stuff

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
see the bottom of this thing that stuff

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.800 
see the bottom of this thing that stuff
just<00:02:24.020> flakes<00:02:24.470> off<00:02:24.740> now<00:02:25.120> there's<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.209> fine<00:02:26.510> ash

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
just flakes off now there's a fine ash

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.840 
just flakes off now there's a fine ash
that's<00:02:27.050> on<00:02:27.260> here<00:02:27.500> we'll<00:02:28.430> get<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.640> through<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
that's on here we'll get it through the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.650 
that's on here we'll get it through the
blast<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.390> will<00:02:29.510> clean<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.900> right<00:02:30.170> up<00:02:31.660> well

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
blast and it will clean it right up well

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.410 
blast and it will clean it right up well
I<00:02:32.690> think<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.080> can<00:02:33.260> see<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.800> this<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.420> cleaned

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
I think you can see that this is cleaned

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.790 
I think you can see that this is cleaned
up

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
up

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.360 
up
quite<00:02:37.370> well

see<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.239> bottom<00:02:44.569> side<00:02:44.810> here<00:02:44.870> is<00:02:46.239> gotten

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
see that the bottom side here is gotten

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.160 
see that the bottom side here is gotten
completely<00:02:47.690> cleaned<00:02:47.989> up<00:02:49.870> besides<00:02:50.870> looking

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
completely cleaned up besides looking

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:06.050 
completely cleaned up besides looking
good

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.550 

I'm<00:03:07.060> gonna<00:03:07.180> put<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.480> over<00:03:07.720> in<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.050> tumbler

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
I'm gonna put this over in the tumbler
