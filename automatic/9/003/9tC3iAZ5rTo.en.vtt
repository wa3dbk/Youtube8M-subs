 from a cardboard box apparently 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.230
 empty in which three children have fun 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.510
 for hours a company emerges 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.410
 Mexican dance clown called tricycle 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.390
 red since 2006 this company has gone 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.550
 creating a space for poetic encounter 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.380
 between imagination and the body that has 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.800
 transcended borders to get to 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:41.120
 countries like india china united states 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.739
 canada portugal and brazil before the dilemma 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.420
 of restricting the scope of this 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.000
 Scenic proposal the number of forums 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.290
 available in the Mexican Republic 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.059
 red tricycle created a solution 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.579
 imaginary in order to reach the highest 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.380
 number of children possible according to 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.480
 the national council for culture and 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.940
 the arts in mexico has registered 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.940
 the existence of 557 theaters 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.010
 if we divide this amount between 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.890
 last estimate of inhabitants the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.979
 result is one theater for every 212 thousand 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.990
 600 are Mexicans if only we 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 We concentrate on the state of Oaxaca with 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.060
 its almost 4 million inhabitants the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.460
 result is one theater for every 400 63 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.250
 thousand 865 small water 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.409
 for example a resident of pinotepa 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.869
 national would have to make a trip of 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.700
 At least 10 hours by bus to be able 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.380
 attend one of the three venues

 for him they would be ridiculously low 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.220
 or almost null 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.140
 besides never having stepped on a theater 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.030
 in all his life it is very likely that this 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.700
 child does not have a clear emotion of what 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.800
 are the performing arts investing 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.780
