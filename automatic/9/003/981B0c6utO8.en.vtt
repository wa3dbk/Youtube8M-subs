episode 24 just to be created

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.560 
episode 24 just to be created
appropriately<00:04:15.950> now<00:04:16.950> for<00:04:17.640> one<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.000> hardest

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
appropriately now for one of the hardest

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.680 
appropriately now for one of the hardest
shots<00:04:18.900> in<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.230> entire<00:04:19.590> episode<00:04:20.340> this<00:04:21.209> right

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
shots in the entire episode this right

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.500 
shots in the entire episode this right
here<00:04:22.080> see<00:04:22.890> for<00:04:23.100> this<00:04:23.400> shot<00:04:23.700> I<00:04:23.910> took<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.360> entire

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
here see for this shot I took the entire

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.500 
here see for this shot I took the entire
sequence<00:04:25.260> into<00:04:25.530> After<00:04:25.890> Effects<00:04:26.220> then<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.030> used

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
sequence into After Effects then I used

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.360 
sequence into After Effects then I used
the<00:04:27.720> roto<00:04:27.990> brush<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.650> select<00:04:28.919> freeze<00:04:29.160> and

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
the roto brush to select freeze and

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.760 
the roto brush to select freeze and
krillen<00:04:29.610> and<00:04:29.880> only<00:04:30.660> Frieza<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.230> krillen<00:04:31.500> as

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
krillen and only Frieza and krillen as

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.409 
krillen and only Frieza and krillen as
so<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> could<00:04:32.520> make<00:04:32.700> them<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.910> completely

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
so I could make them a completely

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.230 
so I could make them a completely
separate<00:04:33.900> layer<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:34.770> was<00:04:35.240> incredibly

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
separate layer this was incredibly

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.850 
separate layer this was incredibly
time-consuming<00:04:36.840> as<00:04:37.500> I

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
time-consuming as I

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.140 
time-consuming as I
essentially<00:04:38.250> had<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.460> do<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.669> frame<00:04:38.909> by<00:04:39.120> frame

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
essentially had to do it frame by frame

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.830 
essentially had to do it frame by frame
D<00:04:39.750> selecting<00:04:40.259> the<00:04:40.349> background<00:04:40.830> every<00:04:41.370> time

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
D selecting the background every time

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.409 
D selecting the background every time

our biggest missed opportunities in the

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
entire series so here we were finally

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.019 
entire series so here we were finally
