of<00:01:04.559> part<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.880> when<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.180> added<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.450> mr.

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
of part one is when they added the mr.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.140 
of part one is when they added the mr.
fusion<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.409> make<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> easier<00:01:08.100> for<00:01:08.939> us<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
fusion but to make it easier for us to

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.820
