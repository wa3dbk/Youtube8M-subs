00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.089 
courtesy using nuclear parametric the
basic<00:00:11.670> method<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.480> creating<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.259> TC<00:00:13.710> would<00:00:13.889> be

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
basic method of creating the TC would be

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.910 
basic method of creating the TC would be
to<00:00:14.429> create<00:00:14.820> 3d<00:00:15.450> curves<00:00:15.839> or<00:00:16.049> planar<00:00:16.350> colors<00:00:16.770> in

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
to create 3d curves or planar colors in

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.000 
to create 3d curves or planar colors in
them<00:00:17.100> or<00:00:17.340> maybe<00:00:17.910> see<00:00:18.270> our<00:00:18.690> sweep<00:00:19.109> section

across<00:00:20.609> these<00:00:21.180> kits<00:00:21.600> but<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.710> doesn't<00:00:23.070> work<00:00:23.250> as

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
across these kits but it doesn't work as

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.390 
across these kits but it doesn't work as
you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.920> intersections<00:00:25.920> are<00:00:26.130> not

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
you can see the intersections are not

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.870 
you can see the intersections are not
realistic<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.349> onion<00:00:29.010> reality<00:00:29.580> don't

so<00:00:38.430> what<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.600> become<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.200> problem<00:00:40.770> maybe<00:00:41.070> we

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
so what to become this problem maybe we

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.209 
so what to become this problem maybe we
can<00:00:41.640> use<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.360> surface<00:00:43.050> command<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:43.980> are

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
can use the surface command and then are

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.660 
can use the surface command and then are
then<00:00:45.210> print<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.809> surface<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.710> merge<00:00:47.070> surface

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
then print the surface or merge surface

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.560 
then print the surface or merge surface
together<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:49.430> sometimes<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.090> thickening

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
together but sometimes the thickening

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.590 
together but sometimes the thickening
option<00:00:52.020> would<00:00:52.469> create<00:00:52.920> some<00:00:53.600> representation

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
option would create some representation

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.709 
option would create some representation
which<00:00:54.809> can't<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.320> meshed<00:00:55.860> together<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.719> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
which can't be meshed together on the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.979 
which can't be meshed together on the
opposite<00:00:58.199> also<00:00:58.469> doesn't<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.370> sometimes<00:00:59.989> so

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
opposite also doesn't but sometimes so

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.080 
opposite also doesn't but sometimes so
gray<00:01:01.260> provides<00:01:01.739> an<00:01:01.949> option<00:01:02.370> for<00:01:02.670> overcoming

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
gray provides an option for overcoming

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
underwent a plane again and also the

order the first girl on the last curve

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:17.390 
order the first girl on the last curve
so<00:04:11.069> it<00:04:11.250> creates<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:12.120> PDF<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:14.190> bended<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:16.400> that's

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
so it creates a PDF the bended so that's

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.199 
so it creates a PDF the bended so that's
all<00:04:17.639> V<00:04:17.760> doesn't<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:19.410> other<00:04:19.530> method<00:04:19.889> is<00:04:19.919> to

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
all V doesn't the other method is to

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.650 
all V doesn't the other method is to
place<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.479> co-owner<00:04:22.469> on<00:04:23.180> between<00:04:24.180> two<00:04:24.360> points

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
place the co-owner on between two points

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.270 
place the co-owner on between two points
with<00:04:25.780> this<00:04:26.170> nothing<00:04:26.560> but<00:04:26.740> it<00:04:26.890> actually

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
with this nothing but it actually

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.820 
with this nothing but it actually
creates<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:28.090> code<00:04:28.540> between<00:04:28.990> two<00:04:29.320> points<00:04:29.770> and

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
creates the code between two points and

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.210 
creates the code between two points and
then<00:04:30.010> with<00:04:31.020> cross-section<00:04:32.020> before<00:04:32.770> we<00:04:32.890> have

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
then with cross-section before we have

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.490 
then with cross-section before we have
to<00:04:33.370> define<00:04:33.700> a<00:04:33.730> plane<00:04:34.120> passing<00:04:34.900> through<00:04:35.350> the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
to define a plane passing through the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.520 
to define a plane passing through the
points<00:04:35.920> so<00:04:36.190> that's<00:04:36.460> how<00:04:36.760> we<00:04:37.510> define<00:04:37.720> a<00:04:37.960> profile

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
points so that's how we define a profile

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.400 
points so that's how we define a profile
I<00:04:38.830> have<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.820> define<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.270> profile<00:04:40.720> we<00:04:41.020> need<00:04:41.230> to

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
I have to define the profile we need to

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.870 
I have to define the profile we need to
do<00:04:41.650> with<00:04:41.890> joint<00:04:43.800> jointer<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.980> intersections

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
do with joint jointer the intersections

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.570 
do with joint jointer the intersections
which<00:04:46.180> can<00:04:46.450> be<00:04:46.570> done<00:04:46.750> basing<00:04:47.140> our<00:04:47.580> joint

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
which can be done basing our joint

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.630 
which can be done basing our joint
command<00:04:48.970> here<00:04:49.240> so<00:04:49.930> at<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.230> top<00:04:50.380> of<00:04:50.440> 21<00:04:51.130> I<00:04:51.340> want

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
command here so at the top of 21 I want

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.000 
command here so at the top of 21 I want
this<00:04:51.730> type<00:04:51.910> of<00:04:52.030> joint<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.690> then<00:04:52.990> maybe<00:04:53.530> select

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
this type of joint and then maybe select

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.450 
this type of joint and then maybe select
these<00:04:54.190> surfaces<00:04:55.410> yeah<00:04:56.410> that's<00:04:57.040> how<00:04:57.250> we<00:04:57.280> do

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
these surfaces yeah that's how we do

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.630 
these surfaces yeah that's how we do
that<00:04:57.610> is<00:04:58.240> repetition<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:59.050> continuous<00:04:59.530> loop<00:04:59.740> so

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
that is repetition a continuous loop so

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:10.140 
that is repetition a continuous loop so
you<00:05:01.240> can<00:05:01.480> go<00:05:01.870> on<00:05:02.200> doing<00:05:02.530> die<00:05:03.180> tell<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.420> one<00:05:09.150> so

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
you can go on doing die tell you one so

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.690 
you can go on doing die tell you one so
one<00:05:10.660> of<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.870> command<00:05:11.290> that<00:05:11.620> could<00:05:12.370> be<00:05:12.520> useful

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
one of the command that could be useful

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.630 
one of the command that could be useful
in<00:05:13.090> creating<00:05:15.390> create<00:05:16.390> is<00:05:16.570> it<00:05:16.810> should<00:05:16.990> be<00:05:17.640> cut

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
in creating create is it should be cut

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.240 
in creating create is it should be cut
at<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.390> intersections<00:05:20.050> or<00:05:20.440> some<00:05:20.800> complex

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
at the intersections or some complex

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.630 
at the intersections or some complex
cuts<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:22.270> I'll<00:05:22.930> use<00:05:23.290> the<00:05:23.500> profile<00:05:23.980> cut<00:05:24.280> out<00:05:24.490> and

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
cuts so I'll use the profile cut out and

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.700 
cuts so I'll use the profile cut out and
selecting<00:05:25.180> or<00:05:25.630> for<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:25.990> needs<00:05:26.230> to<00:05:26.380> be<00:05:26.410> cut

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
selecting or for that needs to be cut

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.630 
selecting or for that needs to be cut
white<00:05:27.190> by<00:05:28.060> profile<00:05:28.780> that<00:05:29.020> cuts<00:05:29.380> it<00:05:29.560> so<00:05:30.340> as<00:05:30.610> you

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
white by profile that cuts it so as you

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.100 
white by profile that cuts it so as you
can<00:05:30.910> see<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.300> CEO<00:05:32.110> or<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:33.490> profile<00:05:34.390> is<00:05:34.600> club

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
can see the CEO or the profile is club

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.390 
can see the CEO or the profile is club
and<00:05:35.910> the<00:05:36.910> motion<00:05:37.680> realistic<00:05:38.680> you<00:05:38.830> can<00:05:39.010> do<00:05:39.220> that

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
and the motion realistic you can do that

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.770 
and the motion realistic you can do that
here<00:05:40.240> or<00:05:40.450> very<00:05:41.440> one<00:05:41.920> so<00:05:42.550> this<00:05:43.360> would<00:05:43.510> be<00:05:43.660> the

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
here or very one so this would be the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.160 
here or very one so this would be the
basic<00:05:44.140> option<00:05:44.560> are<00:05:45.240> for<00:05:46.240> creating<00:05:46.810> your

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
basic option are for creating your

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.450 
basic option are for creating your
chassis<00:05:47.530> of<00:05:47.860> F<00:05:48.400> is<00:05:48.640> a<00:05:48.790> are<00:05:49.060> go-kart<00:05:49.900> vehicle

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
chassis of F is a are go-kart vehicle

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.670 
chassis of F is a are go-kart vehicle
also<00:05:51.460> you<00:05:51.550> can<00:05:51.730> use<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.090> planet<00:05:52.510> trim<00:05:52.810> they

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
also you can use the planet trim they

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.800 
also you can use the planet trim they
replace<00:05:54.100> surface<00:05:54.640> options<00:05:55.150> which<00:05:55.450> may<00:05:55.750> be

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
replace surface options which may be

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.980 
replace surface options which may be
useful<00:05:56.050> but<00:05:56.980> this<00:05:57.670> would<00:05:57.850> be<00:05:57.880> the<00:05:58.180> basic

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
useful but this would be the basic

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.530 
useful but this would be the basic
necessity<00:05:59.980> for<00:06:00.220> creating<00:06:00.730> your<00:06:01.060> chassis

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
necessity for creating your chassis

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.430 
necessity for creating your chassis
so<00:06:02.550> that's<00:06:03.550> it<00:06:03.820> that's<00:06:04.600> end<00:06:04.900> of<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.260> tutorial

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
so that's it that's end of the tutorial

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.620 
so that's it that's end of the tutorial
and<00:06:06.010> now<00:06:06.820> see<00:06:07.150> you<00:06:07.390> later<00:06:07.480> in<00:06:07.930> bye
