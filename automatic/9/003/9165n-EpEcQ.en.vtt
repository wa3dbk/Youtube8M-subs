I<00:01:27.360> thought<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> was<00:01:28.080> quite<00:01:28.229> cute<00:01:28.619> okay<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.610> if

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
I thought it was quite cute okay so if

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.190 
I thought it was quite cute okay so if
you're<00:01:29.820> into<00:01:30.119> marley<00:01:30.450> hair<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.020> wouldn't

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you're into marley hair you wouldn't

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.950 
you're into marley hair you wouldn't
know<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.409> marley<00:01:31.890> hair<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.280> very<00:01:32.820> hard<00:01:33.210> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
know that marley hair is very hard this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.260 
know that marley hair is very hard this
hair<00:01:34.290> does<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:35.130> coarse<00:01:35.549> texture

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
hair does have a really coarse texture

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.749 
hair does have a really coarse texture
so<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:36.930> you're<00:01:37.049> not<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.409> into<00:01:38.009> hard<00:01:38.460> hair

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
so if you're not really into hard hair

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
so if you're not really into hard hair
this<00:01:38.939> may<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.240> work<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.170> find

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that this is much softer than a lot of

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.319 
that this is much softer than a lot of
the<00:01:42.630> marley<00:01:42.930> hair<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.290> I've<00:01:43.530> had<00:01:44.090> has<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> lot
