00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.740
 I am the fire is here with a new 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.820
 televen video and today I'm going to give you my 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.570
 advice for 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.340
 for the cup 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.470
 Many of you will have realized that 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.840
 in the long environment for the already eliminated 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.970
 the advantages of certain players for 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.000
 example advantages that the 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.360
 players of level 5 universe 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.590
 7 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:38.900
 to level 1 players 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.750
 that has been removed and now the 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:47.290
 Cup pairings are based on 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.290
 in the calm in a place 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.930
 players in the same cup who have 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.310
 a very similar quality 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.430
 my advice for you to have 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.880
 a little more advantage without accepting 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.200
 totally 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.200
 You see here in 1011 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.610
 and come 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.450
 55 51 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.329
 8 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.620
 of my players the substitutes are 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.500
 between 45 and 50 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.440
 but here I have certain players who 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.330
 later work the average of the team and 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.170
 accident time to have with this player 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.119
 it's 55 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.740
 that I would have done who is not 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.740
 would have framed in a cup 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.549
 a team that wants 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.860
 quality 50 51 52 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.170
 by not downloading my friend from the team 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.170
 having these players logically 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.390
 it's going to be a little more affordable 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.280
 freedom to the other players because 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.280
 really a good one 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.220
 in guilt has nothing to do 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.610
 that you have a team 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.710
 like I have to get to the end 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.710
 in the turn 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:27.819
 it is simply an advice for what 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.819
 do not have a little easier 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.580
 that sounds to me always a result 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.770
 always reached the round of 16 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.580
 but 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.350
 from a point of view of indifference 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:48.110
 because quite 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:52.480
 this is all for today I will go up 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.480
 little by little more nobody
