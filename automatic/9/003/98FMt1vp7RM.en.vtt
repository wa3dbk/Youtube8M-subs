00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
from TJ Maxx and that's pretty much it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.130 
from TJ Maxx and that's pretty much it
for<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.550> outfit<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.539> paired<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:10.989> with<00:02:11.050> a

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
thought it just tied the whole look

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:33.480 
thought it just tied the whole look
together<00:02:14.739> since<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.430> was<00:02:15.519> lacking<00:02:15.790> some<00:02:16.180> color

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490
