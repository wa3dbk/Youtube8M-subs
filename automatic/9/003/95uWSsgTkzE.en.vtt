00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
movements so I'm just going to jump as

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.530 
movements so I'm just going to jump as
high<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.130> can<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.610> that'll<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.209> one<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.480> my

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
high as I can and that'll be one of my

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.100 
high as I can and that'll be one of my
routes<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:13.020> 20<00:02:13.260> seconds<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.900> turn<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:15.990> volume

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
routes for 20 seconds so turn the volume

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.980 
routes for 20 seconds so turn the volume
up<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.910> again<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.480> just<00:02:18.660> showing

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
up on this and again this just showing

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.270 
up on this and again this just showing
you<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.230> could<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:19.500> ciabatta<00:02:19.770> anywhere

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
you that you could do ciabatta anywhere

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.900 
you that you could do ciabatta anywhere
even<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.420> hotel<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:23.310> know<00:02:23.340> hotel

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
even in a hotel you know hotel

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.449 
even in a hotel you know hotel
essentially<00:02:24.680> so

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.509 

let's<00:02:30.849> get<00:02:30.969> started<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.189> two<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.489> one

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
let's get started so it's a two to one

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.679 
let's get started so it's a two to one
work<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.239> rest<00:02:34.450> ratio<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:37.359> let's<00:02:37.569> go<00:02:37.689> ahead<00:02:39.689> so

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
work to rest ratio and let's go ahead so

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.380 
work to rest ratio and let's go ahead so
this<00:02:40.840> is<00:02:40.930> going<00:02:41.170> on<00:02:41.260> there<00:02:42.069> I'm<00:02:43.000> gonna<00:02:43.120> get<00:02:43.239> my

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
this is going on there I'm gonna get my

00:02:43.390 --> 00:04:11.589 
this is going on there I'm gonna get my
speed

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:27.210 

okay<00:04:12.459> once<00:04:13.459> this<00:04:13.640> about<00:04:13.849> three<00:04:14.560> already
