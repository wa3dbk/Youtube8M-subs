00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.420
 bernanke had been so tasty nor 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.129
 cook with fun 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:15.270
 this is kitchen tower but with a lot 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:20.250
 I was hungry 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:22.470
 a delirium I want to help 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 hello how are you welcome to cook your 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.700
 We are going to prepare a recipe for 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.770
 that grow up healthy and strong and I know 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.840
 I recommend if they go to warriors they can not 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.950
 stop asking for it let's prepare a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.950
 fish fillet to size 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.989
 The first thing you have to do is 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.910
 cut an onion into medium good cubes 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.070
 diced onion and let's put 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.050
 be together with 2 cloves of garlic we are going to 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.559
 wake up the chiles and we're also leaving 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.559
 to put the salt 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.180
 and 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.780
 since the chiles are golden without 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.430
 come to burn we are going to put them to 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.430
 soak 10 minutes in hot water 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130
 do not 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.530
 we are going to liquefy the chili peppers along with the 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.420
 rest of the ingredients if it is 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.920
 It is necessary that you add a little 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.570
 water so that the blades of the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.119
 blender and we really left a 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.590
 very very homogeneous mixture, so let's go 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.590
 to have to add a little water 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.630
 the nothing 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:36.129
 or not 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.129
 no no 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.870
 of fish we are going to pepper them 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.340
 let's notice with a little lemon and 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.200
 then we are going to tell you about the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.640
 liquefied we made chili with 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.890
 mayonnaise and good all the ingredients 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.450
 we're going to let it sit for five minutes 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.319
 to absorb a bit and then we 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.319
 we put them in the pan 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.730
 now 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.600
 what I like when they prepare me 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.910
 fish fillet carving on the beach 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.980
 is that in the spit they have what 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.069
 to be used to fire the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.840
 firewood is few dry flakes I think 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.060
 that this gives a good flavor so 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.590
 well I do not have coconuts to put to burn 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.330
 habitat but what I have is a bit of 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.100
 coconut oil with which more seal 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.400
 the fish four minutes per each 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.400
