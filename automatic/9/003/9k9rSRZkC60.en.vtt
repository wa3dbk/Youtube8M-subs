00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
too thin for my face bro which I tend to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.190 
too thin for my face bro which I tend to
do<00:00:35.460> out<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> stress<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.690> something<00:00:36.899> that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
do out of stress so it's something that

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.229 
do out of stress so it's something that
I<00:00:37.230> could<00:00:37.680> check<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> want<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.059> back

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
I could check on but I want to go back

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.090 
I could check on but I want to go back
to<00:00:39.270> my<00:00:39.600> happy<00:00:39.960> medium<00:00:40.320> which<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.649> roughly<00:00:40.920> what

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
to my happy medium which is roughly what

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.010 
to my happy medium which is roughly what
you<00:00:41.219> see<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.579> picture<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.870> it's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
you see in this picture so you know it's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.110 
you see in this picture so you know it's
kind<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.410> too<00:00:43.590> thin<00:00:43.860> not<00:00:43.890> too<00:00:44.129> thick<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.789> I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
kind of not too thin not too thick and I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
kind of not too thin not too thick and I
can<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.629> without<00:00:45.930> bananas<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.680> if<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
can go without bananas and if I need to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.970 
can go without bananas and if I need to
so<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.270> last<00:00:48.420> time<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.750> filled<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.590> did<00:00:49.860> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
so the last time I filled it in I did it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.709 
so the last time I filled it in I did it
on<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.460> goal<00:00:50.760> which<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.210> really<00:00:51.510> really

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
on a one goal which is really really

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.410 
on a one goal which is really really
messy<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> face<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.180> especially<00:00:54.180> when

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

wanted in an easy way to do this is to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
wanted in an easy way to do this is to
use<00:01:17.340> eyebrow<00:01:17.640> stencils<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.720> get

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
use eyebrow stencils so you can get

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.679 
use eyebrow stencils so you can get
these<00:01:19.110> from<00:01:19.439> loads<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.159> viruses<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.180> chemists

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
these from loads of viruses or chemists

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.899 
these from loads of viruses or chemists
or<00:01:21.840> drug<00:01:22.020> stores<00:01:22.290> or<00:01:22.530> anastacio<00:01:23.280> brow<00:01:23.580> kids

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
or drug stores or anastacio brow kids

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.480 
or drug stores or anastacio brow kids
and<00:01:24.180> stuff<00:01:24.330> like<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> want

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
and stuff like that so for here I want

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.700 
and stuff like that so for here I want
to<00:01:26.580> do<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.880> by<00:01:27.119> hand<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> tend<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.680> is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
to do it by hand so what I tend to do is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.730 
to do it by hand so what I tend to do is
use<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.670> dark<00:01:30.090> eyebrow<00:01:30.570> pencil<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.500> see

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
use a dark eyebrow pencil you can see

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.770 
use a dark eyebrow pencil you can see
I've<00:01:31.860> already<00:01:32.100> started<00:01:32.430> taking<00:01:33.240> my<00:01:33.420> eyebrows

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I've already started taking my eyebrows

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.710 
I've already started taking my eyebrows
out<00:01:33.990> that's<00:01:34.409> about<00:01:34.700> 45<00:01:35.700> days<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.329> regrowth

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
out that's about 45 days of regrowth

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.140 
out that's about 45 days of regrowth
that<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.049> haven't<00:01:37.259> locked<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.799> area<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:39.119> i

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that I haven't locked in that area so i

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.719 
that I haven't locked in that area so i
use<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.750> eyebrow<00:01:40.170> pencil<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.009> fill<00:01:41.400> in

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
use the eyebrow pencil and I fill in

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
use the eyebrow pencil and I fill in
roughly<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> thickness<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.320> how<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.530> want<00:01:43.950> my

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
roughly the thickness of how I want my

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.200 
roughly the thickness of how I want my
eyebrows<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.549> just<00:01:47.549> kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.030> this

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
eyebrows to be so I just kind of do this

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
the hairs outside of that shades so my

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.440 
the hairs outside of that shades so my
favorite<00:02:23.400> tweezers<00:02:23.790> are<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> tweezerman

basically the slanted ones I find that

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.590 
basically the slanted ones I find that
they<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.340> really<00:02:29.880> went<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.390> hairs

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
they just really went on to the hairs

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.500

and<00:02:30.930> they<00:02:31.530> don't<00:02:31.709> tend<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.220> break<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.700> skin<00:02:32.940> so

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
and they don't tend to break the skin so

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.780 
and they don't tend to break the skin so
keep<00:02:33.720> locking<00:02:33.959> on<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.410> all<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:35.040> stray<00:02:35.400> hair<00:02:35.640> is
