00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
think there's been much to be said about

youth sports and I just thought it was

it<00:00:59.530> was<00:00:59.680> something<00:01:00.070> that<00:01:00.269> had<00:01:01.269> to<00:01:01.420> be<00:01:01.510> the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
it was something that had to be the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.509 
it was something that had to be the
first<00:01:01.930> step<00:01:02.170> before<00:01:02.440> we<00:01:02.800> go<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.190> talk<00:01:03.370> about

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
something that I think everybody

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.650 
something that I think everybody
understands<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:34.269> know<00:03:34.390> it's<00:03:34.540> not

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
understands and you know it's not

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.789 
understands and you know it's not
something<00:03:34.989> that<00:03:35.019> we<00:03:35.140> just<00:03:35.320> want<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.650> in

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
something that we just want to have in

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.289 
something that we just want to have in
place<00:03:35.950> for<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> year<00:03:36.670> or<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:36.940> it's<00:03:37.150> something

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
place for a year or so it's something

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.440 
place for a year or so it's something
that<00:03:37.510> should<00:03:37.660> be<00:03:37.690> consistent<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:39.359> you<00:03:40.359> know

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
that should be consistent and you know

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.750 
that should be consistent and you know
again<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:40.900> more<00:03:41.350> than<00:03:41.560> anything<00:03:41.739> it's<00:03:42.549> for

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
again it's more than anything it's for

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.550 
again it's more than anything it's for
the<00:03:42.850> players<00:03:43.090> it's<00:03:43.329> for<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.600> kids<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:44.200> that's

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
the players it's for the kids so that's

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.410 
the players it's for the kids so that's
that<00:03:45.040> was<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.310> main<00:03:45.459> objective<00:03:45.609> with<00:03:46.120> with
