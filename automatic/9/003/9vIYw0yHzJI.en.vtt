there's<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.040> touch<00:04:02.250> on<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.580> your<00:04:02.670> push<00:04:02.820> chair

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
there's a touch on to your push chair

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.070 
there's a touch on to your push chair
you<00:04:03.630> can<00:04:03.780> tighten<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.320> off<00:04:04.500> even<00:04:04.890> more<00:04:06.080> now

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
you can tighten that off even more now

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.350 
you can tighten that off even more now
as<00:04:07.440> I've<00:04:07.590> already<00:04:07.739> said<00:04:08.130> we<00:04:08.670> have<00:04:08.940> got<00:04:09.269> the

facility to have the pushchair facing

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.880 
facility to have the pushchair facing
either<00:04:12.420> way<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:13.110> I'm<00:04:13.200> just<00:04:13.350> going<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.590> set<00:04:13.860> that

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
either way so I'm just going to set that

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.060 
either way so I'm just going to set that
up<00:04:14.209> this<00:04:15.209> solid<00:04:15.720> bar<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.290> we<00:04:16.380> use<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.799> do<00:04:16.919> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
up this solid bar that we use to do the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.860 
up this solid bar that we use to do the
recline<00:04:17.489> you've<00:04:17.790> got<00:04:17.910> another<00:04:18.269> one<00:04:18.600> and

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
recline you've got another one and

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.440 
recline you've got another one and
that's<00:04:19.169> at<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.530> base<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:20.100> your<00:04:20.190> push<00:04:20.519> chair<00:04:20.820> so

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
that's at the base of your push chair so

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.690 
that's at the base of your push chair so
just<00:04:21.660> pulling<00:04:22.019> that<00:04:22.169> out<00:04:22.230> it<00:04:22.860> releases<00:04:23.370> that

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
just pulling that out it releases that

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.659 
just pulling that out it releases that
part<00:04:24.030> off<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.710> your<00:04:25.710> seat<00:04:25.950> unit<00:04:26.280> comes<00:04:26.460> off

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
part off and your seat unit comes off

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.090 
part off and your seat unit comes off
nice<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.210> easily

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
nice and easily

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.790 
nice and easily
flipping<00:04:28.700> it<00:04:28.820> round<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.570> all<00:04:30.230> that<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.620> need

flipping it round and all that you need
to<00:04:30.830> do<00:04:31.130> line<00:04:31.820> that<00:04:32.180> up<00:04:32.890> pop<00:04:33.890> it<00:04:34.070> into<00:04:34.310> position

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
to do line that up pop it into position

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.330 
to do line that up pop it into position
and<00:04:35.060> it's<00:04:35.570> basically<00:04:36.170> the<00:04:36.380> two<00:04:36.710> little<00:04:37.070> black

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340

and it's basically the two little black
buttons<00:04:37.910> that<00:04:38.150> are<00:04:38.270> on<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.570> side<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.290> it

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
buttons that are on the side and it

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.130 
buttons that are on the side and it
literally<00:04:40.550> just<00:04:41.210> clicks<00:04:41.510> into<00:04:41.750> place

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
literally just clicks into place

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.010 
literally just clicks into place
and<00:04:42.470> you'll<00:04:43.190> hear<00:04:43.460> a<00:04:43.490> really<00:04:43.880> nice<00:04:44.240> loud<00:04:44.660> click

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
and you'll hear a really nice loud click

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.830 
and you'll hear a really nice loud click
again<00:04:45.830> allowing<00:04:46.400> you<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:46.850> have<00:04:46.910> that<00:04:47.150> position

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
again allowing you to have that position

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.160 
again allowing you to have that position
whichever<00:04:48.620> way<00:04:48.830> you<00:04:48.860> would<00:04:49.160> like<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:49.610> go<00:04:50.170> so

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
whichever way you would like it to go so

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.160 
whichever way you would like it to go so
again<00:04:51.350> just<00:04:51.380> removing<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:52.340> off<00:04:52.990> I'm<00:04:53.990> going

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
again just removing that off I'm going

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.350 
again just removing that off I'm going
to<00:04:54.290> take<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.560> whole<00:04:54.770> thing<00:04:54.800> off<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.580> show<00:04:56.300> you

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
to take the whole thing off and show you

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.690 
to take the whole thing off and show you
the<00:04:56.630> frame<00:04:56.930> when<00:04:57.620> we<00:04:57.770> do<00:04:57.890> the<00:04:58.040> folding<00:04:58.490> down

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
the frame when we do the folding down

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.200 
the frame when we do the folding down
mechanism<00:05:00.040> you<00:05:01.040> can<00:05:01.280> have<00:05:01.520> your<00:05:01.640> seat<00:05:01.850> unit

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
mechanism you can have your seat unit

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.020 
mechanism you can have your seat unit
facing<00:05:02.660> away<00:05:02.750> from<00:05:02.900> you<00:05:03.350> it<00:05:03.950> will<00:05:04.280> not<00:05:04.580> fold

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
facing away from you it will not fold

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.850 
facing away from you it will not fold
down<00:05:05.270> with<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.570> seat<00:05:05.780> unit<00:05:06.110> facing<00:05:06.500> towards

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
down with the seat unit facing towards

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.250 
down with the seat unit facing towards
you<00:05:06.950> but<00:05:07.070> it<00:05:07.190> will<00:05:07.430> facing<00:05:07.970> away<00:05:08.090> but<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:08.990> won't

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
you but it will facing away but it won't

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.050 
you but it will facing away but it won't
fold<00:05:09.530> quite<00:05:09.800> so<00:05:10.010> flat<00:05:10.250> but<00:05:10.610> I'll<00:05:10.730> talk<00:05:11.000> you

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
fold quite so flat but I'll talk you

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.720 
fold quite so flat but I'll talk you
through<00:05:11.240> that<00:05:11.570> as<00:05:11.780> we<00:05:11.900> do<00:05:12.110> it<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:13.340> take<00:05:13.550> off

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
through that as we do it to take off

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.110 
through that as we do it to take off
your<00:05:13.910> hood<00:05:14.090> just<00:05:14.720> sliding<00:05:15.650> off<00:05:15.940> really<00:05:16.940> easy

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
your hood just sliding off really easy

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.570 
your hood just sliding off really easy
to<00:05:17.450> do<00:05:17.630> just<00:05:17.870> to<00:05:18.200> slide<00:05:18.470> on<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:18.860> off<00:05:18.950> action

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
to do just to slide on and off action

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.990 
to do just to slide on and off action
now<00:05:20.030> we've<00:05:20.240> got<00:05:20.390> just<00:05:20.420> the<00:05:20.870> frame<00:05:21.140> itself<00:05:22.000> I'm

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
now we've got just the frame itself I'm

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000 
now we've got just the frame itself I'm
going<00:05:23.330> to<00:05:23.390> do<00:05:23.510> folding<00:05:23.900> down<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.410> I<00:05:24.590> find<00:05:24.890> it

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
going to do folding down and I find it

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.030 
going to do folding down and I find it
slightly<00:05:25.220> easier<00:05:25.430> if<00:05:26.060> we<00:05:27.020> release<00:05:27.470> off<00:05:27.740> the

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
slightly easier if we release off the

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.250 
slightly easier if we release off the
front<00:05:28.310> wheels<00:05:28.550> it<00:05:29.240> makes<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.810> a<00:05:29.840> smaller

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
front wheels it makes it a smaller

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.540 
front wheels it makes it a smaller
package<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:31.420> just<00:05:32.420> tipping<00:05:32.750> that<00:05:32.930> away<00:05:33.620> again

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
package and just tipping that away again

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.730 
package and just tipping that away again
will<00:05:34.760> make<00:05:34.940> it<00:05:35.120> slightly<00:05:35.360> smaller<00:05:35.660> I'm<00:05:36.530> just

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
will make it slightly smaller I'm just

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.320 
will make it slightly smaller I'm just
going<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:36.890> pop<00:05:37.130> my<00:05:37.160> pump<00:05:37.610> away<00:05:37.940> so<00:05:38.000> it<00:05:38.300> doesn't

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
going to pop my pump away so it doesn't

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.990 
going to pop my pump away so it doesn't
go<00:05:38.630> rolling<00:05:38.990> over<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.470> floor<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.160> again<00:05:40.670> that

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
go rolling over the floor and again that

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.150 
go rolling over the floor and again that
velcro's<00:05:41.630> into<00:05:41.960> that<00:05:42.230> nice<00:05:42.530> neat<00:05:42.860> little

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
velcro's into that nice neat little

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.730 
velcro's into that nice neat little
pocket<00:05:45.490> handle<00:05:46.490> down<00:05:46.670> so<00:05:47.270> if<00:05:47.360> you<00:05:47.450> were<00:05:47.630> to<00:05:47.960> pop

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
pocket handle down so if you were to pop

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.240 
pocket handle down so if you were to pop
your<00:05:48.890> handle<00:05:49.190> down<00:05:49.310> again<00:05:49.850> makes<00:05:50.090> it<00:05:50.240> smaller

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
your handle down again makes it smaller

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.530 
your handle down again makes it smaller
you've<00:05:52.250> got<00:05:52.370> a<00:05:52.400> safety<00:05:52.850> catch<00:05:53.030> on<00:05:53.180> the<00:05:53.300> side

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
you've got a safety catch on the side

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.710 
you've got a safety catch on the side
and<00:05:53.780> that<00:05:53.840> just<00:05:54.350> depresses<00:05:54.980> out<00:05:55.160> of<00:05:55.370> the<00:05:55.460> way

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
and that just depresses out of the way

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.110 
and that just depresses out of the way
pull<00:05:56.720> up<00:05:56.870> both<00:05:57.410> sides<00:05:57.920> and<00:05:58.400> you're<00:05:58.820> going<00:05:59.030> to

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310 
a red part squeezing the gray will

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.550 
a red part squeezing the gray will
release<00:06:34.670> off<00:06:34.880> your<00:06:35.030> red<00:06:35.180> safety<00:06:35.480> and<00:06:35.900> that

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
release off your red safety and that

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.130 
release off your red safety and that
allows<00:06:36.980> you<00:06:37.250> then<00:06:37.400> to<00:06:37.460> tuck<00:06:37.970> that<00:06:38.000> in<00:06:38.510> and

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
allows you then to tuck that in and

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
those wheels will make that much snow

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.730 
those wheels will make that much snow
but<00:06:41.640> I<00:06:41.790> just<00:06:42.030> lay<00:06:42.180> that<00:06:42.420> down<00:06:42.720> it<00:06:43.350> gives<00:06:43.590> you<00:06:43.710> a

but I just lay that down it gives you a

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.400 
but I just lay that down it gives you a
better<00:06:44.100> idea<00:06:44.340> of<00:06:44.940> how<00:06:45.060> small<00:06:45.510> that's<00:06:46.050> going<00:06:46.290> to

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
better idea of how small that's going to

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.480 
better idea of how small that's going to
be<00:06:46.560> to<00:06:46.710> go<00:06:46.860> in<00:06:46.920> your<00:06:47.040> car<00:06:48.200> to<00:06:49.200> put<00:06:49.350> back<00:06:49.500> up<00:06:49.740> all
