00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.140
 makeup alone 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.850
 I still wanted to confuse myself for years and years. 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.879

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.760

 I'm very glad to be here. 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.320
 sharing these tips with others is a 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.150
 I work very hard. 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.210
 Love and have a lot of interesting tip 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.130
 And I'll show you 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.960
 the step by step makeup of the bianca 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.180
 after her skin is already clean 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.860
 toned I'll start applying 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.860
 cousin to do the makeup 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.689
 I like to start applying in the team. 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.159
 always in zone t which is where the snow has 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:46.229
 an area of the city and the first helps 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:50.820
 containing oiliness disguises the lines 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.570
 expression and helps to hold more 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.570
 make up 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.899
 I like to apply the first one by hand 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.799
 because I like to feel where it went 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.330
 applied the product where I can not 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.759
 spread it in a more free way 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.340
 contrary has already been applied to the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.890
 My house now I 'm going to apply base on 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.720
 theft that we make up that I usually 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.510
 I like to use two to three 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.830
 base points to make the skin look 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.830
 guiana I'm going to do with two shades 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.519
 at first the first lighter in worship 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.519
 center of the face 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.400
 Health is good, and I do not know 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.370
 now I will apply the darkest tone of the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.939
 base on the sides of the face 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.689
 This tweaks your face and lets you 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:59.560
 more uniform skin so the best is 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.560
 what people 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:15.260
 A very important tip is to apply the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.750
 base with this brush that is the one of the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.750
 that he has the tips lighter 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:24.799
 It's cool to always ba ba 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:28.480
 circular movements and this goes 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:31.669
 spreading the best product on the skin 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.579
 very interesting to not forget 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:37.040
 this part around the nose and the 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.659
 corners of the mouth that are usually part of 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.769
 darkest face 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:44.900
 Now I'll start applying the blush. 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:48.049
 blush just for contour I 'm going to start 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.479
 drawing on her face so I'll give a 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:55.340
 A nice trick on the face is to use 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:59.019
 the middle in the ear to the corner of the mouth then 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.019
 This is where I'm going to apply this blush. 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.230
 after applying the blush in the time I 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.590
 I'm going to do a little bit on my chin to give 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:25.240
 contour of the face and a little in the 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.980
 very subtle temples and blush 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.420
 does not have much color so it creates a blush 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.460
 outline 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.950
 after applying the outline I go 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.200
 Give a little color in the face the bianca 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.500
 that this thing that she color that she 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.240
 loves to get tanned 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.240
 proportional to the height where her skin 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.860
 It is very clear that there are more 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:55.090
 see the time saints or profile itself I 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:58.630
 I love people of the same year and apply eye 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.250
 the blush only on the apple of the face which is a 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.930
 trick really easy than the one who wanted 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.670
 listen a little where to stand up 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.780
 where we will apply is just to give 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.780
 a healthier air 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.980
 the time came for the river as bianca has 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.190
 enough if their children are well 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.550
 and I will apply several layers of 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:33.030
 mask in damage cilia 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:33.030
 I do not know, they do not know. 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:41.789
 The YouTube 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:41.789
 I will not say I do not know
