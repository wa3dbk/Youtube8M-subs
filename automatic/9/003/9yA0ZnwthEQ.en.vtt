at<00:02:00.479> all<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> opened<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.100> after<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> few

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
at all and but I opened it after a few

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.219 
at all and but I opened it after a few
hours<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.180> was<00:02:03.329> hoping<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.719> everyone<00:02:03.990> had

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
hours so I was hoping that everyone had

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.780 
hours so I was hoping that everyone had
probably<00:02:04.500> been<00:02:04.649> done<00:02:04.920> from<00:02:05.159> opening<00:02:05.640> their

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
probably been done from opening their

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.490 
probably been done from opening their
packs<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> little<00:02:06.450> while<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:07.259> do<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
packs for a little while but do you

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.070 
packs for a little while but do you
think<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.879> are<00:02:09.060> different<00:02:09.810> times

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
think that there are different times

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380 
think that there are different times
like<00:02:10.379> peak<00:02:10.649> times<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.760> stuff<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.330> that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
like peak times and and stuff like that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.550 
like peak times and and stuff like that
where<00:02:12.780> you're<00:02:12.959> more<00:02:13.200> like
