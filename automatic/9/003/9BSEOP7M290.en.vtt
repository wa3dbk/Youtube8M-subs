00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.289
 here is the site is like that 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.510
 before showing you how we look 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.610

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.770
 chance enclave where were going the movies 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.770
 popular and so it's on the loonie 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.680
 click on it so there you have 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.449
 really full of ads because the site 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.280
 balloon that kind of stuff 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.350
 Look at the 9.6 was more fakes 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.480
 so no I touch and especially not that 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.650
 that's also the beginning of something 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.700
 to touch is to look in 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.880
 sell-in agree my little top and there 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.680
 it created us new leads to 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.490
 a link so these are the ones that actually 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.600
 fout the direction so see her 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.049
 now that brings me to a link of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.060
 the box 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.080
 so that's the haste to box the values 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.670
 files it allows you to 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.950
 download the movie here is the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.509
 sendai cup top box simon he told me I 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.090
 not say block the road or on iphone 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.579
 so free download so done 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.619
 free download enough ads 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.930
 once again really full of ads 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.060
 but hey there you have to wait for a 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.710
 minute 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.799
 so there it is soon over so once 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.439
 that you waited a minute you 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.030
 have clicked on general and a link of 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.500
 download you click on it and there 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.979
 you will see click here to launch 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.210
 the download does that so there 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.790
 it's weird but again on 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.619
 a pub go back to the window and there it 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.479
 will you launch the movie took place ago 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.160
 full of advertising but here it is 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.720
 websites now on the internet that lives 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.270
 thanks to the pubs so the savannah launch the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.000
 movie 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.950
 So here is the cell years I you 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.230
 disable there because I worked the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.620
 rotate know how to show you in mode 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.420
 landscape 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.860
 so in fact everything depends on your 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.210
 collection it takes time because 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.670
 I do not have a connection that is rarely 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.440
 more here is my son ali ben yes I 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.960
 do not know the movie so here is the room 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.800
 and the film is so we will return 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.300
 on the site 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.500
 So here you are now 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.660
 look at the site so there you can 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.120
 comment and his faults okay I think 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.820
 So that's where it makes you spit safari 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.590
 that's good, otherwise it was hard 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.270
 style to show how to look at a 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.950
 movie streaming on your iphone ipod 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.870
 touch ipad and even on others 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.370
 devices like smartphones and 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.780
 tablets under android or even the psp 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.340
 so if you liked this video 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.020
