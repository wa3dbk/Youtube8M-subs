00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.480
 Hello My name is André Greulich from Romantik Hotel Fürstenhof in Landshut 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.109
 today we can have a beef tenderloin medion 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.789
 The Schleidener bring there located within four to five centimeters large 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.249
 pieces 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.249
 a pink we have soaked in water 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.380
 with these inks now the beef fillet 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.800
 we can make a double knot here, then we will not go this knot 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800
 too easy on 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.130
 Excessive palate is cut off 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 our grill is preheated properly hot 52 straight is wonderful 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.140
 and now so that winter many Vontobel to get a better spread 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.140
 salted and peppered 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.040
 We'll do it with some oil just to fry it 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.040
 not clip 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.790
 Now we lie down on her on the grill and make our first 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.310
 No, we turn the whole thing 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.930
 the second had to 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.230
 to get a real Krehl pattern now 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.250
 we have to turn it 45 degrees again 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.040
 under all those times 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.540
 leave it with a barbecue 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.630
 Andrina s then again 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.009
 it had a nice crew on both sides 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.880
 Now we go to a core temperature filling beef fillet 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.370
 and now put in a place Interrail One low temperature prevails 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.090
 that is slowly at rest 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.600
 Count can pull 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.880
 our industry now lives 30 degrees 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 and we're leaving it up to 57 degrees 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.240
 we do not have in the desired content or our actual 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.510
 Customer of the Knipping of the many once again the left and right correctly 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.310
 hot when frying to get a coded outside temperature 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.549
 Just cut the thumb now 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.059
 and now we can get the beef fillet 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:29.059
 nice to cut open Gün and then we recognize 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.579
 Ours are also prompt 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.459
 as it is only nice and juicy inside and had to roar the beautiful crew 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.739
 I enjoy playing after cooking
