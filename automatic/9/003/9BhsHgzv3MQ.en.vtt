 learn how to make a refrigerator 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.519
 it's a trick something to con that 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.960
 it's an archaic thing its date of the 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.730
 prehistory 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.809
 so here we have so I spend a 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.059
 box it's a first point in the earth 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.279
 cooked that is there but bigger than the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.359
 second who is there we agree you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.820

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.250
 well in the center below before 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.779
 insert it we have the second in the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.430
 first you put a layer of sand 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.559
 in the background by then we were pretty much 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.370
 close to two centimeters of sand 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.899
 then you insert the second pot into 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.940
 terracotta always after you 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:48.059
 fill every turn of the second skin with 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.620
 sand until here okay then a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.770
 After 1000 sand between the two 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.469
 pots or put water you habib is at 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.140
 saturation the sand once the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.570
 sand is soaked to saturation where you 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.390
 take this wet cloth and if a sheet 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.220
 feindra serve I mean any case 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.520
 take out the evenings a little bit 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.810
 had been over and you go 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.210
 see that the temperature will go down 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.000
 to that of a fridge it is towards 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.710
 4 degrees is pretty amazing but I 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.869
 I'll try this at home if you had 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.340
