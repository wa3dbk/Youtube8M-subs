00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:09.340
 this is the source box battery grip with 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:13.710
 the designation bg for battery grip 1 f 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.360
 and that is for the k 9 550 600 and 650 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.790
 dispute riekel performs so delivered 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.579
 So again the unity of the concept 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.230
 itself and usually historical 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.790
 Chapters on contacts give 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.860
 made and then we have again 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.700
 such a container for normal 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.110
 Batteries the aaa batteries and the man 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.820
 Of course, as a battery can use 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.829
 also just got started here 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.480
 battery compartment the couple themselves middle 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.769
 open with such a pin you turn 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.309
 just to the side then you can do that 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.100
 appearance 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.879
 So you see two here 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.039
 I would sanctuaries times as the 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.329
 for the battery so with one works 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.679
 it is also possible to make two 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.739
 gets the whole team accordingly 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:53.649
 longer the game again turned on zack 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.510
 and you close that with this 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.519
 Just move the cadastre up and back 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.260
 then it is fixed I think that one 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.899
 show you how to use the battery van 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.310
 the canon I have brought here as 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.720
 model a 550d and that is not synonymous 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.150
 big thing now here in the battery grip 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.550
 you have to set it for her first 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.900
 the camera on the open normally 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.340
 is out of the way of others 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.290
 possibly and then contain 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.730
 Give her this power by simply going here 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.350
 It's easy to pull off then you can 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.750
 take this fund and then you bet 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.780
 Just here the breeders are here 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.130
 Just be careful at the beginning 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.110
 not just raw violence that fits too 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.320
 anything but usa not directly one can 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.940
 so still very gentle and material already 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.140
 to use the whole country is one 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.510
 Road bike down to it 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.100
 find here for the tripod thread under 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.680
 the camera you go here just in the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.360
 direction and for those not 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.520
 Know on the left or right of the effort 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.470
 this is once again beckons in 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.940
 turning direction and that's it 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.020
 All right then we have to go 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.890
 still in acute make 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.090
 they just remember me 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.219
 then turn the lever over the battery 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.049
 And just put it on a battery you can 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.670
 here in each case only one battery to 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.259
 example, it does not matter 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.359
 Whichever subject I always take here 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.319
 the fold what the outside is so there 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.110
 where the pin is 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.510
 the battery with these contacts please so 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.370
 so do not use that 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.200
 not at all back so there must be 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.000
 here in front with the contacts just like that 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.549
 once inserted and then can 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.080
 you click with a light touch 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.459
 simply attach and then he is 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.049
 right in there so as I said the battery 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.420
 if it's only with the contacts so 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.799
 what does fancy notice that means 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.799
 it does not work otherwise 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.829
 that one does not exclude it then because of 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.239
 the battery has been destroyed does not have to 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.280
 I can be broken because of it but so 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.500
 is just easier then just behind 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.690
 again the high and now the whole 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.730
 Field of application of the ko only briefly in the summer 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.220
 is that can never have so much what 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.510
 on it is malama sucker and now do 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.510
 let's take the camera up to the top 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.040
 logically, the display works too 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.549
 right on how you look down here 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.140
 of course, a shutdown button 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.239
 Battery handle yourself as you see who 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.799
 has the function that you just have to say 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.819
 Not only that is often the case 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.049
 it has nothing to do with the unit 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.359
 works to do camera 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.250
 only then just go all the way 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.450
 keys here at the camera are not us 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.530
 then turned off 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.599
 So it can be that one, however 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.099
 rather then once you do not want 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.750
 landscape would not be a portrait format 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.340
 I want to be able to handle everything like that 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.680
 of course with the ball of your hand on the 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.940
 whole look can pay elements 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.530
 So here are the same elements as well 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.880
 always camera up here are just 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.290
 especially for that when I'm at the 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.359
 would like to shoot upright 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.079
 it is seen that their bombs well and 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.180
 safe in the hand 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.919
 and if you just hold this one 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.840
 then want to turn on the function 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.639
 you can also press the button here and 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.169
 then to this whole button in front and that 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.849
 will be here, of course, if the 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.349
 individual functions, too 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.700
 work show where the same 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.500
 for explanation so here is not the 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.450
 camera on and off but has 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.069
 just the function says iris battery 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.840
 myself so now I have in epic 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.630
 width probably explains more likely 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.889
 So not unnecessary and now 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.870
 Let's just take a look at the individual 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:55.940
 functions on the display 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.989
 I think that's enough for her to do that 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.549
 So can live then they can to 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.019
 one has the display and at one 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.610
 down here are the functional buttons i 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.280
 So just be here now 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.990
 the functional heads are the units 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.730
 activate and become easy as to 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.290
 example turn up here on the wheel 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.210
 and you see on the display also raised 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.680
 that has the function at the 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.330
 front here follow the wheel too 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.900
 so here is the blind now 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.459
 adjusted 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.019
 Here you can see the fans 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.160
 is that what the 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.320
 human in the video is also really doing here 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.750
 works then we ever have 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.150
 function movement here the possibilities 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.560
 that we are here for example now 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.840
 So you can choose autofocus point 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.910
 hold down here now and on sides 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.950
 which then just stop here, too 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.390
 so they look just stop the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.230
 different fields can be found here 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.300
 be selected 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.400
 just as you have since then without synonymous 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.350
 Battery grip is known in the 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.060
 also here in portrait format and 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.490
 Of course, here we have the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.440
 possibility that we will go here now 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.880
 For example , you can hire the commuters 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.880
 I already showed him that here 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.190
 see the exposure correction here as well 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.560
 everything works wonderfully you see 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.150
 So everything is wonderful if you have 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.200
 just then shoot in portrait format 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.790
 would like to and not always rumst again 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.350
 spend hours here with the keys here 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.550
 Rear are then set as 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.229
 or so everything is upside down 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.550
 Of course, everything is right here 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.830
 then described for portrait 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.970
 that's the way it is 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.310
 much tells them from the start 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.919
 cake is her whole country easy 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.720
 mounted that was her here now 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.390
 Battery grip lock is the packaging 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.770
 we do a lot personally with that 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.750
 remind us again at the beginning here 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.130
 with this rail for the normal 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.540
 Battery you can do or stop 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.580
 just the rechargeable batteries 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.680
 logically also a cost-saving 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.690
 variant and of course that also belongs 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.100
 a little human knowledge 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.360
 operation manual and again the 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.210
 individual functions are explained here 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.010
 in english language with cooperation yes 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.330
 now it is up to you what she is beautiful 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.770
 handle a battery is just level 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.110
 the fact that he is very high quality 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.520
 processed so he sits down it 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.720
 not about how negative in the camera 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.910
 that you think that is now 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.590
 somehow in inferior plastic or 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.010
 Plastic was held by the camera 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.720
 the same 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.010
 So you see better here too 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.810
 I can not show her completely 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.450
 wonderful klose made was already at the end 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.530
 are they forgetting something and of course 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.210
 on the battery itself too 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.169
 tripod thread very important to you 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.940
 So you do not have to 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.710
 who disconnect from battery grip if they 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.750
 then somehow again 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.890
 want to put the camera tripod and 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.900
 of course here for the fortification 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.250
 God always gives me the opportunity 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.140
 that you have a bend here 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.970
 can go through and the whole then completely 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.150
 can normally wear something like that 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.190
 usually know here yes 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.500
 the two bad ones where one has just now 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.300
 Here then that was able to do 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.260
 but if you have the battery and know in 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.460
 I usually want to 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.750
 much more vertical format recordings 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.310
 then you can strap the same way 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.990
 fix that camera so you can 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.940
 dangling in front of the building or on one 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.010
 side depending on what makes you stop me 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.420
 So up here we have the eye for the
