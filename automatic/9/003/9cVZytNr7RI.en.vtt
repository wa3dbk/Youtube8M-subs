00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.390
 hello in this lesson for this 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.549
 experimenting with the image 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.349
 to make an imitation of it 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.119
 pencil drawing 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.449
 try working with the same image 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.400
 which we corrected 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.509
 plastic broker 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.509
 i started brothers the layers palette 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.819
 we need to create in duplicate 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:27.869
 by layer 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.289
 can save speech key kontrol jay on 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.619
 keyboard 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.469
 duplicate should provide a 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.079
 really can be through the menu 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.340
 image 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.830
 correction 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.160
 investments 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.230
 memorize hot keys 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.800
 rustling contour mind 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.519
 further for doubles word kontron life 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.550
 on keyboard 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.740
 3 ct on this layer is necessary 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.190
 invest sieve 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.810
 so that the dark areas become light settled 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.560
 dark ie swap 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.190
 for this also income menu and 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.300
 Images 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.429
 correction 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.940
 or version 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.580
 can also be remembered speech 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.920
 the keys are contra and their 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.780
 and there is 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.860
 now for this layer should apply 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.610
 blending mode 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.230
 on the layering palette, masonry tests 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.530
 m 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.530
 choose linear clarifier 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.670
 the whole area turns white 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.190
 given now to this layer 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.159
 and we applied the blend mode 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.610
 should use chechetov 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.150
 menu filter 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.160
 for example blur render ape 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.120
 choosing the seagull 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.160
 image is manifested 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.030
 here everything now depends on the radius 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.210
 of course 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.990
 the forest the more appears 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.360
 picture 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.749
 less so 

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:51.720
 more on the rally only contour 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.060
 sometimes choose what averages like money and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060
 mixer pencil drawing 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.509
 choose to your taste and quality 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.790
 vis a citro triza solutions 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.579
 I have become something like this 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.350
 but Kiev 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.420
 further at this stage in principle if 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.220
 The result can be satisfied with mbask 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.299
 to finish 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.299
 you can also apply the border a little bit 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.829
 these are the touches 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.040
 that is, an imitation of such Cossacks 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.309
 patterned 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.509
 for this old man the same layer and apply 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.519
 once again filter 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.519
 touches like airbrush 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.759
 it focuses only on the strokes 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:33.429
 since basically the image itself on 

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:35.419
 special not visible 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:36.919
 There astrophysics applied 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.179
 specific conditions 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.779
 on the right side of the window we can choose 90 and the temple 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.959
 and just for their name 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.959
 experiment on your taste boats 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.369
 now we see 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.729
 Here are such a sweeping that else 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:56.299
 and some pictures 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.720
 it will be very interesting to look good 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.960
 at this stage you can fix 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.960
 image snapshots in the stories palette 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.439
 I remind the whole palette is a menu like but 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:08.529
 the decision is not open to you 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.369
 in the story create a snapshot click on 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:13.939
 camera button at the bottom palette 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.290
 and we can compare 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.959
 barrage 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.869
 with our drawing 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:21.660
 if you think that drawing 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.830
 quite faded you can give it 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.379
 contrasted with this correction 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.589
 such apply a correction layer 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:31.059
 that is, go to the layers palette 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.759
 liza palette click black white 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:34.689
 circle 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.900
 and choose critics directors for example by 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.269
 level 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.480
 if the histogram we need 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.729
 I nevertheless 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.340
 understand what leg disease 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.029
 about to the end broke 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:49.909
 basically you can leave to your taste 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.909
 he is pretty where on this level 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.699
 the woman became more contrast 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.619
 again and record the story 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.319
 camera 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.619
 and compare 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.049
 first shot 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.829
 and second 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.259
 second half with what 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:10.249
 also if you want your image 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.009
 make 7 0 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.229
 Well, first of all, you can paint 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:15.669
 this ramos see a lot of 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.449
 other lessons 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:18.680
 attacked the elderly 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.109
 if you condition them 1 uncheck 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.800
 that is, the first duplicate to 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.620
 made black and white 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.110
 so images automatically 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.740
 come here and you are so interesting 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.319
 story 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.309
 The main thing is that in our photos 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:34.759
 especially in the background there were not many small ones 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.379
 details then these images 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.909
 fairly uniform background 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.309
 or you can notify yourself on 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:42.300
 their homeland 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.530
 Czech forum I will give you a few more 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.539
 examples 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.550
 how recently their tags look on others 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.960
 their considerations 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.439
 eg 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:54.439
 architecture 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.559
 or other photos 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:01.849
 as for the elements 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.749
 architecture 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:06.499
 there is another for them 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:08.990
 way imitation of pencil drawing 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.460
 but make a lot of some small five 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.659
 extra details 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.080
 not always using a filter means 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.529
 leaned which we used can 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.829
 achieve naturally not imitation of a pencil 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:23.529
 so you can try another one 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:25.150
 the way 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.790
 for that i'm on my political and in 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.120
 eliminate visibility to the layers that I have 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.180
 previously created 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.990
 her hit her so they 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.219
 no, they didn't interfere 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:37.129
 but about to show the carp on this 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:38.479
 image 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.169
 the beginning of us is identical 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.939
 that is, we create a duplicate contra the best 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:44.809
 next to ten in the evening 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:46.159
 try the hotkeys already 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.669
 it's 6 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.319
 he filed the street 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.319
 started all were equal contour jay 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.589
 applying investments in the summer besides a 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.089
 if on the keyboard 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.400
 and now to our mind roll 2 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.490
 apply overlay mode to palette 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.589
 layers 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:08.580
 same lines not saint 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.889
 instead of invoice talk about 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.589
 leaned try to use another 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.249
 filter 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:16.819
 other minimum 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:19.319
 this is purely technical used but 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.729
 according to legend 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.699
 worked quite well 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:27.159
 also only contours are trusted 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.119
 born in pixels render us the thickness 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:31.559
 our lines 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.649
 that is, the larger the radius the thicker they are 

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:36.649
 there will be lines 

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:40.460
 I put a radius of 1 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.449
 when you press the Kiev highway a lot more 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.839
 turn pale 

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:46.939
 now after this step we can also 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.349
 apply 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:50.580
 nuts using sweat thread 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.810
 what's the bar give contrast so 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.520
 roshchin 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.439
 on the layers palette 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.319
 adjustment layer 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.599
 level 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:02.689
 and here we are black enough 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:04.689
 bag move 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:07.919
 before the end of the space 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:08.759
 here is such 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:09.930
 same interesting way 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.449
 they are a little different 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:14.629
 seriously tack like and looks like this 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:16.889
 way 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:18.939
 here 

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:20.680
 more and more clearly 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.280
 as always, don’t see which way 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.440
 exactly on your images will be 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.030
 look more interesting 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.249
 therefore allowed 

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:28.989
