00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
can see and we actually find the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.200 
can see and we actually find the
cheapest<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.399> sec<00:00:53.610> when<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:53.940> she's<00:00:54.120> about

cheapest in a sec when what she's about
600<00:00:54.930> pounds<00:00:55.170> i<00:00:55.230> think<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.500> was<00:00:55.590> one<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.949> for

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
600 pounds i think there was one up for

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.510 
600 pounds i think there was one up for
six<00:00:56.520> hundred<00:00:56.699> coins<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.360> guys<00:00:57.539> will<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:58.100> in<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
six hundred coins you guys will see in a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.069 
six hundred coins you guys will see in a
second<00:01:00.059> i<00:01:00.149> think<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.690> ahead<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.930> pick

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
second i think we do go ahead and pick

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.959 
second i think we do go ahead and pick
that<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.559> up<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.399> after<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.820> that's

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that one up and then after that that's

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.420 
that one up and then after that that's
quite<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> few<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> 650<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.890> if<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.189> think<00:01:05.369> about

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
quite a few of 650 so if you think about

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.160 
quite a few of 650 so if you think about
that<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.820> could<00:01:06.000> probably<00:01:06.150> sell<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.659> eyes<00:01:06.960> on

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that we could probably sell all eyes on

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.980 
that we could probably sell all eyes on
for<00:01:07.470> 650<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.610> see<00:01:08.729> 1<00:01:08.880> 600<00:01:09.510> right<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:09.900> we

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
for 650 you can see 1 600 right there we

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.270 
for 650 you can see 1 600 right there we
can<00:01:10.140> probably<00:01:10.320> sell<00:01:10.560> each<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.920> every<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
can probably sell each and every one of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.030 
can probably sell each and every one of
them<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:12.090> 650<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.140> bought<00:01:13.380> them<00:01:13.590> so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
them on for 650 if we bought them so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.380 
them on for 650 if we bought them so
you're<00:01:14.159> depending<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:14.760> profit<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.240> want

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you're depending on what profit we want

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
you're depending on what profit we want
to<00:01:15.450> make<00:01:15.600> maybe<00:01:15.869> 100<00:01:16.500> coins<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.340> can

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
to make maybe 100 coins is so we can

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.020 
to make maybe 100 coins is so we can
kind<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.299> pick<00:01:18.450> them<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.020> 500<00:01:19.740> coins

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
kind of pick them all up for 500 coins

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.300 
kind of pick them all up for 500 coins

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
one x 5 4 450 so we could have made 200

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.770 
one x 5 4 450 so we could have made 200
coins<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.600> just

it seemed the season you can pick up
more<00:02:36.510> because<00:02:36.689> they'll<00:02:36.900> probably<00:02:37.109> go<00:02:37.439> down<00:02:37.620> to

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
more because they'll probably go down to

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.289 
more because they'll probably go down to
like<00:02:37.950> three<00:02:37.980> hundred<00:02:38.340> cones<00:02:38.730> maybe<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.150> little

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
like three hundred cones maybe a little

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.479 
like three hundred cones maybe a little
bit<00:02:39.480> loredana<00:02:40.139> will<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.769> described<00:02:41.189> value

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
bit loredana will be described value

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.339 
bit loredana will be described value
pretty<00:02:41.760> much<00:02:41.939> nobody<00:02:42.480> will<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.930> selling<00:02:43.230> them

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
pretty much nobody will be selling them

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.020 
pretty much nobody will be selling them
on<00:02:43.469> you<00:02:43.920> can<00:02:44.040> see<00:02:44.189> again<00:02:44.549> you<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:44.760> want<00:02:45.000> to

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
on you can see again you just want to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.720 
on you can see again you just want to
check<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.450> healing<00:02:45.780> prices<00:02:46.260> same<00:02:47.129> thing<00:02:47.459> goes

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
check the healing prices same thing goes

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.970 
check the healing prices same thing goes
for<00:02:48.239> this<00:02:48.689> one<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.109> see<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.680> across

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
for this one you can see going across

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.740 
for this one you can see going across
check<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> Chiefs<00:02:50.970> by<00:02:51.180> now<00:02:51.389> I<00:02:51.420> think<00:02:51.629> it's

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
check the Chiefs by now I think it's

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.379 
check the Chiefs by now I think it's
about<00:02:51.810> 750<00:02:52.799> or<00:02:53.069> 700<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.909> can<00:02:54.030> see<00:02:54.180> right<00:02:54.209> now

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
about 750 or 700 you can see right now

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.289 
about 750 or 700 you can see right now
and<00:02:54.750> we'll<00:02:55.560> see<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.889> might<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.189> 650<00:02:56.819> in<00:02:56.970> and

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
and we'll see it might be 650 in and

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.879 
and we'll see it might be 650 in and
second<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.810> think<00:02:58.019> there<00:02:58.139> are<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.470> three<00:02:58.799> or

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
second I think there are like three or

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.349 
second I think there are like three or
four<00:02:58.919> 650<00:02:59.639> so<00:02:59.730> that's<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.000> price<00:03:00.209> you're

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
four 650 so that's the price you're

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.490 
four 650 so that's the price you're
going<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.599> be<00:03:00.659> able<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.900> sell<00:03:01.079> you<00:03:01.200> as<00:03:01.349> I<00:03:01.439> know

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
going to be able to sell you as I know

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.770 
going to be able to sell you as I know
you<00:03:01.709> can<00:03:01.859> see<00:03:02.010> three<00:03:02.340> there<00:03:02.549> 650<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:03.659> that's

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
you can see three there 650 so that's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.909 
you can see three there 650 so that's
the<00:03:03.900> price<00:03:04.049> you're<00:03:04.139> going<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.349> be<00:03:04.409> also<00:03:04.500> yours

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:04.919 
the price you're going to be also yours

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.589 
the price you're going to be also yours
danna<00:03:05.129> so<00:03:05.579> depending<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:05.970> what<00:03:06.209> profit<00:03:06.540> you
