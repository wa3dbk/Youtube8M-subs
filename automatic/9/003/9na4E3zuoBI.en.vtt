has<00:03:15.120> one<00:03:15.540> little<00:03:15.780> part<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.470> verse<00:03:16.680> up<00:03:16.920> there

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
has one little part of a verse up there

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.590 
has one little part of a verse up there
and<00:03:17.310> then<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.430> whole<00:03:17.730> lot<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:17.910> someone<00:03:18.360> wrote

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
and then a whole lot that someone wrote

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.360 
and then a whole lot that someone wrote
about<00:03:19.050> something<00:03:19.260> else<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:19.920> we<00:03:20.069> just<00:03:20.250> have

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
about something else but we just have

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.490 
about something else but we just have
the<00:03:20.489> Bible<00:03:20.850> as<00:03:20.940> kind<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.269> decoration<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:22.380> our

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
the Bible as kind of a decoration to our

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.940 
the Bible as kind of a decoration to our
books

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
books

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.580 
books
another<00:03:23.670> way<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:23.910> we<00:03:24.150> misuse<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.840> Bible<00:03:25.230> it

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
another way that we misuse the Bible it

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.170 
another way that we misuse the Bible it
is<00:03:25.769> by<00:03:25.980> breaking<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.580> up<00:03:26.670> into<00:03:26.790> little

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
is by breaking it up into little

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.630 
is by breaking it up into little
fragments<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.900> little<00:03:28.350> story<00:03:28.709> here<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.370> a

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
fragments a little story here and a

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.670 
fragments a little story here and a
little<00:03:29.790> parable<00:03:30.209> over<00:03:30.600> there<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.320> oftentimes

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
little parable over there so oftentimes

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.470 
little parable over there so oftentimes
for<00:03:32.070> example<00:03:32.489> we'll<00:03:32.610> quote<00:03:32.790> one<00:03:33.000> of<00:03:33.030> Jesus

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
for example we'll quote one of Jesus

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.420 
for example we'll quote one of Jesus
parables<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:34.019> ignore<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.980> if<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.190> look<00:03:35.340> at

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
parables and ignore that if you look at

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.350 
parables and ignore that if you look at
the<00:03:35.549> text<00:03:35.790> itself

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
the text itself

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.630 
the text itself
he<00:03:36.690> told<00:03:36.930> three<00:03:37.200> parables<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.860> row<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.310> they

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
he told three parables in a row and they

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.009 
he told three parables in a row and they
have<00:03:38.820> something<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.209> do<00:03:39.450> with<00:03:39.600> each<00:03:39.660> other

generation of reading the Bible alone

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.690 
generation of reading the Bible alone

rather than in the community of God so

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.430 
rather than in the community of God so
how<00:05:13.850> should<00:05:14.180> we<00:05:14.360> approach<00:05:14.480> the<00:05:14.930> text

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
how should we approach the text

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.900 
how should we approach the text
well<00:05:15.740> imagine<00:05:15.980> with<00:05:16.280> me<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.580> you've<00:05:16.670> never

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
well imagine with me that you've never

well imagine with me that you've never
seen<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.330> Bible<00:05:17.660> before<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:18.200> all<00:05:18.860> those

seen the Bible before and all those
things<00:05:19.250> that<00:05:19.370> we've<00:05:19.520> added<00:05:19.820> to<00:05:20.000> it<00:05:20.270> over<00:05:20.360> the

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
things that we've added to it over the

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.940 
things that we've added to it over the
years<00:05:20.780> really<00:05:21.110> to<00:05:21.350> try<00:05:21.530> to<00:05:21.560> make<00:05:21.740> it<00:05:21.860> more

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
years really to try to make it more

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.620 
years really to try to make it more
usable<00:05:22.220> sometimes<00:05:23.060> gets<00:05:23.270> in<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:23.480> way<00:05:23.570> so

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
usable sometimes gets in the way so

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.210 
usable sometimes gets in the way so
let's<00:05:23.750> take<00:05:24.020> all<00:05:24.170> those<00:05:24.290> things<00:05:24.560> out<00:05:24.770> instead

let's take all those things out instead

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.920 
let's take all those things out instead
of<00:05:25.310> two<00:05:25.490> columns<00:05:25.910> let's<00:05:26.060> make<00:05:26.240> it<00:05:26.360> one<00:05:26.570> column

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
of two columns let's make it one column

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.270 
of two columns let's make it one column
instead<00:05:27.170> of<00:05:27.260> those<00:05:27.380> chapters<00:05:27.890> and<00:05:28.220> verses

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.610 
instead of those chapters and verses
that<00:05:28.790> dividing<00:05:29.360> it<00:05:29.450> up<00:05:29.510> that<00:05:29.720> way<00:05:29.900> let's<00:05:30.410> keep

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
that dividing it up that way let's keep

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.260 
that dividing it up that way let's keep
it<00:05:30.800> in<00:05:30.920> paragraphs<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:31.670> let's<00:05:31.820> keep<00:05:31.970> it<00:05:32.180> in

it in paragraphs and let's keep it in

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.670 
it in paragraphs and let's keep it in
letters<00:05:32.630> and<00:05:32.660> let's<00:05:32.870> keep<00:05:32.990> it<00:05:33.170> in<00:05:33.260> whole<00:05:33.440> books

frames out reality the Bible begins in

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.280 
frames out reality the Bible begins in
the<00:05:49.790> beginning<00:05:50.210> God<00:05:50.390> created<00:05:50.420> the<00:05:50.930> heavens<00:05:51.170> in

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
the beginning God created the heavens in

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.890 
the beginning God created the heavens in
the<00:05:51.380> earth<00:05:51.500> it<00:05:51.980> ends<00:05:52.490> when<00:05:52.880> God<00:05:53.120> is<00:05:53.270> recreating

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
the earth it ends when God is recreating

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.320 
the earth it ends when God is recreating
the<00:05:54.350> new<00:05:54.620> heavens<00:05:55.040> and<00:05:55.100> the<00:05:55.220> new<00:05:55.550> earth<00:05:55.700> so<00:05:56.300> you

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
the new heavens and the new earth so you

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.210 
the new heavens and the new earth so you
have<00:05:56.630> the<00:05:56.810> story<00:05:57.170> of<00:05:57.290> the<00:05:57.380> world<00:05:57.740> from

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
have the story of the world from

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
beginning to end and if you start

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.660 
beginning to end and if you start
fleshing<00:06:00.530> it<00:06:00.740> out<00:06:00.830> just<00:06:01.070> a<00:06:01.130> little<00:06:01.160> bit<00:06:01.520> more

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
fleshing it out just a little bit more

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.160 
fleshing it out just a little bit more
you<00:06:01.880> see<00:06:02.090> some<00:06:02.330> things<00:06:02.510> that<00:06:02.660> hold<00:06:02.780> the<00:06:02.900> story

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
you see some things that hold the story

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.020 
you see some things that hold the story
together<00:06:03.320> so<00:06:04.010> the<00:06:04.130> first<00:06:04.400> part<00:06:04.610> of<00:06:04.730> the<00:06:04.820> story

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
together so the first part of the story

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.880 
together so the first part of the story
deals<00:06:05.240> with<00:06:05.450> the<00:06:05.570> whole<00:06:05.780> world<00:06:06.050> and<00:06:06.410> then<00:06:06.770> it

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
deals with the whole world and then it

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.340 
deals with the whole world and then it
locks<00:06:07.070> in<00:06:07.340> on<00:06:07.430> one<00:06:07.790> nation<00:06:08.270> of<00:06:08.390> Israel<00:06:08.840> but<00:06:08.990> the

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
locks in on one nation of Israel but the

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.290 
locks in on one nation of Israel but the
point<00:06:09.590> of<00:06:09.740> that<00:06:09.860> nation<00:06:10.310> is<00:06:10.430> to<00:06:10.670> bring<00:06:11.210> a

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
point of that nation is to bring a

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.840 
point of that nation is to bring a
blessing<00:06:11.480> to<00:06:11.870> the<00:06:12.260> whole<00:06:12.290> world<00:06:12.770> and<00:06:13.070> so<00:06:13.460> after

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
blessing to the whole world and so after

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.060 
blessing to the whole world and so after
Christ<00:06:14.180> comes<00:06:14.540> and<00:06:14.750> the<00:06:14.840> Spirit<00:06:15.260> comes<00:06:15.410> to<00:06:15.950> his

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
Christ comes and the Spirit comes to his
