 Hello, how about, this time we're going 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.080
 to install the nintendo 10 emulator 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.900
 that already works at 100 in all 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.009
 good androids in which I have tried 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.349
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.389
 download the video and they are going to put these 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.920
 three files to the root of your sd or if 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.630
 have some this cell with the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.939
 internal storage have to go to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.789
 this memory now let's go to 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.330
 emulator this one has to this 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.700
 they have to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.329
 to give laws when the initial we give 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.149
 in the games and then look for the rom 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.019
 and whoever is in this found him 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.019
 da shows the game 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.009

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.900
 summer 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.730

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.820

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.620

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.310

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.150
 I am also going to leave you a page 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.460
 so that several roms are downloaded 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.200

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.200
