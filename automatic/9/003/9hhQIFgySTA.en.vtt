00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:02.540
 d 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.540
 There 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.779
 we also talk today about safe driving 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.279
 listen to the recovery you recommend lorenzo satisfied with the driving school 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.800
 safe Sardinia 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.930
 today we see how to use the commands of the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.930
 pedals of our vehicle 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.370
 how to use the pedal board 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.840
 the pedals of our vehicle is composed of three petals 2 dosers of 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.550
 speed is a clutch with the right foot we use the dosers of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.240
 speed the speed dosers should be used with extreme caution not 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.240
 only the buttons are not pressed down 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.380
 let's see how to press the accelerator on the brake 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.090
 the heel of the right foot should rest on the hull of ours 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.320
 vehicle in the middle between the accelerator pedal and the brake pedal 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.800
 only the tip and heel is moved, the tip of ours is used as an anchor 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.410
 right foot softly picks up the accelerator to increase the 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.550
 speed no brake to decrease speed left foot invents 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.250
 try pressing the clutch 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.580
 the clutch is firmly pressed down until it is gently released 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.009
 of fundamental importance is the pedal 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.009
 positioned next to the clutch 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.430
 important the position of the left foot to the rest that must be 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.020
 positioned on the special pedanina 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.289
 so as to give us maximum anchorage when cornering 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:16.469
 when cornering we have to push on the power pedal so that ours 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.469
 body remains perfectly still possible 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:37.469
 in the left corners we can take advantage of the left knee 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.469
 resting on the upright in the right-hand bends we lean against it 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.989
 on the console of our vehicle 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.279
 on the road safety front, for today it's all waiting for you 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.700
 next Saturday's episode 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.379
 we will talk about the trajectory of life
