00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
a-string believe it standard tuning here

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.950 
a-string believe it standard tuning here
and<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.659> get<00:01:07.810> it<00:01:07.960> started<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.330> best<00:01:10.540> way<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:10.750> do

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
and to get it started the best way to do

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.700 
and to get it started the best way to do
this<00:01:11.140> is<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.800> pick<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.070> open<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:14.409> then<00:01:14.500> we're

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
this is to pick the open and then we're

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.670 
this is to pick the open and then we're
gonna<00:01:14.830> hammer<00:01:15.040> on<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.370> front<00:01:15.610> three

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
gonna hammer on the front three

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.410 
gonna hammer on the front three
and<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.190> hammer<00:01:17.370> onto<00:01:17.520> fret<00:01:17.820> 7

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
and the hammer onto fret 7

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.580 
and the hammer onto fret 7
and<00:01:19.540> then<00:01:19.630> with<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.840> tapping<00:01:20.290> hand<00:01:20.409> we're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
and then with the tapping hand we're

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.980 
and then with the tapping hand we're
going<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.830> fret<00:01:21.040> 12

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
going to fret 12

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.740 
going to fret 12
and<00:01:23.500> then<00:01:23.619> you're<00:01:23.740> gonna<00:01:23.860> pull<00:01:24.640> off<00:01:24.820> all<00:01:25.540> of

and then you're gonna pull off all of

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.719 
and then you're gonna pull off all of
that<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:26.259> it's<00:01:26.409> like<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.530> roll<00:01:26.829> going<00:01:27.250> up<00:01:27.460> and

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
that so it's like a roll going up and

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.260 
that so it's like a roll going up and
back<00:01:28.299> so<00:01:28.810> it's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.719 

people

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
people

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
people

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
you're gonna do that four times so it's

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.300

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
up here on the neck so you have some

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.670 
up here on the neck so you have some
stability<00:01:46.800> with<00:01:46.950> your<00:01:47.130> tapping<00:01:47.670> hand<00:01:48.680> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
stability with your tapping hand you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.990 
stability with your tapping hand you
don't<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.980> to<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.340> that's<00:01:50.490> how<00:01:50.700> most<00:01:50.850> people

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
don't have to but that's how most people

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.390 
don't have to but that's how most people
do<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.830> want<00:01:52.980> to<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.280> right

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
do that and you want to have the right

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.850 
do that and you want to have the right
control<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.750> volume<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.530> you're<00:01:55.680> coming

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
control and the volume as you're coming

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:11.420 
control and the volume as you're coming
down<00:01:55.980> on<00:01:56.280> these<00:01:56.340> taps<00:01:56.670> so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.800 

and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.990 

so<00:02:15.810> what<00:02:16.079> I<00:02:16.110> did<00:02:16.200> was<00:02:16.439> four<00:02:16.709> times<00:02:16.980> on<00:02:17.219> the<00:02:17.250> 3/7

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
so what I did was four times on the 3/7

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.809 
so what I did was four times on the 3/7
tap<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:18.750> 12<00:02:19.019> then<00:02:19.799> I<00:02:19.829> moved<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.250> left<00:02:20.549> hand

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
tap in the 12 then I moved the left hand

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.520 
tap in the 12 then I moved the left hand
or<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> freighting<00:02:21.599> hand<00:02:21.810> up<00:02:22.049> a<00:02:22.260> whole-step

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
or the freighting hand up a whole-step

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.740 
or the freighting hand up a whole-step
to<00:02:23.010> five<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.519> nine<00:02:23.700> did<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> same<00:02:24.299> thing<00:02:24.510> four

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.899 
to five and nine did the same thing four
times<00:02:24.780> they're<00:02:25.319> all<00:02:26.099> so<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.489> I'm<00:02:26.640> great

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
times they're all so it's like I'm great
