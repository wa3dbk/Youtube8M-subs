the<00:01:05.250> bird<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.939> road<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.299> think<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.570> 89<00:01:06.990> or

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the bird on the road I think on 89 or

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.320 
the bird on the road I think on 89 or
city<00:01:07.560> tonight<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.640> she<00:01:09.570> came<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.080> he<00:01:10.229> came<00:01:10.470> in

with<00:01:12.330> her<00:01:12.810> his<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.380> wing<00:01:13.619> drooping<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> we

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
with her his right wing drooping and we

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.800 
with her his right wing drooping and we
thought<00:01:14.790> at<00:01:15.030> first<00:01:15.299> maybe<00:01:15.420> there<00:01:15.689> was<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
thought at first maybe there was a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.740 
thought at first maybe there was a
broken<00:01:15.990> bone<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> turned<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
broken bone but it turned out that the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.859 
broken bone but it turned out that the
skin<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.830> armpit<00:01:20.340> area<00:01:20.540> under<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> wing

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
skin in the armpit area under the wing

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.429 
skin in the armpit area under the wing
was<00:01:22.140> actually<00:01:22.500> torn<00:01:22.799> open<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:24.140> we<00:01:25.140> ended<00:01:25.320> up

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
was actually torn open and we ended up

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.399 
was actually torn open and we ended up
treating<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.689> putting<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.020> bandage

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
treating that you know putting a bandage

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.980 
treating that you know putting a bandage
on<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.009> disinfecting<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:31.970> eventually

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
on it and disinfecting it and eventually

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.719 
on it and disinfecting it and eventually
the<00:01:33.990> wound<00:01:34.259> started<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> grow<00:01:34.950> mold<00:01:35.220> which<00:01:35.610> was

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the wound started to grow mold which was

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.090 
the wound started to grow mold which was
really<00:01:35.939> strange<00:01:36.409> we<00:01:37.409> treated<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:37.979> an

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
really strange we treated it with an

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.280 
really strange we treated it with an
antifungal<00:01:38.579> medication<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.479> first<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.079> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
antifungal medication at first and that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.499 
antifungal medication at first and that
didn't<00:01:40.560> work<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.759> started<00:01:42.000> using<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.299> tea

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
didn't work so we started using a tea

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.030 
didn't work so we started using a tea
tree<00:01:42.750> oil<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.350> actually<00:01:43.710> cleared<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
tree oil and that actually cleared the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.890 
tree oil and that actually cleared the
fungus<00:01:44.369> right<00:01:44.549> up

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
fungus right up

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.450 
fungus right up

I gotta toss him in that direction and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.660 
I gotta toss him in that direction and
as<00:02:23.850> I<00:02:24.000> said<00:02:24.060> before<00:02:24.240> red<00:02:24.810> tails<00:02:25.050> are<00:02:25.410> known<00:02:26.280> for

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
as I said before red tails are known for

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.850 
as I said before red tails are known for
just<00:02:26.970> taking<00:02:27.180> off<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.720> then<00:02:27.840> landing<00:02:28.680> right

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
just taking off and then landing right

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.330 
just taking off and then landing right
away<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.459> he<00:02:30.150> might<00:02:30.300> do<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.570> and<00:02:31.500> just<00:02:32.130> keep

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
away so he might do that and just keep

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.980 
away so he might do that and just keep
your<00:02:32.490> eyes<00:02:32.610> peeled<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.150> which<00:02:33.360> direction<00:02:33.660> he

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
your eyes peeled for which direction he

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.800 
your eyes peeled for which direction he
chooses<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.890> go<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:37.940> he's<00:02:38.940> probably<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.570> little

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
chooses to go in he's probably a little

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.270 
chooses to go in he's probably a little
wound<00:02:40.140> up<00:02:40.290> from<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> car<00:02:40.800> ride<00:02:41.040> and
