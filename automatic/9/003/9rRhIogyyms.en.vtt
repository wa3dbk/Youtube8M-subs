00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
wreath again pendulums pretty much just

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.020

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
you've got your road rage controls to a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.120 
you've got your road rage controls to a
lot<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.820> people<00:01:27.150> don't<00:01:27.360> actually<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:28.500> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
lot of people don't actually like this

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.720 
lot of people don't actually like this
game<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.380> I've<00:01:31.380> been<00:01:31.680> kind<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.010> wondering<00:01:32.400> why

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
game and I've been kind of wondering why

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.260 
game and I've been kind of wondering why
that<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.600> mean<00:01:34.050> I<00:01:34.290> myself<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that is I mean I myself do not like it I

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.030 
that is I mean I myself do not like it I
think<00:01:37.230> it's<00:01:37.910> it's<00:01:38.910> what<00:01:39.120> I<00:01:39.150> want<00:01:40.050> in<00:01:40.410> a<00:01:40.590> racing

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
think it's it's what I want in a racing

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.600 
think it's it's what I want in a racing
game<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.910> just<00:01:42.480> don't<00:01:42.690> like<00:01:42.780> racing<00:01:43.230> games

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
game but I just don't like racing games

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.570 
game but I just don't like racing games
so<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.450> mean<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.230> places<00:01:46.800> they're<00:01:47.430> all

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
so but I mean the places they're all

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.969 
so but I mean the places they're all
beautiful<00:01:49.490> futuristic<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:51.619> I<00:01:54.770> just<00:01:55.770> don't

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
beautiful futuristic and I just don't

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.000 
beautiful futuristic and I just don't
know<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.190> they<00:01:56.280> don't<00:01:56.400> like<00:01:57.680> probably<00:01:58.680> they

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
know if they don't like probably they

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.940 
know if they don't like probably they
don't<00:01:59.190> like<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.640> you<00:02:00.210> get<00:02:00.420> damaged<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.259> darn

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
don't like that you get damaged so darn

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.609 
don't like that you get damaged so darn
easily<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:03.710> don't<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.950> don't<00:02:05.130> really<00:02:05.490> see<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:05.970> I

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.820 

think<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:14.900> one<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.110> things<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.500> really

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
think it's one of the things I really

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.850 
think it's one of the things I really
don't<00:02:17.040> like<00:02:17.190> about<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:18.560> sometimes<00:02:19.560> you

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
don't like about it is sometimes you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.490 
don't like about it is sometimes you
just<00:02:19.890> don't<00:02:20.640> know<00:02:20.959> which<00:02:21.959> way<00:02:22.350> you're

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
just don't know which way you're

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:31.880 
just don't know which way you're
supposed<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.920> go

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.270 

and<00:02:32.890> sometimes<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:33.940> can<00:02:34.120> go<00:02:34.239> both<00:02:34.450> ways

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
and sometimes you can go both ways

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.280 
and sometimes you can go both ways
sometimes<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.519> can't<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.260> confuses<00:02:38.260> the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
sometimes you can't it confuses the

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.180 
sometimes you can't it confuses the
pants<00:02:38.769> off<00:02:38.920> me<00:02:40.530> even<00:02:41.530> though<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.739> found<00:02:42.040> this

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
pants off me even though I found this

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.240 
pants off me even though I found this
thing<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.640> be<00:02:42.760> okay<00:02:43.209> pick<00:02:43.930> up<00:02:44.140> boring<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.099> me

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
thing to be okay pick up boring to me

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.199 
thing to be okay pick up boring to me
pretty<00:02:45.790> fast<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:49.200> stopped<00:02:50.200> 20<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.519> we<00:02:51.550> made

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
pretty fast and I stopped 20 so we made

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.599 
pretty fast and I stopped 20 so we made
it<00:02:52.330> like<00:02:52.450> that
