three<00:03:13.299> gigabytes<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.959> dedicated<00:03:14.530> graphics

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
three gigabytes of dedicated graphics

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.009 
three gigabytes of dedicated graphics

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
memory which is a lock you're also going

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.319 
memory which is a lock you're also going
to<00:03:17.079> find<00:03:17.230> 128<00:03:18.040> gigabytes<00:03:18.459> solid-state<00:03:19.060> drive

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
to find 128 gigabytes solid-state drive

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.280 
to find 128 gigabytes solid-state drive
and<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.690> one<00:03:19.959> terabyte<00:03:20.590> hard<00:03:21.130> drive<00:03:22.290> powering

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
and a one terabyte hard drive powering

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.590 
and a one terabyte hard drive powering
all<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:23.890> going<00:03:24.100> to<00:03:24.160> be<00:03:24.220> 16<00:03:24.700> gigs<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.120> ddr3

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
all that is going to be 16 gigs of ddr3

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.170 
all that is going to be 16 gigs of ddr3
RAM<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:27.160> you're<00:03:27.519> definitely<00:03:27.640> going<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.000> find

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
RAM so you're definitely going to find

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.819 
RAM so you're definitely going to find
that<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.600> specs<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.200> this<00:03:29.320> thing<00:03:29.560> will<00:03:29.739> be

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
that the specs of this thing will be

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.470 
that the specs of this thing will be
able<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.100> handle<00:03:30.400> pretty<00:03:30.609> much<00:03:30.700> whatever<00:03:31.359> you

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
able to handle pretty much whatever you

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.099 
able to handle pretty much whatever you
throw<00:03:31.690> at<00:03:31.930> it

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
throw at it

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.349 
throw at it
now<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.859> is<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> laptop<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.790> does<00:03:33.940> get<00:03:34.090> hot

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
now it is a laptop so it does get hot

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.390 
now it is a laptop so it does get hot
you<00:03:34.750> do<00:03:34.930> have<00:03:35.109> that<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.709> is<00:03:35.859> very<00:03:36.190> powerful

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
you do have that and it is very powerful

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.880 
you do have that and it is very powerful
in<00:03:36.880> there<00:03:37.090> but<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.870> does<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.019> pretty<00:03:38.410> good<00:03:38.739> job

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
in there but it does a pretty good job

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.979 
in there but it does a pretty good job
of<00:03:38.950> staying<00:03:39.160> cool<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.359> is<00:03:40.450> able<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.810> run

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
of staying cool and it is able to run

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.289 
of staying cool and it is able to run
most<00:03:41.290> games<00:03:41.470> without<00:03:42.040> problem<00:03:42.519> which<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.090> what

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
most games without problem which is what

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.229 
most games without problem which is what
we<00:03:43.480> are<00:03:43.569> going<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.930> show<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.230> next<00:03:45.000> so<00:03:46.000> as<00:03:46.090> you

game<00:04:27.610> even<00:04:27.909> though<00:04:28.030> it's<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.330> couple<00:04:28.870> years<00:04:28.930> old

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
game even though it's a couple years old

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.409 
game even though it's a couple years old
still<00:04:29.889> can<00:04:30.129> push<00:04:30.340> most<00:04:30.610> systems<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.270> their

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
still can push most systems to their

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.589 
still can push most systems to their
limits<00:04:31.779> you<00:04:32.289> can<00:04:32.409> see<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.650> runs<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:33.039> quite<00:04:33.249> well

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
limits you can see it runs it quite well

so here we're using 3d marks benchmark
software<00:04:36.999> 3d<00:04:37.689> mark<00:04:37.900> 11<00:04:38.319> you<00:04:38.710> can<00:04:38.889> see<00:04:39.099> I've

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:39.249 
software 3d mark 11 you can see I've

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:40.649 
software 3d mark 11 you can see I've
sped<00:04:39.580> it<00:04:39.699> up<00:04:39.789> here<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.419> running

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
sped it up here and it is running

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.809 
sped it up here and it is running
through<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.050> process<00:04:41.560> of<00:04:41.710> what<00:04:42.009> it<00:04:42.129> did<00:04:42.279> you

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
through the process of what it did you

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.309 
through the process of what it did you
can<00:04:42.939> kind<00:04:43.150> of<00:04:43.180> see<00:04:43.360> where<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.689> frame<00:04:43.960> rate<00:04:44.169> is

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
can kind of see where the frame rate is

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.200 
can kind of see where the frame rate is
at<00:04:44.499> during<00:04:44.860> all<00:04:45.009> of<00:04:45.129> it<00:04:45.219> it<00:04:45.610> hangs<00:04:45.909> pretty

at during all of it it hangs pretty
steady<00:04:46.509> at<00:04:46.689> around<00:04:46.810> 30<00:04:47.259> fps<00:04:47.860> for<00:04:48.129> most<00:04:48.310> of<00:04:48.490> the

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
steady at around 30 fps for most of the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.339 
steady at around 30 fps for most of the
tests<00:04:48.909> during<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.449> physics<00:04:49.810> test<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.169> does

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
tests during the physics test it does

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.980 
tests during the physics test it does
drop<00:04:50.650> down<00:04:50.919> slightly<00:04:51.430> but<00:04:52.210> it<00:04:52.330> still<00:04:52.599> runs<00:04:52.840> it

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
drop down slightly but it still runs it

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.869 
drop down slightly but it still runs it
pretty<00:04:53.229> comfortably<00:04:53.740> so<00:04:54.310> overall<00:04:54.639> I<00:04:54.699> would

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:54.879 
pretty comfortably so overall I would

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.429 
pretty comfortably so overall I would

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:56.439 
say as far as playing games on this

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.839 
say as far as playing games on this
thing<00:04:56.650> goes<00:04:56.860> you're<00:04:57.340> gonna<00:04:57.460> get<00:04:57.610> great

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849
