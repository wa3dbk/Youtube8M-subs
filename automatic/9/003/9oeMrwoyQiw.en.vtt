we make milk and to cheese except first

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
we make milk and to cheese except first
we<00:01:08.530> start<00:01:08.770> off<00:01:08.920> with<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.460> bean<00:01:10.560> soy<00:01:11.560> beans<00:01:11.890> are

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
we start off with the bean soy beans are

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.429 
we start off with the bean soy beans are
added<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.820> water<00:01:12.970> they're<00:01:13.659> allowed<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:13.929> soak

their<00:01:15.159> ground<00:01:15.549> up<00:01:15.819> and<00:01:16.119> then<00:01:16.600> turn<00:01:16.780> into

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
their ground up and then turn into

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.029 
their ground up and then turn into
liquid<00:01:17.409> this<00:01:17.740> liquid<00:01:17.799> is<00:01:18.520> known<00:01:19.240> as<00:01:19.450> soy<00:01:19.659> milk

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
liquid this liquid is known as soy milk

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.819 
liquid this liquid is known as soy milk
soy<00:01:21.039> milk<00:01:21.369> is<00:01:21.579> then<00:01:22.149> heated<00:01:22.719> allowed<00:01:23.619> to

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
soy milk is then heated allowed to

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.190 
soy milk is then heated allowed to
thicken<00:01:24.100> along<00:01:24.520> with<00:01:24.700> some<00:01:24.909> salts<00:01:25.389> it's

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
thicken along with some salts it's

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.010 
thicken along with some salts it's
actually<00:01:26.590> put<00:01:26.799> into<00:01:26.950> cheesecloth<00:01:27.689> forms<00:01:28.689> just

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
actually put into cheesecloth forms just

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.980 
actually put into cheesecloth forms just
like<00:01:29.139> cheeses<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.009> allowed<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.520> harden<00:01:30.990> tofu

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
like cheeses and allowed to harden tofu

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.870 
like cheeses and allowed to harden tofu
is<00:01:32.259> high<00:01:32.649> in<00:01:32.829> protein<00:01:32.859> in<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.670> actually

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
is high in protein in and actually

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.179 
is high in protein in and actually
contains<00:01:34.539> all<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:35.020> essential<00:01:35.439> amino<00:01:35.469> acids

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
contains all the essential amino acids

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.819 
contains all the essential amino acids
just<00:01:36.490> like<00:01:36.759> meat<00:01:37.060> does<00:01:37.329> however<00:01:38.049> there<00:01:38.679> are

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
just like meat does however there are

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.949 
just like meat does however there are
some<00:01:39.069> big<00:01:39.310> differences<00:01:39.549> between<00:01:39.959> animal

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
some big differences between animal

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.129 
some big differences between animal
proteins<00:01:41.499> and<00:01:42.030> plant-based<00:01:43.030> proteins<00:01:43.780> and

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.139 
proteins and plant-based proteins and

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:46.739 
proteins and plant-based proteins and
that's<00:01:44.679> because<00:01:45.100> plant-based<00:01:45.700> proteins<00:01:46.389> have

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:46.749 
that's because plant-based proteins have

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's because plant-based proteins have
a<00:01:46.780> lot<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.020> other<00:01:47.259> health<00:01:47.350> properties<00:01:48.130> that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
a lot of other health properties that

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.319 
a lot of other health properties that
come<00:01:48.490> along<00:01:48.729> with<00:01:48.969> it

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
come along with it

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.800 
come along with it
soy<00:01:50.100> specifically<00:01:51.100> has<00:01:51.729> been<00:01:51.999> studied<00:01:52.450> that

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
soy specifically has been studied that

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.199 
soy specifically has been studied that
when<00:01:53.020> consumed<00:01:53.529> regularly<00:01:53.799> can<00:01:54.639> actually

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
when consumed regularly can actually

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.330 
when consumed regularly can actually
help<00:01:55.389> lower<00:01:55.749> cholesterol<00:01:56.200> levels<00:01:56.529> you'll

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
help lower cholesterol levels you'll

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.449 
help lower cholesterol levels you'll
find<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:57.819> most<00:01:58.060> tofu<00:01:58.689> is<00:01:58.959> not<00:01:59.289> flavored<00:01:59.829> such

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
find that most tofu is not flavored such

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:01.620 
find that most tofu is not flavored such
as<00:02:00.639> this<00:02:00.789> tofu

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
as this tofu

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.770 
as this tofu
however<00:02:02.470> tofu<00:02:03.460> can<00:02:03.640> also<00:02:03.759> come<00:02:04.119> flavored<00:02:04.540> and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
however tofu can also come flavored and

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.380 
however tofu can also come flavored and
this<00:02:05.320> one's<00:02:05.530> flavored<00:02:05.920> like<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.100> berry<00:02:06.400> now

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
this one's flavored like a berry now

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.900 
this one's flavored like a berry now
unflavored<00:02:08.110> tofu<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:08.800> literally<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.399> flavor

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910

sponge meaning you want to cook it with

sponge meaning you want to cook it with
something<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:12.970> has<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.150> lot<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.510> flavor<00:02:13.900> and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
something that has a lot of flavor and

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.870 
something that has a lot of flavor and
serve<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.920> with<00:02:15.040> foods<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.340> have<00:02:15.489> lots<00:02:15.730> of
