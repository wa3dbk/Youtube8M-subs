00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
from the T side I know there's already a

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.110 
from the T side I know there's already a
bunch<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.769> videos<00:00:11.070> out<00:00:11.190> there<00:00:11.250> how<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> do<00:00:11.940> it

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
bunch of videos out there how to do it

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.079 
bunch of videos out there how to do it
but<00:00:12.660> um<00:00:12.980> it<00:00:13.980> seems<00:00:14.160> really<00:00:14.400> hard<00:00:14.490> for<00:00:14.880> me<00:00:15.059> just

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
but um it seems really hard for me just

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.150 
but um it seems really hard for me just
looking<00:00:15.509> at<00:00:15.660> those<00:00:15.780> videos<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.440> need<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.859> be

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
looking at those videos I need to be

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.029 
looking at those videos I need to be
able<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:18.390> know<00:00:18.420> look<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.289> find<00:00:19.590> exact

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
able to you know look and find exact

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.790 
able to you know look and find exact
placement<00:00:20.430> over<00:00:20.910> here<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.590> kind<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.650> was

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
placement over here so kind of was

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
placement over here so kind of was
messing<00:00:23.100> around<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.400> map<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.029> found<00:00:24.600> a

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
messing around this map and I found a

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.050 
messing around this map and I found a
pretty<00:00:24.900> sure<00:00:25.199> way<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.470> always<00:00:26.039> hit<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.519> ledge

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
pretty sure way to always hit that ledge

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.349 
pretty sure way to always hit that ledge
so<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.420> smoke<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> window<00:00:28.609> so<00:00:29.609> really<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
so you smoke the window so really the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.410 
so you smoke the window so really the
main<00:00:30.510> thing<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.199> method<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:32.000> this<00:00:33.000> long

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
main thing of this method is a this long

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.590 
main thing of this method is a this long
antenna<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:35.460> meets<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.850> power<00:00:36.210> line

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
antenna here it meets this power line

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.850 
antenna here it meets this power line
right<00:00:37.320> here<00:00:38.780> that's<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> kind<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> keys

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
right here that's the kind of the keys

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.560 
right here that's the kind of the keys
to<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.129> whole<00:00:41.370> thing<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.480> is

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to this whole thing so what you do is

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.110 
to this whole thing so what you do is
you<00:00:42.660> cock<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.110> grenade<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.820> wear<00:00:44.820> your

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
you cock your grenade and wear your

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.900 
you cock your grenade and wear your
glove<00:00:45.870> meets<00:00:46.410> your<00:00:46.649> thumb<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.520> right<00:00:47.550> hand

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
glove meets your thumb on the right hand

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.420 
glove meets your thumb on the right hand
side<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.570> point<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.590> put<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
side that point you just put it at the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.010 
side that point you just put it at the
same<00:00:50.610> point<00:00:50.969> where<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.329> antenna<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
same point where the antenna and the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.200 
same point where the antenna and the
power<00:00:52.289> line<00:00:52.469> meet<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.949> right<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
power line meet so right there so you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.060 
power line meet so right there so you
just<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.719> put<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.960> there<00:00:55.140> there's<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
just going to put it there there's a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.410 
just going to put it there there's a
little<00:00:56.309> grace<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.059> can<00:00:57.210> put<00:00:57.329> it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
little grace you know you can put it

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
little grace you know you can put it
there<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.800> long<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.010> you're

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
there there you know as long as you're

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.970 
there there you know as long as you're
pretty<00:00:59.760> close<00:01:00.109> and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.199> what<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
pretty close and then what you do is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.000 
pretty close and then what you do is
you're<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.820> run<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.559> then<00:01:04.559> as<00:01:04.739> soon<00:01:04.920> as

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
you're going to run and then as soon as

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.340 
you're going to run and then as soon as
your<00:01:05.159> pointer<00:01:05.640> finger<00:01:06.030> touches<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.020> first

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
your pointer finger touches the first

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.800 
your pointer finger touches the first
power<00:01:07.710> line<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.130> let<00:01:08.369> go<00:01:09.590> like<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:11.810> then

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
power line you let go like that then

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.520 
power line you let go like that then
I'll<00:01:12.990> come<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.619> bounce<00:01:15.200> blinds<00:01:16.200> this

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
I'll come up here bounce blinds this

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.289 
I'll come up here bounce blinds this
whole<00:01:16.740> thing<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.360> uh<00:01:19.340> yeah<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.640> seems<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.270> work

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
whole thing so uh yeah it seems to work

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.120 
whole thing so uh yeah it seems to work
pretty<00:01:21.450> well<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:21.869> me<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.320> actually<00:01:22.530> hit<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
pretty well for me I actually hit it

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.730 
pretty well for me I actually hit it
most<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> time<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:24.210> not<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> time<00:01:24.810> I'm

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
most the time if not all the time I'm

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
most the time if not all the time I'm
pretty<00:01:25.920> constant<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.759> now<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:29.479> yeah<00:01:30.479> it

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
pretty constant with it now and yeah it

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.130 
pretty constant with it now and yeah it
seems<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.439> lot<00:01:31.740> easier<00:01:31.770> method<00:01:32.520> than

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
seems to be a lot easier method than

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.819 
seems to be a lot easier method than
just<00:01:34.140> kind<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.409> winging<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> yeah<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.680> can

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
just kind of winging it so yeah you can

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.830 
just kind of winging it so yeah you can
release<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.430> little<00:01:38.640> bit<00:01:38.820> early<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.150> it'll

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
release it a little bit early and it'll

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.600 
release it a little bit early and it'll
still<00:01:40.110> work<00:01:40.140> okay<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.159> release<00:01:41.579> it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
still work okay but if you release it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.789 
still work okay but if you release it
like<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.360> know<00:01:42.479> past<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> power<00:01:43.290> line<00:01:43.619> then

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
like you know past the power line then

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
like you know past the power line then
we're<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.100> come<00:01:44.280> short<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.990> kind

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
we're going to come short so just kind

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.340 
we're going to come short so just kind
of<00:01:46.229> practice<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:48.170> if<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.320> just

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
of practice it and you know if you just

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.260 
of practice it and you know if you just
you<00:01:49.860> know<00:01:49.979> release<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.670> at<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> right<00:01:51.030> time

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you know release it at the right time

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.080 
you know release it at the right time
and<00:01:51.600> aim<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.490> you're<00:01:53.490> always<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> hit

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and aim right you're always going to hit

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.639 
and aim right you're always going to hit
it<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.630> kind<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> right<00:01:55.170> side<00:01:55.560> of
