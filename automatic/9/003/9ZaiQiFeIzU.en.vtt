00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.529 
person next to you was talking about but
they're<00:00:27.960> not<00:00:28.140> ideal<00:00:29.099> for<00:00:29.369> somebody<00:00:29.789> who<00:00:30.029> wants

to totally bleed out everything for that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.540 
to totally bleed out everything for that
