00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.490 
is what you have for the playstation 3
and<00:06:27.070> a<00:06:27.460> headset<00:06:28.150> is<00:06:28.690> what<00:06:28.900> you<00:06:29.050> have<00:06:29.229> for<00:06:29.440> the

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
and a headset is what you have for the

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.920 
and a headset is what you have for the
turtle<00:06:29.770> beaches

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
turtle beaches

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.189 
turtle beaches
and<00:06:32.320> again<00:06:33.210> about<00:06:34.210> the<00:06:34.330> same<00:06:34.479> price<00:06:34.660> these<00:06:35.020> are

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 
and again about the same price these are

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.129 
and again about the same price these are
about<00:06:35.320> 150<00:06:36.280> Brandon<00:06:37.000> these<00:06:37.240> are<00:06:37.360> about<00:06:37.570> 160

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
about 150 Brandon these are about 160

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.680 
about 150 Brandon these are about 160
but<00:06:39.150> realistically<00:06:40.150> you<00:06:40.360> could<00:06:40.479> probably

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
but realistically you could probably

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.480 
but realistically you could probably
find<00:06:41.020> these<00:06:41.259> cheaper<00:06:41.770> online<00:06:41.919> just<00:06:42.310> because

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
find these cheaper online just because

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.120 
find these cheaper online just because
they're<00:06:42.610> more<00:06:42.789> popular<00:06:43.740> you<00:06:44.740> know<00:06:44.830> you<00:06:44.919> can<00:06:45.039> go

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
they're more popular you know you can go

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.760 
they're more popular you know you can go
on<00:06:45.220> Craigslist<00:06:45.970> or<00:06:46.090> whatever<00:06:46.479> a<00:06:46.570> back<00:06:46.780> page<00:06:47.050> so

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
on Craigslist or whatever a back page so

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.129 
on Craigslist or whatever a back page so

just comment if you have any questions I

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.909 
just comment if you have any questions I
would<00:06:58.449> be<00:06:58.600> pretty<00:06:58.900> realistic<00:06:59.289> you<00:06:59.710> know<00:06:59.770> I've

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 
would be pretty realistic you know I've

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:01.920 
would be pretty realistic you know I've
used<00:07:00.100> both<00:07:00.340> have<00:07:00.580> sets<00:07:00.850> so<00:07:01.180> I<00:07:01.389> mean<00:07:01.750> they're

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
used both have sets so I mean they're

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.570 
used both have sets so I mean they're
both<00:07:02.110> you<00:07:02.380> can't<00:07:02.590> go<00:07:02.710> wrong<00:07:02.740> with<00:07:03.070> either<00:07:03.100> but

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
both you can't go wrong with either but

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.499 
both you can't go wrong with either but
I<00:07:05.009> strongly<00:07:06.009> suggest<00:07:06.310> if<00:07:06.669> you<00:07:06.759> replace<00:07:07.060> three

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:07.509 
I strongly suggest if you replace three

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:08.879 
I strongly suggest if you replace three
user<00:07:07.780> that<00:07:07.990> you'd<00:07:08.169> go<00:07:08.380> with<00:07:08.560> the<00:07:08.650> poles

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:08.889 
user that you'd go with the poles

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.189 
user that you'd go with the poles
headsets<00:07:09.400> but<00:07:10.180> then<00:07:10.419> again<00:07:10.449> that<00:07:10.870> should<00:07:11.050> be

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 
headsets but then again that should be

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.830 
headsets but then again that should be
because<00:07:11.669> it's<00:07:12.669> not<00:07:12.820> only<00:07:13.000> you<00:07:13.539> know<00:07:13.570> for<00:07:13.810> the

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
because it's not only you know for the

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.469 
because it's not only you know for the
console<00:07:14.289> like<00:07:14.590> turtle<00:07:15.070> beaches<00:07:15.280> are<00:07:15.479> but

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 
console like turtle beaches are but

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:18.629 
console like turtle beaches are but
