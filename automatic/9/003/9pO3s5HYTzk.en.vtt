00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:11.420
 good day with you again tatyana and 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.009
 today we will start spring 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:19.290
 making parsley planting the most important thing 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.830
 for parsley must be well prepared 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.020
 the soil 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.020
 since this plant is two-faced and choose 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.660
 such a site that does not want to 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.290
 next year to dig this one 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.960
 plot 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.710
 left from next spring thats 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.609
 earlier 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:43.589
 parstechka as landing 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:47.219
 early spring I was a little late 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.550
 so the depth of seeding will 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:55.109
 do more somewhere two centimeters 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:58.050
 If you plant March and then you can nag better 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:03.120
 one centimeter seminole in parsley 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.700
 a very long time coming up so i am for two days 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.619
 Here in a rag kept in water simply 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:17.450
 water changed seminole water now 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:23.180
 here has dried and will plant 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:27.960
 to get good greens do not need 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.610
 parsley loader here as it wants 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.610
 incomplete then 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:50.610
 soot is average and like all the earlier small 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:53.820
 cultures are good and well but watered 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.300
 to germinate and do not need to water well 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.630
 rows well seal earth do 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.470
 two centimeters depth to 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.320
 Vlayku enough and everything and this is quite 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.810
 enough for good money when 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.709
 parsley will sprout enough 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.400
 heights will need to break through on such 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.880
 distances 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.940
 to let go and were lush then and 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:30.380
 the root system will be strong and then 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:35.240
 Does the parsley rest on Muslims 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:38.340
 if you leave tails thickly roots will 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:44.030
 small plants though well 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:48.209
 cold resistant can freeze 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.400
 now it only remains to level off 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.680
 Sand I made here because here 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.850
 we have very fertile land here 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.070
 front la grass but it turned out 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:04.290
 severe but still all root 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:07.970
 plants need a light kidney 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.239
 and now we move in parsley which 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:16.580
 Spring has been growing since last year 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.580
 show how beautiful she is 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.349
 here's parsley last year 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:31.260
 here we are already starting to eat it since march 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.860
 very small little pieces of them 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.829
 and in principle it is possible not to plant parsley 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.640
 two years she is 4 in one place therefore 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.280
 better and 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.629
 fertilize the soil in advance 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:50.430
 shoot arrows or leave it right here 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:53.819
 sown here and then conveniently in one 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.870
 the place is the place which is not occupied 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.170
 it is necessary to dig it very convenient 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.409
 Now 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.750
 and all parsley is very unpretentious 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:07.620
 just growing and we and no 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.579
 fertilize except bookmarks organic before 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.420
 by landing on this all I will say goodbye to 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.420
 new meetings
