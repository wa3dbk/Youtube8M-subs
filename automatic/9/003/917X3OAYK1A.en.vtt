this is a very very painful grip I

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.950 
this is a very very painful grip I
remember<00:01:24.910> when<00:01:25.030> I<00:01:25.090> first<00:01:25.240> learned<00:01:25.600> it<00:01:25.810> so

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
remember when I first learned it so

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.600 
remember when I first learned it so
there's<00:01:26.530> no<00:01:26.680> way<00:01:26.800> I'm<00:01:26.920> ever<00:01:27.010> doing<00:01:27.130> this<00:01:27.310> again

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
there's no way I'm ever doing this again

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.190 
there's no way I'm ever doing this again
it's<00:01:27.730> terrible<00:01:28.210> and<00:01:28.840> then<00:01:28.960> about<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.140> month

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
it's terrible and then about a month

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.890 
it's terrible and then about a month
after<00:01:29.800> having<00:01:30.310> sore<00:01:30.520> thumbs<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:31.210> really<00:01:31.720> found

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
after having sore thumbs I really found

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.430 
after having sore thumbs I really found
the<00:01:32.050> value<00:01:32.470> so<00:01:33.400> when<00:01:33.550> we<00:01:33.700> use<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.910> open<00:01:34.330> it

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
the value so when we use to open it

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.940 
the value so when we use to open it
basically<00:01:35.440> any<00:01:35.800> lift<00:01:36.670> that's<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.420> pull<00:01:37.750> so<00:01:38.710> what

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
basically any lift that's a pull so what

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.490 
basically any lift that's a pull so what
are<00:01:38.980> your<00:01:39.100> poles<00:01:39.400> your<00:01:39.880> deadlift<00:01:40.420> your<00:01:41.170> clean

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.630 
are your poles your deadlift your clean
your<00:01:42.280> snatch<00:01:42.700> all<00:01:43.210> polls<00:01:43.960> even<00:01:44.350> more<00:01:45.070> so<00:01:45.370> if

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
your snatch all polls even more so if

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.340 
your snatch all polls even more so if
you're<00:01:45.790> doing<00:01:46.030> something<00:01:46.240> from<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.630> happiest

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350

time in the Hang position here there's

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.130 
time in the Hang position here there's
nothing<00:01:50.620> supporting<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.760> wink<00:01:52.120> but<00:01:52.750> my<00:01:52.960> own

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
nothing supporting that wink but my own

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.440 
nothing supporting that wink but my own
trip<00:01:53.530> where<00:01:54.160> I<00:01:54.190> went<00:01:54.430> to<00:01:54.490> deadlift<00:01:54.910> because<00:01:55.300> it

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
trip where I went to deadlift because it

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.020
