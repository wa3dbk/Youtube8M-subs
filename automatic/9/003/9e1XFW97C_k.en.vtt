00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.790
 ye love me again, I show 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.890
 Now you have a variant like you 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.570
 could process there are pigments 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.520
 several variants again I'll show you 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.840
 Now again the acrylic variant because 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.150
 I left a little left wid 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.599
 have and then it's already going on her 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.060
 See again what I have in front of me 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.010
 you need acrylic powder of the linc again 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.620
 What am I still talking about here? 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.020
 see in it from before and that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.210
 pigment is glittering again 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.519
 queen of the exotic pigment and one 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.570
 I will not take the others this time 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:54.870
 one of crystal with brush but me 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.460
 take a slightly older one because pigments 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.230
 to be edited remains very many 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.329
 hang brush and if you make it 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.339
 Making a mistake is a problem 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.680
 a second brush 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:10.560
 That's why I take my old one so it goes 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.620
 then go it looks like this when it's open 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.950
 It is always beautiful in gold I suppose 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.590
 again three parts 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.759
 123 and of pigment actually needed 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.869
 not much 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.479
 So I usually take it that way 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.170
 a bit that the country already completely 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.110
 you have to line up there new york again 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.930
 Stir moves and you see how 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.579
 color intensive that is already so of 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.909
 You really do not need pigments 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.909
 a lot of 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:51.299
 I put everything back to the side when 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:55.079
 it works like that to me too 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.250
 a bit for the first time, see me 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:06.270
 my ice cold hands again in front of it 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:08.990
 only after that is prepared again and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.990
 then it starts 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:30.189
 takes on deadly is where the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.189
 kitchens on it again 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.140
 Everyone has a different technique, of course 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.140
 clear 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.510
 I miss that a little too 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.980
 you can for example a 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.880
 make other color of the series 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:30.640
 I am now again the same 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:33.150
 Substance package rhine wants to work 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.150
 it does not work 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.799
 you look a bit dirty 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.969
 That's why I say take one 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.769
 other brush 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:08.579
 That's really important in pigments 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:13.879
 so you will be worse off my yours 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.879
 expensive brush for for 50 60 euro takes 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:21.750
 and then half of the color still 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.470
 in there and because this takes up the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.470
 is out 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.690
 so 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.770
 Of course you have to, after all 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.920
 from falling right to fooling and 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.920
 everything else
