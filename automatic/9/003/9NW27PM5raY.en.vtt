happens to you and it's also a netbook
this<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.060> an<00:01:33.210> Acer<00:01:33.540> netbook<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> what<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
this is an Acer netbook this is what I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.120 
this is an Acer netbook this is what I
did<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.750> had<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:37.049> step<00:01:37.320> by<00:01:37.350> step<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.700> this

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
did I had to go step by step to do this

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.520 
did I had to go step by step to do this
because<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:42.320> searched<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.920> web<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
because I searched it on the web and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.359 
because I searched it on the web and
they<00:01:46.530> gave<00:01:46.710> me<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.250> results<00:01:47.899> but<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.560> was

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
they gave me a lot of results but I was

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.800 
they gave me a lot of results but I was
limiting<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.270> by<00:01:51.479> one<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.890> gonna<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.810> they

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
limiting one by one so I gonna go they

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.950 
limiting one by one so I gonna go they
put<00:01:55.079> up<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:55.530> bit<00:01:55.649> faster<00:01:56.600> let<00:01:57.600> me<00:01:57.719> boot

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
put up a little bit faster let me boot

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:08.660 
put up a little bit faster let me boot
up<00:01:58.140> again

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.949 

so<00:02:09.270> I'm<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.630> go<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.200> BIOS<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.170 

let<00:02:15.959> me<00:02:16.050> see<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.410> could<00:02:16.709> show<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:17.520> properly

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
let me see if I could show you properly

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.010 
let me see if I could show you properly
in<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.830> BIOS<00:02:22.160> under<00:02:23.160> main<00:02:23.720> there's<00:02:24.720> one

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
in in the BIOS under main there's one

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.840 
in in the BIOS under main there's one
that<00:02:25.260> says<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:28.010> SATA<00:02:29.010> mode<00:02:29.520> which<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.570> SATA<00:02:31.350> mode

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
that says a SATA mode which is SATA mode

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:39.350 
that says a SATA mode which is SATA mode
and<00:02:32.850> it's<00:02:33.709> as<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.830> can<00:02:35.010> see<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.330> eh<00:02:37.069> CI<00:02:38.360> so

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
and it's as you can see it's a eh CI so

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.840 
and it's as you can see it's a eh CI so
what<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.630> did<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.959> moved<00:02:40.709> all<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.010> way<00:02:41.040> there

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
what I did I moved all the way there

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:51.070 
what I did I moved all the way there
changed<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.620> IDE<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:47.090> then<00:02:48.650> press<00:02:49.650> save

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
changed it to IDE and then press save

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.840 
changed it to IDE and then press save
and<00:02:52.080> exit<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:53.760> we'll<00:02:54.600> see<00:02:54.810> what<00:02:54.959> happens<00:02:55.850> we

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and exit and we'll see what happens we

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.270 
and exit and we'll see what happens we
will<00:02:56.880> load<00:02:57.120> again<00:02:57.480> from<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> flash<00:02:58.200> drive<00:03:01.280> so

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
will load again from the flash drive so

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:28.750 
will load again from the flash drive so
we're<00:03:02.670> loading<00:03:02.850> for<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.300> flash<00:03:03.570> drive

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.130 

and<00:03:29.150> there<00:03:29.870> you<00:03:29.989> go<00:03:30.370> you're<00:03:31.370> set<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.670> go

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
and there you go you're set to go

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.100 
and there you go you're set to go
I'm<00:03:33.500> guessing<00:03:34.069> that<00:03:34.420> there's<00:03:35.420> some<00:03:35.569> is<00:03:35.690> this

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
I'm guessing that there's some is this

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.360 
I'm guessing that there's some is this
an<00:03:36.290> arrow<00:03:36.500> with<00:03:36.830> Windows<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.870> set<00:03:39.170> up<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:40.220> you

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
an arrow with Windows the set up and you

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.899 
an arrow with Windows the set up and you
gotta<00:03:40.549> change<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:41.060> ID<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:42.920> could<00:03:43.280> just

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
gotta change to ID so you could just

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.490 
gotta change to ID so you could just
