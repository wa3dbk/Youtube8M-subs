it has it looks like a composite
graphite<00:00:43.970> outsole<00:00:44.510> but<00:00:44.720> it's<00:00:44.840> actually<00:00:45.260> more

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
graphite outsole but it's actually more

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
plastic it's gonna keep the weight down

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.979 
plastic it's gonna keep the weight down
but<00:00:52.700> still<00:00:53.180> it's<00:00:53.300> gonna<00:00:53.390> offer<00:00:53.600> some<00:00:53.870> good

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
but still it's gonna offer some good

of a design right out of the box

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.440 
of a design right out of the box
initially<00:01:43.700> it's<00:01:43.820> gonna<00:01:43.909> be<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.119> little<00:01:44.299> more

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
initially it's gonna be a little more

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.690 
initially it's gonna be a little more
comfortable<00:01:45.049> but<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:46.010> doesn't<00:01:46.340> have<00:01:46.490> those

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
comfortable but it doesn't have those

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.789 
comfortable but it doesn't have those
same<00:01:46.939> heat<00:01:47.240> molding<00:01:47.750> properties<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.500> still

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
same heat molding properties to it still

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.399 
same heat molding properties to it still
it<00:01:49.130> does<00:01:49.400> have<00:01:49.610> some<00:01:49.939> heat<00:01:50.900> molding<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.320> you

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
it does have some heat molding so you

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.780 
it does have some heat molding so you
can<00:01:51.650> see<00:01:51.890> how<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.070> kind<00:01:52.189> of<00:01:52.280> flares<00:01:52.549> out<00:01:52.759> a

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
can see how it kind of flares out a

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.370 
can see how it kind of flares out a
little<00:01:53.119> bit<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.420> as<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.900> break<00:01:54.110> it<00:01:54.229> in<00:01:54.290> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
little bit and as you break it in the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.990 
little bit and as you break it in the
traditional<00:01:54.500> way<00:01:54.890> or<00:01:54.979> by<00:01:55.310> baking<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.820> it'll

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
traditional way or by baking it it'll

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.820 
traditional way or by baking it it'll
kind<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.240> roll<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.570> over<00:01:56.900> and<00:01:57.080> give<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:57.650> nice

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
kind of roll it over and give you a nice

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.580 
kind of roll it over and give you a nice
fit<00:01:58.220> going<00:01:59.090> on<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.479> tongue<00:01:59.720> they<00:02:00.350> still

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
fit going on to the tongue they still

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.200 
fit going on to the tongue they still
kept<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.009> similar<00:02:01.340> design<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.909> rest<00:02:02.119> of

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
kept the similar design to the rest of

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.550 
kept the similar design to the rest of
their<00:02:02.299> skates<00:02:02.570> where<00:02:02.780> they<00:02:02.900> have<00:02:02.990> some<00:02:03.170> denser

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
their skates where they have some denser

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.960 
their skates where they have some denser
materials<00:02:03.950> down<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.220> center<00:02:04.549> where<00:02:04.820> this

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
materials down the center where this

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.789 
materials down the center where this
black<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.540> which<00:02:06.259> is<00:02:06.350> going<00:02:06.439> to<00:02:06.500> provide

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
black is which is going to provide

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.410 
black is which is going to provide
against<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.189> lace<00:02:07.400> bite<00:02:07.670> as<00:02:07.909> well<00:02:07.939> as<00:02:08.209> being<00:02:08.360> a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
against the lace bite as well as being a

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.240 
against the lace bite as well as being a
little<00:02:08.659> bit<00:02:08.750> thinner<00:02:09.049> on<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.259> sides<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:10.129> it's

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
little bit thinner on the sides so it's

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.380 
little bit thinner on the sides so it's
gonna<00:02:10.340> loud<00:02:10.489> that<00:02:10.670> tongue<00:02:10.879> to<00:02:11.000> sit<00:02:11.180> nice<00:02:11.360> and

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
gonna loud that tongue to sit nice and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.180 
gonna loud that tongue to sit nice and
firm<00:02:11.930> against<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.470> foot<00:02:12.680> while<00:02:12.890> still

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
firm against the foot while still

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.790 
firm against the foot while still
offering<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.670> lace<00:02:13.849> bite<00:02:14.060> protection<00:02:14.800> going

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
offering that lace bite protection going

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.570 
offering that lace bite protection going
on<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.160> inside<00:02:16.610> they're<00:02:16.849> using<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.209> micro

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
on to the inside they're using a micro

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.070 
on to the inside they're using a micro
fiber<00:02:17.850> liner<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.570> it's<00:02:18.690> gonna<00:02:18.810> allow<00:02:18.930> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
fiber liner so it's gonna allow the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.860 
fiber liner so it's gonna allow the
moisture<00:02:19.470> be<00:02:19.800> waked<00:02:20.040> away<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.090> as<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.240> slightly

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
moisture be waked away and as a slightly

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.000 
moisture be waked away and as a slightly
rough<00:02:22.050> feel<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.650> think<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.920> gonna

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
rough feel to it but I think it's gonna

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.520 
rough feel to it but I think it's gonna
have<00:02:23.160> some<00:02:23.280> good<00:02:23.490> wearing<00:02:23.790> properties<00:02:24.530> going

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
have some good wearing properties going

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.280 
have some good wearing properties going
on<00:02:25.770> from<00:02:26.040> there<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.550> check<00:02:26.760> out<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.290> footbed

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
on from there to check out the footbed

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.900 
on from there to check out the footbed
on<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.560> guy<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.370> has<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.520> slightly

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
on this guy and it has a slightly

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.690 
on this guy and it has a slightly
thinner<00:02:30.240> design<00:02:30.510> than<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:30.990> U<00:02:31.200> +<00:02:31.470> o7<00:02:31.650> but<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.580> was

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
thinner design than the U + o7 but I was

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700 
thinner design than the U + o7 but I was
kind<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.060> soft<00:02:33.300> felt<00:02:33.660> top<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.350> still<00:02:34.560> it's

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
kind of a soft felt top to it still it's

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.080 
kind of a soft felt top to it still it's
not<00:02:34.770> super<00:02:35.160> thick<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.520> it's<00:02:35.640> gonna<00:02:35.730> give<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.060> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
not super thick so it's gonna give you a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.820 
not super thick so it's gonna give you a
little<00:02:36.390> bit<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.750> comfort<00:02:37.020> padding<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.740> it

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
little bit of comfort padding in it

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.790 
little bit of comfort padding in it
while<00:02:38.280> still<00:02:38.520> having<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.880> responsive<00:02:39.480> feel<00:02:39.800> all
