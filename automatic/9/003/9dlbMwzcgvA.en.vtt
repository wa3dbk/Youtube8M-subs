00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:06.879
 You and I are both trying 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.900
 provide what we believe to be 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:13.930
 correct and not justice but without 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.150
 revenge and justice then justice 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.509
 just more revenge 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.730
 I want you to feel the pain. 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.160
 teacher accept, you know the pain 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 staff not just simple people 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.609
 motivated by revenge, not justice 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.560
 this revenge is called justice then 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.620
 this justice and was even more 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.860
 revenge then becomes a chain of 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.870
 hate living with it aware of the past 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.350
 needing in the future what it means 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.780
 know the story we can not avoid 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.880
 but if you understand that people will never 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.370
 will understand each other 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.950
 those who do not understand the true 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.710
 can never understand true peace 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.780
 We are of the same race after all. 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.210
 the reasons for war no longer 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.479
 religion still praises the 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.299
 Earth rancor love resources or just 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.999
 because it does not matter what the package with 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.570
 the reason is sufficient to initiate a 

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:16.780
 war when someone hurts you 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.799
 feel hate and when you get hurt 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.490
 Someone you become a magician know the pain in 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.560
 helps to grow and mature and grow 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.770
 means that you are able to think and 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.740
 own decisions the war bane 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.439
 damage and pain to both sides 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.200
 accepting someone's death is difficult but 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.439
 not with me we convince ourselves that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.240
 a certain person could not die 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.810
 you can try to find meaning 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.119
 of death but only pain is a hate 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.950
 endurable death meaningless hatred 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.079
 eternal and pain that is only love in the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.869
 sacrifices, oil was born and we 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:02.079
 know peace pain 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.469
 I do not know how to achieve peace even more 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.609
 someday break this curse exists 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.819
 something with peace 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:14.280
 I went with room and I will end this. 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.280
 chain of hate I will become God
