00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:32.560 

goes<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:22.190> course<00:01:30.430> water<00:01:31.430> droplets<00:01:32.000> are<00:01:32.330> quite

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
goes of course water droplets are quite

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.500 
goes of course water droplets are quite
fine<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:34.070> part<00:01:34.310> of<00:01:34.400> texture<00:01:37.150> this<00:01:38.150> screen

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
fine that part of texture this screen

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.790 
fine that part of texture this screen
gives<00:01:38.540> slight<00:01:40.540> problem<00:01:41.540> in<00:01:41.900> touch<00:01:42.500> because

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
gives slight problem in touch because

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.600 
gives slight problem in touch because
it's<00:01:43.070> not<00:01:43.400> exactly<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:44.060> feather<00:01:44.420> touch<00:01:44.780> screen

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.270 

so<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:49.640> need<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.180> drag<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.110> bit<00:01:51.350> more<00:01:51.680> than

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
so you need to drag a bit more than

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.650 
so you need to drag a bit more than
usual<00:01:57.100> still<00:01:58.100> as<00:01:58.310> far<00:01:58.550> as<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.880> environment<00:01:59.480> is

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
usual still as far as the environment is

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.020 
usual still as far as the environment is
concerned<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.520> movement<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:01.970> the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
vehicle and other vehicles for example

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.270 
vehicle and other vehicles for example
are<00:02:06.850> very<00:02:07.850> very<00:02:08.450> smooth<00:02:09.110> with<00:02:09.410> no<00:02:09.710> leg

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
are very very smooth with no leg

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.840 
are very very smooth with no leg
whatsoever

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:32.020 

we've<00:02:14.540> got<00:02:14.720> us<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.050> closed<00:02:15.320> environment

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.479 

it's<00:02:33.030> quite<00:02:33.330> smooth<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:34.530> in<00:02:34.650> all<00:02:37.040> next<00:02:38.040> we'll

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
it's quite smooth all in all next we'll

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.020 
it's quite smooth all in all next we'll

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
and all our media tech processors in the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.780 
and all our media tech processors in the
previous<00:02:45.180> devices<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:46.049> led<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.519> game

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
previous devices have led in this game

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.770 
previous devices have led in this game
significantly<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.640> even<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> Xolo<00:02:50.970> 2000<00:02:51.629> you

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
significantly and even the Xolo 2000 you

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:04.190 
significantly and even the Xolo 2000 you
can<00:02:51.989> see<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.470> no<00:02:53.220> different<00:02:54.260> relax<00:02:55.459> majorly

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.150 

but<00:03:04.470> still<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.310> quite<00:03:06.080> drivable<00:03:07.080> up<00:03:07.770> till

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
but still it's quite drivable up till

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.979 
but still it's quite drivable up till
this<00:03:08.370> point<00:03:10.610> all<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.840> maneuvering<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
this point all the maneuvering the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.630 
this point all the maneuvering the
curves<00:03:13.319> is<00:03:15.470> slightly<00:03:16.470> more<00:03:17.040> difficult

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
curves is slightly more difficult

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:36.370 
curves is slightly more difficult
because<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:19.709> does<00:03:19.920> not<00:03:20.099> respond<00:03:20.640> immediately

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.220 

slagging<00:03:37.380> yes<00:03:38.000> significantly<00:03:39.000> yes<00:03:39.599> but<00:03:40.080> it's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
slagging yes significantly yes but it's

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.819 
slagging yes significantly yes but it's
not<00:03:40.500> really<00:03:41.250> unplayable<00:03:41.819> as<00:03:42.299> we've<00:03:43.260> seen<00:03:43.560> on

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
not really unplayable as we've seen on

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.650 
not really unplayable as we've seen on
some<00:03:44.069> other<00:03:44.310> devices<00:03:44.730> having<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.510> same

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
some other devices having the same

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:58.910 
some other devices having the same
processor

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.429 

but<00:03:59.920> yeah<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.340> looks<00:04:00.610> significantly<00:04:01.329> now<00:04:02.079> the

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
but yeah it looks significantly now the

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:07.679 
but yeah it looks significantly now the
acid<00:04:02.769> test<00:04:03.189> Nova<00:04:03.849> tree<00:04:04.090> next<00:04:06.239> let's<00:04:07.239> check

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:07.689 
acid test Nova tree next let's check

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:20.960 
acid test Nova tree next let's check
this<00:04:08.049> out<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:11.650> movie<00:04:13.829> not<00:04:14.829> exactly

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:31.930 

little<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.300> leading<00:04:24.150> but<00:04:25.150> not<00:04:25.330> significantly

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.110 

the<00:04:32.780> phone<00:04:33.050> is<00:04:33.230> doing<00:04:33.530> a<00:04:33.620> fairly<00:04:34.040> good<00:04:34.430> job<00:04:34.790> so

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
the phone is doing a fairly good job so

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:45.439 
the phone is doing a fairly good job so
far

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.850 

this<00:04:46.449> emptiness<00:04:48.660> problem<00:04:49.660> usually<00:04:50.229> comes

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
this emptiness problem usually comes

00:04:50.860 --> 00:05:12.959 
this emptiness problem usually comes
during<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.550> gameplay

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:25.470 

good<00:05:13.809> good

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.900 

good<00:05:26.480> so<00:05:26.690> it<00:05:26.750> exceeded<00:05:27.199> my<00:05:27.610> expectations<00:05:28.610> and

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
good so it exceeded my expectations and

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.939 
good so it exceeded my expectations and
it's<00:05:29.270> really<00:05:29.660> playing<00:05:30.370> decent<00:05:31.370> so<00:05:31.880> far

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
it's really playing decent so far

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:40.090 
it's really playing decent so far
there's<00:05:33.949> not<00:05:34.160> much<00:05:34.850> lag
