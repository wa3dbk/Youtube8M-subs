this season's like we started thinking

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.370

and<00:00:52.510> then<00:00:52.899> I<00:00:52.960> started<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.260> think<00:00:53.320> like<00:00:53.590> well<00:00:54.040> I

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
and then I started to think like well I

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.310 
and then I started to think like well I
am<00:00:54.370> on<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.610> precipice<00:00:54.970> of<00:00:55.239> something<00:00:55.420> and<00:00:56.110> I

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
am on the precipice of something and I

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.350 
am on the precipice of something and I
could<00:00:56.530> really<00:00:56.710> screw<00:00:56.980> it<00:00:57.160> up<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.550> then<00:00:58.149> we're

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
could really screw it up and then we're

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.940 
could really screw it up and then we're
sort<00:00:58.570> of<00:00:58.690> like<00:00:58.840> what<00:00:59.380> does<00:00:59.500> that<00:00:59.680> look<00:00:59.920> like

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
sort of like what does that look like

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.560 
sort of like what does that look like
now<00:01:00.460> that<00:01:00.489> might<00:01:00.820> be<00:01:00.850> emotional<00:01:01.180> foundation

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570
