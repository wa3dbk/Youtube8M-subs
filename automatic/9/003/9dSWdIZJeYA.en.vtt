okay I've set our satisfied mind webpage

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.249 
okay I've set our satisfied mind webpage
back<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:05.130> way<00:00:05.310> it<00:00:05.430> was<00:00:05.490> but<00:00:06.240> not<00:00:06.390> exactly<00:00:07.140> in

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
the same way I use some different types

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.890 
the same way I use some different types
of<00:00:10.380> color<00:00:10.740> settings<00:00:11.370> because<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.599> wanted<00:00:12.840> to

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
of color settings because I wanted to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.939 
of color settings because I wanted to
share<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.410> with<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.160> let's<00:00:14.910> go<00:00:15.560> to<00:00:16.560> text

share that with you so let's go to text
Wrangler<00:00:18.350> now<00:00:21.439> I'm<00:00:22.439> back<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.100> stylesheet

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
Wrangler now I'm back at the stylesheet

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.169 
Wrangler now I'm back at the stylesheet
I'm<00:00:25.279> at<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.640> body<00:00:27.599> selector<00:00:28.699> and<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.820> want<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I'm at the body selector and I want to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.180 
I'm at the body selector and I want to
point<00:00:30.449> out<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.349> set<00:00:31.800> my<00:00:32.009> background<00:00:32.880> color

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
point out that I set my background color

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.420 
point out that I set my background color
to<00:00:35.190> beige<00:00:35.430> again<00:00:36.290> but<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.469> time<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.800> set<00:00:38.250> my

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
to beige again but this time I set my

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.750 
to beige again but this time I set my
color<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.809> saddle<00:00:40.290> brown<00:00:40.559> here<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> body

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
color to saddle brown here in the body

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.260 
color to saddle brown here in the body
so<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.719> will<00:00:42.989> set<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.260> default<00:00:44.100> color<00:00:44.430> for

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
so this will set the default color for

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.170 
so this will set the default color for
all<00:00:45.570> text<00:00:46.260> within<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> web<00:00:47.129> page<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
all text within the web page to that

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.529 
all text within the web page to that
nice<00:00:48.480> dark<00:00:49.460> saddle<00:00:50.460> brown<00:00:52.940> then<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.059> wanted<00:00:54.390> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
nice dark saddle brown then I wanted to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.299 
nice dark saddle brown then I wanted to
use<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> dark<00:00:55.350> orange<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.879> my<00:00:57.059> headings<00:00:57.949> so<00:00:58.949> in

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
use a dark orange for my headings so in

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.770 
use a dark orange for my headings so in
this<00:00:59.520> example<00:00:59.760> of<00:01:00.270> color

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
this example of color

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
this example of color
I've<00:01:00.930> used<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.440> color<00:01:01.680> name<00:01:03.320> but<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.680> my<00:01:04.830> h1

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
I've used the color name but for my h1

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.000 
I've used the color name but for my h1
heading<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.869> using<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.189> hexadecimal<00:01:08.869> number

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
heading I'm using the hexadecimal number

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.850 
heading I'm using the hexadecimal number
so<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> start<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> pound<00:01:12.240> sign<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.990> then

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
so I start with a pound sign and then

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.390 
so I start with a pound sign and then
list<00:01:14.159> out<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.700> FF<00:01:15.360> parts<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:17.990> red<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.680> 8c

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
list out the FF parts of red the 8c

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.550 
list out the FF parts of red the 8c
parts<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.409> green<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.400> zero<00:01:23.729> parts<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
parts of green and the zero parts of

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.090 
parts of green and the zero parts of
blue<00:01:26.479> now<00:01:27.680> for<00:01:28.680> my<00:01:28.799> h2<00:01:29.070> color<00:01:29.790> I'm<00:01:30.750> using

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
blue now for my h2 color I'm using

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.740 
blue now for my h2 color I'm using
exactly<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> same<00:01:32.369> color<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.180> dark<00:01:33.390> orange

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
exactly the same color that dark orange

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.210 
exactly the same color that dark orange
but<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.549> converted<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> numbers<00:01:36.150> from

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
but I converted the numbers from

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.810 
but I converted the numbers from
hexadecimal<00:01:38.220> base<00:01:38.479> 16<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:40.500> decimal<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.369> based

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
hexadecimal base 16 to decimal or based

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.010 
hexadecimal base 16 to decimal or based
in<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:43.170> numbers<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.310> work<00:01:44.640> with

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
in the numbers that you and I work with

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.990 
in the numbers that you and I work with
when<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:48.439> have<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.890> tell<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.759> system

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
when I do that I have to tell the system

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.990 
when I do that I have to tell the system
that<00:01:51.869> my<00:01:52.079> color<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.880> RGB<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:55.640> then<00:01:56.640> within

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that my color is RGB and then within

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.910 
that my color is RGB and then within
parenthesis<00:01:58.100> lists<00:01:59.100> out<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.399> three<00:02:00.920> colors

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
parenthesis lists out the three colors

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.780 
parenthesis lists out the three colors
and<00:02:03.049> separate<00:02:04.049> them<00:02:04.259> by<00:02:04.469> commas<00:02:04.670> when<00:02:05.670> we

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
and separate them by commas when we

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.440 
and separate them by commas when we
separate<00:02:06.450> data<00:02:06.899> by<00:02:07.200> columns<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.950> call<00:02:08.160> it

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
separate data by columns we call it

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.230 
separate data by columns we call it
comma<00:02:10.069> delimited<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> have<00:02:12.690> 200

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
comma delimited so I have 200

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.150 
comma delimited so I have 200

green and zero parts of blue now there
is<00:02:22.570> a<00:02:22.600> variation<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.580> RGB<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.590> is

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
is a variation on the RGB and that is

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.170 
is a variation on the RGB and that is
the<00:02:26.920> RGB<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:30.010> RGB<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.850> allows<00:02:31.480> me<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.050> set

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
the RGB a the RGB a allows me to set

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:41.010 
the RGB a the RGB a allows me to set
levels<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.390> transparency<00:02:36.990> where<00:02:37.990> a<00:02:39.090> 0.0<00:02:40.090> would

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
levels of transparency where a 0.0 would

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.370 
levels of transparency where a 0.0 would
be<00:02:41.230> fully<00:02:42.010> transparent<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.820> 1.0<00:02:45.820> would<00:02:46.180> be

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
be fully transparent and a 1.0 would be

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.090 
be fully transparent and a 1.0 would be
fully<00:02:47.380> opaque<00:02:47.980> or<00:02:48.370> solid<00:02:49.360> if<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.720> will<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.800> I

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
fully opaque or solid if you will so I

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
fully opaque or solid if you will so I
would<00:02:51.400> enter<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.090> in<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:53.320> this<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.670> want

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
would enter that in like this so I want

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.400 
would enter that in like this so I want
to<00:02:58.180> try<00:02:58.600> setting<00:02:59.260> my<00:02:59.410> transparency<00:03:00.400> at<00:03:01.410> 0.5

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
to try setting my transparency at 0.5

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.030 
to try setting my transparency at 0.5
for<00:03:02.860> 50%

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
for 50%

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.880 
for 50%
let's<00:03:06.040> save<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.370> out<00:03:07.230> unless<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:08.440> see<00:03:08.650> if<00:03:08.770> we

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
let's save that out unless you see if we

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.110 
let's save that out unless you see if we
see<00:03:09.130> any<00:03:09.310> difference<00:03:09.760> now<00:03:10.320> remember<00:03:11.320> that

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
see any difference now remember that

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:21.090 
see any difference now remember that
transparency<00:03:14.070> pertain<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.310> our<00:03:17.550> heading<00:03:18.550> 2<00:03:20.100> so

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
transparency pertain to our heading 2 so

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.070 
transparency pertain to our heading 2 so
we<00:03:21.310> want<00:03:21.490> to<00:03:21.610> look<00:03:21.730> where<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.060> says<00:03:22.270> jump<00:03:22.690> bias

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
we want to look where it says jump bias

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.130 
we want to look where it says jump bias
and<00:03:23.440> many<00:03:23.620> others<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:25.450> watch<00:03:25.750> for<00:03:26.110> a

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
and many others and watch for a

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
and many others and watch for a
difference<00:03:26.650> as<00:03:26.830> I<00:03:27.510> refresh<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:29.230> webpage<00:03:29.470> now

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
difference as I refresh the webpage now

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:40.310 
difference as I refresh the webpage now
ah<00:03:33.600> do<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.690> see<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.020> got<00:03:35.320> fainter<00:03:37.980> very<00:03:38.980> good

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
ah do you see it got fainter very good

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.350 
ah do you see it got fainter very good
it's<00:03:41.320> not<00:03:41.590> enough<00:03:41.980> contrast<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:42.940> I<00:03:42.970> wouldn't

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
it's not enough contrast so I wouldn't

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.160 
it's not enough contrast so I wouldn't
leave<00:03:43.570> it<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.780> way

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
leave it that way

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.810 
leave it that way
but<00:03:44.710> we<00:03:44.860> can<00:03:45.070> see<00:03:45.340> how<00:03:45.550> we<00:03:46.060> can<00:03:46.300> control

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
but we can see how we can control

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.420 
but we can see how we can control
transparency<00:03:48.820> with<00:03:49.540> our<00:03:49.750> G<00:03:50.260> B<00:03:51.390> hey<00:03:53.280> give<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.310> a

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
transparency with our G B hey give it a

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.590 
transparency with our G B hey give it a
try<00:03:55.230> remember<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.380> practice
