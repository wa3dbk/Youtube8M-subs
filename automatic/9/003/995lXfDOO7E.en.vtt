00:00:25.960 --> 00:01:48.660 

you

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.370 

and<00:01:49.670> first<00:01:50.390> up<00:01:50.690> we<00:01:50.990> have<00:01:51.040> stark<00:01:52.040> on<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.760> spider

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
and first up we have stark on the spider

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.220 
and first up we have stark on the spider
which<00:01:54.380> oddly<00:01:54.740> enough<00:01:55.010> only<00:01:55.610> has<00:01:55.850> six<00:01:56.600> arms

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
which oddly enough only has six arms

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.280 
which oddly enough only has six arms
instead<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.980> eight<00:01:58.220> but<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.300> still<00:01:59.900> think<00:02:00.170> this

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
instead of eight but I still think this

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.950 
instead of eight but I still think this
is<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.650> pretty<00:02:00.920> cool<00:02:01.250> huh<00:02:01.400> minifigure<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.300> also

think they did a really good job on

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.140 
think they did a really good job on
these<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.760> last<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:23.660> not<00:02:23.840> least<00:02:24.230> we<00:02:24.920> have

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
these and last but not least we have

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.560

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
Wynonna the female rhino and I think

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.900

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
right back down in here and just kind of

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.880 
right back down in here and just kind of
have<00:03:30.890> it<00:03:31.040> stored<00:03:31.610> there<00:03:31.940> very<00:03:32.810> awesome<00:03:33.350> you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
have it stored there very awesome you

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.910 
have it stored there very awesome you
can<00:03:34.100> also<00:03:34.340> push<00:03:35.330> down<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:36.110> tail<00:03:36.380> end<00:03:36.650> of<00:03:36.739> this

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
can also push down the tail end of this

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.880 
can also push down the tail end of this
and<00:03:37.220> it's<00:03:37.790> easier<00:03:38.450> if<00:03:38.570> you<00:03:38.690> open<00:03:39.260> that<00:03:39.410> part<00:03:39.739> up

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
and it's easier if you open that part up

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.830 
and it's easier if you open that part up
then<00:03:40.370> you<00:03:40.459> can<00:03:40.640> close<00:03:40.820> it<00:03:40.880> back<00:03:41.120> over<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.600> and

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
then you can close it back over it and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.280 
then you can close it back over it and
