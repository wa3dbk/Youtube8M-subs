 subject was next read my apology 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.490
 lack of information if possible not 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.020
 identify in the video 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.030
 I wonder if it's possible to grow 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.710
 defined I have a little time to 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.280
 I do not intend to stay for a long time. 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.869
 great 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.600
 grow a little defined what I want 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.360
 It 's possible for me a lot of you are going 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.369
 touch a chicken with regret if you go there blah 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.320
 but let's stop this joking that is 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.939
 due place is actually very good and 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.070
 I'm sure it has already passed in the head of the 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.540
 Most of you there then let's talk about 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.150
 let's not criticize the guy not 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.220
 first you can grow defined and 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.140
 depends on some factors that 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.740
 are crucial to the first fact you 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.750
 has its genetics 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.240
 This is it, it 's very simple, let's imagine 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.000
 for example, it is common for eton hill to have 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.220
 practically almost dry and one 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.080
 It's the monster in relation to me. 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 much easier to grow 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.820
 defined in the case as it has facility 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.460
 to earn more dry and I 'm in the 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.200
 not by logic he would have more 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.909
 defined ease of belief than I 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.560
 and remembering that we're not talking 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.080
 from Pedro that we are talking about 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.970
 quality and muscle evidence 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.130
 The second factor is your training time that 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.140
 you already have the muscular maturity that 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.090
 You already managed to achieve I do not know if 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.380
 You know but the muscles that are hungry 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.940
 lots of calories 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.280
 in fact they are as people do 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.049
 by most of the calorie burning of the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.549
 your body and if you already have a 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.100
 considerable amount of mass 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.620
 muscle is much easier for you 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.080
 provided you know what to eat and 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.180
 we won more videos the third factor 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.250
 would be the training experience and 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.989
 The techniques you're going to use I'll give you 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.790
 an example as you know the owner 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.860
 grow up lion and I will twist 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.890
 I'm not actually far away is 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.380
 sooner rather than this time in my dogs there 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.140
 being much more controlled before 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.920
 I do not do what you are and today I 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.180
 I know today I learned that this is a step 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.579
 if you want to sell the 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.950
 books to be very honest 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.680
 formerly when it came to take off 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.100
 and the tortoise for erotic team and today I 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.420
 I know that this step this technique is very 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.790
 important 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.890
 even off the oil but now you 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.660
 He started doing beauty work here one or 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.290
 another its obvious you're winning 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.049
 only pure muscle mass did not fall 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.660
 yesterday a single muscle mass but this time 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.430
 the big ones are much more alive than 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.769
 social networking company to inhabit the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.660
 company evolution and I alone 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.400
 I can say that the great ones do not 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.470
 really much more controlled and much 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.870
 richer than last expensive last 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.959
 room that would be important is 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.660
 equation would be a use of evangelicals and 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.239
 for you who wants to win completely 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.959
 keep the muscle quality of the 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.989
 fuck 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.299
 without the use of error the genius gets very 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.459
 difficult I would say that even after some 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.410
 point would become almost impossible for you 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.090
 I can do as you know what I 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.829
 step here I speak from experience and 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.780
 this case I speak from experience 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.889
 Then we finish the video 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.959
 here that video that I wanted 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.959
 I was just asking you to take this doubt 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.139
 in the minds of many of you it is possible 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.090
 growing depends depends on the 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.799
 level of definition on the scoreboard who is 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.109
 talking you want a living example and 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.019
 blood would be felipe franco that when 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.840
 It is to be the dof out it is not so 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.910
 dry as he really does 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.080
 in your pre-contract shortly after your 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.850
 Daddy leaves it there 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.389
 but it stops being dry because of 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.820
 that not the guy to stay dry fucking the 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.030
 car with over 100 films as the 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.419
 Intricate old then in relation to 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.550
 his employment in relation to the 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.169
 definition that reaches for championships 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.830
 for events etc 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.169
 He is not so definite but he is still 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.210
 so it is defined as hell and earnings 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.460
 child and begs not to be 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.620
 totally clean 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.479
 in relation to pre- accounts it is 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.360
 winning very clean yes it is growing 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.259
