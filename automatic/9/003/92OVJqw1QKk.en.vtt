seven each hook was like seven and then
the<00:02:00.600> bar<00:02:00.810> was<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:02.070> was<00:02:02.189> under<00:02:02.399> 20<00:02:02.670> anyways<00:02:03.119> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the bar was it was under 20 anyways and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.590 
the bar was it was under 20 anyways and
then<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.750> actually<00:02:04.110> was<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.979> shelf<00:02:05.700> from<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
then this actually was a shelf from a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.359 
then this actually was a shelf from a
different<00:02:06.750> project<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.680> had<00:02:07.799> moved<00:02:08.009> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
different project that we had moved and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.540 
different project that we had moved and
so<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.330> stuck<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.629> back<00:02:09.660> up<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.080> because

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
so I just stuck it back up there because

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.619 
so I just stuck it back up there because
she<00:02:11.550> wants<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> put<00:02:11.970> something<00:02:12.180> up<00:02:12.330> there<00:02:12.390> now

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
she wants to put something up there now

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.059 
she wants to put something up there now

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
she can

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.099 
she can
and<00:02:13.219> they<00:02:13.999> said<00:02:14.209> I'll<00:02:14.299> actually<00:02:14.540> shelves<00:02:15.019> that

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:15.109

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510

that<00:02:17.629> shelf<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:18.230> didn't<00:02:18.469> need<00:02:18.560> one<00:02:18.849> but<00:02:19.849> now<00:02:20.030> her

dresses can hang as long as they want

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.929 
dresses can hang as long as they want
and<00:02:22.430> they<00:02:22.999> won't<00:02:23.180> touch<00:02:23.329> the<00:02:23.510> floor<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.670> I

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
and they won't touch the floor and I

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.089

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
could have put them what I was planning

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:07.990 
could have put them what I was planning
on<00:03:06.620> doing<00:03:06.650> at<00:03:06.980> first<00:03:07.159> is<00:03:07.370> putting<00:03:07.699> the<00:03:07.790> hooks

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
on doing at first is putting the hooks

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.330 
on doing at first is putting the hooks
off<00:03:08.269> of<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.569> bunk<00:03:08.780> beds<00:03:09.049> which<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.159> why<00:03:10.310> I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
off of the bunk beds which is why I

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.409 
off of the bunk beds which is why I
swooped<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.419> bunk<00:03:11.599> beds<00:03:11.810> around<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.169> way

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419 
swooped the bunk beds around this way

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.140 
swooped the bunk beds around this way
but<00:03:14.419> I<00:03:14.449> decided<00:03:14.930> just<00:03:15.079> to<00:03:15.349> put<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.650> on<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:15.889> wall

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
but I decided just to put it on the wall

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.670 
but I decided just to put it on the wall
because<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.720> can<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.319> came<00:03:18.530> out<00:03:18.680> too<00:03:18.919> far<00:03:19.159> here

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
because it can it came out too far here

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.399 
because it can it came out too far here
and<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.220> that's<00:03:22.370> why<00:03:22.489> I<00:03:22.519> did<00:03:22.639> it<00:03:22.729> that<00:03:22.879> way<00:03:23.409> you

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
and so that's why I did it that way you

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.960 
and so that's why I did it that way you
can<00:03:24.650> if<00:03:24.829> you<00:03:24.949> want<00:03:25.159> by<00:03:25.659> those<00:03:26.799> portable
