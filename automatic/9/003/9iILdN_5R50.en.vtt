versus the makeup forever wasn't light

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.280 
versus the makeup forever wasn't light
mocha<00:00:39.970> so<00:00:40.570> this<00:00:41.470> is<00:00:41.680> what<00:00:41.920> it<00:00:42.010> looks<00:00:42.250> like<00:00:42.370> a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
coverage on this is medium full I need

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.690 
coverage on this is medium full I need
about<00:00:51.130> two<00:00:51.670> full<00:00:51.940> pups<00:00:52.890> sometimes<00:00:53.890> two<00:00:54.460> and<00:00:54.610> a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
about two full pups sometimes two and a

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.550 
about two full pups sometimes two and a
half<00:00:54.940> that's<00:00:55.570> why<00:00:55.780> I<00:00:55.810> say<00:00:56.050> it's<00:00:56.200> meaningful

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
half that's why I say it's meaningful

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.670 
half that's why I say it's meaningful
maybe<00:00:57.130> more<00:00:57.400> on<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.640> medium<00:00:57.970> side<00:00:58.240> it<00:00:58.680> is

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
maybe more on the medium side it is

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.500 
maybe more on the medium side it is
buildable<00:01:00.340> so<00:01:00.520> that's<00:01:00.880> why<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.060> say<00:01:01.330> it's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
buildable so that's why I say it's

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.310 
buildable so that's why I say it's
medium<00:01:01.900> full<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:02.610> is<00:01:03.780> definitely<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.809> glowing

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
primers and stuff I will still get that

five hours even the Becca radiant
foundation

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
foundation

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.390 
foundation
I<00:02:12.129> would<00:02:12.879> get<00:02:13.180> two<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:14.620> was<00:02:14.829> just<00:02:15.069> had<00:02:15.219> that

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
I would get two it was just had that

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.119 
I would get two it was just had that
greaseball<00:02:15.700> or<00:02:16.389> two<00:02:16.780> Looney<00:02:17.349> to<00:02:17.739> shiny

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
greaseball or two Looney to shiny

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.550 
greaseball or two Looney to shiny
effects<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:18.909> this<00:02:19.659> one<00:02:19.870> doesn't<00:02:20.109> do<00:02:20.349> that<00:02:20.530> I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
effects so this one doesn't do that I

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.289 
effects so this one doesn't do that I
find<00:02:20.859> that<00:02:20.889> it's<00:02:21.099> a<00:02:21.219> really<00:02:21.489> good<00:02:21.670> balance

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
find that it's a really good balance

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.569 
find that it's a really good balance
I<00:02:22.329> brought<00:02:22.959> twice<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.739> I'm<00:02:23.829> good<00:02:24.069> during<00:02:24.549> the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
I brought twice and I'm good during the

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.819 
I brought twice and I'm good during the
day<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:25.030> don't<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.719> use<00:02:25.870> any<00:02:26.109> powder<00:02:26.319> and

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
day I don't have to use any powder and

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.740 
day I don't have to use any powder and
as<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.159> can<00:02:27.280> see<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.819> you'll<00:02:28.030> see<00:02:28.269> in<00:02:28.359> photos

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
as you can see and you'll see in photos

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.140 
as you can see and you'll see in photos
that<00:02:28.989> you<00:02:29.319> do<00:02:29.620> get<00:02:29.799> a<00:02:29.859> very<00:02:30.219> nice<00:02:30.459> radiant

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
that you do get a very nice radiant

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.610 
that you do get a very nice radiant
glowing<00:02:31.450> effect<00:02:31.900> without<00:02:32.170> looking<00:02:32.469> like<00:02:32.500> a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
glowing effect without looking like a

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.250 
glowing effect without looking like a
disco<00:02:33.069> ball<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.879> it's<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.209> very<00:02:34.540> nice<00:02:34.840> balance

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
disco ball so it's a very nice balance

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.059 
disco ball so it's a very nice balance
of<00:02:36.569> radiance<00:02:37.569> without<00:02:37.930> being<00:02:38.230> too<00:02:38.709> much

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
of radiance without being too much

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.699 
of radiance without being too much
especially<00:02:40.030> if<00:02:40.389> your<00:02:40.629> combination<00:02:41.319> oily<00:02:41.499> I

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
especially if your combination oily I

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.099 
especially if your combination oily I
think<00:02:42.040> you'll<00:02:42.249> be<00:02:42.400> okay<00:02:42.819> just<00:02:43.389> use<00:02:43.659> certain

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
think you'll be okay just use certain

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.929 
think you'll be okay just use certain
precautions<00:02:44.290> with<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.159> I<00:02:45.340> think<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:45.790> would

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
precautions with this I think this would

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.709 
precautions with this I think this would
be<00:02:45.969> more<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.569> my<00:02:47.280> ladies<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.700> my<00:02:48.909> guys<00:02:49.120> who

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:49.719 
be more for my ladies and my guys who

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.189 
be more for my ladies and my guys who
want<00:02:50.019> who<00:02:50.650> have<00:02:51.030> normal<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.449> dry<00:02:52.659> skin<00:02:52.689> I<00:02:53.079> think

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:53.199 
want who have normal to dry skin I think

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.140 
want who have normal to dry skin I think
this<00:02:53.590> would<00:02:53.769> be<00:02:53.799> ideal<00:02:54.129> especially<00:02:54.939> if<00:02:55.000> you

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
this would be ideal especially if you

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.470 
this would be ideal especially if you
want<00:02:55.419> a<00:02:55.689> radiant<00:02:56.439> look<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:58.180> find<00:02:58.389> that

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
want a radiant look and you find that

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.360 
want a radiant look and you find that
your<00:02:58.659> skin<00:02:58.900> comes<00:02:59.079> off<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.290> little<00:02:59.620> dull<00:02:59.799> this

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
your skin comes off a little dull this

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.909 
your skin comes off a little dull this
would<00:03:00.579> be<00:03:00.790> great<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.409> where<00:03:02.620> test

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
would be great this is the where test

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.459 
would be great this is the where test
for<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.219> your<00:03:03.609> skin<00:03:04.150> nude<00:03:04.629> this<00:03:04.959> is<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.260> one

for the your skin nude this is the one

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.189 
for the your skin nude this is the one

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
glowing properties to it I'm going to

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.709 
glowing properties to it I'm going to
wear<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.469> for<00:03:11.500> 12<00:03:12.040> hours<00:03:12.219> I'm<00:03:13.000> going<00:03:13.389> to<00:03:13.540> only

wear it for 12 hours I'm going to only

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.750 
wear it for 12 hours I'm going to only
blot<00:03:14.109> and<00:03:14.469> then<00:03:14.829> I'll<00:03:14.980> come<00:03:15.280> back<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.699> show

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
blot and then I'll come back and show

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.999 
blot and then I'll come back and show
you<00:03:15.969> what<00:03:16.479> it<00:03:16.659> looks<00:03:16.870> like<00:03:17.019> after<00:03:17.409> 12<00:03:17.709> or<00:03:17.859> more

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:18.009 
you what it looks like after 12 or more

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.819 
you what it looks like after 12 or more
hours<00:03:18.069> of<00:03:18.400> wear<00:03:18.729> and<00:03:19.060> you'll<00:03:19.870> be<00:03:20.049> able<00:03:20.169> to<00:03:20.590> see

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
hours of wear and you'll be able to see

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.740 
hours of wear and you'll be able to see
that<00:03:21.189> before<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.609> after<00:03:21.939> if<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.239> oxidized<00:03:22.720> or

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
that before and after if it oxidized or

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.270 
that before and after if it oxidized or
if<00:03:23.109> it<00:03:23.290> doesn't<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.739> find<00:03:24.009> that<00:03:24.129> this

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
if it doesn't I find that this

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.949 
if it doesn't I find that this
foundation<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:25.150> me<00:03:25.449> doesn't<00:03:25.870> oxidize<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:27.959> it

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
foundation on me doesn't oxidize but it

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.899 
foundation on me doesn't oxidize but it
just<00:03:29.229> depends<00:03:29.709> on<00:03:30.129> what<00:03:30.310> products<00:03:30.790> you're

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
just depends on what products you're

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.490 
just depends on what products you're
using<00:03:30.970> if<00:03:31.389> you're<00:03:31.509> using<00:03:31.659> a<00:03:31.810> primer<00:03:32.109> if<00:03:32.319> you're

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
using if you're using a primer if you're

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.649 
using if you're using a primer if you're
using<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.829> setting<00:03:33.040> spray<00:03:33.159> that<00:03:33.939> may<00:03:34.269> effects

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
using a setting spray that may effects

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.990 
using a setting spray that may effects
the<00:03:34.900> oxidation<00:03:35.500> levels<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.549> kind<00:03:36.759> of<00:03:36.849> just

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
the oxidation levels so kind of just

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.949 
the oxidation levels so kind of just
keep<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.389> in<00:03:37.449> mind

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
keep that in mind

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.719 
keep that in mind
so<00:03:38.349> here's<00:03:38.709> what<00:03:38.919> it<00:03:38.949> looks<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:41.009> nice<00:03:42.009> blow

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729 
so here's what it looks like nice blow

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.189 
so here's what it looks like nice blow
here<00:03:43.090> hopefully<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:43.569> don't<00:03:43.720> look<00:03:44.019> like<00:03:44.139> a

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
here hopefully I don't look like a

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.349 
here hopefully I don't look like a
greaseball<00:03:44.739> when<00:03:45.069> I<00:03:45.159> come<00:03:45.370> back<00:03:45.549> so<00:03:46.000> I'll<00:03:46.150> see

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
greaseball when I come back so I'll see

light mocha I think they have mocha and
then<00:05:24.410> light<00:05:25.130> mocha<00:05:25.480> so<00:05:26.480> I'm<00:05:27.169> like<00:05:27.470> mocha<00:05:27.860> and
