00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
5 on PC and if you go into more details

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.330 
5 on PC and if you go into more details
on<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.079> actually<00:00:43.500> goes<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> tell<00:00:44.190> you

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
on it it actually goes in to tell you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.299 
on it it actually goes in to tell you
that<00:00:44.930> possibly<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.110> will<00:00:46.379> support<00:00:47.600> HB<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.840> oh

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
that possibly it will support HB a oh

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
that possibly it will support HB a oh
and<00:00:50.309> if<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.610> don't<00:00:50.760> know<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
and if you don't know what that is that

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.250 
and if you don't know what that is that
is<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.719> type<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.110> ambient<00:00:53.010> occlusion<00:00:53.219> which

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
is a type of ambient occlusion which

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.540 
is a type of ambient occlusion which
shows<00:00:55.260> different<00:00:55.739> shadows<00:00:55.949> at<00:00:56.309> different

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
shows different shadows at different

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.279 
shows different shadows at different
angles<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.270> looks<00:00:57.449> way<00:00:57.780> better<00:00:57.960> than<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
angles and it looks way better than the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.490 
angles and it looks way better than the
default<00:00:58.500> into<00:00:59.370> ambient<00:01:00.180> occlusion<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.629> also

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
default into ambient occlusion and also

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.579 
default into ambient occlusion and also
there's<00:01:02.129> soft<00:01:02.430> shadows<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.149> hard<00:01:03.660> works<00:01:03.899> hair

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
there's soft shadows and hard works hair

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.350 
there's soft shadows and hard works hair
works<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:05.430> could<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.729> working<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.180> you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
works they could be working like you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.080 
works they could be working like you
know<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.600> Far<00:01:06.810> Cry<00:01:06.960> 4<00:01:07.020> those<00:01:07.380> fur<00:01:07.850> it<00:01:08.850> would<00:01:08.970> be

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
know in Far Cry 4 those fur it would be

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.090 
know in Far Cry 4 those fur it would be
really<00:01:09.210> awesome<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.720> all<00:01:09.840> this

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
really awesome to have all this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.260 
really awesome to have all this
implemented<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> other<00:01:11.790> thing<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
implemented and the other thing that is

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.940 
implemented and the other thing that is
really<00:01:12.450> cool<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:14.430> possibly<00:01:15.950> might

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
really cool is that it possibly might

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.219 
really cool is that it possibly might
support<00:01:17.460> other<00:01:17.790> things<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.780> physics

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
support other things like the physics

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.050 
support other things like the physics
will<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.710> an<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> different<00:01:20.400> support<00:01:20.790> obviously

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
will be an a different support obviously

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.600 
will be an a different support obviously
so<00:01:21.990> hopefully<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> physics<00:01:22.860> will<00:01:22.979> be<00:01:23.100> more

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
so hopefully the physics will be more

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.609 
so hopefully the physics will be more
supportive<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.180> SLI<00:01:24.600> instead<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
supportive for SLI instead of the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.789 
supportive for SLI instead of the
original<00:01:25.740> GTA<00:01:26.369> 4<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:27.479> TX<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
original GTA 4 and then TX a which is a

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.270 
original GTA 4 and then TX a which is a
temporary<00:01:29.310> anti<00:01:29.909> aliasing<00:01:31.040> thing<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.220> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
temporary anti aliasing thing and it

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.590 
temporary anti aliasing thing and it
basically<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.850> better<00:01:33.060> than<00:01:33.360> any<00:01:33.540> other

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
basically it's better than any other

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
basically it's better than any other
anti<00:01:34.200> aliasing<00:01:34.619> especially<00:01:35.070> when<00:01:35.220> you're

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
anti aliasing especially when you're

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.130 
anti aliasing especially when you're
trying<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> run<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.810> good<00:01:36.930> quality

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
trying to run like really good quality

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.800 
trying to run like really good quality
at<00:01:37.470> look<00:01:37.680> at<00:01:37.860> 1920<00:01:38.759> by<00:01:38.850> 1080<00:01:39.150> P<00:01:39.270> but<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.570> does

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
at look at 1920 by 1080 P but it does

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
at look at 1920 by 1080 P but it does
cost<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.500> than<00:01:40.650> FX<00:01:41.040> AAA<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.640> other

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
cost more than FX AAA and other

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.480 
cost more than FX AAA and other
resolutions<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> would<00:01:43.829> recommend<00:01:43.979> using

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
resolutions so I would recommend using

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.780 
resolutions so I would recommend using
msaa<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.630> you're<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.049> doing<00:01:46.170> high

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
msaa if you're going to be doing high

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.060 
msaa if you're going to be doing high
resolutions<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.850> 4k<00:01:48.409> or<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.770> don't<00:01:49.920> use

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
resolutions like 4k or just don't use

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.280 
resolutions like 4k or just don't use
any<00:01:50.869> anti-aliasing<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.200> you're

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
any anti-aliasing at all if you're

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
any anti-aliasing at all if you're
running<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.560> kid<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.490> other<00:01:53.670> thing<00:01:53.970> is

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
running for kid and the other thing is

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.690 
running for kid and the other thing is
it's<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.200> nice<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:55.799> combined<00:01:56.219> this

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it's really nice and it's combined this

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.190 
it's really nice and it's combined this
is<00:01:56.759> basically<00:01:57.180> made<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.630> combining<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
is basically made with combining the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560 
is basically made with combining the
high<00:01:58.380> quality<00:01:58.649> MSAA<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.790> multi<00:02:00.149> sampling

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
high quality MSAA with multi sampling

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.359 
high quality MSAA with multi sampling
anti-aliasing<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:02.219> bit<00:02:02.310> of

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
anti-aliasing a little bit of

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.340 
anti-aliasing a little bit of
post-processing<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.689> filters<00:02:04.320> that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
post-processing and the filters that

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.950 
post-processing and the filters that
were<00:02:04.590> designed<00:02:04.950> by<00:02:05.100> Nvidia<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:06.810> pretty

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
were designed by Nvidia and it's pretty

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.210 
were designed by Nvidia and it's pretty
cool<00:02:07.170> how<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.439> works<00:02:07.619> because<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.950> works<00:02:08.099> with

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
cool how it works because it works with

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.850 
cool how it works because it works with
motion<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> works<00:02:09.300> really<00:02:09.599> well

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
motion and it works really well

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.560 
motion and it works really well
I<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.460> think<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:11.910> something<00:02:12.120> awesome

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
I just think that it's something awesome

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.420 
I just think that it's something awesome
to<00:02:12.660> have<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.260> an<00:02:13.380> additional<00:02:13.710> support<00:02:14.130> for

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
to have it as an additional support for

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.240 
to have it as an additional support for
this<00:02:14.900> application<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.740> then<00:02:16.890> we<00:02:16.980> go<00:02:17.100> move

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
this application and then we go move

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.560 
this application and then we go move
them<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.490> 4k<00:02:17.700> obviously<00:02:18.240> everybody<00:02:18.480> knows

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
them on a 4k obviously everybody knows

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.770 
them on a 4k obviously everybody knows
what<00:02:18.720> 4k<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.890> runs<00:02:20.100> native<00:02:20.610> 4k<00:02:21.300> which

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
what 4k is and it runs native 4k which

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.810 
what 4k is and it runs native 4k which
means<00:02:22.020> not<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.350> dynamic<00:02:23.100> sample<00:02:23.400> resolution

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
means not that dynamic sample resolution

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.320 
means not that dynamic sample resolution
crap<00:02:24.090> or<00:02:24.570> it's<00:02:24.750> downsampled<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.680> 4k<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.670> 1920

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
crap or it's downsampled to 4k to 1920

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.110 
crap or it's downsampled to 4k to 1920
by<00:02:27.420> 1080<00:02:27.720> P<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.170> rendered<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.040> 1920<00:02:29.580> by<00:02:29.670> 1080<00:02:30.000> P

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.060 
by 1080 P and rendered in 1920 by 1080 P
but<00:02:30.390> actual<00:02:30.840> true<00:02:31.080> 4k<00:02:31.320> which<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.770> really

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
but actual true 4k which is really

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.480 
but actual true 4k which is really
exciting

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
exciting

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.280 
exciting
and<00:02:32.640> then<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.360> other<00:02:33.480> thing<00:02:33.720> obviously<00:02:33.840> which

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
and then the other thing obviously which

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.990 
and then the other thing obviously which
is<00:02:34.410> really<00:02:34.620> good<00:02:34.770> for<00:02:34.980> those<00:02:35.310> um<00:02:35.550> who<00:02:35.880> are

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
is really good for those um who are

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.880 
is really good for those um who are
trying<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.270> make<00:02:36.450> other<00:02:36.750> things<00:02:36.890> dynamic

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
trying to make other things dynamic

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.980 
trying to make other things dynamic
sample<00:02:38.160> resolution<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.880> awesome<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.720> it's

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
sample resolution is awesome and it's

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.240 
sample resolution is awesome and it's
good<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.410> rendered<00:02:40.800> like<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.160> as<00:02:41.250> well<00:02:41.540> so

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
good to be rendered like that as well so

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.340 
good to be rendered like that as well so
it's<00:02:44.250> gonna<00:02:44.430> be<00:02:44.580> really<00:02:44.700> cool<00:02:44.940> if<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:46.140> all

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
it's gonna be really cool if this all

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.280 
it's gonna be really cool if this all
gets<00:02:46.590> played<00:02:46.950> out<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.430> can't<00:02:48.240> wait<00:02:48.420> hopefully

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
gets played out and can't wait hopefully

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.690 
gets played out and can't wait hopefully
there'll<00:02:49.410> be<00:02:49.440> more<00:02:49.770> releases<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.400> this<00:02:50.550> and

running<00:03:34.410> GTA<00:03:34.709> 4<00:03:34.920> now<00:03:35.070> are<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.489> 4<00:03:35.850> years<00:03:36.239> ahead

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720

just to run GT 4 so hopefully this is
not<00:03:39.900> gonna<00:03:40.110> be<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.380> case<00:03:40.560> with<00:03:40.860> GTA<00:03:41.220> 5<00:03:41.489> onpc

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
ultra settings because if not I'm gonna

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.470 
ultra settings because if not I'm gonna
be<00:03:55.110> very<00:03:55.440> very<00:03:55.799> frustrated<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.580> then<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.269> was

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
be very very frustrated and then I was

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.030 
be very very frustrated and then I was
thinking<00:03:57.510> about<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:58.080> for<00:03:58.260> longer<00:03:58.620> pondering

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
thinking about that for longer pondering

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.979 
thinking about that for longer pondering
it<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.310> realized<00:03:59.670> recommended<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.750> just

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
it and I realized recommended is just

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.170 
it and I realized recommended is just
recommended<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:02.070> is<00:04:02.250> minimum<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.850> this<00:04:02.970> is

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
recommended this is minimum and this is

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.320 
recommended this is minimum and this is
mid<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.290> all<00:04:04.470> this<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.950> mid<00:04:05.250> spec<00:04:05.640> which

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
mid this is all this is a mid spec which

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.940 
mid this is all this is a mid spec which
means<00:04:06.600> this<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:06.959> just<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.290> running<00:04:07.590> on<00:04:07.680> mid

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
means this is just a running on mid

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.740 
means this is just a running on mid
would<00:04:08.670> this<00:04:08.820> is<00:04:08.970> pretty<00:04:09.209> much<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.390> lot<00:04:09.540> better

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
would this is pretty much a lot better

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.009 
would this is pretty much a lot better
than<00:04:09.900> ps3<00:04:10.350> so<00:04:11.340> now<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.269> thing<00:04:12.420> about<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.750> they

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
than ps3 so now that thing about it they

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.509 
than ps3 so now that thing about it they
should<00:04:13.049> actually<00:04:13.350> start<00:04:13.709> adding<00:04:14.100> different

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
should actually start adding different

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.940 
should actually start adding different
system<00:04:14.760> requirements<00:04:15.239> namely<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:16.019> minimum<00:04:16.769> a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
system requirements namely a minimum a

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.240 
system requirements namely a minimum a
mid<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.729> then<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.269> ultra<00:04:19.109> system<00:04:19.650> requirement

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
mid and then a ultra system requirement

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.099 
mid and then a ultra system requirement
so<00:04:20.640> they<00:04:20.940> should<00:04:21.120> have<00:04:21.270> a<00:04:21.479> one<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:21.870> should

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
so they should have a one that should

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.080 
so they should have a one that should
sufficiently<00:04:22.950> run<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.340> on<00:04:23.460> high

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
sufficiently run it on high

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.000 
sufficiently run it on high
and<00:04:24.480> they<00:04:24.960> never<00:04:25.110> have<00:04:25.410> those<00:04:25.590> but<00:04:25.770> hopefully

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
and they never have those but hopefully

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.170 
and they never have those but hopefully
they<00:04:26.130> might<00:04:26.280> start<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.580> have<00:04:26.610> those<00:04:26.850> now<00:04:27.030> with

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
they might start to have those now with

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.940 
they might start to have those now with
new<00:04:27.360> systems<00:04:27.750> now<00:04:28.200> that<00:04:28.350> we're<00:04:28.470> coming<00:04:28.710> up<00:04:28.800> in

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
new systems now that we're coming up in

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.290 
new systems now that we're coming up in
the<00:04:29.010> world<00:04:29.040> and<00:04:29.280> everything's<00:04:29.610> just<00:04:29.669> really

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
the world and everything's just really

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.010 
the world and everything's just really
nice<00:04:30.510> with<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:33.030> know<00:04:33.150> hardware<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:33.900> this

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
nice with you know hardware and this

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.480 
nice with you know hardware and this
cheaper<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.500> stuff<00:04:34.680> but<00:04:35.160> that's<00:04:35.250> pretty<00:04:35.400> much

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
cheaper and stuff but that's pretty much

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.220 
cheaper and stuff but that's pretty much
I'll<00:04:35.700> have<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:35.910> say<00:04:36.090> um<00:04:36.360> thanks<00:04:36.870> for<00:04:36.900> watching

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
I'll have to say um thanks for watching

very<00:04:39.600> soon<00:04:39.900> I'm<00:04:40.320> not<00:04:40.440> sure<00:04:40.590> what<00:04:40.740> I'm<00:04:40.830> gonna<00:04:40.919> do

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
very soon I'm not sure what I'm gonna do

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.860 
very soon I'm not sure what I'm gonna do
next<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:41.700> might<00:04:41.910> make<00:04:42.030> another<00:04:42.150> far<00:04:42.690> cry

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
next but I might make another far cry

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.000 
next but I might make another far cry
before<00:04:43.050> video<00:04:43.440> or<00:04:43.620> something<00:04:43.889> I'm<00:04:43.980> just

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
before video or something I'm just

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.190 
before video or something I'm just
waiting<00:04:44.520> I'm<00:04:45.090> just<00:04:45.360> patiently<00:04:45.720> waiting<00:04:46.050> so

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
waiting I'm just patiently waiting so

waiting I'm just patiently waiting so
it's<00:04:46.320> gonna<00:04:46.410> be<00:04:46.590> like<00:04:46.710> another<00:04:46.740> month<00:04:47.160> before

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
it's gonna be like another month before
