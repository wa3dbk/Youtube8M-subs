that but also there was a nice mate in

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.319 
that but also there was a nice mate in
10<00:02:10.640> according<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.670> Whitaker<00:02:11.970> with<00:02:12.120> night<00:02:12.299> h6

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
10 according to Whitaker with night h6

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.270 
10 according to Whitaker with night h6
king<00:02:15.329> king<00:02:15.750> neck<00:02:15.930> Queen<00:02:16.230> takes<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.250> is

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
king king neck Queen takes so this is

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.740 
king king neck Queen takes so this is
stronger<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.850> course

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.670 

this<00:02:21.350> continuation<00:02:23.350> anyway<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.410> get<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
this continuation anyway you get the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.800 
this continuation anyway you get the
idea<00:02:24.830> why<00:02:25.310> it's<00:02:25.430> completely<00:02:25.790> winning<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.540> I

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
idea why it's completely winning so I

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.690 
idea why it's completely winning so I
thought<00:02:27.200> this<00:02:27.380> puzzle<00:02:27.950> was<00:02:28.070> quite<00:02:28.250> beautiful

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
thought this puzzle was quite beautiful

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.770 
thought this puzzle was quite beautiful
and<00:02:28.790> i<00:02:28.850> thought<00:02:29.090> i'd<00:02:29.150> share<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.720> a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
and i thought i'd share of you is a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.320 
and i thought i'd share of you is a
little<00:02:29.900> puzzled<00:02:30.560> coffee<00:02:30.710> break<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:32.030> let's<00:02:32.210> go

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
little puzzled coffee break so let's go

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.850 
little puzzled coffee break so let's go
back<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> nice<00:02:33.950> key<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.820> solution<00:02:35.000> is

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
back so a nice key to the solution is

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
back so a nice key to the solution is
rook<00:02:36.860> takes<00:02:37.040> b5<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.910> now<00:02:38.750> here<00:02:39.200> rook<00:02:39.560> CA<00:02:39.880> the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
rook takes b5 and now here rook CA the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.720 
rook takes b5 and now here rook CA the
