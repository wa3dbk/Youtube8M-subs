00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.709
 very well this is the adaptation that I 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.009
 I made for the chalupa rhythm then 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:22.020
 the idea is to make the drum between s 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.960
 with block and the hype 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.930
 the wache clark the cheerful among the gift of 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:38.220
 air and the burned of the happy with the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:50.610
 drummer the tambora would be this with the 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:52.320
 wache would be the happy because he is doing 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.890
 the happy more or less the adaptation 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.890
 It would be something like this 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.040
 it would sound more or less like this 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.580
 you 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.480
 at a faster speed 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.830
 What I do now is how to try to start 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.710
 to improvise with only the right hand 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.229
 making accents on the snare drum by 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.300
 all the drums keeping the base 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.300
 of the tambora and the base of the milestone 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.769
 two
