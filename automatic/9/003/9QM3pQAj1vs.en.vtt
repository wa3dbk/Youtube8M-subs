 in berlin-wedding about the 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.689
 bouncer scene until the buggy of the stars 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:02:01.220
 experience a bit like the German 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.929
 version of american dream the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.179
 German version of the 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.470
 American Dream bodyguard da thinks 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.229
 Immediately join this hollywood for 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.729
 no cost of the bolliger world famous 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.280
 is your life just as exciting as in 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.620
 this movie so my name is determined 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.420
 always very exciting varied yes 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.920
 not to be, and it is not 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.420
 incredibly dangerous as in these 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.310
 Hollywood classic bodyguard 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.019
 I have to pay the costs because the conclusion 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.480
 be throwing the shotgun, so to speak 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.560
 risk your own life then say so 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.989
 that you have to do 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.780
 that could happen but then has to 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.670
 I do the whole thing but in any case 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.989
 is already very dangerous because the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.450
 Violence is also enormous 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.060
 has gone up and the crime is 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.319
 just very high and thereby the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.609
 occupation also very dangerous 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.380
 recently it has yes and colleagues from 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.760
 those in berlin he catches he has his 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.340
 Company daughter protected as 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.090
 this mask man this mysterious 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.799
 has also emerged in the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.030
 Shotgun was thrown heavy 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.900
 but actually I have injured now 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.459
 read in her book 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.139
 so you have to safety 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.260
 had to look at the capital 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:02.810
 visited as I said then the crime 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.910
 I've been growing up since 1982 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.530
 this business and I work directly 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.889
 At the friends then I write 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.480
 Feel this enormous violence 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:14.200
 and also this disrespect 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.739
 towards the police and ours 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.870
 rule of law and therefore much has to be done 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.340
 be just about the whole thing 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.950
 fight by sharing more 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.849
 hire cops and get on more 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.620
 show presence 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.340
 in public compared to the 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.800
 citizens so that every citizen 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.019
 they met police officers is a problem 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.300
 I can approach him and maybe 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.530
 then the civil courage was also rising 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.720
 because you know that police nearby 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.010
 and moment is not as in forest and so 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.910
 The police will work closely 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.110
 Together she and her 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.819
 security company so you 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.340
 do not consider themselves as competition and 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.540
 have their own, so to speak 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.220
 philosophy of security but quite 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.500
 consciously closely cooperate with the police 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.299
 yes that's very important to me too 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.400
 at that time not to be dependent too 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.010
 be from the criminal scene 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.530
 direct contact with the police and us 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.079
 work very closely together and that is 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.360
 well- known scene and I think so 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.670
 good that we are the call we are the one 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.950
 extended arm of the police and us 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.220
 help the police where it helps 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.290
 going 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.970
 you also have as a bouncer in the 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.320
 all the time so worked with the hab 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.940
 I always made strange experiences 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.039
 most of them are yes I would not have it 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.560
 of them but kind of after that 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.370
 everything in the muscle but nothing in the motto 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.870
 pear 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.940
 why is it so in disrepute? 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.130
 get the job that is the great 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.250
 problem bouncer have in addition to the profession 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.990
 or the property unfortunately relative 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.030
 be rude and fast 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.000
 strike and but look a whole 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.550
 other policy with my company we are 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.889
 rather, who bounces we are 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.630
 service provider we are the customer 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.460
 King and so must the guest 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.070
 and many understand that 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.810
 Do not bounce and that's how it should be 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.669
 the profession of gatekeeper is one 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.440
 service you have as 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.460
 personal protection as a bodyguard quite completely 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.620
 many celebs already protected 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.570
 how do you meet these people? 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.139
 some are all to the hospital 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.390
 full of marriages or not grateful and 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.570
 happy towards him 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.780
 everything was nice friendly in general 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.940
 we support yes if a protector 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.860
 song comes leonardo dicaprio or 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.960
 Rebecca is mostly in her own person 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.460
 She respectfully or rather like that 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.140
 a bit like I say like the annoying one 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.910
 Tear fly which is always near 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.960
 which is two important but actually 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.710
 yes a bit uncomfortable because that one 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.230
 is lucky 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.480
 One will accept duration usually 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.730
 is just part of the bodyguard of 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.080
 directly from America he gets to the 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.880
 top off there is a tight 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.700
 relationship of trust and we are just 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.960
 over to there to show the ways because 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.370
 we know the localities 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.720
 not as close a relationship as with 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.400
 to an actual bodyguard of 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.050
