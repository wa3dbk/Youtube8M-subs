what's up guys recently have had a ton

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.099 
what's up guys recently have had a ton
of<00:00:04.290> work<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.770> do<00:00:04.920> so<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.460> haven't<00:00:05.850> been<00:00:06.109> making

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
of work to do so I haven't been making

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.780 
of work to do so I haven't been making
videos<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.770> we're<00:00:07.890> supporting<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.460> as<00:00:08.610> well

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
videos that we're supporting you as well

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.730 
videos that we're supporting you as well
as<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.120> want<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.290> but<00:00:11.120> anyway<00:00:12.380> you<00:00:13.380> guys<00:00:13.500> have

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
as I want to but anyway you guys have

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.179 
as I want to but anyway you guys have
been<00:00:13.830> asking<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.549> for<00:00:15.020> a<00:00:16.020> while<00:00:16.049> now<00:00:16.379> so

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.099 

this<00:00:23.189> one<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:24.000> an<00:00:24.180> operating<00:00:24.570> system<00:00:24.720> file

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
this one is in an operating system file

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.689 
this one is in an operating system file
so<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.650> average<00:00:25.800> person<00:00:26.189> probably<00:00:26.369> isn't

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
so the average person probably isn't

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.589 
so the average person probably isn't
going<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.880> know<00:00:26.970> what<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.449> this

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
going to know what to do with this

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.480 
going to know what to do with this
unless<00:00:28.500> they<00:00:28.710> know<00:00:28.830> how<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> actually<00:00:29.250> install

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
unless they know how to actually install

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.950 
unless they know how to actually install
the<00:00:29.880> DLLs<00:00:30.269> but<00:00:30.510> they're<00:00:30.599> not<00:00:30.689> going<00:00:30.900> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the DLLs but they're not going to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.940 
the DLLs but they're not going to
probably<00:00:31.830> not<00:00:32.099> know<00:00:32.309> where<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:33.829> like<00:00:34.829> you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
probably not know where to like you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.200 
probably not know where to like you
can't<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.280> put<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.460> into<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.790> program<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:37.320> I

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
can't just put it into a program so I

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.369 
can't just put it into a program so I
will<00:00:39.210> show<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.480> how<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.719> install<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:44.899> draw<00:00:45.899> so

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
will show you how to install it draw so

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.590 
will show you how to install it draw so
copy<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> file<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.750> drop<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.930> into<00:00:49.079> system<00:00:49.739> 32

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
copy the file and drop it into system 32

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.889 
copy the file and drop it into system 32
just<00:00:51.600> control<00:00:52.500> V<00:00:53.449> I'm<00:00:54.449> not<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.870> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
just control V I'm not going to do it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.750 
just control V I'm not going to do it
because<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.890> need<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.460> right<00:00:56.579> now

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760

because I don't need it right now
and<00:00:57.230> then<00:00:58.230> drop<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.590> into<00:00:58.710> system<00:00:59.129> while<00:00:59.280> 64<00:00:59.910> if

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
and then drop it into system while 64 if

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.450
