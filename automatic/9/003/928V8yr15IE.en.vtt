00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 but I start the program with news 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.290
 dermatology 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.099
 Have you heard of skin you look at? 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.190
 super current treatment that eliminates wrinkles 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.880
 those fine wrinkles and ensures 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.220
 elasticity of the skin 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.920
 the company knows when the skin on the face 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.010
 of the cervix begins to have fine wrinkles 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.890
 with that cracked look this is 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 loss of hydration by hydration and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.520
 loss of collagen 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.250
 then with the aging people lose 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.590
 these substances and also sometimes 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.079
 intake of cigarette alcohol at the time of 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.070
 menopause are times that the skin 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.120
 aging more then the skin with appearance 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.030
 dehydrated is a skin that is unusual 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.890
 one more skin loses its shine without 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.750
 life there are several factors that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.500
 interfere with the lack of hydration of the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.469
 skin 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.719
 internal and external factors so 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.250
 the question of age is not age then 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.129
 the aging 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.350
 sun exposure the more sun you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.689
 exposure during his or her lifetime. 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.299
 will be aging skin to skin 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.820
 loses hyaluronic acid that this 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.580
 collagen loses this hydration 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.860
 it will get easier the leaks will go 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.650
 then popping people so 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.000
 work in the sun what garden drink 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.799
 alcoholic smoking at times obesity 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.810
 some diseases also by some 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.070
 medicines can cause aging 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.290
 precocious 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.200
 The novelties in moisturizing creams for 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.079
 face and body are innumerable assets that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.530
 promise true miracles but we will 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.090
 be consistent clear crimes help 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.060
 more others less 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.280
 but the changes are not as 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.640
 significant help then the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.070
 creams are part of the daily routine of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.799
 skin care they do not replace 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.479
 procedures but they are 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.700
 important even treatment for the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.790
 but the cream does not have any 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.020
 ability to penetrate deeply 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.149
 so it 's more of a care 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.239
 ari a care with the day to day including 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.610
 the moisturizer a vitamin sunscreen 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.220
 and together with them we can make the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.459
 active procedures with vitamins and 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.500
 Specific acid creams all help in 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.349
 fight against loss of skin wrinkles 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.810
 but nothing compares the effect produced 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.099
 when the directly placed substance 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.739
 inside the dermis 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.170
 the skin booster is a new concept in 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.299
 hydration and rejuvenation 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.299
 the application is in the dermis itself 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.950
 it's a very new procedure 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.750
 recent procedure and he to the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.510
 What is hyaluronic acid? 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.120
 procedure is an injectable procedure 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.690
 where hyaluronic acid is applied in the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.340
 a layer of skin and the dermal layer 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.349
 there it will stimulate the absorption of water 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.450
 and the formation of collagen 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.670
 When we use a cream, crime does not 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.069
 has this capability does not have this 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.599
 depth of penetration 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.209
 So we are believing that 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.790
 need in the correct place then the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.230
 production will be much faster in 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.569
 greater quantity 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.000
 this will form collagen will become 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.400
 absorb water the skin will become more 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.290
 firm will get more moisturized 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.840
 what is the result that we perceive 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.540
 improve the skin 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.700
 wrinkles then fine wrinkles improves 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.970
 sagging skin and improved appearance 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.670
 the texture rejuvenates is made with 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.739
 needle and this is injectable is a 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.180
 quiet procedure because needle is 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.099
 very thin 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.680
 but it is an injectable procedure only 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.630
 can be performed by physician is done in 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.639
 doctor's office then a 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.340
 dermatologist or plastic surgeon 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.950
 can carry out the treatment 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.859
 it consists of three sessions if one 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.419
 month and then a maintenance and 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.790
 this maintenance depends on the 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.880
 more or less aging can be 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.370
 semiannually or annually an application 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.739
 application is practically painless since 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.750
 the needle is very thin this method 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.069
 covers the entire area affected by 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.640
 dryness and small wrinkles 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.799
 on the face and on the lap in the hands are the 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.590
 common places and the neck region 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.470
 on the face it is applied in the region of 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.300
 eyelids in the region of the Chinese mustache 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.590
 cheeks, it all adds up, it helps a lot. 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.590
 most important right 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.340
 doctor what happens is from inside to 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.400
 out 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.479
 how is the effect of this hyaluronic acid 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.729
 for hydration 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.789
 so the chronic one is a used product 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.979
 in the weather law for quite some time 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.030
 so when we talk about 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.190
 it is already a good product. 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.740
 consecrated is a filler that the 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.650
 dermatologists more use the 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.690
 skin booster it does not come to give volume 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.750
 so when the person has a very wrinkle 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.120
 that it needs to turn the volume 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.759
 We're going to do a base fill. 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.280
 of steel and agronomy then that is the skin 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.180
 booster is the hyaluronic acid chain 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.060
 Light 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.729
 so it is more liquid it is applied 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.220
 and it absorbs water with the absorption of 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.770
 water and stimulates the formation of collagen 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.409
 with this, it acts on aging as 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.090
 we have quoted in only three sessions with 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.880
 interval of six months 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.039
 the difference is already quite remarkable change that 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.650
 occurs from the inside out 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:32.530
 the patients show enough is not a 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.320
 immediate result procedure then 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.380
 if the application is made around 30 to 40 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.090
 days you see the first results 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.190
 because it is not the substance that people 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.680
 apply that will make the result is the 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.710
 skin that will produce that will absorb the 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.720
 water to produce collagen and then it will be 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.599
 the aesthetic result and what is the difference 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.070
 before and after is very good improves the 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.830
 skin texture 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.349
 the fine wrinkles disappear the contour 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.729
 facial enhances the skin with a 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:06.070
 most beautiful appearance with glow invites 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.960
 Slows Plastic Surgery Slows Help 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.669
 enough so it is suitable for 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.889
 patients who do not want to make a 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.770
 plastic surgery for patients who do not 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.150
 want to make the month deeper or to 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.460
 complement that already 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.630
 but this kind of treatment sometimes 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.120
 patient has undergone a 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.490
 surgery made a more intense laser like 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.500
 laser co2 and want to do the maintenance 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.120
 procedures. 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.120
 then it is indicated in these two cases
