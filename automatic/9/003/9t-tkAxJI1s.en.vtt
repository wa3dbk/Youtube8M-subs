00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.759
 the boat are tips so today again 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.269
 another video today for 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.139
 Improvement of the more joint exercise 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.830
 kneeling and one or the other 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.410
 problems 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.180
 so here mobilization to exercise and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.150
 Although the first exercise I start with 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.359
 left a sideways step this one 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.029
 90 degrees to the hip and there will be tasted 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.560
 He knuckles as far as possible 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.300
 to move forward and again the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.460
 complete rome to the rear 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.040
 It is important that you are in one 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 Moving axis 8 works and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.450
 according to the whole course analog 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.239
 on the right side so left and right 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.329
 should go in the change and 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.980
 always as possible before the squat as 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.219
 She can do pure warming exercises 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.750
 be accepted as well as in addition 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.250
 a training-free day 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 important here is the difference 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.260
 between exercises and mobilization 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.789
 Exercise has a completely different claim 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.680
 we are not the actin here and here 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.720
 myosin pretty apart sunscreen 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.450
 try a complete complete 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.270
 rome so range of movement the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.360
 full movement in the joint too 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.740
 reach out to simply possible the whole 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.310
 So really one to prevent 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.810
 stability and accordingly one 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.630
 to achieve proper movement there 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.270
 the second exercise here is the multi exercise 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.490
 one leg is stretched the other is 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.340
 bent over the knee becomes the 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.979
 hip to the side 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 moved accordingly opens one 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.329
 Of course in the field of adoption 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.030
 that means the adductors are here 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.909
 each to the opposite side of the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.759
 make complete movement and important 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.770
 also in the field of squat because we 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.479
 have a merck a r articulated 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.579
 Exercise and this more joint exercise 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.770
 works just when the knee 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.390
 and the hip neatly this 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.070
 can initiate movements the same 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.070
 of course also on the opposite side 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.610
 Here you can see that pretty well 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.410
 really worked only from the hip 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.470
 she gets a bit weird from the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.980
 exercise though 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.560
 definitely achieved a magnificent 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.450
 Agility to that effect is like that 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.550
 much to this exercise what else can i do 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.320
 say 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:30.440
 multi- channeled exercise or mobilization 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.670
 Exercise is also very important and the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.890
 third exercise here 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.690
 the full movement sequence here in 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.330
 The body stretching over the hips 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.640
 It is also important that the lower body 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.790
 So accordingly, give away from 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.890
 Kneeling up to your feet remains fixed 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.080
 and it's always just the stretch over 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.670
 the hip reaches us is important 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.470
 do not stretch the hips completely 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.240
 through that the back is overstretched 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.520
 is but only up to the 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.050
 movement in the course also the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.750
 movement can be initiated 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.370
 That's the basic thing about yourself 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.410
 maybe get used to it should 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.320
 really just a full video 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.150
 not further and to conclusion 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.430
 once again a good knee bend 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.760
 really try as deep as here 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.860
 possible to come with the po i start 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.440
 with the simple variant first the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:24.590
 Hands on his head behind his head 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:28.480
 Fixation yes, if possible from 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.420
 Body focus is deep behind the body 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.550
 straight and here the variation with 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.830
 opened arms stretched upwards 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.050
 just to just the 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.390
 stabilization as well as the 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.610
 body stretching is important here 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.930
 poor people stay stretched one or the other 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.970
 others are already there difficulties 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.150
 have and I wish you much fun 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.150
 there 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.889
 O
