00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
comm okay so right here we have the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.990 
comm okay so right here we have the
motor<00:00:20.400> fuse<00:00:21.410> what<00:00:22.410> you'll<00:00:22.560> find<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.760> your

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
motor fuse what you'll find is if your

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.390 
motor fuse what you'll find is if your
motor<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.480> completely<00:00:25.320> dead<00:00:25.619> nothing<00:00:26.279> is

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
motor is completely dead nothing is

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160 
motor is completely dead nothing is
happening<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.970> push<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> button<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.930> just

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
happening you push the button and just

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.560 
happening you push the button and just
nothing<00:00:28.349> happens<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> one<00:00:30.420> that's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
nothing happens this is the one that's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to check this this is where you're going

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.200 
to check this this is where you're going
to<00:00:43.079> need<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.440> use<00:00:43.649> an<00:00:43.829> ohm<00:00:44.070> meter<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.789> hope<00:00:45.090> you

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to need to use an ohm meter I hope you

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.569 
to need to use an ohm meter I hope you
can<00:00:45.360> see<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.719> okay<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.800> buy<00:00:46.980> these<00:00:47.190> for

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
can see this okay you can buy these for

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.819 
can see this okay you can buy these for
about<00:00:47.789> ten<00:00:48.090> dollars<00:00:48.480> over<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:48.899> Home<00:00:49.079> Depot<00:00:49.110> and

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
about ten dollars over at Home Depot and

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.920 
about ten dollars over at Home Depot and
you're<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.670> want<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> set<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
you're going to want to set it to the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.130 
you're going to want to set it to the
ohms<00:00:52.289> resistance<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.719> thing<00:00:55.110> does

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
ohms resistance and all this thing does

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.389 
ohms resistance and all this thing does
is<00:00:56.329> when<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.360> touch<00:01:00.590> when<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.710> touch<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.190> two

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
is when you touch when you touch the two

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.100 
is when you touch when you touch the two
prongs<00:01:02.730> together<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.690> shows<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
prongs together it just shows that

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.609 
prongs together it just shows that
electricity<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.670> flow<00:01:05.700> through<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.270> circuit

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
electricity can flow through the circuit

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.170 
electricity can flow through the circuit
that's<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.010> does<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.400> nothing<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.850> plugged

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that's all it does so nothing is plugged

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.429 
that's all it does so nothing is plugged
in<00:01:09.390> obviously<00:01:09.720> when<00:01:09.930> you've<00:01:10.049> got<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.290> thing

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
in obviously when you've got this thing

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
in obviously when you've got this thing
open<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.310> plugged<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.850> because

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
open do not have it plugged in because

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.630 
open do not have it plugged in because
you've<00:01:12.750> got<00:01:12.869> 220<00:01:13.799> volts<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.490> will

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you've got 220 volts and that will

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.600 
you've got 220 volts and that will
really<00:01:14.909> give<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> bad<00:01:15.630> day<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.460> all

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
really give you a bad day so that's all

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.850 
really give you a bad day so that's all
we're<00:01:17.790> doing<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.210> vo<00:01:18.450> meter<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.229> mean<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:19.799> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
we're doing is vo meter I mean for you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
we're doing is vo meter I mean for you
guys<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.310> Orion<00:01:20.820> girls<00:01:21.060> already<00:01:21.479> use<00:01:21.780> ohm

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
guys that Orion girls already use ohm

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
guys that Orion girls already use ohm
meters<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.310> kind<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.670> moot

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
meters and if this is kind of a moot

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.330 
meters and if this is kind of a moot
point<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.450> anyway<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.560> all<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.979> does<00:01:26.159> it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
point but anyway that's all it does it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.039 
point but anyway that's all it does it
shows<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.790> electricity<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.780> flow<00:01:27.810> through

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
shows the electricity can flow through

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.950 
shows the electricity can flow through
okay<00:01:29.060> alright<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.659> put<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
okay alright so I'm going to put the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.620 
okay alright so I'm going to put the
meter<00:01:31.200> right<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.880> hoping<00:01:33.450> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
meter right there and I'm hoping that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.969 
meter right there and I'm hoping that
you'll<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.900> able<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.170> see<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.650> okay<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.829> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
you'll be able to see that okay and you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.710 
you'll be able to see that okay and you
can't<00:01:38.340> come<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.450> change

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
can't come here so I'm going to change

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.760 
can't come here so I'm going to change
the<00:01:39.900> camera<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.320> little<00:01:40.470> bit<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.410 

think<00:01:48.370> you<00:01:48.520> can<00:01:48.700> just<00:01:49.060> see<00:01:49.270> everything

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
think you can just see everything

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.670 
think you can just see everything
they're<00:01:51.330> good

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
they're good

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.460 
they're good
all<00:01:54.310> right<00:01:54.520> pair<00:01:55.150> of<00:01:55.240> needlenose<00:01:55.540> pliers

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
all right pair of needlenose pliers

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.350 
all right pair of needlenose pliers
let's<00:01:56.800> go<00:01:57.010> through<00:01:57.370> these<00:01:57.610> so<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.030> this<00:01:58.150> video

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
let's go through these so in this video

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.420 
let's go through these so in this video
we're<00:01:58.690> going<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.870> go<00:01:58.990> through<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.980> cycling

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
we're going to go through the cycling

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.330 
we're going to go through the cycling
thermostat<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.720> motor<00:02:01.930> fuse<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.800> then

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
thermostat and the motor fuse and then

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.540 
thermostat and the motor fuse and then
the<00:02:03.490> next<00:02:03.760> video<00:02:04.030> we're<00:02:04.680> going<00:02:05.680> on<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.280> heat

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
the next video we're going on the heat

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.210 
the next video we're going on the heat
box<00:02:06.850> over<00:02:07.180> here<00:02:07.360> so<00:02:08.229> pull<00:02:08.860> off<00:02:08.950> your<00:02:09.100> wires<00:02:09.630> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
box over here so pull off your wires and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.130 
box over here so pull off your wires and
you<00:02:12.220> need<00:02:12.370> both<00:02:12.640> wires<00:02:13.090> off<00:02:13.540> because<00:02:13.810> when

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
you need both wires off because when

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.810 
you need both wires off because when
you're<00:02:14.290> testing<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.890> if<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.190> leave<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> wire

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
you're testing this if you leave a wire

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.140 
you're testing this if you leave a wire
on<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:17.410> can<00:02:17.590> be<00:02:17.709> picking<00:02:18.130> up<00:02:18.250> another<00:02:18.700> part<00:02:19.000> of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
on you can be picking up another part of

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.540 
on you can be picking up another part of
the<00:02:19.270> circuit<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:19.870> some<00:02:20.050> cases<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:21.040> both<00:02:21.250> wires

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
the circuit in some cases so both wires

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.300 
the circuit in some cases so both wires
off<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.180> all<00:02:22.720> we're<00:02:22.900> looking<00:02:23.050> for<00:02:23.590> if<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.070> is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
off and all we're looking for if this is

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.760 
off and all we're looking for if this is
good<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:25.180> needle<00:02:25.630> will<00:02:26.170> go<00:02:26.200> all<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> way<00:02:26.620> to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
good the needle will go all the way to

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.130 
good the needle will go all the way to
the<00:02:26.980> right<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.860> there<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.489> goes<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.630> this<00:02:31.840> is

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
the right and there it goes so this is

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.380 
the right and there it goes so this is
good<00:02:32.410> that's<00:02:32.650> all<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.160> need<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.610> know<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
good that's all you need to know the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.530 
good that's all you need to know the
motor<00:02:34.739> thermal<00:02:35.739> fuse<00:02:36.070> is<00:02:36.100> good<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.880> this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
motor thermal fuse is good and this

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.620 
motor thermal fuse is good and this
motor<00:02:37.810> thermal<00:02:38.380> fuse<00:02:38.709> is<00:02:38.739> not<00:02:39.220> resettable<00:02:39.790> so

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
motor thermal fuse is not resettable so

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.130 
motor thermal fuse is not resettable so
if<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.470> has<00:02:41.739> failed<00:02:42.160> remember<00:02:43.090> change<00:02:43.750> out<00:02:43.989> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
if it has failed remember change out the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.530 
if it has failed remember change out the
cycling<00:02:44.620> thermostat<00:02:44.860> as<00:02:45.489> well<00:02:45.760> otherwise

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
cycling thermostat as well otherwise

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.970 
cycling thermostat as well otherwise
you'd<00:02:46.780> be<00:02:46.810> going<00:02:47.110> back<00:02:47.320> in<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.650> doing<00:02:47.709> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
you'd be going back in and doing the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.760 
you'd be going back in and doing the
whole<00:02:48.130> job<00:02:48.400> again<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.989> what<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.350> generally

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
whole job again and what you generally

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.460 
whole job again and what you generally
find<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:51.370> has<00:02:51.430> failed<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.930> cycling

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
find that this has failed the cycling

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.550 
find that this has failed the cycling
thermostat<00:02:53.650> hasn't<00:02:54.430> been<00:02:54.810> shutting<00:02:55.810> down<00:02:56.050> as

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
thermostat hasn't been shutting down as

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.310 
thermostat hasn't been shutting down as
fast<00:02:56.860> as<00:02:57.100> it<00:02:57.220> should<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:57.489> and<00:02:58.080> that's<00:02:59.080> why

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
fast as it should have and that's why

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.960 
fast as it should have and that's why
it's<00:02:59.500> not<00:02:59.650> tout<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.040> fuse<00:03:00.400> over<00:03:00.730> here

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
it's not tout this fuse over here

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.060 
it's not tout this fuse over here
alright<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.140> let's<00:03:02.290> go<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.650> cycling

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
alright so let's go to the cycling

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.470 
alright so let's go to the cycling
thermostat<00:03:03.280> now<00:03:03.880> pop<00:03:04.209> off<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.480> wires<00:03:06.480> there

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
thermostat now pop off the wires there

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.220 
thermostat now pop off the wires there
we<00:03:07.630> go<00:03:09.030> try<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.090> get<00:03:10.209> my<00:03:10.330> turns<00:03:10.660> out<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.049> road

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
we go try and get my turns out the road

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.820 
we go try and get my turns out the road
here<00:03:11.820> again<00:03:12.820> all<00:03:13.060> we're<00:03:13.239> looking<00:03:13.360> for<00:03:13.600> is<00:03:14.110> for

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
here again all we're looking for is for

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.910 
here again all we're looking for is for
the<00:03:14.890> meter<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.730> move<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:17.140> from<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.590> terminal

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
the meter to move so from this terminal

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.470 
the meter to move so from this terminal
to<00:03:18.370> this<00:03:18.519> terminal<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:21.640> cycling<00:03:22.269> thermostat

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
to this terminal that cycling thermostat

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.350 
to this terminal that cycling thermostat
is<00:03:23.110> good<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:24.250> only<00:03:24.489> thing<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.850> could<00:03:25.060> be<00:03:25.180> bad

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
is good the only thing that could be bad

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.810 
is good the only thing that could be bad
about<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:26.049> again<00:03:26.320> if<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.709> had<00:03:26.920> failed<00:03:27.310> is

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
about it again if this had failed is

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.449 
about it again if this had failed is
that<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.870> wasn't<00:03:29.110> shutting<00:03:29.709> down<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.160> heat

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
that it wasn't shutting down the heat

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.880 
that it wasn't shutting down the heat
early<00:03:31.090> enough<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.900> got<00:03:32.049> too<00:03:32.290> hot<00:03:32.320> in<00:03:32.739> this

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
early enough and it got too hot in this

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.150 
early enough and it got too hot in this
area<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.549> knocked<00:03:34.390> out<00:03:34.690> this<00:03:35.200> thermal<00:03:35.799> fuse

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
area and knocked out this thermal fuse

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.479 
area and knocked out this thermal fuse
here<00:03:36.459> now<00:03:37.209> on<00:03:37.570> your<00:03:38.320> particular<00:03:38.650> machine<00:03:39.220> you

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
here now on your particular machine you

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.460 
here now on your particular machine you
may<00:03:39.670> find<00:03:40.060> that<00:03:40.329> there's<00:03:40.510> an<00:03:40.600> additional<00:03:41.170> two

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
may find that there's an additional two

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.340 
may find that there's an additional two
terminals<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:43.180> top<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.870> cycling

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
terminals on the top of the cycling

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.500 
terminals on the top of the cycling
thermostat<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.250> has<00:03:45.400> four<00:03:45.730> wires<00:03:46.060> going

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
thermostat that it has four wires going

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.650 
thermostat that it has four wires going
to<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:48.100> also<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.700> terminals<00:03:49.269> will<00:03:49.480> be

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
to it and also the terminals will be

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.259 
to it and also the terminals will be
smaller<00:03:50.110> these<00:03:50.500> terminals<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.959> 2.5<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:55.000> size

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
smaller these terminals a 2.5 the size

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.979 
smaller these terminals a 2.5 the size
is<00:03:55.450> 2.5<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.650> these<00:03:57.489> terminals<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.690> small

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
is 2.5 and these terminals the small

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.590 
is 2.5 and these terminals the small
ones<00:03:59.260> I<00:03:59.380> think<00:03:59.440> a<00:03:59.650> 1.75<00:04:00.459> something<00:04:01.299> like<00:04:01.420> that

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
ones I think a 1.75 something like that

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.090 
ones I think a 1.75 something like that
but<00:04:02.500> anyway<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.880> these<00:04:04.359> two<00:04:04.660> top<00:04:04.989> ones<00:04:05.290> they

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
but anyway so these two top ones they

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.950 
but anyway so these two top ones they
actually

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
actually

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.310 
actually
a<00:04:07.020> little<00:04:07.560> heat<00:04:07.890> halo<00:04:08.520> which<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.360> fixed<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.020> the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
a little heat halo which is fixed to the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.490 
a little heat halo which is fixed to the
top<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.040> thermostat<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.080> that<00:04:13.080> is<00:04:13.260> how

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
top of the thermostat and that is how

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.260 
top of the thermostat and that is how
you<00:04:13.560> get<00:04:13.890> your<00:04:13.950> different<00:04:14.280> temperatures<00:04:15.090> it

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
you get your different temperatures it

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.780 
you get your different temperatures it
turns<00:04:15.540> on<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.930> little<00:04:16.230> heat<00:04:16.500> halo<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.280> it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
turns on the little heat halo and it

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.940 
turns on the little heat halo and it
tricks<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.270> thermostat<00:04:19.020> into<00:04:19.380> cycling

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
tricks the thermostat into cycling

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.060 
tricks the thermostat into cycling
sooner<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:21.720> that's<00:04:22.020> basically<00:04:22.710> how<00:04:22.830> you're

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
sooner so that's basically how you're

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.650 
sooner so that's basically how you're
getting<00:04:23.160> different<00:04:23.580> temperatures<00:04:24.120> in<00:04:24.420> some

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
getting different temperatures in some

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.540 
getting different temperatures in some
of<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.840> newer<00:04:25.080> models<00:04:25.140> but<00:04:26.100> on<00:04:26.160> this<00:04:26.310> one<00:04:26.490> we

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
of the newer models but on this one we

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.530 
of the newer models but on this one we
just<00:04:26.700> have<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.210> two<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.850> don't<00:04:30.060> need<00:04:30.360> to

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
just have the two you don't need to

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.470 
just have the two you don't need to
check<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.470> heat<00:04:31.710> halo<00:04:32.250> if<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.730> have<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.090> the

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
check the heat halo if you have the the

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.900 
check the heat halo if you have the the
newer<00:04:33.810> model<00:04:34.260> with<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.890> heat<00:04:35.100> halo<00:04:35.490> on<00:04:35.700> it

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
newer model with the heat halo on it

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.180 
newer model with the heat halo on it
again<00:04:36.510> these<00:04:36.750> it's<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.170> two<00:04:37.380> big<00:04:37.620> terminals

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
again these it's the two big terminals

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.670 
again these it's the two big terminals
your<00:04:38.370> concern<00:04:38.760> with<00:04:39.030> so<00:04:39.630> both<00:04:40.080> of<00:04:40.110> these<00:04:40.350> check

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
your concern with so both of these check

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.560 
your concern with so both of these check
out<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.100> good<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.910> actually<00:04:42.210> there's<00:04:42.420> nothing

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
out is good and actually there's nothing

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.450 
out is good and actually there's nothing
wrong<00:04:42.900> with<00:04:42.960> this<00:04:43.230> dryer<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:43.710> plugged<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.250> in<00:04:44.340> to

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
wrong with this dryer I plugged it in to

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.720 
wrong with this dryer I plugged it in to
check<00:04:44.730> it<00:04:44.940> but<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:46.620> can<00:04:46.770> see<00:04:46.980> how<00:04:47.250> full<00:04:47.700> of

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
check it but you can see how full of

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.550 
check it but you can see how full of
lint<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:48.420> so<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:48.930> would<00:04:49.020> all<00:04:49.140> have<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.380> be

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
lint it is so that would all have to be

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.470 
lint it is so that would all have to be
cleaned<00:04:49.860> out<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.220> everything<00:04:50.610> all<00:04:50.970> right<00:04:51.180> so
