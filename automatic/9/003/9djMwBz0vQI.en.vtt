00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.280 

okay<00:02:30.069> I'm<00:02:30.160> getting<00:02:30.519> a<00:02:30.870> signal<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:32.079> is

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
okay I'm getting a signal that is

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:42.559 
okay I'm getting a signal that is
showing<00:02:33.010> good<00:02:33.489> high<00:02:33.819> numbers<00:02:36.390> 85<00:02:37.390> 90<00:02:39.269> 8675

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.150 

right<00:02:43.569> there<00:02:43.810> I've<00:02:44.049> shrunk<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.620> feel<00:02:44.920> down

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
right there I've shrunk that feel down

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.559 
right there I've shrunk that feel down
to<00:02:45.310> where<00:02:45.430> all<00:02:45.639> I'm<00:02:45.819> doing<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.150> finding<00:02:46.420> the

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
to where all I'm doing is finding the

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.009 
to where all I'm doing is finding the
center<00:02:47.019> of<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.230> object<00:02:48.269> right<00:02:49.269> there<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.900> the

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
center of the object right there is the

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.479 
center of the object right there is the
center<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.620> right<00:02:50.859> in<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.010> middle<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.310> that

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
center so right in the middle of that

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.090 
center so right in the middle of that
hole<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.180> center<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> search<00:02:52.900> coil<00:02:53.230> okay

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
hole the center of the search coil okay

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.259 
hole the center of the search coil okay
we're<00:02:54.459> gonna<00:02:54.549> dig<00:02:54.850> this<00:02:55.269> shows<00:02:55.870> promise<00:02:57.269> so

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
we're gonna dig this shows promise so

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.830 
we're gonna dig this shows promise so
we'll<00:02:58.450> see<00:02:58.690> here<00:03:02.790> i'm<00:03:03.790> doing<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.090> flap<00:03:04.389> that<00:03:04.660> you

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
we'll see here i'm doing a flap that you

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.160 
we'll see here i'm doing a flap that you
peel<00:03:05.079> back<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.389> always<00:03:07.569> want<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.049> do<00:03:08.139> a

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
peel back and you always want to do a

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.620 
peel back and you always want to do a
flap<00:03:08.500> these<00:03:09.459> then<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.760> graphs<00:03:10.030> can<00:03:10.150> be<00:03:10.269> put

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
flap these then the graphs can be put

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.080 
flap these then the graphs can be put
back<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.079> you'll<00:03:11.170> still<00:03:11.440> be<00:03:11.590> rich<00:03:12.090> structure

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
back and you'll still be rich structure

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.870
