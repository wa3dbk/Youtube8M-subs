the growth of this program I think it's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.110 
the growth of this program I think it's
a<00:00:59.879> sleeping<00:01:00.329> giant<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:01.640> think<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:02.940> been

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
a sleeping giant I think that it's been

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
a sleeping giant I think that it's been
done<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.719> before<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.040> time<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.549> do

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
done here before I think it's time to do

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.789 
done here before I think it's time to do
it<00:01:05.729> again<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.510> don't<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.680> do

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it again I don't think that you can do

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.070 
it again I don't think that you can do
it<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.130> day<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.700> don't<00:01:09.270> think<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.900> can

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
it in a day I don't think that you can

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.560 
it in a day I don't think that you can
do<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.560> season<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.220> don't<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
do it in a season I don't think that you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.660 
do it in a season I don't think that you
can<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.140> one<00:01:13.439> recruiting<00:01:13.920> class<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
can do it in one recruiting class I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.940 
can do it in one recruiting class I
don't<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> with<00:01:16.320> one<00:01:16.710> head

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
don't think you can do it with one head

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.660 
don't think you can do it with one head
coach<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:18.450> think<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.350> with

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the right things and for me to have an

the right things and for me to have an
opportunity<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.220> at<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> place<00:01:33.200> where<00:01:34.200> Frank

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
opportunity to be at a place where Frank

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.530 
opportunity to be at a place where Frank
Beamer<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> head<00:01:35.220> coach<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.610> think<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.030> is

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
Beamer as the head coach I think is is

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.960 
Beamer as the head coach I think is is
huge<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.439> could<00:01:37.619> turn<00:01:37.820> Beamer<00:01:38.820> ball

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
huge and if we could turn Beamer ball

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
huge and if we could turn Beamer ball
football<00:01:39.540> style<00:01:39.810> into<00:01:40.259> Beamer<00:01:40.619> ball

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
football style into Beamer ball

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
football style into Beamer ball
basketball<00:01:41.100> style<00:01:41.759> then<00:01:42.329> maybe<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.930> build

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
basketball style then maybe we can build

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.649 
basketball style then maybe we can build
exactly<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:44.189> he's<00:01:44.369> built<00:01:44.700> we're<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.540> gonna

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
exactly what he's built we're just gonna

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.910 
exactly what he's built we're just gonna
have<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.869> build<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.200> new<00:01:46.290> arena<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:46.799> we

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
have to build a new arena because we

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.280 
have to build a new arena because we
can't<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.280> 70,000<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.049> not

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.109 
we all figure out that it's about us
that's<00:01:58.530> how<00:01:58.770> we<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:59.159> build<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.729> that's

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that's how we can build it and that's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.030 
that's how we can build it and that's
how<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.630> grow<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.860> up

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
how we can grow it it's going to be up

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.100 
how we can grow it it's going to be up

appreciate
but<00:02:14.110> we've<00:02:14.290> all<00:02:14.560> got<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:15.010> come<00:02:15.040> together<00:02:15.400> to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
but we've all got to come together to

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.290 
but we've all got to come together to
get<00:02:16.420> this<00:02:16.660> thing<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.590> level<00:02:18.130> maybe<00:02:18.910> that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
get this thing to the level maybe that

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.479 
get this thing to the level maybe that
it<00:02:19.450> hasn't<00:02:19.840> been<00:02:19.989> in<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.230> long<00:02:20.560> long<00:02:20.830> time<00:02:20.890> and

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
it hasn't been in a long long time and

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.300 
it hasn't been in a long long time and
that<00:02:22.060> will<00:02:22.209> be<00:02:22.330> great<00:02:22.980> but<00:02:23.980> what's<00:02:24.190> even

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
that will be great but what's even

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.430 
that will be great but what's even
better<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:25.000> get<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.510> where<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.110> away

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
better is to get it where it's that away

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.460 
better is to get it where it's that away
and<00:02:26.709> it's<00:02:27.130> sustainable<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.450> happens<00:02:28.810> game

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
and it's sustainable and it happens game

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.220 
and it's sustainable and it happens game
after<00:02:29.860> game<00:02:30.069> season<00:02:30.580> after<00:02:30.910> season<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.840> that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
after game season after season and that

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.830 
after game season after season and that
becomes<00:02:32.680> our<00:02:32.890> brand<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:34.030> becomes<00:02:34.390> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
becomes our brand and that becomes the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.050 
becomes our brand and that becomes the
way<00:02:34.989> we<00:02:35.230> do<00:02:35.440> things<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.010> our<00:02:36.370> culture<00:02:36.880> becomes
