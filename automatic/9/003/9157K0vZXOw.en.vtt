then<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.440> diversity<00:02:08.830> transformer<00:02:09.340> so

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
then that's the diversity transformer so

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.970 
then that's the diversity transformer so
let's<00:02:09.580> do<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.729> in<00:02:09.820> real<00:02:09.910> time
