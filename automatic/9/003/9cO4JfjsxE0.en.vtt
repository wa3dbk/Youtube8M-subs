00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.600
 The risk of fire is latent in each combustible material, depending on whether 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.899
 fuels will be the rate of fire growth 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.659
 and the violence with which it manifests 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.519
 the fires that are developed based on vegetable and animal fats and oils 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.369
 they are classified internationally as fire of the type k 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.460
 this derives from the English kitchens that means kitchen since they are fires 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.359
 that take place in kitchens 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.830
 basically from restaurants 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.200
 grease of potassium is the extinguishing agent indicated especially for the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.140
 combat 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.730
 of this kind of fire 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.130
 the only one that allows you to distinguish them suddenly 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.310
 safe and without risk of rezende 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.940
 the games about fats and oils are the most difficult to control if not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.010
 it has an adequate extinguishing agent takes hold for a long time 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.240
 heat time 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.240
 and once a certain temperature is reached the fire becomes 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.450
 uncontrollable if you do not restrict yourself with the proper means 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.750
 both in restaurants and in places where industrial kitchens are used 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.740
 harris so fry hours there will be a latent risk of fire 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.130
 if to this is added the poor maintenance and cleaning of the duct 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.480
 smoke extraction 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.480
 and filters to partners 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.560
 the extinguishing systems for kitchen are currently based on acetate 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.780
 potassium 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.850
 This is because 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.750
 here other executing agents 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.180
 - be effective 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.300
 and cause serious damage to people or facilities 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.160
 as an example we can cite the water in the form of full jets 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.490
 that produces a thermal shock so violent that it becomes a 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.930
 true explosion I buy fat section or boiling oil towards all 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.950
 addresses 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.880
 to the chemical powder tri class that obstructs the vision and does not prevent the surrender of 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.040
 fire I know it's not a good coolant and finally carbon dioxide 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.040
 that acts by displacing the oxygen but that does not get to cool in a 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.869
 definitive fuel 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.779
 the extinguishing systems for kitchen are classified in manual systems that 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.969
 are those in which man intervenes 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.859
 and automatic systems 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.169
 constant hector a detection device 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.790
 a power station 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.149
 and an extinguishing device 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:30.349
 have adequate equipment for extinguishing fires in kitchens 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.549
 It should be understood as an investment and not as an expense although most of the 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.180
 Sometimes it is understood too late
