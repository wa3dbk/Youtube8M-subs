costs focus to cast which was actually

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.650 
costs focus to cast which was actually
an<00:00:35.010> interesting<00:00:35.430> idea<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.180> kind<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.480> took

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
an interesting idea but it kind of took

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.470 
an interesting idea but it kind of took
a<00:00:36.719> little<00:00:36.989> bit<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> fun<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.309> me

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
a little bit of the fun out of it for me

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
a little bit of the fun out of it for me
however<00:00:39.480> time<00:00:39.899> moves<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.590> survival<00:00:41.250> is

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
however time moves on and survival is

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.250 
however time moves on and survival is
back<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> fairly<00:00:42.120> stable<00:00:42.510> position<00:00:42.870> once

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
back in a fairly stable position once

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.279

damaged and in your situation focusing
shot<00:03:45.690> doesn't<00:03:45.989> really<00:03:46.109> work<00:03:46.350> for<00:03:46.380> the

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
shot doesn't really work for the

shot doesn't really work for the
survival<00:03:47.040> hunter<00:03:47.310> at<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.579> moment<00:03:47.970> mostly

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
survival hunter at the moment mostly

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.840 
survival hunter at the moment mostly
because<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:49.109> how<00:03:49.380> clunky<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:50.190> long<00:03:50.340> cast<00:03:50.609> time

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
because of how clunky the long cast time

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.120 
because of how clunky the long cast time
makes<00:03:51.209> survival<00:03:51.720> play<00:03:52.200> but<00:03:52.590> realistically

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
makes survival play but realistically

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.620 
makes survival play but realistically
we'll<00:03:53.400> just<00:03:53.579> have<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.819> wait<00:03:53.970> until<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.420> damage

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
we'll just have to wait until the damage

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.990 
we'll just have to wait until the damage
number<00:03:55.170> buffs<00:03:55.889> and<00:03:56.130> tweaks<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.760> being

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
number buffs and tweaks of being

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.879 
number buffs and tweaks of being
finalized<00:03:57.810> before<00:03:58.019> really<00:03:58.440> making<00:03:58.799> a

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
finalized before really making a

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.979 
finalized before really making a
judgment<00:03:59.370> call<00:03:59.579> of<00:03:59.849> that<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:00.720> overall

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
judgment call of that but overall

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.809 
judgment call of that but overall
survival<00:04:01.380> is<00:04:01.620> not<00:04:01.769> looking<00:04:02.010> too<00:04:02.160> bad<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.609> can

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
survival is not looking too bad I can

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.670 
survival is not looking too bad I can
see<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.120> really<00:04:03.269> stacking<00:04:03.690> up<00:04:03.900> nicely<00:04:04.230> come

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
see it really stacking up nicely come

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.920 
see it really stacking up nicely come
late<00:04:04.980> game<00:04:05.280> especially<00:04:05.579> with<00:04:06.090> multi<00:04:06.630> strike

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
late game especially with multi strike

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.229 
late game especially with multi strike
but<00:04:07.530> yeah<00:04:07.829> not<00:04:08.099> too<00:04:08.280> much<00:04:08.310> change<00:04:08.790> going<00:04:08.880> on

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
but yeah not too much change going on

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.200
