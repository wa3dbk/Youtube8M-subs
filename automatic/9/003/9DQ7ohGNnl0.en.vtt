00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
of times when you're working on an idea

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.119 
of times when you're working on an idea
you<00:02:29.250> come<00:02:29.640> up<00:02:29.760> against<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.959> know<00:02:31.140> you

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
you come up against the you know you

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.949 
you come up against the you know you
just<00:02:32.489> come<00:02:32.700> up<00:02:32.819> against<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.239> impasse<00:02:33.659> and

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
just come up against the impasse and

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.440 
just come up against the impasse and
then<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.620> get<00:02:34.799> away<00:02:34.920> from<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.700> or<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.180> maybe

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
then you get away from it or you maybe

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.960 
then you get away from it or you maybe
go<00:02:36.629> surfing<00:02:37.049> or<00:02:37.200> something<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.709> then<00:02:38.400> your

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
go surfing or something and then your

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.619 
go surfing or something and then your
idea<00:02:39.329> kind<00:02:39.659> of<00:02:39.920> flows<00:02:40.920> better<00:02:41.819> so<00:02:42.299> it's<00:02:42.540> a

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
idea kind of flows better so it's a

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.780 
idea kind of flows better so it's a
little<00:02:42.870> bit<00:02:43.109> of<00:02:43.260> both<00:02:43.530> it's<00:02:43.769> kind<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:43.980> like<00:02:44.190> you

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
little bit of both it's kind of like you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.360 
little bit of both it's kind of like you
know<00:02:44.819> plugging<00:02:45.420> away<00:02:45.510> at<00:02:45.930> something<00:02:46.439> taking<00:02:47.310> a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
know plugging away at something taking a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.960 
know plugging away at something taking a
break

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
break

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.809 
break
maybe<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:49.260> know<00:02:49.379> go<00:02:49.590> surfing<00:02:50.040> or<00:02:50.159> something<00:02:50.549> I

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
maybe you know go surfing or something I

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.970 
maybe you know go surfing or something I
find<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.599> lot<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.780> times<00:02:52.019> have<00:02:52.470> we<00:02:52.500> got<00:02:52.799> in<00:02:52.920> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
find a lot of times have we got in the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.610 
find a lot of times have we got in the
water<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.459> we<00:02:53.879> kind<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.299> things<00:02:55.230> sort<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.560> come

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
water and we kind of things sort of come

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.420 
water and we kind of things sort of come
together<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.280> bit<00:02:57.769> I've<00:02:58.769> had<00:02:58.950> some<00:02:59.190> times

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
together a bit I've had some times

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.599 
together a bit I've had some times
actually<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.680> traveling<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.799> plane<00:03:01.889> you

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
actually of traveling on a plane you

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:03.860 
actually of traveling on a plane you
know<00:03:02.639> where<00:03:02.940> you're<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.239> sitting<00:03:03.599> there<00:03:03.629> and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
know where you're just sitting there and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.020 
know where you're just sitting there and
just<00:03:03.959> staring<00:03:04.920> into<00:03:05.239> space<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.840> just<00:03:07.590> kind<00:03:07.920> of

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
just staring into space and just kind of

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.270 
just staring into space and just kind of
waiting<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.329> something<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.950> pop<00:03:10.950> into<00:03:11.190> your

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
waiting for something to pop into your

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.349 
waiting for something to pop into your
head<00:03:11.579> I<00:03:11.609> guess<00:03:12.859> that's<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.069> thing<00:03:14.310> about

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
head I guess that's the thing about

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.080 
head I guess that's the thing about
surfing<00:03:15.359> and<00:03:15.510> music<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.200> being<00:03:16.739> really<00:03:17.459> hard

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
surfing and music is being really hard

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.259 
surfing and music is being really hard
to<00:03:18.420> just<00:03:18.720> kind<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.620> hang<00:03:19.859> on<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.310> me<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:20.730> it's

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
to just kind of hang on to me so it's

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.420 
to just kind of hang on to me so it's
always<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.870> matter<00:03:22.079> of<00:03:22.260> chasing<00:03:22.769> as<00:03:22.859> well<00:03:23.099> or

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
always a matter of chasing as well or

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.539 
always a matter of chasing as well or
getting<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:24.090> good<00:03:24.959> session<00:03:25.230> one<00:03:25.560> day<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:25.919> you

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
getting a good session one day and you

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.119 
getting a good session one day and you
know<00:03:26.699> missing<00:03:27.569> out<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.959> next<00:03:28.139> day<00:03:28.379> and<00:03:28.650> same

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
know missing out the next day and same

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.939 
know missing out the next day and same
with<00:03:29.459> music<00:03:29.639> you<00:03:30.030> know<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.269> might<00:03:30.569> have<00:03:30.599> a

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
with music you know you might have a

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.319 
with music you know you might have a
time<00:03:31.949> where<00:03:32.129> you<00:03:32.250> feel<00:03:32.609> like<00:03:32.819> you<00:03:33.030> know<00:03:33.150> you're

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
time where you feel like you know you're

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.869 
time where you feel like you know you're
just<00:03:33.359> playing<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.959> really<00:03:34.139> good<00:03:34.319> solo<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.919> then

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
just playing a really good solo and then

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.789 
just playing a really good solo and then
you<00:03:36.000> try<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.209> reproduce<00:03:36.599> that<00:03:37.079> feeling<00:03:37.620> and

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
you try to reproduce that feeling and

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.460 
you try to reproduce that feeling and
when<00:03:38.099> it<00:03:38.190> comes<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.489> improvising<00:03:39.239> with<00:03:40.109> music

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
when it comes to improvising with music

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.309 
when it comes to improvising with music
especially<00:03:40.769> you<00:03:41.430> can't<00:03:41.790> keep<00:03:42.449> repeating<00:03:42.870> you

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
especially you can't keep repeating you

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.990 
especially you can't keep repeating you
can<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.220> just<00:03:44.430> doesn't<00:03:44.699> happen

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
can but it just doesn't happen

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.949 
can but it just doesn't happen
automatically<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.169> that's<00:03:46.590> why<00:03:47.959> more

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
automatically so that's why more

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.289 
automatically so that's why more
structure<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.650> good<00:03:49.889> with<00:03:50.340> surfing<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.060> and

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
structure is good with surfing and and

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.280 
structure is good with surfing and and
with<00:03:52.019> playing<00:03:52.290> music<00:03:52.349> I<00:03:52.739> think

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.370 

structure<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.410> important

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.440 

you
