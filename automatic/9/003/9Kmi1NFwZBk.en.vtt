little<00:01:18.210> hook<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:18.570> talking<00:01:18.960> about

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
little hook I'm talking about

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.660 
little hook I'm talking about
so<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.409> depending<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.799> how<00:01:19.890> many<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.130> these<00:01:20.460> you
