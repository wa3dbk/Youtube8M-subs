you<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:49.769> need<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:49.980> extended<00:02:50.700> cutting<00:02:50.970> pads

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.190 
for the XL die that the perfect setting
is<00:02:53.310> make<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> sandwich<00:02:54.090> out<00:02:54.359> of<00:02:54.420> them<00:02:54.659> put<00:02:55.049> them

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
is make a sandwich out of them put them

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.770 
is make a sandwich out of them put them
on<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.440> big<00:02:55.530> shot<00:02:55.859> and<00:02:56.129> i<00:02:56.670> found<00:02:57.000> i<00:02:57.209> need<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.629> a

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
on the big shot and i found i need it a

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.410 
on the big shot and i found i need it a
little<00:02:58.019> bit<00:02:58.290> more<00:02:58.680> off<00:02:59.069> with<00:02:59.609> this<00:02:59.819> so<00:03:00.030> i<00:03:00.060> used

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
little bit more off with this so i used

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.710 
little bit more off with this so i used
a<00:03:00.569> little<00:03:00.870> bit<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.019> cardboard<00:03:01.829> on<00:03:02.040> top<00:03:02.720> crank

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
it out some of the more solid edges were

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.349 
it out some of the more solid edges were
fine<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.470> once<00:03:19.650> i<00:03:19.769> take<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.159> out<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.549> have<00:03:20.909> this

length so just slide that around so till

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.330 
length so just slide that around so till
it<00:03:57.329> matches<00:03:57.810> where<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.079> design<00:03:58.409> is<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.099> then

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
it matches where the design is and then
