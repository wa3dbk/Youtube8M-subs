00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Y 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.840
 today we are going to start with the cord and 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.809
 let's do it from what are your 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.130
 varieties let's see the colors let's 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.510
 Let's see 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.300
 the causes of these colors and well then 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.010
 start with the condom always because it is 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.930
 a stone that seems to me 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.750
 very interesting from the point of view 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.460
 of varieties that apart from the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.200
 importance you may have for the two 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.150
 more stones 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.270
 most relevant of this group which is the 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.220
 spin but also because it is a stone 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.110
 which has many types of impurities 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.180
 many types of inclusions and that we 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.280
 it serves so that learning on the margin 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.210
 also that it is a stone subject to 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.130
 possible treatments of many types 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.830
 in addition also to synthesis and even 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.150
 also to determination already from another 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.540
 point of view the determination of 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.210
 provenances because well let's go to 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.700
 see that they are very different 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.340
 the characteristics that are going to leave us 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.580
 the deposits of one site or another 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:37.540
 because for all that I like to start with 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.540
 the hill so we just go to the mess 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.620
 well we start by analyzing what they are 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.230
 the varieties and colors of the colon 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.420
 let's see that there are many minerals that 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.770
 the same thing happens to the heart and that 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.410
 is what happens to them because simple and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.390
 plainly that many may appear 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.270
 varieties that can appear many 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.150
 colors of fact you can you can think 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.000
 that a condom can have any 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.090
 color that you imagine we were wings 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 tourmalines in the quartz are even 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.970
 they see them and those who are going to give 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.920
 place to stops for example 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.770
 the chemical composition of the colin don 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.380
 trio pcia of aluminum in principle no 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.970
 should you provide us with any kind 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.280
 of color indeed the variety that we're going 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.990
 to meet with only trio cheese 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.600
 aluminum would be this we are seeing 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.910
 a colorless variety that is known with 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.370
 the name of leuco acid 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.350
 the crazy sapphire had his moment in 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.690
 our sector because it was used as 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.790
 imitation in diamond especially by 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.560
 a single argument that of hardness and 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.650
 We will see when we analyze 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.540
 physical properties that the condom is the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.090
 next in the ranking after the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.010
 diamond as far as hardness is concerned 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.050
 the most expensive varieties the most 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.690
 interesting what doubt is that they are the and 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.080
 the sapphire the ruby ​​owes its color to the rust 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.360
 chronic that can lead to several 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.370
 qualities based on the amount of 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.050
 that element and also of the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.500
 inclusions that we'll see that also 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.720
 they will affect the quality of the stone 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.610
 the blue variety known as sapphire 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.890
 its color is titanium and oxide 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.610
 iron is very important that when 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.489
 let's talk about just acid and a 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.560
 denomination that we make in an invoice 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.569
 they have a note whatever with a 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.870
 certified when we say sapphire we 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.390
 we are referring to the blue variety 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.349
 of not being this way of being of another color 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.750
 hard different from red or blue 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.819
 we should call them sapphire and 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.290
 the color that comes with it from steel 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.379
 yellow sapphire orange etc etc 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.879
 yes it is true that also 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.069
 commercially recognized to acids 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.170
 that are not blue or the laces that 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.510
 they are neither blue nor red are they 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.140
 they call fantasy sapphires is a 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.970
 commercial denomination of agreement well 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.909
 there is a very interesting variety that is 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.209
 sapphire peace happens and it is orange 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.220
 and it owes its color to the chrome as in the 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.049
 ruby case for the same thing we're going to 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.350
 find in the orange variety is 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.690
 an orange or even a little rose 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.419
 careful because it can be confused with 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.520
 other orange sapphires that owe their 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.729
 color to ferric oxide as in the 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.539
 sapphire case the price can be 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:32.669
 scandalously different there are other 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.699
 variables also very interesting as 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.070
 is the yellow variety are sapphires that 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.940
 they come practically from before 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.150
 they named it is now white 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.910
 the green sapphire very own of australia 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.800
 also of ceylon or ry lanka and 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.470
 careful because they are objects of 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.340
 treatments are again sapphires that 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.260
 in themselves they do not have much value and many 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.860
 Sometimes they are objects are a breeding ground 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.449
 to treat them to get the blue 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.180
 then there are other interesting varieties 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.820
 which are interesting not because of the color 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.889
 but for the effect of the same as 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.330
 we are seeing here this same one too 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.630
 it is known that the name of asturias 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.479
 they are stars caused by millions of 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.960
 inclusions in the form of articulated 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.000
 needle that are usually rutile and 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.180
 how the structure of the condom is 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.910
 hexagonal or court directed the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.040
 needles intersect forming 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.970
 as a six-pointed star on 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:39.000
 three three-pronged pardon when they have 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.470
 a color intense enough a 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.910
 transparency also by tend to be 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.130
 quite opaque but if they have good 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.540
 Good color transparency and effect 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.610
 It is very well marked and very well 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.630
 decided can achieve prices too 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.849
 of scandal, well, well, this 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.569
 serves as an introduction to varieties 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.189
 good as an introduction and really like 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.469
 here we finished talking about the 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:06.879
 varieties as you see the colors can 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:09.189
 be very different and this also good 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.899
 Well, it may already be a problem and 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.939
 we are already setting the bases a bit 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:15.669
 of the work of the geologist and the 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:19.599
 professional jewelry and many times 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:23.919
 color has given us that good 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:25.749
 because they have not studied geology as 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.379
 the color is an argument from 

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:31.389
 identification sometimes even labels 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:34.149
 so we saw a red life we ​​said that 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.159
 the ruby and the sapphire blue and if it was green 

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:37.719
 Emerald such as good will 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:40.149
 go watching along the course like this 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.339
 it's not like that and in the end you're even going to 

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:44.199
 end thinking since I'll have 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:46.209
 I did this or what will I have followed 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.709
 these classes if I really was before 

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:51.249
 much quieter because now I'm going to 

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:54.099
 doubt everything that I enter for my 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:57.029
 hands very well then we see the side not 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:57.029
 we go up in the next
