hi<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.680> just<00:00:01.890> going<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.070> sort<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.550> show<00:00:02.850> you

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
hi I'm just going to sort of show you

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.860 
hi I'm just going to sort of show you
how<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.300> micro<00:00:04.110> trains<00:00:04.670> couplers<00:00:05.670> work<00:00:05.910> with

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
how the micro trains couplers work with

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.970 
how the micro trains couplers work with
the<00:00:07.580> magnetic<00:00:08.580> on<00:00:08.880> coupler<00:00:09.590> which<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.740> down

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
the magnetic on coupler which is down

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.660 
the magnetic on coupler which is down
here<00:00:11.120> and<00:00:12.259> that<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.650> actually<00:00:14.190> two

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
here and that one is actually two

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.210 
here and that one is actually two
magnetic<00:00:15.630> catches<00:00:16.910> go<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:18.470> four<00:00:19.470> cupboard

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
magnetic catches go for four cupboard

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.720 
magnetic catches go for four cupboard
doors<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.850> put<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.869> back<00:00:22.350> now<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.519> you

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
doors and that put that back now as you

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.589 
doors and that put that back now as you
can<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:24.439> if<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.650> look<00:00:25.680> carefully<00:00:26.599> reverse

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
can see if you look carefully reverse

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.100 
can see if you look carefully reverse
this<00:00:27.779> up<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:30.570> watch<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.900> couple<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.260> move<00:00:33.110> see

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
this up you watch a couple of move see

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.500 
this up you watch a couple of move see
it<00:00:34.170> spring<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.460> now<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.059> delayed

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it spring up it's now in the delayed

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.479 
it spring up it's now in the delayed
position<00:00:38.870> so<00:00:39.870> when<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> drive<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.980> past<00:00:41.219> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
position so when you drive it past it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.369 
position so when you drive it past it
springs<00:00:41.820> back<00:00:41.940> again<00:00:44.480> now<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.930> think

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
springs back again now just so you think

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.010 
springs back again now just so you think
I<00:00:46.680> will<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.700> will<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.149> driving<00:00:48.390> mine<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.899> I'll

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
I will get will be driving mine and I'll

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.729 
I will get will be driving mine and I'll
just<00:00:49.230> uncouple<00:00:50.239> not<00:00:51.239> necessarily<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.559> can

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
just uncouple not necessarily as you can

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.209 
just uncouple not necessarily as you can
see<00:00:52.890> from<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.610> pulling<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.270> forward

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
see from here this is pulling it forward

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:57.439 
see from here this is pulling it forward
did<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.610> never<00:00:56.760> uncoupled<00:00:57.360> it

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
did you see it never uncoupled it

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.319 
did you see it never uncoupled it
because<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> stayed<00:00:58.710> nice<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.100> tight<00:00:59.329> okay

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
because it stayed nice and tight okay

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.549 
because it stayed nice and tight okay
I'm<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.600> try<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.930> show<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.109> how<00:01:01.410> this

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
I'm going to try and show you how this

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.820 
I'm going to try and show you how this
on<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> coupling<00:01:02.250> works<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.439> go

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
on the coupling works and you can go

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.980 
on the coupling works and you can go
straight<00:01:04.890> back<00:01:05.309> onto<00:01:05.670> these<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.180> prefer<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> go

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
straight back onto these I prefer to go

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.280 
straight back onto these I prefer to go
forward<00:01:08.150> alright<00:01:09.150> sorry<00:01:11.900> let's<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.229> if

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
forward alright sorry let's just see if

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.840 
forward alright sorry let's just see if
we<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.619> close<00:01:14.360> all<00:01:15.360> forward<00:01:16.850> right

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
we can get close all forward right

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.289 
we can get close all forward right
through<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> couplers<00:01:18.930> bouncing<00:01:20.000> go<00:01:21.000> back

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
through the couplers bouncing go back

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.550 
through the couplers bouncing go back
just<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.659> fraction<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.259> forward

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
just a fraction and then go forward

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.399 
just a fraction and then go forward
again<00:01:25.710> no<00:01:25.979> uncouple<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> best<00:01:28.259> thing

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
again no uncouple and the best thing

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
again no uncouple and the best thing
about<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.329> see<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.820> right

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
about this and you can see this right

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.399 
about this and you can see this right
here<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.600> they<00:01:33.689> called<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.960> blade

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
here is in what they called the blade

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.399 
here is in what they called the blade
position<00:01:35.210> which<00:01:36.210> means<00:01:36.420> now<00:01:36.750> when<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.200> come

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
position which means now when you come

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.020 
position which means now when you come
back<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:39.090> Loko<00:01:39.770> they're<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:41.189> offset<00:01:44.030> to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
back the Loko they're actually offset to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760 
back the Loko they're actually offset to
each<00:01:45.149> other<00:01:45.420> which<00:01:45.689> means<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:46.500> push

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
each other which means you can then push

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
each other which means you can then push
it<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.070> move<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.520> where<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.790> want<00:01:47.899> like

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
it and move it to where you want like

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.719 
it and move it to where you want like
this<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.350> example<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:50.009> are<00:01:50.729> not<00:01:51.210> coupled

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
this for example and are not coupled

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.270 
this for example and are not coupled
however<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.149> push<00:01:54.450> them

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.620 

it's<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.880> example<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.299> could<00:02:00.420> push

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
it's like this for example I could push

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.410 
it's like this for example I could push
that<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:00.899> up<00:02:00.960> onto<00:02:01.320> more<00:02:01.500> typica<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.420> then

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that one up onto more typica and then

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.130 
that one up onto more typica and then
drive<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.840> forward

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.809 

there<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.710> if<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> need<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.519> pick<00:02:08.670> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
there you go and if you need to pick it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.699 
there you go and if you need to pick it
up<00:02:08.910> again<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.690> already<00:02:09.869> off<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
up again because it's already off of the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.270 
up again because it's already off of the
coupler<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:12.200> back<00:02:13.200> up<00:02:13.410> connect<00:02:13.950> work<00:02:14.099> your

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
coupler and back up connect work your

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.420 
coupler and back up connect work your
new<00:02:14.400> usually<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:17.120> now<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.269> go
