 all this is a classic dance lesson 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.489
 it lasts about one and a half to two hours 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.110

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.729

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740

 classical dance includes such sections 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.180
 like a machine mean jumps and fingers 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.280

 koskov and shoes in general, I tell you then this 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.420
 I'll tell you everything in the next issue also 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.759
 there is rock folk dance 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.810
 a huge number of different folk 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:47.250
 dancing spanish flamenco 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.350
 hungarian tatar god their huge 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.899
 quantity and they are all beautiful in their own way 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.729
 Generally folk dance is one of mine 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.930
 most favorite items after marriage 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.710
 classical dance 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.210
 it's just that love is here too 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.270
 present historical dance this 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.509
 dance that we study dance aesthetics 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.789
 past centuries 17 18 19 centuries 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.530
 they are many they are different and every dance needs 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.410
 to dance in a certain manner 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.660
 and well actually that's all modern 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.099
 dance but here everything is clear 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.870
 direction as a contemporary it 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.590
 present in many theaters know 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.660
 it seems to me 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.940
 fine my vision but i think that 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.549
 contemporary she gives an understanding of what 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.500
 your body can be much bigger than you 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.150
 you think 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.129
 because modern dance works 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 absolutely other muscle groups and absolutely 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:40.010
 differently you present certain 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.340
 movements and in principle I am very 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.440
 like this kind of dancing is the direction 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.390
 but there was no dance duet duet dance 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.769
 these are guys tanis dancers and dancers 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:56.840
 and and initially in any sick and duet 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:59.290
 the dance was called sdd in sdd entered three 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.620
 and even that when a couple dance together 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.959
 variation of each of them is solo and code but in 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.000
 principle duet can differ somehow 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.459
 then basically they partner partner 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.870
 are always together well that's all in 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.230
 Basically, I think for a start 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.569
 and know enough to say that there despite 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.069
 the fact that ballet is very strict very 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.260
 disciplined and art 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.130
 yet it is fun especially if you 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.410
 there are some funny close friends or 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.090
 fellow students 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.889
 is it really cool when good 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.639
 team it always raises you 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:38.269
 mood gives motivation to work so 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:40.400
 okay something I started talking in general that 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.109
 I want to say in the next issues rather 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.760
 I will tell you about what is 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.769
 ballet shoes 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.139
 what they are made of as they are 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.230
 arranged and how all the same ballerina 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:53.419
 stand on my fingers for paid I think 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.139
 it will be interesting to you so that 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.139
 see you soon
