00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.920
 private areas are located 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.040
 The trees should be treated with care 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.780
 nobody should pluck at it and the 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.130

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.170
 you should just keep this in mind and yes 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.030
