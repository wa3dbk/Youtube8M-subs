 died in an eventual fight in my 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.690
 investigations right that every dog 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.520
 it was made mainly to fight 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.380
 these two are willing to get 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.600
 until the units ie die 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.549
 fighting and it's not an option to run away from their 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.020
 opponent the dogs are considered in 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.600
 various places in the world like dogs 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.250
 dangerous and extremely dangerous

 rules for your position both the gib 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.940
 like the bull terrier have the most 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.220
 lethal bites that have 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.420
 knowing now if in the confrontation 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.610
 one with the other 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.100
 would win the one that better conditions are 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.049
 the bull has a better bite but the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.970

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.630
 more flexible than yours if I would have to 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.640
 decide between one or the other who would leave 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.730
 is that I would ignore biting first and in what 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.830
 match according to this one 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.320
 we can decide how far we'll see 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.120
 by themselves although appearance and 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.060
 registered background has gained more 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.060
