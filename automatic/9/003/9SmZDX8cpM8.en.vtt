00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.820
 let's see the tractor from the front 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.119
 comments something does not give me the wind 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.490

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:07.820
 Belarus sensor devices we 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.670
 battery capacity 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.570

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.200
 oil on the pressure of some kind on the air 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.200
 accordingly hours 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:39.110

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.039
 we do not understand these forms 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.880
 these five meters and let's try
