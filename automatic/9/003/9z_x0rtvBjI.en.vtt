00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.080 

one<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.340> the<00:00:05.430> interesting<00:00:05.609> things<00:00:06.000> about

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.090 
one of the interesting things about

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.660 
one of the interesting things about
chemistry<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.050> it's<00:00:07.439> so<00:00:07.649> cooking<00:00:08.430> it's

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
chemistry is that it's so cooking it's

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.570 
chemistry is that it's so cooking it's
amazing<00:00:09.270> if<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.080> think<00:00:10.230> about<00:00:10.530> our<00:00:10.889> biscuits

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
amazing if you think about our biscuits

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.129 
amazing if you think about our biscuits
and<00:00:11.760> cakes<00:00:11.910> they're<00:00:12.570> essentially<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.049> same

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
and cakes they're essentially the same

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.580 
and cakes they're essentially the same
thing<00:00:13.619> they're<00:00:14.100> what<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.760> flour<00:00:15.000> sugar<00:00:15.389> eggs

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
thing they're what the flour sugar eggs

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.380 
thing they're what the flour sugar eggs
what<00:00:16.590> makes<00:00:16.800> them<00:00:17.010> different<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.090> amount

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
what makes them different is the amount

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.200 
what makes them different is the amount
that<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:18.990> put<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.440> and<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.859> order<00:00:20.339> you<00:00:20.849> put<00:00:21.089> it

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
that you put in and the order you put it

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.579 
that you put in and the order you put it
in<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.900> will<00:00:22.019> make<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.259> huge<00:00:22.289> difference

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589 
in and that will make a huge difference

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.300 
in and that will make a huge difference
into<00:00:23.249> the<00:00:23.369> final<00:00:23.999> product<00:00:24.720> now<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.679> next

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
into the final product now the next

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.909 
into the final product now the next
obvious<00:00:26.550> step<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.109> top<00:00:28.650> another

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
obvious step with this top another

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.159 
obvious step with this top another
particle<00:00:29.369> stick<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.390> change<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> order<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
particle stick is to change the order of

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.130 
particle stick is to change the order of
things<00:00:31.259> so<00:00:32.189> what<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.820> did<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.300> start<00:00:33.900> at<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
things so what I did was start at the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
things so what I did was start at the
copper<00:00:34.380> salt<00:00:34.590> head<00:00:34.950> add<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.550> ascorbic<00:00:36.000> acid

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
copper salt head add the ascorbic acid

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.420 
copper salt head add the ascorbic acid
and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:36.780> yellow<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:37.710> we've<00:00:37.920> got<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> large

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
and then yellow then we've got a large

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.030 
and then yellow then we've got a large
Pacific<00:00:38.970> eight<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.810> relatively<00:00:40.800> large

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
Pacific eight out of relatively large

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.370 
Pacific eight out of relatively large
copper<00:00:41.520> particles<00:00:41.940> because<00:00:42.900> I<00:00:42.990> added<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
copper particles because I added the

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.260 
copper particles because I added the
ascorbic<00:00:43.800> acid<00:00:43.830> first<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:45.030> thing

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
ascorbic acid first the thing

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.420 
ascorbic acid first the thing
automatically<00:00:46.170> occurs<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.250> what

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
automatically occurs to you but what

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.520 
automatically occurs to you but what
happens<00:00:47.790> if<00:00:47.970> you<00:00:48.090> add<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> arms<00:00:48.810> first

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
happens if you add the arms first

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.300 
happens if you add the arms first
so<00:00:49.920> moving<00:00:50.280> up<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.790> is<00:00:51.120> our<00:00:52.080> 250<00:00:52.860> milliliters

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
so moving up here is our 250 milliliters

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.840 
so moving up here is our 250 milliliters
of<00:00:53.400> water<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.910> 10<00:00:54.090> grams<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.690> sulfur

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
of water with 10 grams of sulfur

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
of water with 10 grams of sulfur
I've<00:00:56.850> changed<00:00:57.180> another<00:00:57.510> variable<00:00:58.020> as<00:00:58.110> well

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
I've changed another variable as well

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.630 
I've changed another variable as well
I've<00:00:58.530> actually<00:00:58.710> doubled<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> amount<00:00:59.280> of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
I've actually doubled the amount of

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.800 
I've actually doubled the amount of
water<00:00:59.880> because<00:01:00.330> I'm<00:01:00.420> changing<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
water because I'm changing the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.340 
water because I'm changing the
concentration<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:02.070> what

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
concentration and what

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.920 
concentration and what
helping<00:01:02.710> by<00:01:02.920> gently<00:01:03.519> concentration<00:01:04.299> is<00:01:04.509> that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
helping by gently concentration is that

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.109 
helping by gently concentration is that
the<00:01:05.019> reaction<00:01:05.470> is<00:01:05.530> slightly<00:01:05.799> slower<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.970> it's

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
the reaction is slightly slower and it's

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.910 
the reaction is slightly slower and it's
a<00:01:07.180> simple<00:01:07.509> thing<00:01:07.780> but<00:01:07.960> more<00:01:08.290> things<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:08.710> have

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
a simple thing but more things you have

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.310 
a simple thing but more things you have
crammed<00:01:09.310> together<00:01:09.549> nearer<00:01:10.060> to<00:01:10.330> get<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:11.140> more

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
crammed together nearer to get the more

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.710 
crammed together nearer to get the more
likely<00:01:11.350> they<00:01:11.920> are<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.040> react<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:13.210> less<00:01:13.479> they

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
likely they are to react the less they

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.960 
likely they are to react the less they
are<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.530> further<00:01:14.770> apart<00:01:15.159> they<00:01:15.369> are<00:01:15.549> the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
are and the further apart they are the

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.670 
are and the further apart they are the
slower<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.479> reaction<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:16.930> going<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.140> be<00:01:17.200> it's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
slower the reaction is going to be it's

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.340 
slower the reaction is going to be it's
pretty<00:01:17.890> obvious<00:01:18.280> okay<00:01:18.610> so<00:01:19.360> those<00:01:19.930> kind<00:01:20.259> of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
pretty obvious okay so those kind of

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.170 
pretty obvious okay so those kind of
things<00:01:20.560> are<00:01:20.860> going<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.220> have<00:01:21.399> an<00:01:21.520> effect<00:01:21.970> on

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
things are going to have an effect on

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.719 
things are going to have an effect on
the<00:01:22.539> end<00:01:22.780> product<00:01:23.380> of<00:01:23.560> what<00:01:23.860> we<00:01:24.039> make<00:01:24.340> and

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
the end product of what we make and

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.550 
the end product of what we make and
we're<00:01:24.880> looking<00:01:25.210> for<00:01:25.360> really<00:01:25.630> tiny<00:01:25.869> particles

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
we're looking for really tiny particles

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.760 
we're looking for really tiny particles
particles<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.159> will<00:01:27.280> stay<00:01:27.490> in<00:01:27.670> solution<00:01:28.270> so

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
particles it will stay in solution so

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.590 
particles it will stay in solution so
what<00:01:29.770> I'm<00:01:29.890> thinking<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.430> okay<00:01:30.880> let's<00:01:31.360> change

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
what I'm thinking is okay let's change

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.389 
what I'm thinking is okay let's change
the<00:01:31.840> order<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.229> lot<00:01:32.409> until<00:01:32.619> we<00:01:32.920> instead<00:01:33.310> of

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
the order a lot until we instead of

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.760 
the order a lot until we instead of
making<00:01:33.909> those<00:01:34.060> big<00:01:34.330> lump<00:01:34.690> particles<00:01:35.500> that<00:01:35.619> we

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
making those big lump particles that we

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.550 
making those big lump particles that we
did<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:36.039> first<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:36.850> I'm<00:01:37.330> taking<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.259> semi

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
did it first and I'm taking the semi

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.070 
did it first and I'm taking the semi
reduced<00:01:39.069> green<00:01:39.850> solution<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.750> adding<00:01:40.960> the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
reduced green solution and adding the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.380 
reduced green solution and adding the
arm<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:41.649> let's<00:01:42.280> take<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:43.000> original

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
arm to that let's take the original

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.109 
arm to that let's take the original
copper<00:01:43.929> sulfate<00:01:44.440> solution<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.610> arms

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
copper sulfate solution and the arms

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.050 
copper sulfate solution and the arms
first<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.929> then<00:01:47.200> add<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.619> ascorbic<00:01:48.580> acid<00:01:48.610> to

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
first and then add the ascorbic acid to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.410 
first and then add the ascorbic acid to
cap<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.479> after<00:01:50.080> it's<00:01:50.229> been<00:01:50.470> reduced<00:01:51.130> so<00:01:51.880> that's

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
cap it after it's been reduced so that's

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:06.359 
cap it after it's been reduced so that's
what<00:01:52.659> we're<00:01:52.810> gonna

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.620 

I'm<00:02:06.429> gonna<00:02:06.579> shout

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
I'm gonna shout

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.080 
I'm gonna shout
but

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.170 

we<00:02:14.330> stuff<00:02:14.660> it<00:02:14.690> up<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.080> clue

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
we stuff it up in clue

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.540 
we stuff it up in clue
put<00:02:16.450> on

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:36.030 

we<00:02:20.120> much

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.150 

go<00:02:37.040> from<00:02:37.340> whoring

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.309 

because<00:02:44.990> going<00:02:45.990> on

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.860 

and<00:02:49.650> now

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.030 

it's<00:02:54.019> reducing

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.620 

okay<00:02:58.040> so<00:02:58.100> let<00:02:58.490> have<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.640> half<00:02:58.880> an<00:02:59.030> hour<00:03:04.210> and<00:03:05.210> that

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
okay so let have a half an hour and that

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:16.470 
okay so let have a half an hour and that
is<00:03:05.780> absolutely<00:03:05.930> fascinating

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.000 

look<00:03:17.480> at<00:03:17.630> that<00:03:18.160> lovely

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
look at that lovely

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
look at that lovely
okay<00:03:22.010> we'll<00:03:22.220> give<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.400> little<00:03:22.760> while<00:03:22.879> the

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
okay we'll give that little while the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.360 
okay we'll give that little while the
subtle<00:03:23.360> out<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:24.230> see<00:03:24.470> what<00:03:24.620> we<00:03:24.739> get<00:03:24.920> out<00:03:24.980> of

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
subtle out and see what we get out of

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.030 
subtle out and see what we get out of
there<00:03:25.610> but<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.930> actually<00:03:27.500> is<00:03:27.530> I've<00:03:27.800> been

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
there but that actually is I've been

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.420 
there but that actually is I've been
pretty<00:03:28.340> excited<00:03:29.000> because<00:03:29.209> obviously<00:03:30.310> what<00:03:31.310> we

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
pretty excited because obviously what we

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.420 
pretty excited because obviously what we
managed<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.790> do<00:03:32.090> is<00:03:32.780> use<00:03:33.110> an<00:03:33.260> extremely<00:03:34.220> simple

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
managed to do is use an extremely simple

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.589 
managed to do is use an extremely simple
method<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.360> producing<00:03:36.260> mana<00:03:36.950> particles<00:03:37.599> now

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
method of producing mana particles now

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.449 
method of producing mana particles now
this<00:03:38.930> is<00:03:39.080> a<00:03:39.110> kitchen<00:03:39.590> run<00:03:40.040> now

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
this is a kitchen run now

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.039 
this is a kitchen run now
so<00:03:40.610> like<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.879> said<00:03:41.060> if<00:03:41.239> we<00:03:41.360> use<00:03:41.540> something<00:03:41.810> like

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
so like I said if we use something like

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.130 
so like I said if we use something like
a<00:03:42.260> silver<00:03:42.680> sterlin<00:03:43.069> industrial<00:03:43.760> blender<00:03:44.140> and

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
a silver sterlin industrial blender and

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.080 
a silver sterlin industrial blender and
we<00:03:45.319> give<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.500> longer<00:03:46.099> maybe<00:03:46.310> or<00:03:46.640> play<00:03:46.970> around

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
we give it longer maybe or play around

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.910 
we give it longer maybe or play around
with<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.480> little<00:03:47.750> bit<00:03:47.930> then<00:03:48.319> we're<00:03:48.440> looking<00:03:48.560> at

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
with a little bit then we're looking at

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.000 
with a little bit then we're looking at
a<00:03:49.310> very<00:03:49.790> simple<00:03:50.120> industrial<00:03:51.019> method<00:03:51.680> for<00:03:51.920> the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
a very simple industrial method for the

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.710 
a very simple industrial method for the
mass<00:03:52.190> production<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:53.239> metal<00:03:53.599> nanoparticles

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
mass production of metal nanoparticles

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.319 
mass production of metal nanoparticles
that<00:03:54.650> I've<00:03:55.130> used<00:03:55.340> properly<00:03:55.670> using<00:03:56.299> a

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
that I've used properly using a

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.650 
that I've used properly using a
replacement<00:03:56.690> reaction<00:03:57.489> clearly<00:03:58.489> lots<00:03:59.360> and

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
replacement reaction clearly lots and

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.990 
replacement reaction clearly lots and
lots<00:03:59.930> of<00:04:00.200> salts<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.829> metals<00:04:01.099> can<00:04:01.700> be<00:04:01.730> done

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
lots of salts and metals can be done

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.690 
lots of salts and metals can be done
exactly<00:04:02.150> the<00:04:02.569> same<00:04:02.630> way<00:04:03.110> using<00:04:03.860> a<00:04:04.220> replacement

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
exactly the same way using a replacement

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.699 
exactly the same way using a replacement
reaction<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.510> so<00:04:06.049> in<00:04:06.290> looking<00:04:06.560> in<00:04:06.650> the

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
reaction and so in looking in the

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.190 
reaction and so in looking in the
methodology<00:04:07.069> here<00:04:07.579> for<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.629> cheap<00:04:08.930> mass

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
methodology here for the cheap mass

production in metal nanoparticles of any

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.680 
production in metal nanoparticles of any
type<00:04:12.260> at<00:04:12.530> all<00:04:12.879> that's<00:04:13.879> really<00:04:14.209> good

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
type at all that's really good

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.350 
type at all that's really good
cool<00:04:15.200> now<00:04:15.910> factors<00:04:16.910> that<00:04:17.030> are<00:04:17.180> going<00:04:17.299> to

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:17.360 
cool now factors that are going to

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.440 
cool now factors that are going to
affect<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.440> size<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.610> particles<00:04:20.239> that

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
affect the size of the particles that

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.870 
affect the size of the particles that
are<00:04:20.510> obviously<00:04:21.049> going<00:04:21.260> to<00:04:21.350> be<00:04:21.880> concentration

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
are obviously going to be concentration

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.840 
are obviously going to be concentration

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
going to be dictated by things like that

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.530 
going to be dictated by things like that
the<00:04:54.560> solution<00:04:55.160> units<00:04:55.430> actually<00:04:55.790> in<00:04:56.000> so<00:04:56.390> this

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
the solution units actually in so this

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.110 
the solution units actually in so this
is<00:04:56.660> just<00:04:56.840> in<00:04:57.020> water<00:04:57.320> if<00:04:57.770> you<00:04:58.340> put<00:04:58.400> it<00:04:58.670> in<00:04:58.850> a

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
is just in water if you put it in a

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.640 
is just in water if you put it in a
salad<00:04:59.330> like<00:04:59.660> on<00:04:59.900> you<00:05:00.110> can<00:05:00.260> have<00:05:00.410> a<00:05:00.440> different

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
salad like on you can have a different

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.950 
salad like on you can have a different
morphology<00:05:01.430> and<00:05:01.610> so<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.330> share<00:05:02.660> of<00:05:02.840> the

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.300 
morphology and so the share of the
particles<00:05:03.590> that<00:05:03.740> you're<00:05:03.860> going<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.070> be<00:05:04.220> able

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
particles that you're going to be able

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.730 
particles that you're going to be able
to<00:05:04.520> make<00:05:04.700> are<00:05:04.880> going<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.150> be<00:05:05.740> changed

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
to make are going to be changed

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.870 
to make are going to be changed
depending<00:05:07.160> on<00:05:07.610> what<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.270> have<00:05:08.300> in<00:05:08.780> here<00:05:08.810> as

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
depending on what you have in here as

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.210 
depending on what you have in here as
the<00:05:10.880> solid<00:05:11.390> also<00:05:12.380> if<00:05:12.710> you<00:05:12.800> could<00:05:12.980> bad

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
the solid also if you could bad

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.150 
the solid also if you could bad
attitudes<00:05:13.850> in<00:05:14.030> for<00:05:14.480> instance<00:05:14.810> pvp's<00:05:15.530> setting

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
attitudes in for instance pvp's setting

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.890 
attitudes in for instance pvp's setting
the<00:05:16.280> thing<00:05:16.400> up<00:05:16.520> or<00:05:16.730> gelatin<00:05:17.090> something<00:05:17.750> like

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
the thing up or gelatin something like

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.080 
the thing up or gelatin something like
that<00:05:18.140> then<00:05:18.740> that's<00:05:19.100> also<00:05:19.370> going<00:05:19.730> to<00:05:19.790> have<00:05:20.060> a

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
that then that's also going to have a

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.670 
that then that's also going to have a
big<00:05:20.570> effect<00:05:20.690> I<00:05:21.020> would<00:05:21.080> imagine<00:05:21.380> on<00:05:21.650> the

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
big effect I would imagine on the

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.620 
big effect I would imagine on the
morphology<00:05:22.100> of<00:05:22.370> virtual<00:05:22.820> particle<00:05:23.300> cooking

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
morphology of virtual particle cooking

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.050 
morphology of virtual particle cooking
produce<00:05:23.960> so<00:05:24.950> those<00:05:25.160> kind<00:05:25.430> of<00:05:25.550> things<00:05:25.790> are

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
produce so those kind of things are

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.120 
produce so those kind of things are
going<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.450> have<00:05:26.600> influencing<00:05:27.530> factors<00:05:27.980> on

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
going to have influencing factors on

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.350 
going to have influencing factors on
this<00:05:28.370> now<00:05:29.090> this<00:05:29.810> is<00:05:29.870> a<00:05:30.230> first<00:05:31.040> start<00:05:31.610> if<00:05:32.060> you

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
this now this is a first start if you

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.700 
this now this is a first start if you
like<00:05:32.600> when<00:05:32.840> we<00:05:32.930> just<00:05:33.080> have

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
like when we just have

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.800 
like when we just have
attitude<00:05:34.280> to<00:05:34.550> see<00:05:34.759> what<00:05:34.970> would<00:05:35.090> happen<00:05:35.330> but

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
attitude to see what would happen but

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.770 
attitude to see what would happen but
it's<00:05:36.289> obvious<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.889> me<00:05:37.070> at<00:05:37.220> least<00:05:37.370> that<00:05:38.090> this<00:05:38.479> is

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
it's obvious to me at least that this is

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.070 
it's obvious to me at least that this is
an<00:05:39.460> extremely<00:05:40.460> patentable<00:05:41.120> it's<00:05:41.810> one<00:05:41.990> of

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
an extremely patentable it's one of

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.330 
an extremely patentable it's one of
those<00:05:42.199> things<00:05:42.530> that<00:05:42.650> if<00:05:42.770> you<00:05:42.889> can<00:05:43.100> get<00:05:43.220> it

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
those things that if you can get it

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.189 
those things that if you can get it
right<00:05:43.580> we're<00:05:44.060> talking<00:05:44.210> about<00:05:44.479> the<00:05:44.810> patent

right we're talking about the patent

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.770 
right we're talking about the patent
worth<00:05:45.410> millions<00:05:45.979> and<00:05:46.130> millions<00:05:46.550> of<00:05:46.639> dollars

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780
