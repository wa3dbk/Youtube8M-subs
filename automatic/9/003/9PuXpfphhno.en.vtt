00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.509 

this<00:00:23.619> probably<00:00:23.830> won't<00:00:24.039> be<00:00:24.189> much<00:00:24.310> better

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
this probably won't be much better

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.990

honestly

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
honestly

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.040 
honestly
because<00:00:26.480> this<00:00:26.690> is<00:00:26.870> like<00:00:27.410> actual<00:00:28.190> platforming
