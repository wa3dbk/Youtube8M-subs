00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
this so unlucky feel like this might get

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.180 
this so unlucky feel like this might get

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.800 

well<00:01:35.400> I'm<00:01:36.400> just<00:01:36.580> keeping<00:01:36.940> exclude<00:01:37.330> up<00:01:37.480> I<00:01:37.630> could

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
well I'm just keeping exclude up I could

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.510 
well I'm just keeping exclude up I could
play<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.140> in<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.500> next<00:01:38.650> turn<00:01:38.890> if<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.280> draw

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
play this in the next turn if I draw

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.370 
play this in the next turn if I draw
forest<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.410> could<00:01:41.410> play<00:01:41.740> this<00:01:42.430> but<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.960> chances

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
forest I could play this but the chances

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.530 
forest I could play this but the chances
of<00:01:44.440> him<00:01:44.770> playing<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.310> creature<00:01:45.640> unturned<00:01:46.210> for

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
of him playing a creature unturned for

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.660 
of him playing a creature unturned for
are<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.870> lot<00:01:47.140> more<00:01:47.170> likely<00:01:47.860> than<00:01:48.040> me<00:01:48.280> drawing

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
are a lot more likely than me drawing

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.710 
are a lot more likely than me drawing
one<00:01:49.060> of<00:01:49.150> my<00:01:49.300> for<00:01:49.840> forests<00:01:50.590> next<00:01:50.920> turn<00:01:51.720> although

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
one of my for forests next turn although

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.450 
one of my for forests next turn although
I<00:01:52.750> will<00:01:53.020> probably<00:01:53.260> just<00:01:53.560> draw<00:01:53.770> one<00:01:53.980> of<00:01:54.100> my<00:01:54.190> for

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
I will probably just draw one of my for

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:04.720 
I will probably just draw one of my for
forests

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:14.040 

alright<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:07.720> we<00:02:08.720> are<00:02:08.750> playing<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.230> reef<00:02:09.590> shaman

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.600 

Pabu<00:02:15.050> glider<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:17.480> what<00:02:18.040> what<00:02:19.040> is<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.310> combo

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
Pabu glider so what what is the combo

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:30.910 
Pabu glider so what what is the combo
here

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.410 

Oh

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:50.040

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.030 

so<00:02:50.950> we're<00:02:51.070> going<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.280> attack<00:02:51.520> them<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.770> then

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
so we're going to attack them and then

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.010 
so we're going to attack them and then
we're<00:02:54.250> going<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.510> it's<00:02:55.660> just<00:02:55.780> all

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
we're going to so it's just all

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.430 
we're going to so it's just all
permanence<00:02:56.560> all<00:02:56.710> non-land<00:02:57.130> permanent<00:02:58.440> growth

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
permanence all non-land permanent growth

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:12.980 
permanence all non-land permanent growth
for<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.800> swamp

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.360 

it's<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> good<00:03:13.680> thing<00:03:13.770> I<00:03:13.890> don't<00:03:14.070> have<00:03:14.190> any

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
it's a good thing I don't have any

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.030 
it's a good thing I don't have any
removal<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.750> says<00:03:15.990> non<00:03:16.350> black<00:03:16.710> creature

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
removal that says non black creature

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.200 
removal that says non black creature
because<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.490> would<00:03:17.610> just<00:03:17.790> shut<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.120> all<00:03:18.330> down

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
because that would just shut it all down

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.700 
because that would just shut it all down
but<00:03:21.210> that<00:03:21.390> tells<00:03:21.570> me<00:03:21.720> he<00:03:21.840> doesn't<00:03:22.110> either

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:41.720 

interesting<00:03:32.860> not<00:03:33.860> sure<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.100> like<00:03:34.190> that

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.809 

he<00:03:42.269> kind<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.569> had<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.750> do<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.670> well<00:03:44.670> that's

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
he kind of had to do it well that's

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.220 
he kind of had to do it well that's
going<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.030> get<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.239> for<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> billion<00:03:46.049> damage

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
going to get in for a billion damage

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.630 
going to get in for a billion damage
they've<00:03:49.230> never<00:03:49.500> seen<00:03:49.739> those<00:03:49.920> tokens<00:03:50.159> they're

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
they've never seen those tokens they're

00:03:50.640 --> 00:04:01.950 
they've never seen those tokens they're
very<00:03:50.940> weird<00:03:54.980> then<00:03:55.980> we<00:03:56.250> come

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.170 

and<00:04:02.080> then<00:04:02.680> if<00:04:02.770> you<00:04:02.920> march<00:04:03.100> of<00:04:03.250> souls<00:04:03.520> is<00:04:03.730> again

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
and then if you march of souls is again

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:12.170 
and then if you march of souls is again
I<00:04:04.480> still<00:04:04.990> have<00:04:05.170> creatures
