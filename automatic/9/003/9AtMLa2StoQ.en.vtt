like<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.040> kind<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.399> basic<00:02:02.820> look<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.659> i'm<00:02:03.780> not

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
going to go too much into that I really

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.679 
going to go too much into that I really
won't<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.880> didn't<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.270> partnership<00:02:06.659> for

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.210 
won't I didn't want the partnership for
the<00:02:06.780> money<00:02:06.990> really<00:02:07.229> because<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.680> have<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> job

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the money really because I do have a job

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.050 
the money really because I do have a job
and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
and

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.870 
and
videos<00:02:10.780> are<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:11.170> pastime<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.520> know<00:02:12.640> having

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
videos are a pastime but you know having

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.860 
videos are a pastime but you know having
a<00:02:12.940> partnership<00:02:13.239> is<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:13.599> like<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> little

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
a partnership is just like a little

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.080 
a partnership is just like a little
bonus<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.440> suppose<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.580> makes<00:02:15.730> my<00:02:15.819> channel

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
bonus I suppose and it makes my channel

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.190 
bonus I suppose and it makes my channel
look<00:02:16.209> nicer<00:02:16.569> which<00:02:16.720> brings<00:02:16.959> more<00:02:17.110> attention

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
look nicer which brings more attention

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.620 
look nicer which brings more attention
to<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.770> i<00:02:17.890> would<00:02:18.040> like<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.340> think<00:02:18.580> but<00:02:19.300> um

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
to it i would like to think but um

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.540 
to it i would like to think but um
something<00:02:20.500> i<00:02:20.739> guess<00:02:20.950> it'll<00:02:21.099> just<00:02:21.190> get<00:02:21.370> into

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
something i guess it'll just get into

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.220 
something i guess it'll just get into
some<00:02:21.670> runescape<00:02:22.000> stuff<00:02:22.180> sorry<00:02:22.420> last<00:02:22.900> year<00:02:23.200> i

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
some runescape stuff sorry last year i

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.010 
some runescape stuff sorry last year i
think<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.530> was<00:02:23.620> 92<00:02:24.190> runecrafting<00:02:24.880> i'm<00:02:25.239> now<00:02:25.390> 96

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.229 
think it was 92 runecrafting i'm now 96
and<00:02:26.200> 632<00:02:27.130> k<00:02:27.310> from<00:02:28.120> 97<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:28.959> really<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.880> sucks

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
and 632 k from 97 so really it sucks

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.640 
and 632 k from 97 so really it sucks

have noticed but they made a lot more
smoother<00:02:40.269> and<00:02:40.420> just<00:02:41.110> they've<00:02:41.980> kind<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.190> oiled

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
smoother and just they've kind of oiled

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.090 
smoother and just they've kind of oiled
the<00:02:42.670> rusty<00:02:43.090> chain<00:02:43.480> let's<00:02:44.380> say<00:02:44.560> when<00:02:44.769> you<00:02:44.890> do

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
the rusty chain let's say when you do

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.559 
the rusty chain let's say when you do
the<00:02:45.220> runecrafting<00:02:45.489> animation<00:02:46.090> it's<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.269> chain

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
the runecrafting animation it's a chain

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.390 
the runecrafting animation it's a chain
and<00:02:46.810> it's<00:02:47.290> all<00:02:47.410> it's<00:02:47.620> all<00:02:47.680> rusty<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.100> now<00:02:48.250> that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
and it's all it's all rusty and now that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.890 
and it's all it's all rusty and now that
you've<00:02:48.489> gone<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.819> oiled<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:49.450> now<00:02:49.660> it's<00:02:49.810> all

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
you've gone and oiled it so now it's all

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.720 
you've gone and oiled it so now it's all
nice<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.290> smooth<00:02:50.560> again<00:02:50.799> it<00:02:51.340> was<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.489> really

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
nice and smooth again it was a really

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.420 
nice and smooth again it was a really
bad<00:02:52.000> way<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.239> describing<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:52.930> but<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:54.280> got<00:02:54.400> to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
bad way of describing it but you got to

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
bad way of describing it but you got to
think<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.670> things<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:54.940> your<00:02:55.060> head<00:02:55.150> which<00:02:55.299> is

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
think of things in your head which is

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.430 
think of things in your head which is
difficult<00:02:55.660> sometimes<00:02:56.080> but<00:02:57.660> hmm<00:02:58.660> not<00:02:59.140> sure<00:02:59.170> ill

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440

to<00:05:50.860> be<00:05:50.919> one<00:05:51.190> but<00:05:51.310> not<00:05:51.550> there<00:05:51.820> is<00:05:52.030> because<00:05:52.900> the

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
to be one but not there is because the

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.010 
to be one but not there is because the
odds<00:05:53.380> are<00:05:53.560> always<00:05:53.680> against<00:05:54.100> me<00:05:54.240> yeah<00:05:55.240> anyway
