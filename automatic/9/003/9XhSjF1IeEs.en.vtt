here<00:00:01.079> we<00:00:01.199> have<00:00:01.380> two<00:00:02.600> olympia<00:00:03.680> sm-3

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
here we have two olympia sm-3

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.320 
here we have two olympia sm-3
typewriters<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:07.160> i<00:00:08.160> looked<00:00:08.580> up<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.849> several

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
typewriters and i looked up to several

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:18.410 
typewriters and i looked up to several
numbers<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.429> both<00:00:11.719> remain<00:00:13.099> 1953<00:00:15.830> this<00:00:17.420> this

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
numbers and both remain 1953 this this

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.200 
numbers and both remain 1953 this this
one<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.140> total<00:00:19.470> number<00:00:19.710> was<00:00:19.890> three<00:00:20.730> two

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
one here the total number was three two

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.210 
one here the total number was three two
three<00:00:21.689> five<00:00:22.260> nine<00:00:22.289> three<00:00:23.330> and<00:00:25.640> this<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:26.970> here

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
three five nine three and this one here

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.459 
three five nine three and this one here
was<00:00:29.220> three<00:00:29.670> eight<00:00:29.880> six<00:00:30.449> nine<00:00:30.920> three<00:00:31.920> six<00:00:32.219> and

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
was three eight six nine three six and

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.639 
was three eight six nine three six and
what's<00:00:34.469> interesting<00:00:34.829> about<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:36.649> just

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
what's interesting about it is that just

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.920 
what's interesting about it is that just
the<00:00:38.309> difference<00:00:38.760> between<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> two<00:00:39.480> models

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.389 

for<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.170> thing<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.770> has<00:00:44.070> no<00:00:46.489> tab<00:00:47.489> settings

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
for one thing this has no tab settings

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.410 
for one thing this has no tab settings
whereas<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> tab<00:00:51.390> key<00:00:51.780> here

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
whereas here you have a tab key here

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.569 
whereas here you have a tab key here
this<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:55.160> some<00:00:56.160> paper<00:00:56.430> mail<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.210> button<00:00:58.579> this

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
this has some paper mail a button this

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.550 
this has some paper mail a button this
one<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.329> has<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> lift<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:02.180> paper<00:01:03.180> bail

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.210 

the<00:01:08.150> marjorie<00:01:09.150> lease<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.650> four<00:01:11.100> dots

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
the marjorie lease is just four dots

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.690 
the marjorie lease is just four dots
symbol<00:01:14.299> whereas<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.540> over<00:01:15.689> here<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.700> says

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
symbol whereas the one over here is says

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.060 
symbol whereas the one over here is says
mr

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.160 

this<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:27.000> doesn't<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.570> any<00:01:30.170> plastique

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
this here doesn't have any plastique

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:42.130 
this here doesn't have any plastique
here<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:33.840> hold<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.200> paper<00:01:34.490> cut<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> down<00:01:36.560> and

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.540 

now<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.070> set<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:45.650> margins<00:01:46.650> here's

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
now so you just set the margins here's

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.969 
now so you just set the margins here's
the<00:01:47.760> margin<00:01:48.590> she<00:01:49.590> squeezed<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> move<00:01:51.979> on

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the margin she squeezed in and move on

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.020 
the margin she squeezed in and move on
this<00:01:53.280> side<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:55.260> margin<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:57.890> in<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.369> back<00:01:59.580> here

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
this side the margin is in the back here

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.380 
this side the margin is in the back here
you<00:02:01.220> have<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.369> kind<00:02:02.580> of<00:02:02.640> work<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.150> little

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you have to kind of work out a little

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.710 
you have to kind of work out a little
harder<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.110> change<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.070> margin<00:02:08.149> we<00:02:09.149> spin<00:02:09.509> this

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
harder to change the margin we spin this

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:26.440 
harder to change the margin we spin this
this<00:02:10.619> one<00:02:10.920> here<00:02:10.950> around<00:02:12.620> and<00:02:16.160> we<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.459> this

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.500 

this<00:02:27.450> here<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.920> emboss<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.150> mean<00:02:30.360> it's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
this here can it emboss I mean it's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.120 
this here can it emboss I mean it's
raised<00:02:30.900> letters<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:33.360> over<00:02:34.290> here<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.709> plate

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
raised letters and over here this plate

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.630 
raised letters and over here this plate
is<00:02:35.489> raised<00:02:35.790> letters<00:02:36.590> but<00:02:37.590> then<00:02:38.010> they<00:02:38.160> went<00:02:38.400> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
is raised letters but then they went to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.780 
is raised letters but then they went to
a<00:02:39.530> stencil<00:02:40.530> here<00:02:41.400> that's<00:02:42.150> worn<00:02:42.660> off<00:02:43.459> but<00:02:44.459> here

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
a stencil here that's worn off but here

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.789 
a stencil here that's worn off but here
they<00:02:45.000> have<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.420> information<00:02:45.750> right<00:02:46.970> on<00:02:47.970> there

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
they have the information right on there

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:55.160 
they have the information right on there
this<00:02:49.799> is<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.370> tab<00:02:52.519> settings<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.690> change<00:02:54.989> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
this is the tab settings and change the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.870 
this is the tab settings and change the
tab<00:02:55.530> stops

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.440 

and<00:03:03.880> we<00:03:06.150> spin<00:03:07.150> these<00:03:07.390> two<00:03:07.720> around<00:03:09.210> this<00:03:10.210> is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
and we spin these two around this is

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.400 
and we spin these two around this is
where<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:11.590> serial<00:03:12.040> number<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.490> down<00:03:12.760> here<00:03:15.300> and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
where the serial number is down here and

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:24.210 
where the serial number is down here and
this<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.830> serial<00:03:18.400> number<00:03:18.430> right<00:03:18.880> here<00:03:23.220> but

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
this is a serial number right here but

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.460 
this is a serial number right here but
there's<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.550> little<00:03:25.080> red<00:03:26.080> right<00:03:27.040> there<00:03:28.230> not<00:03:29.230> on

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
there's a little red right there not on

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.540 
there's a little red right there not on
there<00:03:31.860> now<00:03:32.860> it<00:03:33.760> was<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.420> was<00:03:34.660> saying<00:03:35.050> that<00:03:35.550> this

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
there now it was it was saying that this

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.410 
there now it was it was saying that this
one<00:03:36.910> here<00:03:40.110> with<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.140> tab<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.860> everything<00:03:42.420> you

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
one here with the tab and everything you

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:51.300 
one here with the tab and everything you
know<00:03:43.540> came<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.410> a<00:03:46.110> typical<00:03:48.060> silver<00:03:49.060> case<00:03:50.310> that

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
know came in a typical silver case that

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.770 
know came in a typical silver case that
you<00:03:51.820> know<00:03:51.970> slope<00:03:52.830> curved<00:03:54.270> whereas<00:03:55.270> this<00:03:55.510> one

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
you know slope curved whereas this one

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.940 
you know slope curved whereas this one
here<00:03:56.140> that's<00:03:56.410> he<00:03:58.380> doesn't<00:03:59.380> have<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.560> tab

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
here that's he doesn't have a tab

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.270 
here that's he doesn't have a tab
feature<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:02.490> it<00:04:03.490> came<00:04:04.180> in<00:04:04.450> just<00:04:04.480> a<00:04:05.280> regular

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
feature and it came in just a regular

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:15.620 
feature and it came in just a regular
box<00:04:06.580> case<00:04:07.890> square<00:04:08.890> case<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:11.820> don't<00:04:12.820> think

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:25.590 

that's<00:04:16.630> about<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.650> only<00:04:17.830> things<00:04:18.520> that<00:04:24.480> that<00:04:25.480> I

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
that's about the only things that that I

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.180 
that's about the only things that that I
see<00:04:25.870> is<00:04:25.990> are<00:04:26.290> different<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:29.080> what<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:29.890> thought

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
see is are different and what I thought

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.860 
see is are different and what I thought
was<00:04:30.460> interesting<00:04:31.030> was<00:04:31.930> just<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.919> fact<00:04:33.160> that

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
was interesting was just the fact that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.790 
was interesting was just the fact that
they're<00:04:36.150> far<00:04:37.150> as<00:04:37.300> I<00:04:37.419> can<00:04:37.480> tell<00:04:37.840> they<00:04:38.260> were<00:04:38.320> made

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
they're far as I can tell they were made
