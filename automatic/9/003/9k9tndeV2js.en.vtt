00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
the difference this year what we did

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.300 
the difference this year what we did
differently<00:02:59.080> was<00:02:59.320> we<00:02:59.500> actually<00:02:59.890> played<00:03:00.070> a<00:03:00.100> lot

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
differently was we actually played a lot

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.830 
differently was we actually played a lot
smarter<00:03:00.580> mentally<00:03:01.210> we<00:03:01.360> actually<00:03:01.630> played

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
smarter mentally we actually played

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.620 
smarter mentally we actually played
doubles<00:03:02.200> points<00:03:02.560> when<00:03:02.710> we<00:03:02.800> needed<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.630> we

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
doubles points when we needed to and we

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.540 
doubles points when we needed to and we
both<00:03:04.780> stepped<00:03:04.840> up<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.410> plate<00:03:05.500> when<00:03:05.890> when

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
both stepped up to the plate when when

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.120 
both stepped up to the plate when when
the<00:03:06.670> other<00:03:06.790> was<00:03:07.030> kind<00:03:07.240> of<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:08.260> bit<00:03:08.830> reluctant

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
the other was kind of a bit reluctant

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.570 
the other was kind of a bit reluctant
and<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:10.030> just<00:03:10.810> I<00:03:11.410> just<00:03:11.980> think<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.430> the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
and I just I just think that the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.850 
and I just I just think that the
maturity<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.300> our<00:03:13.660> team<00:03:13.990> as<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.200> team<00:03:14.500> like

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
maturity of our team as a team like

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.310 
maturity of our team as a team like
Lucas<00:03:15.220> just<00:03:15.400> said<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:16.420> team's<00:03:16.660> maturities

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
Lucas just said the team's maturities

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.960 
Lucas just said the team's maturities
has<00:03:17.650> grown<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:17.890> lot<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:18.310> year<00:03:18.370> compared<00:03:18.940> to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
has grown a lot this year compared to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.940 
has grown a lot this year compared to
last<00:03:19.060> year<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.020> probably<00:03:20.230> scum<00:03:20.560> because<00:03:20.830> we

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
last year and I probably scum because we

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.140 
last year and I probably scum because we
want<00:03:21.130> a<00:03:21.190> grand<00:03:21.400> slam<00:03:21.490> at<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.790> French<00:03:22.000> Open

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
want a grand slam at the French Open

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.640 
want a grand slam at the French Open
it's<00:03:22.780> probably<00:03:22.900> come<00:03:23.230> because<00:03:23.470> we've

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
it's probably come because we've

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.900 
it's probably come because we've
accepted<00:03:23.950> each<00:03:24.160> other's<00:03:24.460> strengths<00:03:24.790> and

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
accepted each other's strengths and

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.600 
accepted each other's strengths and
weaknesses<00:03:25.300> we're<00:03:25.570> just<00:03:26.230> about<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.920> year<00:03:27.400> and

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
weaknesses we're just about a year and

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.330 
weaknesses we're just about a year and
three<00:03:28.150> months<00:03:28.180> old<00:03:28.630> now<00:03:28.930> as<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.140> team<00:03:29.410> and<00:03:29.590> I

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
three months old now as a team and I

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.370 
three months old now as a team and I

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
think that the longevity of our

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.750 
think that the longevity of our
partnership<00:03:32.740> we<00:03:33.010> just<00:03:33.220> keep<00:03:33.340> getting<00:03:33.640> better

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
partnership we just keep getting better

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.670 
partnership we just keep getting better

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.210 
lead sometimes and the other player
follows<00:05:59.940> unlike<00:06:00.630> today<00:06:00.900> Lucas<00:06:01.440> LED<00:06:01.650> and<00:06:02.040> I

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
follows unlike today Lucas LED and I

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.860 
follows unlike today Lucas LED and I
followed<00:06:02.610> and<00:06:03.090> I<00:06:03.150> think<00:06:03.360> that's<00:06:03.510> the<00:06:03.570> beauty

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
followed and I think that's the beauty

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.770

is<00:06:03.960> that<00:06:03.990> in<00:06:04.740> our<00:06:04.890> understanding<00:06:05.480> it<00:06:06.480> doesn't

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
is that in our understanding it doesn't

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.290 
is that in our understanding it doesn't
matter<00:06:06.870> who<00:06:07.170> leads<00:06:07.410> or<00:06:07.590> who<00:06:08.040> follows<00:06:08.400> we<00:06:09.090> both

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
matter who leads or who follows we both

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.660 
matter who leads or who follows we both
kind<00:06:09.600> of<00:06:09.720> art<00:06:09.900> together<00:06:10.080> and<00:06:10.500> that's<00:06:11.400> that's

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
kind of art together and that's that's

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.660 
kind of art together and that's that's
why<00:06:11.880> we<00:06:12.000> wanted<00:06:12.300> a<00:06:12.390> really
