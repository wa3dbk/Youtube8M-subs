forest<00:00:44.969> right<00:00:45.120> now<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:46.370> definitely<00:00:47.370> more

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
forest right now but definitely more

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.180

likely<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> draw<00:00:48.030> into<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:51.949> playing<00:00:52.949> against

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
likely to draw into one playing against

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.069 
likely to draw into one playing against
what<00:00:53.430> i<00:00:53.670> think<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> good

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
what i think this is going to be a good

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.170 
what i think this is going to be a good
matchup<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.440> us<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.920> doesn't<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.760> long<00:00:56.910> as

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
matchup for us it doesn't as long as

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.049 
matchup for us it doesn't as long as
it's<00:00:57.300> not<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.570> crazy<00:00:58.340> like<00:00:59.340> aggro<00:00:59.699> deck<00:00:59.940> i

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
it's not like a crazy like aggro deck i

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.380 
it's not like a crazy like aggro deck i
think<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.270> should<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.480> fine

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:14.180 

yeah<00:01:09.950> yeah<00:01:10.950> yeah<00:01:11.400> yeah<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.590> think<00:01:13.710> next<00:01:13.979> turn

yeah so we can I would actually lead

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.420 
yeah so we can I would actually lead
with<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.810> gargantuan<00:03:21.230> make<00:03:21.859> a<00:03:21.889> copy<00:03:22.190> of<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430

Sun chaser so it's a 99 flyer I'll be a

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.379 
Sun chaser so it's a 99 flyer I'll be a
77<00:03:27.010> well<00:03:28.010> 277<00:03:28.669> but<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.849> would<00:03:28.940> get<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.180> ability

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
77 well 277 but it would get the ability

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.330 
77 well 277 but it would get the ability

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.620 

alright<00:04:18.229> so<00:04:18.739> here<00:04:19.430> we're<00:04:20.209> just<00:04:20.239> going<00:04:20.449> to<00:04:20.479> run

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
alright so here we're just going to run

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.689 
alright so here we're just going to run
out<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.780> Quicksilver<00:04:21.380> gargantuan<00:04:21.709> copy<00:04:22.550> the

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
out the Quicksilver gargantuan copy the

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.520 
out the Quicksilver gargantuan copy the
Ori<00:04:22.820> axon<00:04:23.150> chaser<00:04:23.540> and<00:04:23.720> then<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.199> turn<00:04:24.350> after

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
Ori axon chaser and then the turn after

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.460 
Ori axon chaser and then the turn after
it<00:04:24.710> allowed<00:04:24.830> metal<00:04:25.070> crafts<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.430> we're<00:04:25.580> doing

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
it allowed metal crafts that we're doing

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.000 
it allowed metal crafts that we're doing
yeah<00:04:27.470> it's<00:04:27.919> probably<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.400> best<00:04:28.430> play<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:29.240> mean

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
yeah it's probably the best play I mean

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.620 
yeah it's probably the best play I mean
it<00:04:31.010> stinks<00:04:31.340> because<00:04:31.550> we<00:04:31.940> would<00:04:32.090> get<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.300> bigger

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
it stinks because we would get a bigger

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.719 
it stinks because we would get a bigger
creature<00:04:33.020> if<00:04:33.410> we<00:04:33.590> put<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:33.949> galmans<00:04:34.430> warden

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
creature if we put the galmans warden

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.850 
creature if we put the galmans warden
but<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.180> flying<00:04:35.539> ability<00:04:36.080> really<00:04:36.289> does<00:04:36.620> help

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
but the flying ability really does help

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.969 
but the flying ability really does help
us<00:04:37.039> out<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.250> lot<00:04:37.510> or<00:04:38.510> we<00:04:38.780> could<00:04:38.990> play<00:04:39.350> them<00:04:39.860> your

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
us out a lot or we could play them your

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.680 
us out a lot or we could play them your
bow<00:04:40.100> sphere<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.490> copy<00:04:41.240> it<00:04:41.419> with<00:04:41.510> a<00:04:41.539> quick

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
bow sphere and copy it with a quick

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.590 
bow sphere and copy it with a quick
silver<00:04:41.870> egg<00:04:42.080> management<00:04:42.440> they<00:04:43.340> wouldn't<00:04:43.610> gain

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.150

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
this was pretty perfect if we can do

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.720 
this was pretty perfect if we can do
that<00:06:57.780> again<00:06:58.050> yeah<00:06:58.890> it<00:06:59.130> didn't<00:06:59.400> we<00:06:59.460> didn't<00:06:59.640> see

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
that again yeah it didn't we didn't see

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.240 
that again yeah it didn't we didn't see
any<00:06:59.790> removal<00:07:00.180> he's<00:07:00.810> what<00:07:01.560> is<00:07:01.650> he's<00:07:01.890> white

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
any removal he's what is he's white

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.040 
any removal he's what is he's white
pretty<00:07:02.640> much<00:07:02.820> ready<00:07:03.180> to<00:07:03.270> see<00:07:03.510> a<00:07:03.540> second<00:07:03.900> color

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
pretty much ready to see a second color

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.750 
pretty much ready to see a second color
he<00:07:04.260> see<00:07:04.410> he's<00:07:04.590> red<00:07:04.890> white<00:07:05.190> which<00:07:05.490> would<00:07:05.640> make

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.760 
he see he's red white which would make

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.220 
he see he's red white which would make
me<00:07:05.820> think<00:07:05.940> that<00:07:06.150> he<00:07:06.210> might<00:07:06.450> have<00:07:06.630> that<00:07:06.840> turn<00:07:07.080> to

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230 
me think that he might have that turn to

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.890 
me think that he might have that turn to
Slide<00:07:08.150> it<00:07:09.150> doesn't<00:07:09.390> do<00:07:09.450> anything<00:07:09.630> about<00:07:09.870> a
