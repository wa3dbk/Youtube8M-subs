00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:40.479
 very solid 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:42.609
 the employee of a large 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:46.030
 approximately 100 projects 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:49.600
 we are today with 20 running companies 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.659
 and no legal strong in the office today is 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.989
 defined in four parts that is 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.030
 articulated decorated apartments would 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.489
 easy corporate here we act 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.350
 very well corporation by focus too 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.020
 writer also focused on the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.630
 average private clients there is a pattern 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.290
 I really believe so I do. 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.140
 beyond the date and web which I use a lot 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.110
 My heart, I make heart with my 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.960
 heart too much of the truth 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.200
 projects of each project , and another is 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.160
 was my special public stock 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.960
 then one of the things that will differentiate 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.620
 office in the market is the fact that 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.420
 We work very hard as a nation. 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.020
 header of the apartment in the residence 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.790
 how much is a led point and are 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.530
 differentiated are all customers 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.780
 end up winning a project of 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.890
 lighting condition that adverse in 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.690
 our planet 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.050
 I like working with the area that 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.760
 people are hitting the hand a lot because 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.010
 developed in this way in order to 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.820
 each client in each project has 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.550
 difference 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.440
 we will avoid for example the mobile 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.260
 quote the bill cake with the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.229
 Magellan for a project that cried in the 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.450
 market with each project does not 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.780
 able to attend in a very 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.970
 easy to handle with this lighting part and 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.730
 I am very satisfied with the work and 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.760
 increasingly to grow 10 to this our 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.620
 dialogue since the moment of the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.900
 design of the project 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.770
