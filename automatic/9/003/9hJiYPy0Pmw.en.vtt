00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
it's the large size they did also have

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.000 
it's the large size they did also have
the<00:03:19.550> brown<00:03:19.850> or<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.240> tan<00:03:20.960> one<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.440> these<00:03:21.590> two

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
the brown or the tan one of these two

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.820 
the brown or the tan one of these two
and<00:03:22.340> they<00:03:22.910> did<00:03:23.090> have<00:03:23.270> the<00:03:23.540> extra<00:03:24.110> large<00:03:24.260> size

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
the grande size but I find that this

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.410 
the grande size but I find that this
size<00:03:27.770> is<00:03:28.160> fine<00:03:28.490> for<00:03:28.790> my<00:03:28.940> bunnies<00:03:29.150> because

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.860 
size is fine for my bunnies because

only<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.200> medium<00:03:33.470> small<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.880> this<00:03:35.270> works<00:03:35.570> fine

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
only a medium small so this works fine

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.310
