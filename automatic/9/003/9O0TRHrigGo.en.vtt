00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.920
 welcome to my plener tal 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.500
 yoga program for the second team esther 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.210
 The best way to find a place in 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.469
 the near of the wall because straight in the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.120
 third semester is it so that the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.610
 belly size is and it is always nice 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.760
 to have a small support and that the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.539
 wall as well as start with a small one 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.900
 warm up i call that the dance floor 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.130
 and puts your legs a little further 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.890
 if you open you might want 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 the knees bend slightly towards the outside 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 outside and then you start the basin 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.540
 to move to the right and to the left 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.020
 The legs are very loose to the right 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.950
 and to the left then sometimes the pool 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 revolve 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.690
 does move lower is good 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.789
 something the lower back relaxes the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.719
 lower back mobilizes the bottom 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.940
 push and that makes it so completely in yours 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.940
 change your own rhythm page 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.940
 the other way round 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:12.189
 then times forward and back is 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.290
 his breathing always flows 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:23.409
 calm and evenly through the nose 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:23.409
 and off and again from right to left 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.160
 and then slowly solve well and something 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.670
 continue to stay behind the legs 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.310
 open 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.260
 pushes the po backwards and supports 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.740
 Now here on the back wall ok 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.700
 then try the lower back 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.580
 to push backwards against the wall 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.869
 remain completely upright grounding a fusion 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.840
 switzerland the 10th 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.560
 because neck is long and then presses 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:02.300
 shoulder blades back and stay 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.490
 this position and breathe here calmly and 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.490
 evenly through your nose in and out 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.129
 hold here four more breath attempts 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.099
 raise yourself quite consciously and 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.170
 bend your legs just so far that one 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.010
 good feeling you have a bit allowed 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.810
 you feel your leg muscles 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:33.879
 but it may not be too much for you 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:38.189
 effort and then 8 supports itself 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:40.030
 with your hands off and come forward 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.799
 and then I see with the right one 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.780
 shoulder to the wall and supports yourself 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.700
 the right hand here laterally and 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.269
 bring your left arm up 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.139
 the legs remain open and 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.870
 I now leaned to the right here 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:58.469
 and then start with your left hand 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.469
 pump 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:07.930
 Again, your breathing will flow 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.959
 let her and her arm after longer 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.959
 above 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:23.340
 and then slowly change to we switch 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.330
 the left hand side and the right one 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.180
 poor up 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.670
 the legs are still open and 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.190
 which we are the right side 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.840
 the breathing aids are muscles too 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.680
 so stretch like those between the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.690
 muscles and create space for the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.299
 breathing and then pump it again 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.120
 The legs can be bent back slightly 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.120
 leave and pump here 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.569
 and then loosen up slowly again 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.180
 the back and then start this 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.980
 to step 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.080
 that helps everything if you can 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.700
 Water retention has a bit of the 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.700
 Activate the vein pump 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:21.299
 Ok then go back to the back 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:24.889
 we get into the attitude of war du bois 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.780
 right leg outstretched left leg 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.639
 Make sure you step down 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.940
 not so big but stay 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:35.550
 relatively small and now builds the right 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.960
 leg left leg is stretched and 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:44.370
 presses diffuse outer edge into the ground 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.320
 and then either support you here so 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.600
 that the hands on the pelvic bones 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.360
 But you can also if you like 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.250
 you want the arms to the side 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.250
 stretch out and then look to the right 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:03.240
 and stay here the musculature is allowed 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.870
 Feel it a bit quiet too 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.210
 shoulder muscles think if that 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.400
 baby is there then you need strong good 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.690
 Poor and it never hurts a bit 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.820
 arm and shoulder muscles to strengthen 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:24.390
 press the shoulder blades against the wall 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:27.479

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:33.570
 I leaned now a bit to the side 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:38.390
 only very little and is based here 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.310
 and the left hand stays here 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.170
 but you also like to be here 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.850
 supported if it is pleasant for you 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.010
 you also like to head 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.780
 bring in the back 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.600
 The main thing you will get from the wall behind 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:55.090
 supported on the back 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.090

 from breath to belly and pelvis 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:44.870
 to let space flow 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:46.970
 the shoulder blades against the wall then 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.040
