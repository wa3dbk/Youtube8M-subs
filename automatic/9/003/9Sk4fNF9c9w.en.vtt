all<00:00:01.589> right<00:00:01.740> so<00:00:02.100> for<00:00:02.760> like<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.030> last<00:00:03.240> 15<00:00:03.750> years

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:04.400 
all right so for like the last 15 years

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.350 
all right so for like the last 15 years
we've<00:00:05.400> kind<00:00:05.580> of<00:00:05.670> been<00:00:05.790> pioneering<00:00:06.390> the

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
we've kind of been pioneering the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.480 
we've kind of been pioneering the
conversions<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.599> v8<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.620> obviously<00:00:10.950> it's<00:00:11.130> been

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
conversions to v8 so obviously it's been

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.940 
conversions to v8 so obviously it's been
quite<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> tradition<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.450> Land<00:00:12.690> Cruisers<00:00:13.110> but

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
quite a tradition with Land Cruisers but

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.330 
quite a tradition with Land Cruisers but
we<00:00:14.099> wanted<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.610> do<00:00:14.790> was<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.360> utilize<00:00:16.039> not<00:00:17.039> some

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
we wanted to do was to utilize not some

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.580 
we wanted to do was to utilize not some
leftover<00:00:18.029> small-block<00:00:18.810> sitting<00:00:19.410> in<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
leftover small-block sitting in the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.200 
leftover small-block sitting in the
backyard<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.310> carburetor<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.910> all<00:00:21.060> that

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
backyard with a carburetor and all that

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.670 
backyard with a carburetor and all that
crap<00:00:21.480> because<00:00:21.779> you're<00:00:21.900> really<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.230> trading

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
crap because you're really just trading

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.429 
crap because you're really just trading
evils<00:00:23.090> we<00:00:24.090> really<00:00:24.330> wanted<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.660> evolve<00:00:25.080> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
evils we really wanted to evolve to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.279 
evils we really wanted to evolve to
provide<00:00:26.039> more<00:00:26.310> state-of-the-art<00:00:26.990> v8s<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.170> our

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
provide more state-of-the-art v8s in our

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.189 
provide more state-of-the-art v8s in our
conversions<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.539> initially<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.900> would<00:00:31.050> take

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
conversions so initially we would take

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.250 
conversions so initially we would take
the<00:00:31.410> vortex<00:00:31.920> series<00:00:32.160> from<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.000> CKD<00:00:33.420> 1500

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the vortex series from the CKD 1500

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.280 
the vortex series from the CKD 1500
trucks<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.980> CKD<00:00:35.880> 2500<00:00:36.809> depending<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
client's needs and modify them and then

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.760 
client's needs and modify them and then
my<00:00:40.800> friend<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.219> GM<00:00:41.579> performance<00:00:42.770> started

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
my friend at GM performance started

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.340 
my friend at GM performance started
studying<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.250> concept<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.090> doing<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.170> at

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
studying the concept of doing that at

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.330 
studying the concept of doing that at
the<00:00:46.440> OEM<00:00:46.800> level<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.629> we're<00:00:48.629> quite<00:00:48.870> proud<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
the OEM level so we're quite proud that

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.510 
the OEM level so we're quite proud that
our<00:00:50.340> friends<00:00:50.730> at<00:00:50.850> GM<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.600> engineered<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.520> kit

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
our friends at GM have engineered a kit

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.389 
our friends at GM have engineered a kit
called<00:00:54.420> an<00:00:54.690> e<00:00:54.989> rod<00:00:55.260> kit<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.250> offer

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
called an e rod kit and they offer

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.700 
called an e rod kit and they offer
various<00:00:56.969> displacement<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.960> outputs<00:00:58.469> and

various displacement and outputs and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.250 
various displacement and outputs and
what<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> point<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> e<00:01:00.090> rod<00:01:00.359> program<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
what the point of the e rod program is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.329 
what the point of the e rod program is
is<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.180> conversion<00:01:03.949> comes<00:01:04.949> from

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
is that now the conversion comes from

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.700 
is that now the conversion comes from

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
now unfortunately the transmission you

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.680 
now unfortunately the transmission you
cannot<00:03:25.650> source<00:03:25.980> from<00:03:26.220> GM<00:03:26.640> because<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.540> does

not come with the correct output shaft
lengths<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:31.260> we<00:03:31.709> provide<00:03:32.190> those<00:03:32.459> or<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.880> can

lengths so we provide those or you can
get<00:03:33.239> those<00:03:33.420> elsewhere<00:03:33.860> we<00:03:34.860> generally<00:03:35.340> like<00:03:35.489> to

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
get those elsewhere we generally like to

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.880 
get those elsewhere we generally like to
do<00:03:35.820> them<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.239> keep<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.690> stock<00:03:37.050> transmission

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
do them and keep the stock transmission

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.280 
do them and keep the stock transmission
shifter<00:03:38.459> works<00:03:38.730> out<00:03:38.970> really<00:03:39.239> good<00:03:39.510> we<00:03:40.110> also

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
shifter works out really good we also

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.130 
shifter works out really good we also
keep<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.890> stock<00:03:41.160> tachometer<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.120> just<00:03:42.840> run<00:03:43.110> a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
keep the stock tachometer and just run a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.310 
keep the stock tachometer and just run a
