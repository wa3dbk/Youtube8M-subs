thank<00:00:00.930> you<00:00:01.050> gentlemen<00:00:02.149> 25<00:00:03.149> minute<00:00:03.419> win<00:00:03.570> for

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
thank you gentlemen 25 minute win for

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.990 
thank you gentlemen 25 minute win for
impulse<00:00:04.740> that's<00:00:05.130> an<00:00:05.430> incredible<00:00:05.850> way<00:00:05.970> to

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
impulse that's an incredible way to

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600 
impulse that's an incredible way to
start<00:00:06.330> off<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.480> series<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.230> that's<00:00:08.099> after<00:00:08.370> a

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
start off a series and that's after a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.850 
start off a series and that's after a
really<00:00:09.059> solid<00:00:09.360> first<00:00:09.840> blood<00:00:10.260> by<00:00:10.440> gravity

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
really solid first blood by gravity

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.620 
really solid first blood by gravity
which<00:00:10.980> suggests<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.429> they<00:00:11.610> had<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> decent

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
which suggests that they had a decent

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.330 
which suggests that they had a decent
game<00:00:13.019> plan<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.500> least<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.920> early<00:00:14.190> game

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
game plan at least for the early game

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.580 
game plan at least for the early game
going<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.269> then<00:00:15.570> things<00:00:15.809> kind<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.260> fell<00:00:16.320> if

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
going in but then things kind of fell if

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.090 
going in but then things kind of fell if
they<00:00:16.710> crumbled<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.279> bit<00:00:17.779> yeah<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.080> impulse<00:00:19.890> had

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
they crumbled a bit yeah so impulse had

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
they crumbled a bit yeah so impulse had
hecarim<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.210> that's<00:00:21.390> why<00:00:21.570> gravity<00:00:22.020> went

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
hecarim and so that's why gravity went

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.950 
hecarim and so that's why gravity went
with<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> duo<00:00:22.859> top<00:00:23.160> lane<00:00:23.400> impulse<00:00:24.090> luckily

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
with the duo top lane impulse luckily

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.630 
with the duo top lane impulse luckily
guest<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.529> read<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.890> somehow<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:26.519> they

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
guest or read that somehow and then they

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.609 
guest or read that somehow and then they
also<00:00:26.789> sent<00:00:27.029> their<00:00:27.180> duo<00:00:27.330> top<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.869> already

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
also sent their duo top and already

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.080 
also sent their duo top and already
that's<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.189> really<00:00:29.400> bad<00:00:29.519> start<00:00:29.849> because

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
that's a really bad start because

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
that's a really bad start because
against<00:00:30.420> hecarim<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.320> want<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> be

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
against hecarim you want to be

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.680 
against hecarim you want to be
constantly<00:00:32.219> denying<00:00:32.790> him<00:00:32.969> far<00:00:33.210> more<00:00:33.239> diving

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
constantly denying him far more diving

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.000 
constantly denying him far more diving
him<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.230> making<00:00:34.530> sure<00:00:34.649> he<00:00:34.710> doesn't<00:00:34.950> get

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
him or just making sure he doesn't get

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.979 
him or just making sure he doesn't get
farmed<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.399> all<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.700> then<00:00:36.300> even<00:00:36.809> then<00:00:36.930> a

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
farmed at all and then even then a

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.170 
farmed at all and then even then a
hecarim<00:00:37.469> that's<00:00:37.710> down<00:00:37.950> some<00:00:38.370> CS<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.969> still

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
hecarim that's down some CS is still

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.090 
hecarim that's down some CS is still
pretty<00:00:39.540> fine<00:00:39.809> for<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> heck<00:00:40.200> room<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.649> if

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
pretty fine for the heck room and if

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.410 
pretty fine for the heck room and if
he's<00:00:41.190> doing<00:00:41.399> even<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.820> pretty<00:00:42.030> good<00:00:42.149> still

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
he's doing even it's pretty good still

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.360 
he's doing even it's pretty good still
if<00:00:42.750> he<00:00:42.930> was<00:00:42.989> winning<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.559> how<00:00:44.100> he<00:00:44.160> was

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
if he was winning like how he was

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.799 
if he was winning like how he was
against<00:00:44.640> maokai<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.180> bottom<00:00:45.480> then<00:00:45.629> that's

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
against maokai and bottom then that's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.440 
against maokai and bottom then that's
it's<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.829> bad<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.090> gravity<00:00:48.090> because<00:00:48.329> you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
it's really bad for gravity because you

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660 
it's really bad for gravity because you
can<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.600> TP<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.950> his<00:00:50.070> home<00:00:50.219> guard<00:00:50.430> boots

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
can just TP with his home guard boots

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.100 
can just TP with his home guard boots
and<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.030> pretty<00:00:51.329> much<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> kill<00:00:51.899> every

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
and then pretty much get a kill every

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.990 
and then pretty much get a kill every
time<00:00:52.260> his<00:00:52.350> teepees<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.890> alex<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.640> saw<00:00:53.789> some

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
time his teepees up alex we saw some

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420 
time his teepees up alex we saw some
over<00:00:54.300> aggression<00:00:54.899> come<00:00:55.199> out<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.590> gravity

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
over aggression come out of gravity

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
over aggression come out of gravity
after<00:00:56.879> getting<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.270> first<00:00:57.539> blood<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.020> saw

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
after getting that first blood we saw

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.220 
after getting that first blood we saw
both<00:00:58.440> solo<00:00:58.770> laners<00:00:59.160> attempt<00:00:59.730> kills<00:01:00.230> by

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
both solo laners attempt kills by

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810 
both solo laners attempt kills by
themselves<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.920> their<00:01:02.039> lanes<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.489> having

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
themselves in their lanes and having

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.899 
themselves in their lanes and having
them<00:01:02.940> turned<00:01:03.210> around<00:01:03.359> which<00:01:04.280> proved<00:01:05.280> proved

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
them turned around which proved proved

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.520 
them turned around which proved proved
to<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.090> rather<00:01:06.299> detrimental<00:01:07.260> when<00:01:07.380> you're

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
to be rather detrimental when you're

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.289 
to be rather detrimental when you're
giving<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.890> kill<00:01:08.100> over<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> hecarim<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
giving a kill over to hecarim and to a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
giving a kill over to hecarim and to a
Vladimir<00:01:09.680> ultimately<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.130> those<00:01:11.310> two

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
Vladimir ultimately in the in those two

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
Vladimir ultimately in the in those two
lanes<00:01:11.700> well<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.780> only<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.500> killer

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
lanes well I think that only the killer

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.100 
lanes well I think that only the killer
on<00:01:14.100> hecarim<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.060> important<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
on hecarim was that important because it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.990 
on hecarim was that important because it
like<00:01:16.560> open<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> hecarim<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:17.850> like

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
like open up the hecarim because like

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.240 
like open up the hecarim because like
maokai<00:01:18.299> used<00:01:18.509> his<00:01:18.720> teepee<00:01:19.110> hair<00:01:19.770> cream<00:01:19.979> still

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
maokai used his teepee hair cream still

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.429 
maokai used his teepee hair cream still
got<00:01:20.400> his<00:01:20.580> teepee<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.150> then<00:01:21.570> he<00:01:21.780> uses<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.320> in

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
got his teepee and then he uses it in

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.590 
got his teepee and then he uses it in
like<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.830> best<00:01:22.950> way<00:01:23.159> possible<00:01:23.189> he<00:01:24.119> snowballs

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
like the best way possible he snowballs

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.020 
like the best way possible he snowballs
the<00:01:24.810> midlane<00:01:25.080> back<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.759> then<00:01:26.759> Vladimir

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the midlane back and then Vladimir

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.760 
the midlane back and then Vladimir
starts<00:01:27.570> winning<00:01:27.780> when<00:01:28.020> he's<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> scaling

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
starts winning when he's the scaling

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.260 
starts winning when he's the scaling
champion<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> heck<00:01:29.670> room<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.000> winning

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
champion and the heck room is winning

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.030 
champion and the heck room is winning
when<00:01:30.420> he's<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.780> scaling<00:01:31.110> champion<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
when he's the scaling champion so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.319 
when he's the scaling champion so
basically<00:01:32.400> two<00:01:32.640> lanes<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> should<00:01:33.180> be

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
basically two lanes that should be

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.940 
basically two lanes that should be
losing<00:01:33.600> their<00:01:33.750> winning<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.590> pretty

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
losing their winning so it's like pretty

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.030 
losing their winning so it's like pretty
grim<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.689> raj<00:01:36.689> ghat<00:01:36.900> really<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.740> he's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
grim and raj ghat really going he's

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.490 
grim and raj ghat really going he's
showing<00:01:38.430> why<00:01:38.610> he<00:01:38.970> favors<00:01:39.509> leasing<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.079> much<00:01:40.259> i

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
showing why he favors leasing so much i

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.850 
showing why he favors leasing so much i
think<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:42.270> overall<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.409> aggression

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
think that like overall the aggression

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.980 
think that like overall the aggression
at<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.820> would<00:01:45.180> say<00:01:45.299> bought<00:01:45.509> land<00:01:45.750> with

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
at like I would say bought land with

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.870 
at like I would say bought land with
like<00:01:46.380> four<00:01:46.770> top<00:01:46.950> layers<00:01:47.189> right<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.670> what<00:01:47.850> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
like four top layers right as what I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.130 
like four top layers right as what I
mean<00:01:48.170> was<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.670> really<00:01:50.670> strange<00:01:51.420> from<00:01:51.720> okay

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
mean was a really strange from okay

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.740 
mean was a really strange from okay
because<00:01:52.799> his<00:01:53.280> solo<00:01:53.700> kill<00:01:53.970> potential<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.570> not

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
because his solo kill potential is not

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.289 
because his solo kill potential is not
that<00:01:54.869> high<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.340> also<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> think<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.820> they<00:01:57.270> got

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that high and also I think that they got

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.539 
that high and also I think that they got
really<00:01:57.689> good<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.409> video<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:59.100> Mark<00:01:59.369> I

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
really good like to video with Mark I

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.300 
really good like to video with Mark I
and<00:01:59.759> reksai<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.930> maybe<00:02:01.200> after<00:02:01.380> Rex<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.890> got<00:02:02.070> kill

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and reksai so maybe after Rex I got kill

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.120 
and reksai so maybe after Rex I got kill
like<00:02:02.520> at<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> door<00:02:03.420> lanky<00:02:04.200> should<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:04.890> like

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
like at the door lanky should have like

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.820 
like at the door lanky should have like
gun<00:02:05.490> faster<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> bot<00:02:06.960> lane

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
gun faster to the bot lane

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.180 
gun faster to the bot lane
was<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.790> rush<00:02:09.180> he<00:02:09.810> was<00:02:10.020> behind<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.800> CS

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
was a like rush he was behind in CS

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.130 
was a like rush he was behind in CS
because<00:02:11.580> he<00:02:11.730> wasn't<00:02:11.880> farming<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.450> much<00:02:12.630> but

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
because he wasn't farming that much but

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.280 
because he wasn't farming that much but
his<00:02:13.320> ganks<00:02:13.740> were<00:02:13.890> really<00:02:14.250> really<00:02:14.400> good<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.290> I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
his ganks were really really good and I

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.050 
his ganks were really really good and I
think<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:17.100> was<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.640> thing<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
think that was like the thing of the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.760 
think that was like the thing of the
game<00:02:18.240> that's<00:02:19.050> why<00:02:19.320> I<00:02:19.350> think<00:02:19.500> they'd<00:02:19.710> be

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
game that's why I think they'd be

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.680 
game that's why I think they'd be
placing<00:02:20.430> over<00:02:20.670> other<00:02:20.880> champs<00:02:21.300> because<00:02:21.570> they

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
placing over other champs because they

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.860 
placing over other champs because they
really<00:02:22.080> wanted<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:23.570> they<00:02:24.570> would<00:02:24.690> get

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
really wanted to like they would get

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.140 
really wanted to like they would get
really<00:02:25.170> weak<00:02:25.440> early<00:02:25.860> champs<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.400> they<00:02:26.820> really

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
really weak early champs and they really

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.000 
really weak early champs and they really
wanted<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.450> boost<00:02:28.200> him<00:02:28.350> up<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.740> really

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
wanted to boost him up with a really

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.530 
wanted to boost him up with a really
strong<00:02:29.160> jungler<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.910> that's<00:02:30.240> what<00:02:30.390> they<00:02:30.510> did

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
strong jungler and that's what they did

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.270 
strong jungler and that's what they did
