00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:23.670
 waaa okay 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.110
 brother has copied him from the lure you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.970
 to realize that you can count on 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.800
 that life lasts that we find the meaning 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.630
 realities oath of march 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.400
 the south loire makes it survive seems 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.410
 yeah in any case keep faith in 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.000
 god and that's certified if it becomes 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.860
 if god for us to take a step back 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.540
 with all that is they are doing everything for 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.150
 we lock ourselves into a system that we 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.040
 exterminate may we formate as 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.720
 hard drives based on famines 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.300
 wars crisis economic crime and 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.250
 dictatorship it's hard to live in these 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.960
 conditions it's hard we lose all desire 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.790
 to love life becomes a torture 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.140
 many of my brothers are saturating because 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.090
 that for us there is no structure 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.770
 for that pop carbus not hope 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.719
 that it is necessary as fuel frankly 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.640
 it's time and I promise you when the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.320
 white late as dogs loose nothing 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.700
 because we know it's now and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.190
 when everyone gets active in the good 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.649
 sense we will begin to hope yeah in 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.420
 waiting continues to scratch seems that 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.520
 I think so I am so hopefully 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.320
 what does it make me a youngster 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 mission mission taken in a circle 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.939
 vicious son sure i have in the aim 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.090
 and the one that hides the visu and the sleep 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.350
 hair but bike to be jaded from the top 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.420
 summary the system is a zoo 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.310
 the mind locked in a cage did 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.290
 for the mothership and that's the hope 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.330
 lose the waters it's god who holds him 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.000
 the hand whose work continues is 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.710
 his quenelle it's crazy when we die 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.210
 we only wear what we leave 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.040
 to say the name 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.869
 so only the truth hurts I do my 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.790
 place like tiananmen wrong in the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.360
 wall of china you will see me fill 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.520
 chic for the Lord asks the rodez 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.140
 that it costs them to hope for faith and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.790
 the survival instinct but basically the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.100
 two are related so I want to rule 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.500
 as a lioness of the ring ambitions that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.210
 my dish are committed by hope done 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.740
 live 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.500
 but what fuse sports die of 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.410
 hungry me I say that hope and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.739
 survive we want to feel alive 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.360
 before the end yesterday by hope done 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.890
 live 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.650
 but those who live in hope die of 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.890
 hungry me I say that hope is doing 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.890
 smile we all want and are alive there
