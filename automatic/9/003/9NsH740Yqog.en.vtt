00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.900 

it<00:06:10.930> tucks<00:06:11.260> into<00:06:11.410> corners<00:06:11.860> so<00:06:12.220> nicely<00:06:12.700> just

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
it tucks into corners so nicely just

from pushing really hard around corners

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.800 
from pushing really hard around corners
especially<00:06:22.540> if<00:06:23.260> the<00:06:23.350> tarmac<00:06:23.740> is<00:06:24.070> in<00:06:24.370> smooth

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.020 

at<00:06:27.810> normal<00:06:28.229> speeds<00:06:28.470> the<00:06:28.650> a4<00:06:29.039> is<00:06:29.189> quite<00:06:29.520> nice<00:06:29.729> to

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
at normal speeds the a4 is quite nice to

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.029 
at normal speeds the a4 is quite nice to
be<00:06:30.210> in<00:06:30.360> especially<00:06:30.780> when<00:06:31.379> you<00:06:31.470> know<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.800> fuel

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
be in especially when you know the fuel

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.670 
be in especially when you know the fuel
efficiency<00:06:32.550> is<00:06:32.729> decent

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.129 

the<00:06:36.160> 1.8<00:06:36.639> turbocharged<00:06:37.210> motor<00:06:37.419> in<00:06:37.660> the<00:06:37.750> a4

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
the 1.8 turbocharged motor in the a4

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.050 
the 1.8 turbocharged motor in the a4
returned<00:06:38.620> eight<00:06:38.830> and<00:06:39.070> a<00:06:39.100> half<00:06:39.130> kilometers<00:06:39.880> per

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
returned eight and a half kilometers per

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.510 
returned eight and a half kilometers per
liter<00:06:40.240> in<00:06:40.449> the<00:06:40.540> city<00:06:40.780> and<00:06:41.020> a<00:06:41.380> decent<00:06:41.650> 12.5

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
liter in the city and a decent 12.5

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.290 
liter in the city and a decent 12.5
kilometers<00:06:43.030> per<00:06:43.210> litre<00:06:43.389> out<00:06:43.690> on<00:06:44.139> the<00:06:44.259> highway

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.110 

so<00:06:48.230> the<00:06:48.350> a4<00:06:48.650> is<00:06:48.770> definitely<00:06:49.370> an<00:06:49.460> improved<00:06:49.850> car

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
so the a4 is definitely an improved car

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.480 
so the a4 is definitely an improved car
in<00:06:50.330> terms<00:06:50.660> of<00:06:50.870> looks<00:06:51.110> and<00:06:51.290> interiors<00:06:51.770> subtly

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
in terms of looks and interiors subtly

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.460 
in terms of looks and interiors subtly
yet<00:06:52.940> appreciably<00:06:53.360> in<00:06:53.660> other<00:06:54.080> ways<00:06:54.260> more

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
yet appreciably in other ways more

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.860 
yet appreciably in other ways more
substantially<00:06:55.130> the<00:06:55.580> software<00:06:56.090> ride<00:06:56.300> setup

substantially the software ride setup

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.540 
substantially the software ride setup
just<00:06:57.050> makes<00:06:57.470> the<00:06:57.590> a4<00:06:57.920> so<00:06:58.190> much<00:06:58.340> more

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
just makes the a4 so much more

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.640 
just makes the a4 so much more
comfortable<00:06:58.730> to<00:06:59.150> be<00:06:59.180> in<00:06:59.420> and<00:06:59.600> the<00:07:00.020> engine<00:07:00.260> the

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
1.8 liter motor has been revised

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.080 
1.8 liter motor has been revised
extensively<00:07:03.620> which<00:07:03.950> makes<00:07:04.190> it<00:07:04.370> just<00:07:04.550> so<00:07:04.700> much

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090 
extensively which makes it just so much

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.600 
extensively which makes it just so much
more<00:07:05.570> refined<00:07:05.780> and<00:07:06.260> comes<00:07:06.800> with<00:07:06.890> extra<00:07:07.370> power

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
more refined and comes with extra power

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.310 
more refined and comes with extra power
and<00:07:07.850> torque<00:07:08.150> which<00:07:08.660> gives<00:07:08.960> you<00:07:09.140> more

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
and torque which gives you more
