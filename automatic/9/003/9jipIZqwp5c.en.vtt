now when using a railgun you'll notice

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
now when using a railgun you'll notice
two<00:00:30.210> things<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
two things one of which is that the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.430 
two things one of which is that the
scope<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.640> 20<00:00:33.059> X<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.290> things

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
scope is like 20 X so you see if things

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.740 
scope is like 20 X so you see if things
pretty<00:00:34.800> far<00:00:35.100> away<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> other<00:00:36.180> thing<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
pretty far away and the other thing is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.709 
pretty far away and the other thing is
that<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.829> delay<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.430> 2<00:00:39.120> maybe<00:00:39.480> 1

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
that you have like a delay of 2 maybe 1

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.049 
that you have like a delay of 2 maybe 1
seconds<00:00:40.410> before<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.550> actually<00:00:41.700> shoot

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
seconds before you can actually shoot

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.209 
seconds before you can actually shoot
the<00:00:42.120> bullets<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.960> kind<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.559> like<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> Magnum

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the bullets so kind of like the Magnum

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
the bullets so kind of like the Magnum
was<00:00:44.399> before<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.059> patched<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.350> my

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
was before they patched it and in my

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.110 
was before they patched it and in my
opinion<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.190> cool<00:00:47.399> thing<00:00:47.640> because<00:00:47.820> having

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
opinion it's a cool thing because having

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
opinion it's a cool thing because having
a<00:00:48.270> railgun<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.870> hitting<00:00:49.110> everything<00:00:49.920> would

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
a railgun one hitting everything would

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.770 
a railgun one hitting everything would
be<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.610> opie<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.270> didn't<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.719> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
be kind of opie if you didn't have a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.569 
be kind of opie if you didn't have a
delay<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.260> you're<00:00:52.980> kind<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.219> you're<00:00:53.430> gonna

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
delay so you're kind of you're gonna

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.430 
delay so you're kind of you're gonna

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.709 
you my first reaction when I when I
first<00:00:59.160> kill<00:00:59.579> someone<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.329> gun<00:01:00.539> because

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
first kill someone with this gun because

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.240 
first kill someone with this gun because
I<00:01:00.930> thought<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> was<00:01:01.289> pretty<00:01:01.590> hilarious

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
I thought it was pretty hilarious

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:14.980 
I thought it was pretty hilarious
oh<00:01:09.979> fuck<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:12.420> fucking<00:01:12.840> power<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.590> No

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
oh fuck that is fucking power to do No

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.200 
oh fuck that is fucking power to do No
now<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.200> seems<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.920> hit<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.369> any<00:01:17.790> part

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
now it seems to be a one hit in any part

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.760 
now it seems to be a one hit in any part
of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> body<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.110> also<00:01:19.170> seems<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> have

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
of the body and it also seems to have

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.499 
of the body and it also seems to have
like<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> blast<00:01:20.369> radius<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.240> shoot<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
like a blast radius so if you shoot the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.420 
like a blast radius so if you shoot the
ground<00:01:21.810> around<00:01:22.080> people<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.070> still<00:01:23.280> do

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
ground around people you can still do

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.310 
ground around people you can still do
damage<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.810> you're<00:01:24.960> lucky<00:01:25.140> even

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
damage to them or if you're lucky even

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830 
damage to them or if you're lucky even
kill<00:01:25.799> them<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.369> yeah<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> think<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.330> sums<00:01:27.630> up

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
kill them so yeah I think that sums up

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.350 
kill them so yeah I think that sums up
how<00:01:28.049> amazing<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.950> gun<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.150> feels

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
how amazing this gun is it just feels

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
how amazing this gun is it just feels
really<00:01:30.540> powerful<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.560> lot<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> fun<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
really powerful and it's a lot of fun to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740 
really powerful and it's a lot of fun to
just<00:01:32.310> blast<00:01:32.579> people<00:01:33.090> away<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> rail

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
just blast people away with the rail

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.380 
just blast people away with the rail
guns<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:35.070> recommend<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.850> go<00:01:35.970> ahead<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.270> try

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
