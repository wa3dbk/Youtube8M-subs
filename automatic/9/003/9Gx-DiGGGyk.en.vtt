00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
cockpit flight I bet that's a little bit

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.740 
cockpit flight I bet that's a little bit
different<00:00:41.820> than<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> flights<00:00:42.270> were<00:00:42.420> used<00:00:42.660> to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
different than the flights were used to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.590 
different than the flights were used to
you<00:00:42.899> right<00:00:43.050> well<00:00:43.379> yeah<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.949> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.219> more<00:00:44.600> free

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you right well yeah it's a lot more free

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.060

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
than most people you know it's not

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.250 
than most people you know it's not
definitely<00:00:47.609> not<00:00:47.730> confining<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.840> you're

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
definitely not confining because you're

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.410 
definitely not confining because you're
out<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.859> the<00:00:49.920> wind<00:00:49.969> see<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
