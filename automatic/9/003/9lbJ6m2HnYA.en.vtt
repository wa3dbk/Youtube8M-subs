00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 for feeding the vintage series 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.939
 della gar martina we used the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.699
 big john which is a 600 feeder 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.010
 million for carried out by the car martin 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.609
 in collaboration with the fox it has seven 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.470
 outputs to 9 volts are used there 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.110
 very simple cables on one side 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.390
 pin jack and a plug-in part 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.670
 power the classic pedals that can 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.309
 be both calm sits other brands yes 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.780
 connect the pin jack in the appropriate jack 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.460
 sector and this is our blog 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.460
 ready for pedal insertion 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.630
 let's take a look in depth 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.130
 now to the red rivit of her in the series 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.670
 won c track armed in fed a 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.100
 nine volts we have a single button that 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.260
 turns on and off we have the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.630
 repeat check which is the number of 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.190
 reps we can have that time 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.430
 a maximum time of 600 arrives 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:21.290
 milliseconds don that just goes to 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.550
 change the tone of the note tone 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.880
 that we are going to repeat then we will be 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.000
 deng all open will be deng closed deng 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.210
 will be a little more closed and I read is 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.100
 clearly the volume of the repetition 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.100
 we see that we are here for example 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.619
 like its big brother the lex 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.320
 l also the red repeat keeps a lot 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.460
 faithful the dynamics of what we 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.560
 we are playing in relation to 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.689
 repetitions when this dynamic 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.310
 increases repetitions increase by 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.230
 dynamic this one thing really a lot 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.910
 important I let you hear about this 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.470
 speech of the ton 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.790
 when we go to heal a note for 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.790
 example a king 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.209
 now with hilton we have the maximum 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.290
 we have more or less the same sound 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.450
 same stamp if we do not go to 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.910
 to close all hilton we will have one 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:37.330
 darker repetition more closed than 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.470
 stamp with respect to the original p this 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.480
 You could go very well have 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.400
 present we need one 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:57.400
 repetition on nine very sharp for 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:58.930
 example looks like another tool not 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.780
 necessarily ours that repeats itself 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.430
 instead when we are at most we have 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.329
 more or less the same repetition 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.840
 therefore using it in a situation too 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.840
 arpeggiated for examples 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.920
 the issue keeps coming back to us 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.780
 it gets bigger the sound we enrich the 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.080
 part we are playing with delle 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.390
 precise repetitions and very well 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.530
 moreover, to outline open cortona 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.910
 we have this kind of sound 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.530
 when we need it I am no longer 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.900
 apologies the editions will be enough to close the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.570
 tone the time to its maximum 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.140
 repetition at this timing 600 thousand e 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.140
 about seconds 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.280
 we also increase the number of 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.280
 reps 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.490
 we have a health care that almost resembles a 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.030
 loop there is this infinite repeat ad 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.680
 libitum 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.240
 however it continues for a long time 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.400
 of time allows us to do some 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.200
 small overlaps clearly not 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.940
 we are talking about a look but one of her but 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.710
 the potential of this small 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.200
 car that really comes at a price 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.300
 very competitive also allow us to 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.810
 have situations like this here too 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.240
 superimpose chord sounds with 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.660
 small overlapping parts 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.660
 for example 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.630
 therefore allows us to have the 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.790
 very very special sovereignty 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:52.560
 moreover, following the dynamics very much 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.570
 of what we are playing we have a 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.960
 also arrangement of the parts where 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.670
 we can make stronger notes and more notes 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:03.660
 low intensity and we have 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:05.550
 very good sound indeed and 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:23.340
 where we can have possibilities 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:24.560
 creative such as interesting ie 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.910
 notes do not overlap 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.520
 necessarily but they manage to go 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.590
 two roads slightly abacha enough 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.240
 parallel and we have sounds that 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.600
 they overlap each other from time to time 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.760
 however it is certainly a pedal from 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.590
 experiment and can afford to 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.170
 have very very implications 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.520
 creative well with this I greet you vi 

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.560
 I leave your experimentations with 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.270
 ready to eat and see you soon at 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.420
 next pedal 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.420
 Hello 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.610
 Yup
