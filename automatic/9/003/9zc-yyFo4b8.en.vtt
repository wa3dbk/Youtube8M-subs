00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.040
 they update all their means to 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.740
 a new video demos for minecraft in 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.810
 your version 1.7 points 2 today I bring you 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.730
 the TV mod for which we will add a 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.890
 new tea from another game is that we 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.279
 will allow us to teleport from a place 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.470
 another quick and easy way 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.599
 you can see here I have three points or three 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.699
 marks on the map of different colors 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.030
 a green one red and the moral is for 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.980
 she and this is the item that we are 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.079
 adds when we stop over him 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.150
 and wait a moment to load the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.470
 interface as you can see below 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.910
 He tells me that if he loves me 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.650
 transport to point 1 which is where 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.440
 I'm at point 2 or the drivers 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.720
 was selected point 2 brings me the point 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.420
 2 as you can see there is point 1 and 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.239
 sure for about this one 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.049
 and selected that I'm going to do the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.740
 point 3 then it brings me to point 3 that what 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.270
 I have some trees and how are the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.270
 different points that I have 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.020
 similarly it should be noted that this 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.960
 mode is compatible with the kraft link and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.250
 so we can see his character 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.860
 pressing the g key here does not say the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.660
 kraft the phone once we place 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.250
 the TV for us to tell ourselves that this 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.250
 kind of little book with coordinates 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.640
 stop this because we can have 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.530
 transport us from one place to another 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.150
 fast and simple way 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.610
 to download this mode what 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.010
 will have to address the description 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.560
 of the video where I will leave a link as 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.940
 it stands out which will take them to actress 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.640
 and once there we wait for 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.040
 after five seconds we give 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.420
 click on jump advertising and once 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.310
 we have clicked there this takes us 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.380
 automatically to the mega server 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.909
 where the file is located 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.149
 heavy file point 1 mb 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.520
 as I was telling you in block 3 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.700
 against the seconds of jumping advertising 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.780
 and this will take us to mega at once 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.370
 here in mega we click 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.780
 we hope that cargo needs it and we give 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.690
 click on the red button that says everything 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.520

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.350
 of which we will right click on it we give 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.090
 copy and we will pay it within the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.710
 folder that is inside the 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.970
 minecraft point to access the point 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.650
 minecraft can do what I do 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.850
 direct access or they can simply 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.850

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.800

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.470
 data percent click on accept or 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.240
 simply press enter and train 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.740
 he pointed while then the folder mos and 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.390

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.860
 you the pac of has not taken off can 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.660
 enjoy 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.760
 in the game I also wanted to make a 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.450
 question in this sport and that is 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.450
 I wanted to know your opinion about it 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.610
 and what do they think about making a 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.560

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.290

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.489

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.590
 start to go out the modes for 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.810
 newer versions that exist 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.680
 currently of the game more also be 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.180

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.340
 all subscribers would like that 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.819
 after I did a series or something 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.099
 the style then leave a comment 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.709

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.870
 writers I'll be drawing a 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.770

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.390

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.640
