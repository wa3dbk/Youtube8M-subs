00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.160
 what is a NATO 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.780
 one is also a being of terror while 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.210

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.160
 his room watching anime and having manga 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.400
 and especially making the rooster 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.440
 thinking Japanese or in drawings you have already 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 taken a little further east , for 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.510
 Seriously I'm not making fun of the rags 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.230
 for nothing I consider myself taco and I'm 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.080
 proud of it 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.990
 but there are some people who wear it 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:37.910
 a little externally first 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:40.730
 what is otaku in itself the word otaku 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.850
 has several meanings in japan is 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.010
 a person very addicted something not only to 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.339
 Anime the manga as in Europe 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.530
 in the West to anything very addicted 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.960
 to the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.769
 that you can spend all your money and 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.440
 not all your time in this is bad to be 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.030
 otaku in japan, that is, we have not 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.729
 caught the word and we have given to 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.820
 meaning that is the person 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.220
 amateur anime brother in america 1 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.110
 Taco is always fried 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.860
 he is a lifelong geek of these 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.290
 crazy years his critics 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.530
 a social misfit who spends all his 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.290
 life in his room on the computer 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.740
 light dress 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.260
 Besides these types we can also 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.260
 classify the otakus in as in levels 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.570
 of otaku the first visual level the one 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.240
 see anime but do not even know what it is 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.020
 Japanese anime and see it because they throw it 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.720
 on TV and only if it is folded in 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.620
 Spanish or good in the derogatory language 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.900
 the second the otaku beginner what 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.660
 would be the one who has seen a couple of 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.720
 animes never in your fucking life have you read 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.880
 manga but but it does not matter he has seen 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.660
 anime and that's where it was created is like 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.880
 and can criticize and what remains 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.470
 I have not seen a ring you can say 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.900
 what 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.780
 in adductors fuck without having seen 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.750
 Naruto who does have a lot of her 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.450
 has parts 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.070
 or you can say that he gave a bowl is the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.980
 best mood in the world and has only seen 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.220
 something is typical 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.080
 and the third is the otaku of all life 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.980
 it's not like a good lota with normal 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.319
 who sees manga anime sometimes you 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.360
 like anime know about anime can 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.970
 allow yourself to criticize always from the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.280
 expert criticize analyze animes 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.910
 if you want to be otaku or if you are otaku 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.150
 this one should therefore be no more 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.629
 no less 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.970
 the next room is already a bit already 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:53.709
 to go over is the otaku addict who 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:57.879
 he prefers to be unanimous in his house 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.909
 or playing video games or reading 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:04.530
 manga that go out with your friends and good 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.530
 what would be a geek but 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.640
 like the extreme otaku the one that instead 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.510
 to download the anime and its stupidity is going 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.489
 to the maximum and 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.370
 what you buy goes to the store and with 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.410
 marbles when you can stop 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.640
 Internet 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.300
 buy it and read all the dots sleeves 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.490
 of all the anime points and they are known 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.060
 the names of all the authors and already 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.430
 use Japanese words and believe 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.160
 one of the digital characters by 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.070
 last we have the tag fan boy this is the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.250
 worst of the worst you can 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.700
 find is the favor 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.100
 the convoy has been unanimous and no longer 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.350
 you need to see more because you know that is 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.300
 the best mood of the point and that nothing is going to 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.860
 overcome has seen several animes but 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.860
 they still think that the first one who has 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.560
 seen or the second the third or the his 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.200
 preferred is going to be the best anime and that 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.690
 It is a favorite character for all 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.050
 and what is a god is his character 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:17.250
 favorite and that nothing is bad 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.739
 what otakus do you consider me? 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.900
 something like that between the normal otaku of 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.630
 the entire intermediate route and the otaku 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.350
 addicted because sometimes I prefer to be in 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.040
 my house watching anime that that girl 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.450
 good until here the video leave me in the 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.180
 comments that you want me to talk about 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.600
 the next video but surely not 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.830
 see him and god this video 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:45.010
 and after these people and at the end of 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.470
 say on the subject but you can say 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.930
 a subject would show badly and I would give 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.120
 thank you 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.009
 and I would not be alone in this world since 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.400
 I would give a lot 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:59.520
 because rotated accompany that you give 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.520
 taste
