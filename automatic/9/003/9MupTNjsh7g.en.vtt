00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.010
 We are here at the panorama condo. 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:20.450
 a lot that has here in the municipality 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.000
 of piracaia close to joanÃ³polis where 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:28.090
 sabesp is doing a work 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.210
 monstrous dam to dam the water 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:36.440
 and collect the rest you have on 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.430
 jacarey river reservoir that is the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.090
 last reservoir this work is not 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:47.210
 unauthorized persons are doing without 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:53.329
 I'll zoom in and you'll get the 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:57.020
 machines in the background and machines 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.810
 working on the dam 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.759
 then that water will not end 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:07.280
 more water is impossible to have more water 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.890
 so they will play through that 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.890
 landfill here will collect this water more 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.409
 that is on our left which is 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.260
 the end of the reservoir reaches the volume 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.640
 dead is two because the dead volume one 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.560
 It's this quota that's here and it's more for 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.070
 A little dry up there is near the 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.799
 tunnel 7 from the dam here I already fell 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.510
 so for the record, right, I 'm 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.790
 showing you 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.280
 No one took these pictures here I am. 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.640
 getting here now right? 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.369
 and to register with the machines back 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.369
 another working there 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.210
 then it is a dam to dam the water 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.710
 bombs will be placed here and we will 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.920
 cast this water from the flu and killed two ne 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.840
 for it to be achieved is through 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.119
 bombs they have thrown in dead volume 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.350
 one for later 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.050
 and on that rise because the bombs 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.990
 sluices they are far above this 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.520
 here is the end of the reservoir then 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.520
 It's registered and for you.
