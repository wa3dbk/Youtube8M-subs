slim phone and the fingerprint scanner
and<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.760> course<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.330> has<00:01:12.479> 1.8<00:01:13.140> gigahertz

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
and of course it has 1.8 gigahertz

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.700 
and of course it has 1.8 gigahertz
quad-core<00:01:14.909> plus<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.780> point<00:01:15.960> three<00:01:16.259> gigahertz

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
quad-core plus one point three gigahertz

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.429 
quad-core plus one point three gigahertz
quad-core<00:01:17.310> oh<00:01:17.759> yeah<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.900> Exynos

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
quad-core oh yeah this is the Exynos

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.010 
quad-core oh yeah this is the Exynos
variant<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.400> didn't<00:01:21.119> got<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.450> Snapdragon

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
variant so I didn't got the Snapdragon

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.330 
variant so I didn't got the Snapdragon
variants<00:01:22.470> which<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.890> coming<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.310> like

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
variants which is coming with like

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.990 
variants which is coming with like
snapping<00:01:23.729> at<00:01:23.909> 6:15<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:25.520> maybe<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.850> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
snapping at 6:15 but maybe it is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.390 
snapping at 6:15 but maybe it is
snapping<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.450> 15<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.470> don't<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.159> know

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
snapping at 15 but I don't really know

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.990 
snapping at 15 but I don't really know
because<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.710> Snapdragon<00:01:32.280> 615

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
because I think it is Snapdragon 615

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.800 
because I think it is Snapdragon 615
because<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:34.409> know<00:01:34.670> 800<00:01:35.670> F<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.420> most<00:01:36.659> of

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
because you know 800 F so but most of

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.410 
because you know 800 F so but most of
models<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.170> has<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.650> F<00:01:38.009> at<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.060> end<00:01:39.090> are

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
models that has this F at the end are

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
models that has this F at the end are
basically<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.170> Snapdragon<00:01:40.680> ones<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.040> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
basically the Snapdragon ones but I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.609 
basically the Snapdragon ones but I
don't<00:01:41.670> really<00:01:41.820> know<00:01:42.030> because<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:43.140> know<00:01:43.259> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
don't really know because you know I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
don't really know because you know I
don't<00:01:44.040> know<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.970> coming<00:01:45.329> from

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
don't know that if it's coming from

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.630 
don't know that if it's coming from
India<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.200> Pakistan<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.460> is

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
know if we know if we're going to seize

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.089 
know if we know if we're going to seize
the<00:03:57.120> a-10<00:03:57.840> or<00:03:58.079> something<00:03:58.560> like<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.859> but<00:03:59.040> I

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
the a-10 or something like that but I

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.750 
the a-10 or something like that but I
think<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.549> a8<00:04:00.000> might<00:04:00.510> be<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.979> last

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
think the a8 might be that that the last

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.390 
think the a8 might be that that the last
one<00:04:03.030> from<00:04:03.239> this<00:04:03.479> lineup<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.169> the<00:04:05.069> screen<00:04:05.370> is

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
one from this lineup so the screen is

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.550 
one from this lineup so the screen is
red<00:04:05.879> bright<00:04:06.120> first<00:04:06.870> so<00:04:07.139> I'm<00:04:07.229> just<00:04:07.349> going<00:04:07.530> to

more<00:04:26.310> next<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:30.220> course<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:30.580> coming<00:04:30.910> with<00:04:31.060> the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
more next of course is coming with the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.550 
more next of course is coming with the
with<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.840> lollipop<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:34.300> believe<00:04:35.290> it's<00:04:35.440> going

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
with the lollipop I believe it's going

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.490 
with the lollipop I believe it's going
to<00:04:35.620> be<00:04:35.710> 5.1<00:04:36.490> or<00:04:36.730> or<00:04:37.330> maybe<00:04:37.600> 5.0<00:04:38.020> point<00:04:38.170> two<00:04:38.290> so

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
to be 5.1 or or maybe 5.0 point two so

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.560 
to be 5.1 or or maybe 5.0 point two so
as<00:04:39.070> you<00:04:39.190> can<00:04:39.280> see<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.580> has<00:04:39.730> this<00:04:40.000> fingerprint

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570
