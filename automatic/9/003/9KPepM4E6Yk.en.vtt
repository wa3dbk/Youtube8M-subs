with Lightroom versions that are earlier

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.090

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
tricks and techniques that the earlier

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.230 
tricks and techniques that the earlier
versions<00:00:27.619> don't<00:00:27.800> have<00:00:28.099> that<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.519> am<00:00:28.730> in<00:00:29.029> love

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
versions don't have that I am in love

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.799 
versions don't have that I am in love
with<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:30.580> those<00:00:31.580> are<00:00:31.910> what<00:00:32.090> I'm<00:00:32.210> using<00:00:32.450> to

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
with and those are what I'm using to

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.420 
with and those are what I'm using to
create<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:33.440> set<00:00:33.710> it's<00:00:33.950> something<00:00:34.250> that<00:00:34.340> you

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
create this set it's something that you

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.220 
create this set it's something that you
really<00:00:34.610> didn't<00:00:34.969> see<00:00:35.030> in<00:00:35.420> earlier<00:00:35.719> versions<00:00:36.110> of

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
really didn't see in earlier versions of

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.010 
really didn't see in earlier versions of
Lightroom<00:00:36.730> so<00:00:37.730> only<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.300> current<00:00:38.660> version

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
Lightroom so only the current version

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.470 
Lightroom so only the current version
Lightroom<00:00:39.320> 5<00:00:39.530> will<00:00:40.039> have<00:00:40.070> this<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:40.850> be<00:00:41.420> able

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
Lightroom 5 will have this and be able

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.170 
Lightroom 5 will have this and be able
to<00:00:41.680> use<00:00:42.680> these<00:00:42.860> effects<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:43.460> their<00:00:43.610> potential

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
to use these effects to their potential

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.959 
to use these effects to their potential
so<00:00:45.020> I'm<00:00:45.440> sorry<00:00:45.800> for<00:00:45.980> earlier<00:00:46.309> Lightroom

vertical the horizontal presets work

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.660 
vertical the horizontal presets work
pretty<00:01:24.530> well<00:01:24.740> on<00:01:25.010> JPEG<00:01:25.760> or<00:01:26.000> raw<00:01:27.070> versions<00:01:28.070> but

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
pretty well on JPEG or raw versions but

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.010 
pretty well on JPEG or raw versions but
the<00:01:28.820> vertical<00:01:28.970> one's<00:01:29.450> got<00:01:29.660> a<00:01:29.690> little<00:01:29.810> bit

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
the vertical one's got a little bit

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.450 
the vertical one's got a little bit
tricky<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.500> some<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.830> them<00:01:30.980> look<00:01:31.190> a<00:01:31.310> little

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
tricky and some of them look a little

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.480 
tricky and some of them look a little
stretched<00:01:31.970> on<00:01:32.270> certain<00:01:32.600> images<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:34.280> one

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
stretched on certain images so the one

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.760 
stretched on certain images so the one
called<00:01:34.730> speckled<00:01:35.210> flex<00:01:35.510> I<00:01:35.840> really<00:01:36.200> like<00:01:36.380> for

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
called speckled flex I really like for

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.570 
called speckled flex I really like for
the<00:01:37.250> raw<00:01:37.790> versions<00:01:38.360> like<00:01:38.480> a<00:01:38.540> larger<00:01:38.930> file<00:01:39.110> size

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
the raw versions like a larger file size

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.400 
the raw versions like a larger file size
and<00:01:40.580> then<00:01:40.760> if<00:01:40.910> I<00:01:41.030> have<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.240> jpg<00:01:41.690> image<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.320> I've

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
and then if I have a jpg image that I've

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.840 
and then if I have a jpg image that I've
already<00:01:42.740> edited<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.280> I<00:01:43.310> just<00:01:43.490> want<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.700> throw

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.860 
right over an eyeball or you know in
this<00:02:15.340> case<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.879> she's<00:02:16.180> got<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.330> little<00:02:16.450> mole

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
of snow or him chinny here so what we're

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.520 
of snow or him chinny here so what we're
gonna<00:02:20.680> do<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.069> we<00:02:21.280> are<00:02:21.310> going<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:22.319> get<00:02:23.319> rid<00:02:23.440> of

those so we're gonna hit the H key on

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.949 
those so we're gonna hit the H key on
our<00:02:26.890> keyboard<00:02:27.159> and<00:02:27.700> hopefully<00:02:28.629> this<00:02:28.780> does

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
our keyboard and hopefully this does

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.690 
our keyboard and hopefully this does
something<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.190> doesn't<00:02:30.370> look<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.489> it's

something and it doesn't look like it's
going<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.510> what<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.989> can<00:02:32.140> do<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.500> hit<00:02:32.980> this

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
edges soft or you can make them really

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.190 
edges soft or you can make them really
hard<00:05:06.410> so<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.800> snow<00:05:07.070> is<00:05:07.100> more<00:05:07.730> like<00:05:07.940> a<00:05:08.170> you<00:05:09.170> know

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
hard so the snow is more like a you know

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.250 
hard so the snow is more like a you know
hard<00:05:09.800> edged<00:05:10.040> circle<00:05:10.880> so<00:05:11.510> I'm<00:05:11.720> gonna<00:05:11.840> undo<00:05:12.050> that

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
hard edged circle so I'm gonna undo that

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.190 
hard edged circle so I'm gonna undo that
by<00:05:12.530> hitting<00:05:12.680> ctrl<00:05:13.160> Z<00:05:13.310> I<00:05:13.460> don't<00:05:13.640> like<00:05:13.730> that<00:05:13.880> one

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
by hitting ctrl Z I don't like that one

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.330 
by hitting ctrl Z I don't like that one
so<00:05:15.200> I'm<00:05:15.260> going<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.470> feather<00:05:15.650> mine<00:05:15.950> a<00:05:15.980> hundred

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
so I'm going to feather mine a hundred

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.740 
so I'm going to feather mine a hundred
percent<00:05:16.670> and<00:05:16.850> then<00:05:17.030> I'm<00:05:17.180> gonna<00:05:17.330> increase<00:05:17.630> the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
percent and then I'm gonna increase the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.860 
percent and then I'm gonna increase the
density<00:05:17.990> to<00:05:18.590> one<00:05:18.800> hundred<00:05:19.160> so<00:05:19.730> and<00:05:20.510> the<00:05:20.630> flow

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
density to one hundred so and the flow

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.670 
density to one hundred so and the flow
is<00:05:21.020> at<00:05:21.140> 100<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:21.770> all<00:05:21.830> that<00:05:21.980> stuff<00:05:22.250> so

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
is at 100 and all that stuff so

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.129 
is at 100 and all that stuff so
that<00:05:23.400> will<00:05:23.580> allow<00:05:23.910> me<00:05:24.090> to<00:05:24.210> paint<00:05:24.509> some<00:05:24.870> in<00:05:24.990> here

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
that will allow me to paint some in here

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.840 
that will allow me to paint some in here
so<00:05:25.289> I'm<00:05:25.350> just<00:05:25.500> stamping<00:05:25.979> like<00:05:26.220> with<00:05:26.370> one<00:05:26.550> click

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
so I'm just stamping like with one click

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.520 
so I'm just stamping like with one click
of<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.090> mouse<00:05:27.120> and<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.110> can<00:05:28.259> put<00:05:28.440> these

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
of the mouse and you can put these

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.249 
of the mouse and you can put these
wherever<00:05:28.770> you'd<00:05:29.130> like<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:29.699> then<00:05:30.389> to<00:05:30.960> make<00:05:31.110> it

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 
wherever you'd like and then to make it

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.170 
wherever you'd like and then to make it
look<00:05:31.410> believable<00:05:31.770> what<00:05:32.220> I'll<00:05:32.340> do<00:05:32.520> is<00:05:32.729> increase

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
look believable what I'll do is increase

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.969 
look believable what I'll do is increase
the<00:05:33.240> brush<00:05:33.539> size<00:05:33.600> in<00:05:34.080> certain<00:05:34.350> areas<00:05:34.710> and

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
the brush size in certain areas and

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.600 
the brush size in certain areas and
stamp<00:05:35.370> them<00:05:35.610> on<00:05:35.759> there<00:05:36.000> as<00:05:36.210> well<00:05:36.389> and<00:05:37.430> this<00:05:38.430> one

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
stamp them on there as well and this one

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.529 
stamp them on there as well and this one
is<00:05:38.729> snow<00:05:39.000> brush<00:05:39.270> which<00:05:39.570> is<00:05:39.600> not<00:05:40.020> quite<00:05:40.440> so<00:05:41.539> so

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
is snow brush which is not quite so so

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.450 
is snow brush which is not quite so so
bright<00:05:42.840> of<00:05:43.080> snow<00:05:43.320> it's<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.650> little<00:05:43.889> bit<00:05:44.009> faded

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
bright of snow it's a little bit faded

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.760 
bright of snow it's a little bit faded
so<00:05:44.820> it<00:05:44.910> looks<00:05:45.120> like<00:05:45.240> it's<00:05:45.600> more<00:05:46.470> realistic

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
so it looks like it's more realistic

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.469 
so it looks like it's more realistic
it's<00:05:47.130> a<00:05:47.160> little<00:05:47.340> bit<00:05:47.430> out<00:05:47.550> of<00:05:47.580> focus<00:05:47.820> a<00:05:48.270> little

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
it's a little bit out of focus a little

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.070 
it's a little bit out of focus a little
hazy<00:05:48.860> if<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.190> do<00:05:50.430> want<00:05:50.759> brighter<00:05:51.090> snow<00:05:51.479> you

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
hazy if you do want brighter snow you

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.790 
hazy if you do want brighter snow you
can<00:05:52.380> select<00:05:53.630> what<00:05:54.630> is<00:05:54.720> it<00:05:54.840> called<00:05:55.020> snowy<00:05:55.620> and

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
can select what is it called snowy and

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.230 
can select what is it called snowy and
bright<00:05:55.979> there<00:05:56.190> we<00:05:56.280> go<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.580> think<00:05:56.849> I<00:05:56.940> made<00:05:57.120> this

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
bright there we go I think I made this

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.450 
bright there we go I think I made this
maybe<00:05:57.570> so<00:05:58.229> I'm<00:05:58.470> if<00:05:58.590> you<00:05:58.680> hit<00:05:58.830> snowy<00:05:59.099> and<00:05:59.280> bright

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
maybe so I'm if you hit snowy and bright

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.610 
maybe so I'm if you hit snowy and bright
it'll<00:05:59.729> make<00:05:59.940> those<00:06:00.270> same<00:06:00.660> brushes<00:06:01.349> brighter

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
it'll make those same brushes brighter

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.740 
it'll make those same brushes brighter
if<00:06:02.580> you<00:06:02.639> didn't<00:06:03.000> want<00:06:03.150> them<00:06:03.270> bright<00:06:03.479> or<00:06:03.660> go

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
if you didn't want them bright or go

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.659 
if you didn't want them bright or go
back<00:06:03.900> to<00:06:04.050> snow<00:06:04.229> brush<00:06:04.410> and<00:06:04.770> then<00:06:05.250> you<00:06:05.370> can<00:06:05.520> hit

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
back to snow brush and then you can hit

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.379 
back to snow brush and then you can hit
new<00:06:05.970> and<00:06:06.900> then<00:06:07.800> you<00:06:07.979> can<00:06:08.190> select<00:06:08.430> snowy<00:06:09.180> and

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
new and then you can select snowy and

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.150 
new and then you can select snowy and
bright<00:06:09.570> and<00:06:09.780> then<00:06:10.229> you<00:06:10.349> can<00:06:10.500> paint<00:06:10.770> these<00:06:10.949> new

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
bright and then you can paint these new

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.740 
bright and then you can paint these new
brighter<00:06:11.490> ones<00:06:11.820> in<00:06:12.090> here<00:06:12.270> wherever<00:06:12.479> you'd

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
brighter ones in here wherever you'd

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.950 
brighter ones in here wherever you'd
like

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
like

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.100 
like
so<00:06:13.949> you<00:06:14.430> can<00:06:14.580> paint<00:06:14.849> them<00:06:15.060> all<00:06:15.479> over<00:06:15.780> the<00:06:15.870> place

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
so you can paint them all over the place

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.379 
so you can paint them all over the place
and<00:06:16.680> this<00:06:16.800> is<00:06:16.979> really<00:06:17.220> nice<00:06:17.370> too<00:06:17.699> so<00:06:18.000> that<00:06:18.150> if
