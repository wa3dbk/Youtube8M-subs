for an interview the first thing to

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.450 
for an interview the first thing to
remember<00:01:04.690> is<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.290> questions<00:01:06.190> should<00:01:06.430> be

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
remember is that questions should be

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.360 
remember is that questions should be
short<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:06.940> easy<00:01:07.480> to<00:01:07.720> understand<00:01:08.370> although

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
the answers to be long the idea is that

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.600 
the answers to be long the idea is that

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
with that in mind ask questions that

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.210 
with that in mind ask questions that
will<00:01:18.550> require<00:01:18.850> more<00:01:19.270> than<00:01:19.330> a<00:01:19.540> one-word<00:01:20.050> answer

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
