 but 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.520
 Here it is worth March 30 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.200

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.620
 great friend and great hookah 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.360
 master of peter so it will be 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.259
 the coolest event 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:10.860
 I was struck by the level of the south let's say then 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:15.119
 Russia hookah culture and since I even 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.110
 I do not know the first place well, and in addition to it 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.500
 there was an incredible amount of crazy 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.720
 ideas down to the hookah motorcycle was 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.670
 a hookah made of wood is also one 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.530
 from prizes by the way about prizes 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.759
 places this time the prize fund even more 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.619
 70 thousand rubles the main prize that is how 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.119
 it would be worth fighting for it seems to me 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.240
 30 manta 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.420
 restaurant white rabbit krasnodar 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.310
 I think that even if you don’t have 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.619
 some crazy idea though yet 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.420
 enough time to make your 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.490
 the coolest incredible knees but 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.439
 after all the battle of korea chikov is not easy 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.810
 show which presents all sorts 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.040
 unusual interesting hookahs which 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.350
 people made their own hands 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.290
 but this is primarily for me personally 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.310
 damn feast such a knee party 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.630
 for all lovers of hookah who 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.250
 who care who want 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.530
 have a good time chatting with 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.410
 same enthusiasts so even 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.299
 you have no idea or time or 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.160
 opportunities to do something incredible 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.959
 but you are confident in the family what are you doing 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.510
 you still have a very cool hookah 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.120
 time to submit an application on the party’s website 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.269
 white rabbit and just come and do 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.920
 cool hookah because how would 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.459
 it always happens naturally 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.860
 the most unusual bright hookahs are winning 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.560
 and work yes but to everyone and trust me 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.660
 it's always nice when even the taste is on 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.340
 such a simple chinese hookah like me 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.090
 now I do n't even smoke 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.400
 You can make a good hookah and if jiri 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.930
 Take a simple hookah here and there 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.610
 option either man nothing at all 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.040
 understands and not be afraid of something passed 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.280
 either he's doing it so cool that 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.140
 he is sure of himself and it seems to me that if you 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.849
 yourself sure come no matter what 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.390
 the main thing that everyone had a good 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.340
 mood everyone enjoyed me 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.230
 it seems the more such events 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.260
 pass through Russia so it's cooler because 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.290
 well, what am I sending to the party develops 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.840
 It is always helpful to share experiences and 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.349
 just have a good time in total 30 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.890

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.890
