00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.719 
I think week by week improving certainly
I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.479> more<00:01:42.780> time<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.229> training<00:01:43.439> field

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
I think more time on the training field

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.480 
I think more time on the training field
and<00:01:44.729> then<00:01:45.030> playing<00:01:45.329> more<00:01:45.810> time<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
and then playing more time on the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.260 
and then playing more time on the
University<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.700> weekends<00:01:48.090> real

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
University of on the weekends real

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.170 
University of on the weekends real
helped<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:49.079> my<00:01:49.110> game<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.149> just

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
helped with my game so you know I just

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.969 
helped with my game so you know I just
going<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> try<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.049> keep<00:01:52.200> building<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
going to try and keep building on that I

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130 
going to try and keep building on that I
guess<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:54.060> more<00:01:54.210> time<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> spend<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> field

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
guess the more time I spend on the field

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.690 
guess the more time I spend on the field
the<00:01:55.229> mall<00:01:55.409> improved<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.340> I'm<00:01:56.430> looking

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
help you concentrate on working out

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.130

exactly<00:02:12.180> what<00:02:12.390> goes<00:02:12.600> on<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:12.900> position

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
exactly what goes on in that position

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.660 
exactly what goes on in that position
rather<00:02:13.500> than<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.770> switch<00:02:14.010> between<00:02:14.220> there<00:02:14.550> in

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
rather than that switch between there in

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.550 
rather than that switch between there in
the<00:02:14.760> back<00:02:14.910> row<00:02:15.150> yeah<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> think<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.260> narrows

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
the back row yeah I think it narrows

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.980 
the back row yeah I think it narrows
down<00:02:16.590> my<00:02:16.920> focus<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> position<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.840> can

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
down my focus and in the position I can

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.010 
down my focus and in the position I can
saw<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.710> concentrate<00:02:20.310> on<00:02:20.400> playing<00:02:20.550> at<00:02:20.730> 12

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
saw the concentrate on playing at 12

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.870 
saw the concentrate on playing at 12
which<00:02:22.020> has<00:02:22.170> been<00:02:22.350> great<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.280> did<00:02:23.430> enjoy<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880

little<00:02:24.030> part<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.900> back<00:02:25.050> row<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:25.530> i<00:02:25.710> think

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
little part in the back row but i think

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.920 
little part in the back row but i think
that<00:02:26.460> 12<00:02:26.790> at<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.090> moment<00:02:27.450> suits<00:02:27.690> me<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.840> best

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
there in core commits it's a long way

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.580 
there in core commits it's a long way
over<00:02:41.940> Susan<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.420> from<00:02:42.630> tricking<00:02:43.350> them<00:02:43.410> in<00:02:43.530> the

over Susan it from tricking them in the
world<00:02:43.770> cup<00:02:44.070> but<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.520> it's<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.760> first

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
world cup but but it's the first

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.480 
world cup but but it's the first
starting<00:02:45.690> point<00:02:45.960> isn't<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.410> fulfilling<00:02:47.280> that

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
starting point isn't it fulfilling that

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.540 
starting point isn't it fulfilling that
dream<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.730> yours<00:02:47.880> oh<00:02:48.330> yeah<00:02:49.200> i<00:02:49.230> guess<00:02:49.560> like<00:02:49.590> it's

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
dream of yours oh yeah i guess like it's

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.730 
dream of yours oh yeah i guess like it's
a<00:02:50.580> long<00:02:50.700> way<00:02:50.880> until<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.240> world<00:02:51.450> cup<00:02:51.690> plenty<00:02:52.680> of

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
a long way until the world cup plenty of

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.740 
a long way until the world cup plenty of
games<00:02:52.920> before<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.550> saw<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.360> know<00:02:54.450> i'll<00:02:54.540> take

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
games before that saw you know i'll take

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.050 
games before that saw you know i'll take
it<00:02:54.900> step<00:02:55.110> by<00:02:55.140> step<00:02:55.260> i<00:02:55.650> guess<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.030> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
it step by step i guess this is the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.540 
it step by step i guess this is the
first<00:02:57.300> step<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.800> we'll<00:02:58.950> see<00:02:59.100> how<00:02:59.190> we<00:02:59.250> go<00:02:59.310> from

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
first step and we'll see how we go from

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.250 
first step and we'll see how we go from
there<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.000> i'm<00:03:00.570> certainly<00:03:00.870> going<00:03:00.960> to<00:03:01.050> enjoy
