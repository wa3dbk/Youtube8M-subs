00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.340
 Hello everyone and today we have such 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.560
 package wrapped here we have a competitor 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.279
 my cameras are still shooting gopro 3 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.260
 blockade of tires here we have well I think you 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.220
 already guessed the camera action from xiaomi 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.730
 she came pretty quickly 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.790
 according to my calculations for 11 days 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:40.460
 here the camera cost a little more than 100 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.540
 dollars just because she looks 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.540
 Chinese packed that only 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:53.699
 bag with your rollers 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:00.870
 how cost more than a hundred just because 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:03.859
 this travel camera with a wand up 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.859
 link or whatever it is called 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.060
 in general from a monopod so boxes as 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.630
 is always 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.970
 from xiaomi something like that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 apple ovsky box itself solid means 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.549
 so the camera we shoot in resolution 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.180
 maximum full hd that is 1920 on 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.950
 1080 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.170
 with a frame rate of 60 frames per second 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.890
 here is the camera we all somewhere in the area 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.380
 70 grams for her yet no 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.540
 accessories 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.880
 well, as I understand most of the actors for 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.090
 it fits the camera gopro 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.070
 the only thing I found out for her is not 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.649
 suitable case waterproof means 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:00.810
 distorted ordered green color here 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.079
 such a small camera all paper 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.259
 flew points all immediately remove them to us 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.259
 Not needed 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:17.640
 here we have a battery compartment 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.130
 here we have a compartment for sd usb card 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.470
 microusb to charge and micro wait for me and 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.300
 for broadcast right away it's something on 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.310
 TV for example the bottom we have 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.120
 screwdriver and camera finally 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.980
 tripod indicator is just an indicator 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.780
 is it an example of something photograph or something 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.600
 that he charged not charged what she 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.130
 works does not work here we are not 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.530
 nothing here we also have a button 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.959
 Wi-Fi indicator and on top too 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.970
 indicator that is by the way behind 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.620
 the indicator here is even more indicators 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:57.880
 than gopro gopro two or three times indicator 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.769
 total or not so much 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:07.650
 like too now so what does it mean still 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:11.230
 once the instructions go as always on 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.400
 Chinese camera I understand 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.640
 not officially shipped to Russia yet 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.799
 Because of this, everything in Chinese is necessary 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.750
 will be oral applications so charging 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.430
 the charging cable will need to be installed 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.570
 an application so that the camera can 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.239
 connect to the phone and I could 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.239
 see that he is still illuminated 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:47.290
 let's see included and maybe there is 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:51.579
 charge some kind of battery by the way i 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.470
 I will say thinner than gopro but at the same time 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:55.030
 he is wider i mean ugh right a little bit 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.400
 smaller but thicker 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.400
 in general, I think the same as he 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.709
 not written how many people on 1010 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.870
 milliampere 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.690
 spiders about how I remember for 850 years 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:19.380
 800 total 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:21.000
 so close let's turn on still here 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.920
 should here the indicator as you can see 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.510
 fired up I think he will not give us now 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.250
 take pictures because you need 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.950
 insert card card also came 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.660
 review on the card will be soon and 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.100
 I need to deal with the indication to me 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.480
 it seems maybe either this is what he is 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.090
 No card shows such 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:49.560
 purple and either what he 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:54.570
 cut so monopod monopod we have here 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:57.240
 so i would say long i have 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.230
 a pair of monopod ff1 from a tripod 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:05.100
 which are expensive but there are very bulky 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.740
 it turns out and something like the same 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.840
 become a monopod for me but I have not yet 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:17.130
 enjoyed because he don't know and 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:26.030
 somehow I really liked her 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:28.350
 need to heal 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.140
 so I understand that you can just 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.550
 hang up 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.030
 I do not know for anything on the pocket 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.040
 sky dangles lower yoke points 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.190
 unscrewed well in general like u 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:46.730
 standard monopods and so here we are 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.730
 we take the camera 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:56.930
 so we clamp no held here and 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.930
 we clamp 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:13.740
 more comfortable and squeezed everything 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:15.810
 who's so crooked here stuff on 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.280
 like rubberized can be this a 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.580
 this is probably tires here it is 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.680
 promoped monopod can be pushed on 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:28.350
 one link can be for several links 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:32.520
 push I think everything should go now 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:35.580
 street insert card and make 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:42.420

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:48.540
 from xiaomi it is called somehow and or 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:50.490
