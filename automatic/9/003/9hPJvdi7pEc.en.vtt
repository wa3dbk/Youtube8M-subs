five of the six depth charges I'm not
really<00:04:00.519> sure<00:04:00.819> where<00:04:01.060> the<00:04:01.150> sixth<00:04:01.510> one<00:04:01.690> is

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
really sure where the sixth one is

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.900 
really sure where the sixth one is
supposed<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.200> go<00:04:02.349> that's<00:04:02.709> actually<00:04:03.610> being<00:04:03.790> a

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
supposed to go that's actually being a

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.180 
supposed to go that's actually being a
platform<00:04:04.209> probably<00:04:04.900> for<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.200> for<00:04:06.129> the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
platform probably for the for the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.520 
platform probably for the for the
figures<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:07.140> similarly<00:04:08.610> plug<00:04:09.610> this<00:04:09.760> back<00:04:10.030> I

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
figures to similarly plug this back I

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.660 
figures to similarly plug this back I
suppose<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:11.650> could<00:04:11.769> go<00:04:11.890> right<00:04:12.069> behind<00:04:12.310> the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
suppose it could go right behind the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.250 
suppose it could go right behind the
ramp<00:04:12.849> that's<00:04:13.030> there<00:04:13.269> is<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.420> tiny<00:04:13.690> space<00:04:14.019> for

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
ramp that's there is a tiny space for

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.710 
ramp that's there is a tiny space for
that<00:04:14.410> they're<00:04:14.940> not<00:04:15.940> quite<00:04:16.180> sure<00:04:16.209> why<00:04:16.570> they

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
that they're not quite sure why they

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.640 
that they're not quite sure why they
bother<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.829> make<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.790> sixth<00:04:19.239> one<00:04:19.299> if<00:04:19.630> they<00:04:19.930> only

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
bother to make a sixth one if they only

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.170 
bother to make a sixth one if they only
have<00:04:20.979> one<00:04:21.280> four<00:04:21.489> five

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.810 

bukka<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.389> also<00:04:28.540> holds<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.820> reconnaissance

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
bukka it also holds the reconnaissance

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.500 
bukka it also holds the reconnaissance
bike<00:04:31.830> it's<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.889> rather<00:04:33.040> small<00:04:34.950> scooter<00:04:35.950> like

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
bike it's a rather small scooter like

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.409 
bike it's a rather small scooter like
bike<00:04:38.130> rolling<00:04:39.130> wheels<00:04:39.340> turning<00:04:40.210> four<00:04:42.419> it's

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
bike rolling wheels turning four it's

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.900 
bike rolling wheels turning four it's
this<00:04:43.750> is<00:04:43.930> actually<00:04:44.289> rather<00:04:44.580> wide<00:04:45.580> in<00:04:45.760> my

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
this is actually rather wide in my

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.350 
this is actually rather wide in my
opinion<00:04:46.389> so<00:04:47.340> putting<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.490> figure<00:04:48.760> on<00:04:48.970> it<00:04:49.120> it's

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
opinion so putting the figure on it it's

00:04:49.360 --> 00:05:05.629 
opinion so putting the figure on it it's
going<00:04:50.020> to<00:04:50.080> be<00:04:50.169> kind<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:51.270> an<00:04:52.270> awkward<00:04:52.449> deal

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.709 

yeah<00:05:06.300> well<00:05:06.870> he<00:05:07.020> doesn't<00:05:07.169> look<00:05:07.319> too<00:05:07.469> bad<00:05:07.500> there

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:08.719 
yeah well he doesn't look too bad there

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:11.839 
yeah well he doesn't look too bad there
it<00:05:09.719> still<00:05:09.930> looks<00:05:10.169> like<00:05:10.199> he's<00:05:10.500> in<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.460> circus

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
it still looks like he's in the circus

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.990 
it still looks like he's in the circus
but<00:05:12.169> yeah<00:05:13.189> it's<00:05:14.189> better<00:05:14.400> than<00:05:14.550> nothing<00:05:14.879> I

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
but yeah it's better than nothing I

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.140 
but yeah it's better than nothing I
suppose<00:05:19.159> another<00:05:20.159> one<00:05:20.490> that<00:05:20.580> I<00:05:20.639> can<00:05:20.819> activate

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
suppose another one that I can activate

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.890 
suppose another one that I can activate
features<00:05:21.810> is<00:05:22.379> of<00:05:22.680> course<00:05:22.889> I<00:05:23.129> don't<00:05:23.189> from<00:05:23.520> this

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
features is of course I don't from this

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.189 
features is of course I don't from this
cosmic<00:05:24.900> way<00:05:26.360> to<00:05:27.360> pull<00:05:27.569> this<00:05:27.659> back<00:05:27.719> a<00:05:27.930> little

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
cosmic way to pull this back a little

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.520 
cosmic way to pull this back a little
bit<00:05:28.409> maybe<00:05:29.039> because<00:05:29.490> this<00:05:29.810> shoots<00:05:30.810> out<00:05:31.020> rather

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
bit maybe because this shoots out rather

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.830 
bit maybe because this shoots out rather
quickly

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.760 

it<00:05:36.840> doesn't<00:05:37.289> shoot<00:05:37.500> out<00:05:39.409> relatively<00:05:40.409> smoothly

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
it doesn't shoot out relatively smoothly

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.080 
it doesn't shoot out relatively smoothly
at<00:05:41.099> least<00:05:41.250> mine<00:05:41.490> doesn't

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
at least mine doesn't

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:48.070 
at least mine doesn't

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
and there is enough room but the figure

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.279 
and there is enough room but the figure
and<00:06:09.810> decided<00:06:10.469> to<00:06:10.560> gather<00:06:10.710> in<00:06:11.039> here<00:06:11.400> but<00:06:12.289> that

unfortunately infamous these are really
really<00:06:38.400> very<00:06:38.520> fragile<00:06:39.150> which<00:06:39.539> is<00:06:39.659> kind<00:06:40.080> of

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
really very fragile which is kind of

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.600 
really very fragile which is kind of
unfortunate
