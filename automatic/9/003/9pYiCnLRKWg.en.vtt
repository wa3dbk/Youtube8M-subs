00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
one of the biggest challenge I named

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.130 
one of the biggest challenge I named
notebook<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.000> if<00:00:06.690> you<00:00:06.779> want<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.930> have<00:00:07.049> the

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
notebook is if you want to have the

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.509 
notebook is if you want to have the
perfect<00:00:07.350> touch<00:00:07.680> experience<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.309> want<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
perfect touch experience you want to

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.100 
perfect touch experience you want to
make<00:00:08.639> sure<00:00:08.670> your<00:00:08.910> screen<00:00:09.120> doesn't<00:00:09.450> wobble<00:00:09.599> but

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
make sure your screen doesn't wobble but

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.480 
make sure your screen doesn't wobble but
what<00:00:10.290> had<00:00:10.410> happened<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.889> most<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.340> time

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
what had happened is most of the time

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.400 
what had happened is most of the time
you<00:00:11.610> just<00:00:11.730> torque<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.330> system<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.230> is

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
you just torque the system so that is

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.470 
you just torque the system so that is
hard<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.769> open<00:00:14.190> if<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.670> very<00:00:14.790> firm<00:00:15.120> it

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
hard to open if it's very firm it

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.570 
hard to open if it's very firm it
doesn't<00:00:15.780> open<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.289> won't<00:00:16.500> wobble<00:00:16.680> but<00:00:17.190> here

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
doesn't open it won't wobble but here

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.210 
doesn't open it won't wobble but here
you<00:00:17.940> can<00:00:18.090> open<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.480> with<00:00:18.869> one<00:00:19.050> hand<00:00:19.160> at<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
you can open it with one hand at the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.759 
you can open it with one hand at the
same<00:00:20.430> time<00:00:20.699> it's<00:00:21.060> firm<00:00:21.359> enough<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.050> you

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
same time it's firm enough that you

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.650 
same time it's firm enough that you
don't<00:00:22.890> get<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.189> crazy<00:00:23.460> wall<00:00:23.730> bonus<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.390> care

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
don't get that crazy wall bonus we care

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.599 
don't get that crazy wall bonus we care
really<00:00:24.869> about<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.500> touch<00:00:25.680> experience<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
really about the touch experience at the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.370 
really about the touch experience at the
same<00:00:26.820> time<00:00:27.060> everyone<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.810> different<00:00:28.260> right

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
same time everyone is different right

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.259 
same time everyone is different right
sometimes<00:00:29.039> I'm<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> little<00:00:29.640> taller<00:00:29.820> sometimes

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
sometimes I'm a little taller sometimes

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.640 
sometimes I'm a little taller sometimes
a<00:00:30.330> little<00:00:30.480> shorter<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.019> depends<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.439> what<00:00:31.619> I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
a little shorter so depends on what I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.770 
a little shorter so depends on what I
want<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.189> want<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.669> maybe<00:00:32.880> doing<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.420> way<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
want I want is maybe doing this way and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.030 
want I want is maybe doing this way and
maybe<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.020> want<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.260> do<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.649> way

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
maybe I want to do it this way

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670 
maybe I want to do it this way
so<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> sudden<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.170> long

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
so now I can all of a sudden have a long

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.200 
so now I can all of a sudden have a long
term<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.399> eight<00:00:38.610> hours<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.059> touch

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
term like eight hours of touch

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.569 
term like eight hours of touch
experience<00:00:39.450> by<00:00:39.870> one<00:00:40.079> no<00:00:40.559> longer<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.250> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
experience by one no longer do I have to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.790 
experience by one no longer do I have to
reach<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:42.000> there<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.110> touch<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
reach out there but to touch for that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.490 
reach out there but to touch for that
thirty<00:00:44.280> Seconds<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.600> minute<00:00:45.930> but

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
thirty Seconds to the one minute but

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.930 
thirty Seconds to the one minute but
wait<00:00:46.739> I'm<00:00:46.980> sure<00:00:47.250> some<00:00:47.489> time<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.700> want<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
wait I'm sure some time you want to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.130 
wait I'm sure some time you want to
share<00:00:48.059> something<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.539> your<00:00:48.600> friends<00:00:48.780> now

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
share something with your friends now

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.330 
share something with your friends now
all<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> sudden<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:51.000> sharing<00:00:51.719> mode

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
all of a sudden you have a sharing mode

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.950 
all of a sudden you have a sharing mode
but<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> challenge<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.780> you're

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
but the challenge of this is if you're

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.810 
but the challenge of this is if you're
watching<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.469> videos<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.610> less

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
watching the videos on this the less

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
watching the videos on this the less
speaker<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.300> right<00:00:57.420> speaker<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
speaker and right speaker all of a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.229 
speaker and right speaker all of a
sudden<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> reversed<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> make

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
sudden is reversed so we want to make

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.240 
sudden is reversed so we want to make
sure<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.020> sound<00:01:01.289> experience<00:01:02.070> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
sure that the sound experience is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
sure that the sound experience is
perfect<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.210> want<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:03.750> you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
perfect in that when you want when you

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
perfect in that when you want when you
see<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> plane<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.589> by<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.489> video<00:01:05.760> from

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
see a plane go by and the video from

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.030 
see a plane go by and the video from
left<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.840> sound<00:01:07.170> also<00:01:07.470> matches

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
left to right the sound also matches

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.950 
left to right the sound also matches
that<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.400> there's<00:01:08.580> no<00:01:08.700> confusion<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that so there's no confusion so that the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.190 
that so there's no confusion so that the
the<00:01:10.770> total<00:01:11.220> experience<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.880> 400%<00:01:12.689> immersive

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the total experience is 400% immersive

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.820 
the total experience is 400% immersive
and<00:01:13.409> also<00:01:13.799> hunch<00:01:14.159> person<00:01:14.520> accurate<00:01:15.320> now<00:01:16.320> for

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and also hunch person accurate now for

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.170 
and also hunch person accurate now for
this<00:01:16.950> system<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.400> actually<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.939> four

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
this system we actually have four

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.929 
this system we actually have four
speakers<00:01:18.509> two<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.409> each<00:01:19.590> side<00:01:19.619> total<00:01:20.580> eight

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
speakers two on each side total eight

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.590 
speakers two on each side total eight
watts<00:01:21.210> per<00:01:21.810> per<00:01:22.320> system<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.210> we<00:01:24.210> want<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.479> make

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
watts per per system and we want to make

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120 
watts per per system and we want to make
sure<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> sound<00:01:25.259> profile<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> also

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
sure that a sound profile is also

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.620 
sure that a sound profile is also
leveled<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.150> actually<00:01:27.299> have

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
leveled so that we actually have

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.929 
leveled so that we actually have
additional<00:01:28.110> spots<00:01:28.439> built<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> side<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
additional spots built in on the side to

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.670 
additional spots built in on the side to
allow<00:01:30.060> certain<00:01:30.659> frequency<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.290> sound<00:01:31.470> to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
allow certain frequency of sound to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.620 
allow certain frequency of sound to
travel<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> sound<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.060> not<00:01:33.180> teeny

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
travel so that so the sound is not teeny

warder or email this is something that's
unique<00:03:17.900> for<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:18.500> we<00:03:18.770> develop<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:19.280> program

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
unique for a so we develop that program

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.460 
unique for a so we develop that program
just<00:03:19.910> for<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.540> system<00:03:20.900> at<00:03:21.050> this<00:03:21.170> point<00:03:21.380> in

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
just for the system at this point in

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.800 
just for the system at this point in
time<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.190> actually<00:03:22.400> used<00:03:22.850> as<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.180> lava<00:03:23.390> kisses

time and actually used as a lava kisses

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.900 
time and actually used as a lava kisses
it's<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:24.680> much<00:03:24.860> more<00:03:25.100> convenient<00:03:25.490> compared
