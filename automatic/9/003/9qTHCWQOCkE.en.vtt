two<00:02:05.460> cases<00:02:05.909> then<00:02:06.060> thinking<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.479> what

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
two cases then thinking about what

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.710 
two cases then thinking about what
people<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.170> were<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.409> comas<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:09.509> hear

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
people that were in comas and you hear

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.900 
people that were in comas and you hear
that<00:02:09.840> people<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.229> comas<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.649> still<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.640> some

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
that people in comas can still have some

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.680 
that people in comas can still have some
of<00:02:12.000> their<00:02:12.150> senses<00:02:13.730> alert<00:02:14.730> even<00:02:15.420> though<00:02:15.540> they

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
of their senses alert even though they

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.780 
of their senses alert even though they
might<00:02:15.870> not<00:02:16.019> be<00:02:16.200> able<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.530> respond<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.430> so

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
might not be able to respond and so

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.990 
might not be able to respond and so
aroma<00:02:18.299> is<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> very<00:02:18.840> powerful<00:02:19.260> tool<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.250> mean

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
aroma is a very powerful tool I mean

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.550 
aroma is a very powerful tool I mean
there's<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.390> couple<00:02:21.599> essential<00:02:22.170> oils<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.500> I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
there's a couple essential oils that I

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.789 
there's a couple essential oils that I
use<00:02:22.739> one<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.220> rosemary<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.560> other<00:02:25.680> is

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
use one is rosemary and the other is

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.180 
use one is rosemary and the other is
calamus<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.900> what<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.019> could<00:02:28.260> do<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.620> put<00:02:28.680> an

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
calamus and what you could do is put an

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.430 
calamus and what you could do is put an
aromatherapy<00:02:30.060> diffuser<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.750> their<00:02:30.900> room<00:02:31.110> in

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
aromatherapy diffuser in their room in

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.890 
aromatherapy diffuser in their room in
one<00:02:31.950> case<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.430> put<00:02:32.610> calamus<00:02:33.180> essential<00:02:33.690> oil

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
one case you put calamus essential oil

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.770 
one case you put calamus essential oil
on<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.530> young<00:02:34.830> man's<00:02:35.069> mustache<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.599> came

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
on a young man's mustache and it came

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.900 
on a young man's mustache and it came
out<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.170> coma<00:02:37.410> very<00:02:37.860> quickly<00:02:38.250> actually

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
out of a coma very quickly actually

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.050 
out of a coma very quickly actually
within<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.660> few<00:02:39.840> hours<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.620> doing<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.879> we

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
within a few hours of doing that so we

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.000 
within a few hours of doing that so we
know<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:42.239> our<00:02:42.480> nasal<00:02:42.959> cavities<00:02:43.530> are<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.769> very

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
know that our nasal cavities are in very

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.460 
know that our nasal cavities are in very
close<00:02:44.099> proximity<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:45.180> our<00:02:45.420> brain<00:02:45.720> so<00:02:46.319> if<00:02:46.379> we

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
close proximity to our brain so if we

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.979 
close proximity to our brain so if we
could<00:02:46.620> sell<00:02:46.950> something<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:48.120> really<00:02:48.660> could

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
could sell something it really could

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.500 
could sell something it really could
open<00:02:49.319> up<00:02:49.410> neural<00:02:49.769> pathways<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.000> we<00:02:51.239> could

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
open up neural pathways so that we could

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.110 
open up neural pathways so that we could
have<00:02:51.720> better<00:02:51.989> better<00:02:52.650> mental<00:02:53.040> alertness<00:02:53.160> I'm

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
have better better mental alertness I'm

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.759 
have better better mental alertness I'm

the<00:03:15.569> body<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.079> our<00:03:16.200> brain<00:03:16.470> loves<00:03:16.859> oxygen

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
the body and our brain loves oxygen

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.970

I think raw nuts and seeds are also a
great<00:03:20.370> food<00:03:21.019> almonds<00:03:22.019> pine<00:03:22.290> nuts<00:03:22.620> or

corresponds<00:05:01.980> to<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.220> brain<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:02.880> you<00:05:03.300> really

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
corresponds to the brain so you really

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.570 
corresponds to the brain so you really
want<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.930> make<00:05:04.050> sure<00:05:04.080> that<00:05:04.590> we<00:05:05.100> work<00:05:05.310> on<00:05:05.460> the

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580

the<00:05:07.919> big<00:05:08.100> toe<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.610> color<00:05:09.570> can<00:05:09.870> also<00:05:10.020> be<00:05:10.290> a<00:05:10.320> tool

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
the big toe and color can also be a tool

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
the big toe and color can also be a tool
so<00:05:11.280> often<00:05:11.700> when<00:05:11.880> people<00:05:12.030> are<00:05:12.620> incapacitated

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
so often when people are incapacitated

white gown and white sheets and white
room<00:05:19.440> so<00:05:20.130> I<00:05:20.190> think<00:05:20.280> of<00:05:20.580> red<00:05:20.910> we<00:05:21.720> want<00:05:21.990> to

increase their life force and their
vitality<00:05:26.550> I<00:05:27.090> think<00:05:27.600> of<00:05:27.780> blue<00:05:28.140> when<00:05:28.470> we<00:05:28.560> want<00:05:28.770> a

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
vitality I think of blue when we want a

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.330 
vitality I think of blue when we want a
cool<00:05:29.250> inflammation<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.390> calm<00:05:30.660> pain<00:05:31.080> I<00:05:31.500> think

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
cool inflammation and calm pain I think

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.130 
cool inflammation and calm pain I think
of<00:05:32.490> green<00:05:32.760> when<00:05:33.150> we<00:05:33.270> don't<00:05:33.450> know<00:05:33.600> what<00:05:33.810> to<00:05:33.990> do

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
of green when we don't know what to do

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.680 
of green when we don't know what to do
green<00:05:34.440> is<00:05:34.680> always<00:05:35.130> appropriate<00:05:35.490> but<00:05:36.300> colors

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
green is always appropriate but colors

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.159 
green is always appropriate but colors
another<00:05:37.080> tool<00:05:37.410> and<00:05:37.919> even<00:05:38.340> though<00:05:38.490> we<00:05:38.729> might

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
another tool and even though we might

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.200 
another tool and even though we might
think<00:05:40.169> we<00:05:40.320> don't<00:05:40.440> see<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.979> color<00:05:41.250> color<00:05:41.970> has

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210

this<00:06:05.550> young<00:06:06.150> woman<00:06:06.539> in<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.720> coma<00:06:06.990> and<00:06:07.490> they

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
this young woman in the coma and they

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.000 
this young woman in the coma and they
put<00:06:08.789> some<00:06:08.940> crystals<00:06:09.570> on<00:06:09.750> her<00:06:09.960> chakras<00:06:10.650> and

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
put some crystals on her chakras and

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.520 
put some crystals on her chakras and
they<00:06:11.520> made<00:06:11.760> a<00:06:11.789> circle<00:06:12.270> around<00:06:12.660> her<00:06:13.020> by

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
they made a circle around her by

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.589 
they made a circle around her by
crystals<00:06:13.950> I<00:06:14.039> mean<00:06:14.220> like<00:06:14.640> quartz<00:06:15.060> crystals

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
crystals I mean like quartz crystals

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:17.330 
crystals I mean like quartz crystals
they<00:06:15.690> made<00:06:15.870> a<00:06:15.900> circle<00:06:16.260> around<00:06:16.530> her<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:17.280> they

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
they made a circle around her and they

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.070 
they made a circle around her and they
were<00:06:17.400> all<00:06:17.669> holding<00:06:18.000> hands<00:06:18.419> and<00:06:18.690> they<00:06:18.780> were<00:06:18.840> all

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
were all holding hands and they were all

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.010 
were all holding hands and they were all
touching<00:06:19.470> her<00:06:19.919> and<00:06:20.190> they<00:06:20.640> started<00:06:21.150> oming<00:06:21.630> it

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
touching her and they started oming it

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.040 
touching her and they started oming it
should<00:06:22.380> came<00:06:22.710> out<00:06:23.130> of<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.669> coma<00:06:24.000> during<00:06:24.900> the

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
should came out of the coma during the

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.100 
should came out of the coma during the
third<00:06:25.380> own<00:06:25.740> so<00:06:26.729> to<00:06:26.789> me<00:06:27.240> these<00:06:27.720> are<00:06:27.780> just

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
third own so to me these are just

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.110 
third own so to me these are just
something<00:06:28.500> some<00:06:28.919> you<00:06:29.190> know<00:06:29.310> young<00:06:29.640> people<00:06:30.000> in

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
something some you know young people in

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.120 
something some you know young people in
Boulder<00:06:30.479> made<00:06:30.690> up<00:06:30.870> but<00:06:31.349> they<00:06:31.470> said<00:06:31.740> let's<00:06:31.950> you

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
Boulder made up but they said let's you

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.700 
Boulder made up but they said let's you
sound<00:06:32.580> let's<00:06:33.300> use<00:06:33.539> the<00:06:34.020> energy<00:06:34.470> of<00:06:34.620> the

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
sound let's use the energy of the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.570 
sound let's use the energy of the
crystals<00:06:35.190> let's<00:06:35.460> use<00:06:35.640> touch<00:06:36.030> and<00:06:36.530> and<00:06:37.580> if

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
crystals let's use touch and and if

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.430 
crystals let's use touch and and if
something<00:06:39.060> happened<00:06:39.450> was<00:06:39.570> it<00:06:39.720> a<00:06:39.780> miracle<00:06:40.050> well

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
something happened was it a miracle well

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.630 
something happened was it a miracle well
I<00:06:40.500> think<00:06:40.560> they<00:06:40.860> turned<00:06:41.130> into<00:06:41.370> something

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
I think they turned into something

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.580 
I think they turned into something
really<00:06:42.090> good<00:06:42.270> and<00:06:42.450> sometimes<00:06:42.840> we<00:06:43.409> have<00:06:43.440> to

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
really good and sometimes we have to

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.529 
really good and sometimes we have to
make<00:06:43.919> up<00:06:44.130> what<00:06:44.340> our<00:06:44.460> protocol<00:06:45.000> might<00:06:45.210> be<00:06:45.390> it

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
make up what our protocol might be it

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.240 
make up what our protocol might be it
might<00:06:45.750> not<00:06:45.930> be<00:06:46.080> something<00:06:46.380> that's<00:06:46.710> in<00:06:47.130> the

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
might not be something that's in the

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.990 
might not be something that's in the
medical<00:06:47.669> text<00:06:48.060> it<00:06:48.840> might<00:06:49.110> be<00:06:49.260> something<00:06:49.530> that

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
medical text it might be something that

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.580 
medical text it might be something that
we<00:06:51.000> have<00:06:51.210> a<00:06:51.240> dream<00:06:51.599> or<00:06:51.930> the<00:06:51.960> answer<00:06:52.380> to<00:06:52.560> our

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
we have a dream or the answer to our

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.180 
we have a dream or the answer to our
prayer<00:06:52.979> so<00:06:53.669> just<00:06:54.240> know<00:06:54.930> that<00:06:55.229> the<00:06:55.830> body's

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
prayer so just know that the body's

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.219 
prayer so just know that the body's
desires<00:06:56.640> to<00:06:57.000> be<00:06:57.120> well<00:06:57.360> and<00:06:57.690> there<00:06:57.870> are<00:06:58.020> things

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
desires to be well and there are things

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:03.529 
desires to be well and there are things
we<00:06:58.440> can<00:06:58.620> do<00:07:01.430> so<00:07:02.430> hopefully<00:07:02.669> you'll<00:07:03.180> be<00:07:03.240> able<00:07:03.330> to

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
we can do so hopefully you'll be able to

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:05.510 
we can do so hopefully you'll be able to
use<00:07:03.690> some<00:07:03.930> of<00:07:03.960> these<00:07:04.140> ideas<00:07:04.530> and<00:07:04.620> check<00:07:05.280> out<00:07:05.400> my

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
use some of these ideas and check out my

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.900 
use some of these ideas and check out my
book<00:07:05.669> awesome<00:07:06.120> -<00:07:06.300> thanks
