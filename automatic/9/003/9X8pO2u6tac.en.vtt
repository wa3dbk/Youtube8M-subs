called Alderman and it is suggested that
there<00:03:18.270> was<00:03:18.450> some<00:03:18.720> total<00:03:19.170> there<00:03:19.410> as<00:03:19.770> a<00:03:19.830> part<00:03:20.280> of

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
there was some total there as a part of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.000 
there was some total there as a part of
like<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.610> defense<00:03:21.030> arsenal<00:03:21.780> for<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.140> city<00:03:22.410> but

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
like a defense arsenal for the city but

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.890 
like a defense arsenal for the city but
at<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.250> point<00:03:23.520> there<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:24.060> no<00:03:24.300> trace<00:03:24.630> of

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
at this point there is like no trace of

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.470 
at this point there is like no trace of
them<00:03:25.350> ever<00:03:25.620> being<00:03:25.770> there<00:03:26.340> even<00:03:26.610> though<00:03:27.120> it

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
them ever being there even though it

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.300 
them ever being there even though it
would<00:03:27.720> logically<00:03:28.200> make<00:03:28.380> sense<00:03:28.410> for<00:03:29.040> them<00:03:29.280> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
would logically make sense for them to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.290 
would logically make sense for them to
be<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.209> city<00:03:31.160> so<00:03:32.160> really<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.670> only<00:03:32.700> place

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300

were<00:05:15.789> some<00:05:16.029> taller<00:05:16.569> they<00:05:16.900> didn't<00:05:17.169> really

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
were some taller they didn't really

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.329 
were some taller they didn't really
wanna<00:05:17.589> do<00:05:17.919> it

00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:18.339 
wanna do it

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:19.589 
wanna do it
for<00:05:18.490> example<00:05:18.939> the<00:05:19.029> total<00:05:19.210> weight<00:05:19.419> of<00:05:19.479> the

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
for example the total weight of the

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.959 
for example the total weight of the
Aussie<00:05:20.110> City<00:05:20.379> and<00:05:20.650> they<00:05:21.069> refused<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.819> offer

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:21.969 
Aussie City and they refused the offer

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.480 
Aussie City and they refused the offer
and<00:05:22.539> for<00:05:22.810> it<00:05:22.990> that<00:05:23.139> entire<00:05:23.500> city<00:05:23.860> was<00:05:24.039> buried

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
and for it that entire city was buried

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.360 
and for it that entire city was buried
in<00:05:24.729> a<00:05:24.819> sandstorm<00:05:25.419> cast<00:05:25.870> by<00:05:26.110> al'akir<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:27.009> not

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
in a sandstorm cast by al'akir and not

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.920 
in a sandstorm cast by al'akir and not
really<00:05:27.729> that<00:05:27.879> many<00:05:28.060> of<00:05:28.360> them<00:05:28.569> actually

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
really that many of them actually

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.140 
really that many of them actually
survived<00:05:29.349> another<00:05:30.039> faction<00:05:30.460> called<00:05:30.909> the<00:05:31.000> damn

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
survived another faction called the damn

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.570 
survived another faction called the damn
cocky<00:05:31.449> and<00:05:31.629> saw<00:05:31.930> this<00:05:32.139> and<00:05:32.529> they<00:05:32.830> also<00:05:32.979> refused

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
cocky and saw this and they also refused

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.459 
cocky and saw this and they also refused
but<00:05:33.969> before<00:05:34.330> they<00:05:34.509> did<00:05:34.689> it<00:05:34.839> they<00:05:35.020> took<00:05:35.229> all<00:05:35.439> the

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
but before they did it they took all the

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.379 
but before they did it they took all the
necessary<00:05:35.800> steps<00:05:36.430> in<00:05:36.580> order<00:05:36.699> to<00:05:36.849> ensure<00:05:37.210> their

on their body and they were just
generally<00:06:19.599> more<00:06:19.779> powerful<00:06:20.349> but<00:06:20.710> now<00:06:20.889> with<00:06:21.099> the

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:21.219 
generally more powerful but now with the

generally more powerful but now with the
curse<00:06:21.399> of<00:06:21.669> flesh<00:06:21.789> it<00:06:22.149> is<00:06:22.210> a<00:06:22.389> bit<00:06:22.689> different<00:06:22.930> but

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
curse of flesh it is a bit different but

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.230 
curse of flesh it is a bit different but
they<00:06:23.409> still<00:06:23.710> do<00:06:24.039> really<00:06:24.339> resembled<00:06:24.939> it<00:06:25.060> all

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
they still do really resembled it all

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.839 
they still do really resembled it all
for<00:06:25.599> due<00:06:26.379> to<00:06:26.529> them<00:06:26.680> looking<00:06:27.009> a<00:06:27.159> lot<00:06:27.339> like<00:06:27.399> cats

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:27.849 
for due to them looking a lot like cats

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:29.909 
for due to them looking a lot like cats
some<00:06:28.389> suggest<00:06:28.839> that<00:06:29.020> the<00:06:29.139> Tigers<00:06:29.710> the<00:06:29.889> Lions

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
species that look like that are somehow

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.269 
species that look like that are somehow
related<00:06:34.389> to<00:06:34.629> the<00:06:34.959> tall<00:06:35.199> villa<00:06:35.469> or<00:06:35.680> there<00:06:36.190> are

related to the tall villa or there are

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.830 
related to the tall villa or there are
possibly<00:06:36.759> a<00:06:36.849> more<00:06:37.089> de<00:06:37.509> vault<00:06:37.990> version

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
possibly a more de vault version

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.840 
possibly a more de vault version
of<00:06:38.930> the<00:06:39.139> tol'vir<00:06:39.470> although<00:06:40.070> none<00:06:40.610> of<00:06:40.730> this

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
of the tol'vir although none of this

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.060 
of the tol'vir although none of this
easily<00:06:41.240> confirmed<00:06:41.780> the<00:06:42.110> total<00:06:42.500> society<00:06:43.010> is

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
easily confirmed the total society is

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.680 
easily confirmed the total society is
mainly<00:06:43.340> a<00:06:43.490> monarchy<00:06:44.060> meaning<00:06:44.360> that<00:06:44.480> they're

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
mainly a monarchy meaning that they're

really lie with their creator as the
