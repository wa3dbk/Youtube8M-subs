00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.960
 in the first case the md protein 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.500
 e recognizes and binds carbohydrates from the cell surfaces of 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.500
 microorganisms 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.010
 associated calls more fist and more 2 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.810
 they are activated analogously a little bit ago in 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.810
 classic way 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.390
 acts as cqs kigen lc4 aa 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.960
 be 4 b 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.260
 be used 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.410
 c4 of is the large portion and the membrane is fixed 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.500
 0 sada according to and 4 b 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.250
 this diffuses towards the plasma 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.250
 the way goes on like on the road 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.520
 The complex formed by 13 4 b Jerusalem is known as convertase 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.550
 of f3 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.550
 substrate this e3 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.360
 that is a toxin maquila 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.420
 diffuses towards the plasma 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.480
 c 3 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.720
 p will join the membrane forming the complex c4 that there are two without three 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.130
 the cd4 complex that 2 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.870
 e acts on c5 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 five years ago I made five of 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.350
 and then 6 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.050
 and is will join with c5n 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.790
 this generates the expression of hydrophobic domains 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.189
 that allow you to enter the typical alÃ­ habitat 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.800
 to this complex too 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.090
 Out of 8 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.110
 and not by or in 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.110
 in Canada 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.319
 t several tenth of a second molecules in this complex generating a pore 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.279
 even greater 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.279
 finally regretted 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.179
 is that for something 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.369
 proteins 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.789
 cell electrolytes 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.759
 this mode the cell dies by
