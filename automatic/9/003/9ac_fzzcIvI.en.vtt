only about two pound they're relatively
inexpensive<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.860> what<00:02:13.489> I<00:02:13.519> love<00:02:13.790> about<00:02:13.819> this

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
inexpensive and what I love about this

this little slider to whatever
measurement<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.010> want<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.819> it's<00:02:23.000> great<00:02:23.239> when

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
measurement I want so it's great when

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.539 
measurement I want so it's great when
you<00:02:23.510> start<00:02:23.810> sewing<00:02:24.079> and<00:02:24.409> you're<00:02:24.680> looking<00:02:25.129> to

you start sewing and you're looking to

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.809 
you start sewing and you're looking to
learn<00:02:26.510> how<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.870> pin<00:02:27.230> 1.5<00:02:27.859> from<00:02:28.129> the<00:02:28.250> edge<00:02:28.400> or

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
learn how to pin 1.5 from the edge or

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.610 
learn how to pin 1.5 from the edge or
when<00:02:29.060> you're<00:02:29.239> pressing<00:02:29.569> hems<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.379> want<00:02:30.530> a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
when you're pressing hems and you want a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.979 
when you're pressing hems and you want a
fixed<00:02:30.980> point<00:02:31.189> and<00:02:31.549> you<00:02:32.150> just<00:02:32.390> measure<00:02:32.599> from

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
fixed point and you just measure from

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.039 
fixed point and you just measure from
that<00:02:33.049> point<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:34.069> red<00:02:34.430> really<00:02:35.359> good<00:02:35.870> little

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
that point to the red really good little

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.780 
that point to the red really good little
tool<00:02:36.409> when<00:02:36.799> you<00:02:36.950> start<00:02:37.189> turning<00:02:37.370> through

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
tool when you start turning through

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.640 
tool when you start turning through
corners<00:02:38.390> of<00:02:38.569> lapels<00:02:39.019> you've<00:02:39.319> got<00:02:39.409> a<00:02:39.439> little

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
corners of lapels you've got a little

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.309 
corners of lapels you've got a little
point<00:02:39.920> turner<00:02:40.189> it's<00:02:41.000> also<00:02:41.209> great<00:02:41.599> for<00:02:41.659> marking

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
point turner it's also great for marking

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.949 
point turner it's also great for marking
up<00:02:42.470> buttonholes<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.549> called<00:02:43.849> a<00:02:44.150> seam

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
up buttonholes this is called a seam

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.460 
up buttonholes this is called a seam
gauge<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:46.190> will<00:02:46.459> need<00:02:46.810> some<00:02:47.810> tape<00:02:48.049> measures

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
gauge you will need some tape measures

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.770 
gauge you will need some tape measures
now<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.549> have<00:02:49.879> two<00:02:50.209> different<00:02:50.389> types

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
now I like to have two different types

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.460 
now I like to have two different types
of<00:02:51.079> tape<00:02:51.290> measures<00:02:51.709> one<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.730> buy<00:02:53.239> with<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.870> fixed

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
of tape measures one I buy with a fixed

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.190 
of tape measures one I buy with a fixed
end<00:02:54.680> on<00:02:55.129> the<00:02:55.370> end<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.639> it<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:56.200> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
end on the end of it like this the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.890 
end on the end of it like this the
advantage<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.769> this<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.310> if<00:02:59.150> I<00:02:59.389> need<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.689> take

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
advantage of this is if I need to take

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.929 
advantage of this is if I need to take
someone's<00:03:00.170> inside<00:03:00.739> leg<00:03:01.040> instead<00:03:01.519> of<00:03:01.670> putting

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
someone's inside leg instead of putting

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.710 
someone's inside leg instead of putting
my<00:03:02.090> fingers<00:03:02.750> into<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.889> coin<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.609> can<00:03:05.299> slide

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
my fingers into that coin I can slide

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.839 
my fingers into that coin I can slide
this<00:03:06.019> little<00:03:06.230> stiff<00:03:06.620> end<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:07.189> that<00:03:07.400> helped<00:03:07.760> me

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
this little stiff end and that helped me

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.910 
this little stiff end and that helped me
with<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.269> inside<00:03:08.689> leg<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.200> it's<00:03:09.739> good<00:03:09.889> for

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
with the inside leg and it's good for

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.259 
with the inside leg and it's good for
places<00:03:10.489> where<00:03:10.639> you<00:03:10.760> want<00:03:10.879> to<00:03:11.090> measure

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
places where you want to measure

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.789 
places where you want to measure
something<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:11.989> don't<00:03:12.170> want<00:03:12.439> the<00:03:12.560> tape

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
something and you don't want the tape

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.250 
something and you don't want the tape
measure<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.280> it<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.579> Rumple<00:03:13.970> up<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.389> a<00:03:14.569> fixed

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
measure to it to Rumple up so a fixed

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.589 
measure to it to Rumple up so a fixed
end<00:03:15.440> tape<00:03:15.709> measure<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.639> good<00:03:17.060> addition<00:03:17.389> to

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
end tape measure is a good addition to

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.409 
end tape measure is a good addition to
your<00:03:17.750> kit<00:03:18.079> however<00:03:18.829> if<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:19.699> wanted<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.030> use<00:03:20.299> this

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
your kit however if I wanted to use this

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.199 
your kit however if I wanted to use this
to<00:03:20.480> take<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.810> circumference<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.980> fixed<00:03:22.340> end<00:03:22.459> is

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
to take a circumference the fixed end is

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.050 
to take a circumference the fixed end is
actually<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:23.959> disadvantage<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.129> I<00:03:25.579> have

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
actually a disadvantage so I have

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.089 
actually a disadvantage so I have
another<00:03:26.449> type<00:03:26.750> of<00:03:26.780> tape<00:03:27.139> measure<00:03:27.379> in<00:03:27.680> my<00:03:27.829> kit

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
another type of tape measure in my kit

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.659 
another type of tape measure in my kit
and<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:29.000> has<00:03:29.209> got<00:03:29.359> a<00:03:29.419> soft<00:03:29.780> end<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:31.280> again

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
and this has got a soft end and again

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.610 
and this has got a soft end and again
you<00:03:31.879> can<00:03:32.060> see<00:03:32.269> where<00:03:32.419> the<00:03:32.510> tape<00:03:32.750> measures<00:03:33.169> it's

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
you can see where the tape measures it's

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.129 
you can see where the tape measures it's
a<00:03:33.680> good<00:03:33.919> idea<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.250> get<00:03:34.579> them<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.849> inches<00:03:35.389> and<00:03:35.720> in

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
a good idea to get them in inches and in

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.740 
a good idea to get them in inches and in
centimeters<00:03:36.859> because<00:03:37.459> if<00:03:38.090> you're<00:03:38.389> working

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
centimeters because if you're working

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.059 
centimeters because if you're working
with<00:03:38.870> patterns<00:03:39.319> it<00:03:39.500> will<00:03:39.530> always<00:03:39.680> be<00:03:39.979> in

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
with patterns it will always be in

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.159 
with patterns it will always be in
inches<00:03:40.519> but<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.819> may<00:03:41.090> have<00:03:41.269> learnt<00:03:41.780> use

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
inches but you may have learnt use

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.439 
inches but you may have learnt use
centimeters<00:03:42.859> because<00:03:43.099> we're<00:03:43.849> in<00:03:43.970> Europe<00:03:44.150> not

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
centimeters because we're in Europe not

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.020 
centimeters because we're in Europe not
America<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:45.739> you<00:03:45.799> need<00:03:46.010> two<00:03:46.340> different<00:03:46.849> types

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
America so you need two different types

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.719 
America so you need two different types
of<00:03:47.209> tape<00:03:47.449> measures<00:03:47.870> not<00:03:48.440> expensive<00:03:48.859> about<00:03:49.549> 1

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:49.729 
of tape measures not expensive about 1

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:54.949 
another measuring age that I like to

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.689 
another measuring age that I like to
have<00:03:55.159> is<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.699> flexible<00:03:56.599> ruler<00:03:57.159> sadly<00:03:58.159> these<00:03:58.430> are

have is a flexible ruler sadly these are

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.399 
have is a flexible ruler sadly these are

only now available in America but it's
