good game and I think in the last 10
minutes<00:04:47.620> there<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.220> really<00:04:48.370> had<00:04:48.669> it<00:04:48.880> had<00:04:49.150> the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.670 
minutes there it really had it had the

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
ability to take a turn for the worse

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.200

with<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.919> physicality<00:04:51.310> picking<00:04:51.820> up<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.000> little

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210

with the physicality picking up a little
bit<00:04:52.330> but<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:52.900> think<00:04:53.200> both<00:04:53.380> teams<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:53.830> think<00:04:54.100> 11<00:04:54.610> is

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
bit but I think both teams I think 11 is

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.090 
bit but I think both teams I think 11 is
pretty<00:04:55.150> deserving<00:04:55.690> I<00:04:55.870> think<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.650> both<00:04:56.830> teams
