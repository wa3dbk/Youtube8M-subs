Mustang<00:06:10.710> that<00:06:11.710> is<00:06:11.860> my<00:06:12.010> opinion<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:13.630> reason<00:06:13.990> is

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
Mustang that is my opinion the reason is

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.170 
Mustang that is my opinion the reason is
that<00:06:14.320> vaughn<00:06:14.800> gittin<00:06:14.830> drives<00:06:15.640> it<00:06:15.850> and<00:06:16.060> it

that vaughn gittin drives it and it

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.110 
that vaughn gittin drives it and it
looks<00:06:16.390> very<00:06:16.600> cool<00:06:17.670> that<00:06:18.670> was<00:06:18.820> when<00:06:18.970> I<00:06:19.000> started
