00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.229 
here and we're also seeing a little more
gap<00:02:26.209> in<00:02:26.420> heel<00:02:26.660> area<00:02:30.910> but<00:02:31.910> we<00:02:32.000> still<00:02:32.120> have<00:02:32.209> a

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
gap in heel area but we still have a

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.630 
gap in heel area but we still have a
nice<00:02:32.390> fit<00:02:32.630> around<00:02:32.750> sides<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.800> walls<00:02:34.040> would<00:02:34.580> be

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
nice fit around sides the walls would be

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.630 
nice fit around sides the walls would be
in<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:34.940> front<00:02:35.090> it's<00:02:35.360> still<00:02:35.540> spreading<00:02:35.750> nicely

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
in the front it's still spreading nicely

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.949 
in the front it's still spreading nicely
and<00:02:37.640> that<00:02:37.670> boot<00:02:38.000> would<00:02:38.120> actually<00:02:38.450> still<00:02:38.720> work

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
and that boot would actually still work

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.289 
and that boot would actually still work
in<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.500> gluon<00:02:39.739> situation<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.819> wouldn't<00:02:41.030> work<00:02:41.120> as

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
in a gluon situation it wouldn't work as

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.670 
in a gluon situation it wouldn't work as
well<00:02:41.450> as<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.630> glove<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.630> we're<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.260> little<00:02:45.380> big

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
well as a glove so we're a little big

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.900 
well as a glove so we're a little big
here<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:48.650> based<00:02:48.830> on<00:02:48.950> those<00:02:49.100> three<00:02:49.280> shells<00:02:49.610> the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
here so based on those three shells the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:03:04.870 
here so based on those three shells the
one<00:02:50.319> would<00:02:51.319> fit<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.650> horse<00:02:51.830> best<00:03:03.640> real<00:03:04.640> tight

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
one would fit this horse best real tight

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.789 
one would fit this horse best real tight
from<00:03:05.060> side<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.269> side

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
from side to side

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.979 
from side to side
boots<00:03:06.799> hard<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.099> get<00:03:07.220> off<00:03:07.700> snug<00:03:08.630> in<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.810> heel

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
boots hard to get off snug in the heel

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.789 
boots hard to get off snug in the heel
area<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:13.489> based<00:03:13.700> on<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:13.910> fit<00:03:14.239> kit<00:03:14.799> sizing

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
area so based on that fit kit sizing

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.759 
area so based on that fit kit sizing
we'd<00:03:16.010> order<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.340> size<00:03:16.609> one<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.989> a<00:03:18.109> gluon<00:03:18.320> shell

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
we'd order a size one in a gluon shell

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.209 
we'd order a size one in a gluon shell
or<00:03:19.040> any<00:03:19.640> G<00:03:19.790> boot<00:03:19.940> glove
