cinematic 24 25 FPS right now so yeah
but<00:02:17.790> oh<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:20.720> looks<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.900> little<00:02:22.050> better<00:02:22.290> than<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
but oh it looks a little better than the

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.710 
but oh it looks a little better than the
default<00:02:22.980> version<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.730> scar<00:02:23.970> my<00:02:24.270> might<00:02:24.510> I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
default version of scar my might I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.760 
default version of scar my might I
should<00:02:25.050> say<00:02:25.230> myself<00:02:29.540> that's<00:02:30.540> like<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.560> big

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
should say myself that's like this big

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.210 
should say myself that's like this big
difference<00:02:32.160> EMV<00:02:32.430> makes<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:36.830> big<00:02:37.830> difference

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
difference EMV makes a big difference

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.100 
difference EMV makes a big difference
right<00:02:38.310> there<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.580> know<00:02:38.760> it's<00:02:39.270> all<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.750> don't<00:02:40.020> know
