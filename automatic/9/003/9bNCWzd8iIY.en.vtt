Washington again just another update on
the<00:00:08.400> Tomatoes<00:00:08.880> here<00:00:11.000> just<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.090> running<00:00:12.389> tally

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the Tomatoes here just a running tally

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.299 
the Tomatoes here just a running tally
that<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.870> have<00:00:13.080> for<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.349> tomatoes<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:13.889> far<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.280> I

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
that I have for the tomatoes so far is I

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.700 
that I have for the tomatoes so far is I
have<00:00:14.490> about<00:00:14.700> 15<00:00:15.210> pounds<00:00:15.480> off<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.320> tomatoes

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
have about 15 pounds off the tomatoes

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.300 
have about 15 pounds off the tomatoes
and<00:00:17.150> it's<00:00:18.150> probably<00:00:18.359> closer<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.810> 20<00:00:19.109> because

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
and it's probably closer to 20 because

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.880 
and it's probably closer to 20 because
I've<00:00:20.310> given<00:00:20.640> away<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.390> many<00:00:21.630> tomatoes<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.560> I

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
I've given away so many tomatoes that I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310 
I've given away so many tomatoes that I
haven't<00:00:23.670> really<00:00:23.970> been<00:00:24.180> keeping<00:00:24.869> track<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.140> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
haven't really been keeping track of the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.730 
haven't really been keeping track of the
weight<00:00:25.529> when<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.010> give<00:00:26.160> them<00:00:26.279> away<00:00:26.449> but<00:00:27.500> as<00:00:28.500> you

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
weight when I give them away but as you

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.109 
weight when I give them away but as you
can<00:00:28.890> see<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.400> kind<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.640> what<00:00:29.789> happens

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
can see this is kind of what happens

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.510 
can see this is kind of what happens
when<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.720> don't<00:00:32.000> get<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.149> suckers<00:00:33.570> off<00:00:34.520> early

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
when you don't get the suckers off early

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.600 
when you don't get the suckers off early
on<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.239> process<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:38.100> kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.370> end<00:00:38.489> up

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
on in the process you kind of end up

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.869 
on in the process you kind of end up
with<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.590> tangle<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.739> Tomatoes

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
with just a tangle of Tomatoes

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.840 
with just a tangle of Tomatoes
but<00:00:42.210> that's<00:00:43.110> okay<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.800> looks<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.070> cool<00:00:44.460> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
but that's okay it looks really cool so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.240 
but that's okay it looks really cool so
and<00:00:45.410> I'm<00:00:46.410> still<00:00:46.800> getting<00:00:46.890> quite<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> few

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and I'm still getting quite a few

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.959 
and I'm still getting quite a few
tomatoes<00:00:47.760> off<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.579> July<00:00:52.039> 27th<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.119 

just<00:00:56.969> kind<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.500> it's<00:00:58.500> kind<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.770> what<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> got

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
just kind of it's kind of what I got

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.889 
just kind of it's kind of what I got
going<00:00:59.430> here<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.850> trimmed<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> leaves

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
going here I trimmed up the leaves

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.450 
going here I trimmed up the leaves
yesterday<00:01:02.690> pretty<00:01:03.690> aggressively<00:01:04.250> I'm<00:01:05.250> not

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
yesterday pretty aggressively I'm not

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.060 
yesterday pretty aggressively I'm not
sure<00:01:05.610> if<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.790> had<00:01:05.970> any<00:01:06.150> kind<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.540> leaf<00:01:07.070> fungus

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
sure if I had any kind of a leaf fungus

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.990 
sure if I had any kind of a leaf fungus
or<00:01:08.280> issue<00:01:08.900> but<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.260> don't<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.700> doesn't

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
or issue but I don't know it doesn't

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.460 
or issue but I don't know it doesn't
seem<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.600> hurt<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> tomatoes<00:01:13.290> that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
seem to really hurt the tomatoes that

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.070 
seem to really hurt the tomatoes that
much<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.159> long<00:01:14.310> as<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.520> don't<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.820> too

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
much so long as you don't get too

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.310 
much so long as you don't get too
aggressive<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> leaves

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
aggressive with the with the leaves

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.200 
aggressive with the with the leaves
which<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.650> kind<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.280> every<00:01:20.909> time<00:01:21.060> I've

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
which I kind of have every time I've

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.010 
which I kind of have every time I've
done<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.830> nothing's<00:01:22.830> died<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.430> I

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
done in it but nothing's died so I

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
done in it but nothing's died so I
figure<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.290> things<00:01:25.530> die<00:01:25.740> that's<00:01:26.400> when<00:01:26.610> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
figure when things die that's when you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.140 
figure when things die that's when you
get<00:01:26.880> or<00:01:27.659> you've<00:01:27.840> gotten<00:01:28.080> too<00:01:28.350> aggressive

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
get or you've gotten too aggressive

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.929 
get or you've gotten too aggressive
this<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.630> first<00:01:30.900> year<00:01:31.110> doing<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
this is my first year doing this so

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.700 
this is my first year doing this so
really<00:01:33.320> don't<00:01:34.320> take<00:01:34.530> my<00:01:34.710> face<00:01:35.130> but

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
really don't take my face but

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.310 
really don't take my face but
everything's<00:01:37.710> still<00:01:37.829> alive<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
everything's still alive so that's a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.800 
everything's still alive so that's a
testament<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.070> how<00:01:41.820> easy<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.299> stuff<00:01:42.450> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
testament kind of how easy this stuff is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.859 
testament kind of how easy this stuff is
it's<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:43.740> difficult<00:01:46.220> monitor<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
it's not really difficult monitor the

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.120 
it's not really difficult monitor the
the<00:01:48.869> pH<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> water<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.920> monitor<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
the pH of the water and monitor the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.230 
the pH of the water and monitor the
amount<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.280> nutrient<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
amount of nutrient that you have in the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.280 
amount of nutrient that you have in the
water<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.700> you'll<00:01:56.700> get<00:01:56.850> crazy<00:01:57.420> amounts<00:01:57.930> of

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
water and you'll get crazy amounts of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.929 
water and you'll get crazy amounts of
tomatoes

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.419
