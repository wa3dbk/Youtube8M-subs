 you can do in the kitchen

 these are very common behaviors 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.950
 and who does them has no idea of â€‹â€‹star 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.560
 working against your health 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.810
 today in the modern world it is already difficult 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.730
 eating healthily because of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.289
 food industries 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.789
 let's not shoot the hoe 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.650
 feet alone 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.630
 what you can do in the kitchen cooking i 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.940
 microwave booster 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.190
 it is a coupled and criminal 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.780
 of usters are full of preservatives and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.649
 to the states with more raw materials 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.270
 scarce 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.250
 the microwave has been shown to hurt 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.950
 to health by putting them together yes that is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.289
 a kind of monster doing it means not 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.039
 have the slightest desire to safeguard 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.829
 your body and your health 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.270
 prepare a cake with vanillin 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.440
 there are numerous recipes that provide 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.109
 this ingredient 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.420
 but vanillin is not what vanillin is 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.829
 nothing but an artificial aroma yes 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.260
 just one of those used 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.330
 much better from the food industry 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.610
 use real vanilla to make a 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.090
 cake and leave them to the vanillin there where 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.880
 it is being fried for two hours 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.680
 cooking the sautÃ© for a long time 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.750
 properties of any vegetables to which 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.770
 let's put inside disappear 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.330
 vitamins go away 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.040
 nutritional properties decrease 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.229
 exaggeratedly 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.030
 in practice, they pile up everyone well 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.170
 the foods contained inside and yes 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.430
 eat something that is not at all nutritious 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.710
 stir the dishes in the pan 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.290
 non-stick with a metal cutlery 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.299
 this practice causes the bottom of the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.340
 pot is ligated releasing so 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.430
 highly carcinogenic substances in the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.380
 always use food and cutlery in 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.450
 wood or plastic inside the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.430
 Non-stick cookware be careful 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.409
 also in storing and not putting on it 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.130
 another pot that could go to 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.259
 races at the bottom wash the pots without 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.119
 rinse the detergents thoroughly 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.110
 Moderns are certainly not an example of 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.440
 naturalness 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.570
 the scene of dishwashing residues not 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.670
 these residues are certainly healthy 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.130
 will end up in the food we will cook and of 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.490
 consequence also within us of the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.950
 detergent estimates use the nut 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.140
 the dice is considered for many 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.000
 indispensable but the nut we can 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.550
 buy in the supermarket contains 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.220
 highly harmful ingredients yes too 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.900
 the one without monosodium glutamate for 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.410
 this reason a lot better not 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.050
 use it use the zest of 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.850
 citrus- treated lemon or orange 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.070
 they are treated on the surface for 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.320
 keep that nice shiny skin and 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.680
 attractive with chemical compounds such as 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.000
 230 of phenyl a compound derived from 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.989
 coal also used as a pesticide 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.330
 pack the foods containing 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.459
 lemon vinegar tomato with paper 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.680
 aluminum aluminum paper a 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.450
 contact with acid substances it releases 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.400
 aluminum molecules in the food 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.880
 of aluminum cause serious illnesses 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.280
 how to use multiple sclerosis 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.140
 aluminum pans in the pendulum of 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.299
 aluminum always releases aluminum 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.940
 in food, aluminum is a metal 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.890
 very little is enough to scratch it 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.299
 it is for every scratch of the aluminum one is 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.330
 detached from the pot itself 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.140
 poured into the food defrost each 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.269
 thing 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.709
 I think this is the obvious things you strina 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.390
 don't go well and engineering doesn't 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.580
 no one likes them but important 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.380
 remember that the parts squeezed in addition to 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.860
 not being good the palate is also 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.860
 carcinogenic 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.190
 well now that you've learned how 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.230
 behave in the kitchen you just have to 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.570
 learn how to behave 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.130
 supermarket to find out all about 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.390
 food sophistication and 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.269
 deceptions aimed at by multinationals 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.420
 food visit foods to avoid point 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.420
