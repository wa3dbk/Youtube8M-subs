were<00:00:16.330> sold<00:00:16.600> in<00:00:16.960> after<00:00:17.470> the<00:00:17.560> late<00:00:17.740> 40s<00:00:18.250> that<00:00:18.430> had

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
were sold in after the late 40s that had

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.310 
were sold in after the late 40s that had
the<00:00:18.699> narrow<00:00:18.910> front<00:00:19.300> end<00:00:19.539> had<00:00:19.810> what<00:00:19.990> they<00:00:20.109> call

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
the narrow front end had what they call

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.999 
the narrow front end had what they call
a<00:00:20.349> roll<00:00:20.650> ematic<00:00:21.130> front<00:00:21.970> end<00:00:22.240> and<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:23.800> is<00:00:23.980> a

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
a roll ematic front end and that is a

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.640 
a roll ematic front end and that is a
type<00:00:24.279> of<00:00:24.310> suspension<00:00:25.349> and<00:00:26.349> I'm<00:00:26.439> going<00:00:26.589> to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
type of suspension and I'm going to

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.819 
type of suspension and I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:26.829> it<00:00:27.279> here<00:00:27.599> momentarily<00:00:28.829> it's

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
demonstrate it here momentarily it's

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.729 
demonstrate it here momentarily it's
actually<00:00:30.369> a<00:00:30.400> gearbox<00:00:31.210> there<00:00:31.810> that<00:00:32.050> allows<00:00:32.349> one

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
actually a gearbox there that allows one

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.950 
actually a gearbox there that allows one
wheel<00:00:33.010> to<00:00:33.250> go<00:00:33.400> up<00:00:33.610> and<00:00:33.880> one<00:00:34.030> wheel<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.510> go<00:00:34.660> down

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
wheel to go up and one wheel to go down

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.130 
wheel to go up and one wheel to go down
and<00:00:35.610> using<00:00:36.610> this<00:00:36.760> system<00:00:37.060> if<00:00:37.510> a<00:00:37.690> farmer<00:00:38.080> is

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
and using this system if a farmer is

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.700 
and using this system if a farmer is
going<00:00:38.290> across<00:00:38.770> a<00:00:39.060> row<00:00:40.060> of<00:00:40.120> corn<00:00:40.780> or<00:00:41.200> hits<00:00:41.560> a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
going across a row of corn or hits a

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.100 
going across a row of corn or hits a
stone<00:00:41.980> or<00:00:42.280> something<00:00:42.730> and<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:43.600> happens<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.080> be

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
stone or something and it happens to be

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.070 
stone or something and it happens to be
four-inch<00:00:44.800> stone<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:46.210> tractor<00:00:46.690> would<00:00:46.840> raise

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
four-inch stone the tractor would raise

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.070 
four-inch stone the tractor would raise
only<00:00:47.650> two<00:00:48.430> inches<00:00:48.670> or<00:00:49.030> half<00:00:49.300> of<00:00:49.480> that<00:00:49.660> so<00:00:49.930> it

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
only two inches or half of that so it

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.050 
only two inches or half of that so it
provided<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:51.100> little<00:00:51.250> bit<00:00:51.430> better<00:00:51.730> ride

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
provided a little bit better ride

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.960 
provided a little bit better ride
whether<00:00:52.870> or<00:00:53.110> not<00:00:53.230> this<00:00:53.500> was<00:00:53.740> really<00:00:54.130> useful<00:00:54.370> or

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
whether or not this was really useful or

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.330 
whether or not this was really useful or
just<00:00:55.240> a<00:00:55.390> gimmick<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:55.930> don't<00:00:56.140> know<00:00:56.290> there<00:00:57.010> wasn't

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
just a gimmick I don't know there wasn't

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.920 
just a gimmick I don't know there wasn't
really<00:00:57.460> any<00:00:57.730> other<00:00:57.940> tractor<00:00:58.300> companies<00:00:58.810> that

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
really any other tractor companies that

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.010 
really any other tractor companies that
attempted<00:00:59.470> a<00:00:59.920> similar<00:01:00.790> product<00:01:01.120> although

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
attempted a similar product although

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.550 
attempted a similar product although
they<00:01:02.650> certainly<00:01:03.040> had<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:04.019> patent<00:01:05.019> on<00:01:05.170> it<00:01:05.229> for

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
they certainly had a patent on it for

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.510 
they certainly had a patent on it for
many<00:01:05.860> years<00:01:09.420> John<00:01:10.420> Deere<00:01:10.780> B<00:01:11.109> is<00:01:11.409> now<00:01:11.649> jacked<00:01:12.219> up

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
many years John Deere B is now jacked up

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.090 
many years John Deere B is now jacked up
approximately<00:01:12.939> six<00:01:13.899> inches<00:01:14.049> and<00:01:15.009> I'll

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
approximately six inches and I'll

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.580 
approximately six inches and I'll
demonstrate<00:01:15.429> for<00:01:16.119> you<00:01:16.270> how<00:01:16.509> that<00:01:16.960> roll<00:01:17.170> Ematic

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
demonstrate for you how that roll Ematic

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.489 
demonstrate for you how that roll Ematic
works<00:01:17.829> you<00:01:18.729> see<00:01:18.999> one<00:01:19.329> little<00:01:19.600> side<00:01:19.990> will<00:01:20.229> go<00:01:20.350> up

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
works you see one little side will go up

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:23.190 
works you see one little side will go up
the<00:01:21.189> other<00:01:21.219> will<00:01:21.640> go<00:01:21.759> down<00:01:21.999> and<00:01:22.479> as<00:01:22.630> a<00:01:22.659> gearbox

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
the other will go down and as a gearbox

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.550 
the other will go down and as a gearbox
in<00:01:23.469> here<00:01:23.740> with<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.999> gears<00:01:25.329> that<00:01:26.259> are<00:01:26.409> doing

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
in here with the gears that are doing

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.050 
in here with the gears that are doing
that<00:01:26.859> you<00:01:27.009> can<00:01:27.159> look<00:01:27.340> at<00:01:27.460> pictures<00:01:27.609> of<00:01:27.880> that

that you can look at pictures of that
and<00:01:28.270> some

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.530 

did<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.750> notice<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.680> top<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.300> hood

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
did you notice that the top of the hood

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.660 
did you notice that the top of the hood
on<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.930> tractor<00:02:53.520> move<00:02:55.050> vertically

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
the height of the stump okay now we're

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.920 
the height of the stump okay now we're
going<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.459> do<00:03:06.610> some<00:03:06.880> measuring<00:03:07.270> as<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.750> can

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
going to do some measuring as you can

see<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:09.280> sticks<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.850> have<00:03:10.000> clamped<00:03:10.450> above

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
see the sticks that I have clamped above

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.920 
see the sticks that I have clamped above
the<00:03:10.990> hood<00:03:11.200> are<00:03:11.500> about<00:03:12.660> approximately<00:03:13.660> even

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
the hood are about approximately even

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.020 
the hood are about approximately even
with<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.320> high<00:03:14.470> spot<00:03:14.800> of<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.310> hood<00:03:15.580> so<00:03:15.880> now

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
with the high spot of the hood so now

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.060 
with the high spot of the hood so now
I'm<00:03:16.150> going<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.420> back<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.930> tractor<00:03:17.410> down<00:03:17.650> and

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
I'm going to back the tractor down and

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.500 
I'm going to back the tractor down and
then<00:03:19.000> put<00:03:19.330> just<00:03:19.570> one<00:03:19.780> wheel<00:03:20.110> up<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:21.510> stump

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
then put just one wheel up on the stump

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.720 
then put just one wheel up on the stump
to<00:03:23.050> show<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.770> difference<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.520> height

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
to show you the difference in height

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.680 
to show you the difference in height
between<00:03:25.920> both<00:03:26.920> wheels<00:03:27.520> going<00:03:27.970> over<00:03:28.239> something

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
between both wheels going over something

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.710 
between both wheels going over something
or<00:03:28.810> just<00:03:29.230> one<00:03:29.440> wheel<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.070> watch<00:03:30.940> carefully<00:03:31.300> and

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
or just one wheel so watch carefully and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:04:33.200 
or just one wheel so watch carefully and
we'll<00:03:31.870> will<00:03:32.170> notice<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.709> differential

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.290 

as<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.990> can<00:04:34.139> see<00:04:34.380> there's<00:04:34.680> about

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
as you can see there's about

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.850 
as you can see there's about
approximately<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.449> three<00:04:36.810> inch<00:04:36.990> difference<00:04:37.319> I

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
approximately a three inch difference I

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.999 
approximately a three inch difference I
hope<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:39.090> enjoyed<00:04:39.539> this<00:04:39.900> demonstration<00:04:40.289> of
