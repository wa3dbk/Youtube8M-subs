00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.120 
because well-developed lats not only
make<00:00:07.980> us<00:00:08.160> look<00:00:08.340> bigger<00:00:09.200> but<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.380> v-taper<00:00:10.830> they

make us look bigger but the v-taper they

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.030 
make us look bigger but the v-taper they
create<00:00:11.519> makes<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.540> waist<00:00:12.750> look<00:00:13.019> smaller<00:00:13.380> and

that makes for an impressive physique

the<00:00:24.600> workout<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.140> over<00:00:25.500> then<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.369> likely

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the workout is over then it's likely

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.429 
the workout is over then it's likely
that<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.150> are<00:00:27.210> not<00:00:27.420> properly<00:00:27.720> hitting<00:00:28.320> those

muscle fibers and your muscle
development<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.380> probably<00:00:32.189> lacking<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
development is probably lacking if you

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.510 
development is probably lacking if you
have<00:00:34.110> trouble<00:00:34.469> filling<00:00:34.739> your<00:00:34.950> lats<00:00:35.190> when<00:00:35.399> you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
have trouble filling your lats when you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.760 
have trouble filling your lats when you
train<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.090> trouble<00:00:36.750> building<00:00:36.989> your<00:00:37.260> labs<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
train in trouble building your labs I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.889 
train in trouble building your labs I
have<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.640> trick<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.780> I'll

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899

have just the trick for you but I'll
warn<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.290> now<00:00:40.440> you'll<00:00:41.070> feel<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:41.520> labs<00:00:41.809> but

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
warn you now you'll feel your labs but

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.709 
warn you now you'll feel your labs but
they<00:00:42.960> won't<00:00:43.230> feel<00:00:43.469> good<00:00:43.789> however<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.300> results

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
they won't feel good however the results

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.270 
they won't feel good however the results
you<00:00:45.809> get<00:00:45.989> from<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.320> very<00:00:46.649> painful<00:00:46.920> technique

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
you get from this very painful technique

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.970 
you get from this very painful technique
will<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.329> very<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:48.930> those<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.860> who

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
will be very good those of you who

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.799 
will be very good those of you who

extended set track as a method where you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.220 
extended set track as a method where you
start<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.949> exercise<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
start with one exercise and

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.500 
start with one exercise and
progressively<00:00:58.230> move<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.859> other<00:00:59.010> exercises<00:00:59.969> or

way that you started with as the name
implies<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:08.850> method<00:01:09.390> allows<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.049> extend

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
implies this method allows you to extend

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.649 
implies this method allows you to extend
the<00:01:10.590> set<00:01:10.860> past<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.700> point<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.030> muscle<00:01:12.450> failure

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.530 
the set past the point of muscle failure
let<00:01:13.590> me<00:01:13.710> show<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.130> great<00:01:14.400> extended<00:01:15.030> set<00:01:15.270> for

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
let me show you a great extended set for

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200 
let me show you a great extended set for
the<00:01:15.630> lats<00:01:15.840> using<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> pulldown<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:18.030> make

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the lats using the pulldown just make

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.910 
the lats using the pulldown just make
sure<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> set<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.049> wrist<00:01:19.229> straps<00:01:19.500> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
sure you have a set of wrist straps to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
sure you have a set of wrist straps to
prevent<00:01:20.250> your<00:01:20.400> grip<00:01:20.670> from<00:01:20.700> giving<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:21.299> before

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
prevent your grip from giving out before

prevent your grip from giving out before
your<00:01:21.930> laps<00:01:22.140> turn<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.909> extended<00:01:24.540> sets<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
your laps turn to do extended sets and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830 
your laps turn to do extended sets and
pull<00:01:25.439> downs<00:01:25.729> start<00:01:26.729> by<00:01:26.880> doing<00:01:27.150> pull<00:01:27.570> downs

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
pull downs start by doing pull downs

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.410 
pull downs start by doing pull downs
behind<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> neck<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> weight<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
behind the neck with a weight that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.440 
behind the neck with a weight that
allows<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> complete<00:01:31.470> about<00:01:32.310> 12<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.939> 15

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
allows you to complete about 12 to 15

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.580 
allows you to complete about 12 to 15
reps<00:01:34.130> do<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.340> version<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.970> pull<00:01:36.240> downs<00:01:36.590> until

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
reps do this version of pull downs until

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.999 
reps do this version of pull downs until
you<00:01:37.770> reach<00:01:37.979> muscle<00:01:38.310> failure<00:01:39.350> then<00:01:40.350> you'll

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you reach muscle failure then you'll

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.980 
you reach muscle failure then you'll
continue<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.759> set<00:01:42.030> by<00:01:42.360> immediately
