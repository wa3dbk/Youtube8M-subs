00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
loading up and uh yeah actually it looks

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.960 
loading up and uh yeah actually it looks
like<00:01:53.840> we<00:01:53.960> did<00:01:54.140> skip<00:01:54.410> through<00:01:54.650> it<00:01:54.770> okay<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:55.520> i'm

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
like we did skip through it okay so i'm

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.280 
like we did skip through it okay so i'm
guessing<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.450> this<00:01:56.600> is<00:01:56.780> going<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.020> be<00:01:57.140> my

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
guessing that this is going to be my

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.220 
guessing that this is going to be my
starting<00:01:57.680> team<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.540> here<00:01:59.540> we<00:01:59.660> go<00:01:59.690> alright<00:01:59.990> so

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
starting team and here we go alright so

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.290 
starting team and here we go alright so
we<00:02:00.350> got<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.530> really<00:02:00.710> nice<00:02:00.920> striker<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.700> we<00:02:02.120> got

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
we got a really nice striker and we got

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.350 
we got a really nice striker and we got
a<00:02:02.570> center<00:02:03.530> mid<00:02:03.710> coming<00:02:04.010> off<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.250> bench<00:02:04.810> um<00:02:07.360> we

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
a center mid coming off the bench um we

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.969 
a center mid coming off the bench um we
can<00:02:08.509> find<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.810> way<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:08.960> fit<00:02:09.200> him<00:02:09.410> into<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.830> line

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
can find a way to fit him into the line

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.920 
can find a way to fit him into the line
can't<00:02:10.490> we<00:02:11.710> swap<00:02:12.710> him<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.070> for<00:02:13.370> him<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:13.970> move

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
can't we swap him in for him and move

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.020 
can't we swap him in for him and move
alright<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:15.590> chemistry<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.310> not<00:02:16.490> great<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:16.910> the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
alright so chemistry is not great on the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.260 
alright so chemistry is not great on the
steam<00:02:17.300> that's<00:02:18.140> obvious<00:02:18.410> ah<00:02:19.010> do<00:02:20.000> we<00:02:20.090> have<00:02:20.120> a

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
steam that's obvious ah do we have a
