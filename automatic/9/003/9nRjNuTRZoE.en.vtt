big park our boundaries aren't very

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.080 
big park our boundaries aren't very
large<00:00:38.420> but<00:00:38.780> our<00:00:38.899> horizons<00:00:39.590> are<00:00:40.280> tremendous

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
large but our horizons are tremendous

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.080 
large but our horizons are tremendous
and<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.899> horizon<00:00:42.410> is<00:00:42.530> far<00:00:42.800> beyond<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.820> park

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
and the horizon is far beyond the park

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.030 
and the horizon is far beyond the park
boundary<00:00:44.629> there<00:00:45.050> are<00:00:45.170> places<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:45.649> can<00:00:45.829> stand

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040

up<00:00:46.220> on<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.399> rock<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:46.940> see<00:00:47.420> 40<00:00:47.750> miles<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.350> the

up on a rock and see 40 miles to the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.040 
up on a rock and see 40 miles to the
horizon<00:00:48.970> so<00:00:49.970> there's<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.269> lot<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.540> room<00:00:50.750> for

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
horizon so there's a lot of room for

imagination to stretch out and try to

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:06.929 
imagination to stretch out and try to
take<00:00:56.600> in<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.260> vastness<00:00:57.769> of<00:00:57.890> these<00:00:58.250> landscapes

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.910 

one<00:01:07.509> of<00:01:07.630> our<00:01:07.749> most<00:01:07.869> popular<00:01:08.140> questions<00:01:08.799> at

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
one of our most popular questions at

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.679 
one of our most popular questions at
Arches<00:01:09.219> is<00:01:09.340> why<00:01:09.520> are<00:01:09.729> there<00:01:09.850> so<00:01:10.210> many<00:01:10.270> arches

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
Arches is why are there so many arches

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.709 
Arches is why are there so many arches
at<00:01:11.020> arches<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:12.520> at<00:01:12.609> arches<00:01:12.939> basically<00:01:13.479> four

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
at arches here at arches basically four

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.830 
at arches here at arches basically four
things<00:01:14.020> had<00:01:14.289> to<00:01:14.409> happen<00:01:15.390> first<00:01:16.390> we<00:01:16.600> had<00:01:16.719> to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
things had to happen first we had to

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.319 
things had to happen first we had to
have<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.109> right<00:01:17.140> kind<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.770> rock<00:01:17.979> most<00:01:18.969> of<00:01:19.179> what

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
have the right kind of rock most of what

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.779 
have the right kind of rock most of what
you<00:01:19.450> see<00:01:19.659> here<00:01:19.959> is<00:01:20.140> sandstone<00:01:20.740> which<00:01:21.609> is

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
you see here is sandstone which is

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.120 
you see here is sandstone which is
porous<00:01:22.240> water<00:01:22.869> can<00:01:23.140> trickle<00:01:23.409> through<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.890> and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
porous water can trickle through it and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.179 
porous water can trickle through it and
slowly<00:01:24.490> dissolve<00:01:25.209> it<00:01:25.390> over<00:01:25.600> time<00:01:26.189> second

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
slowly dissolve it over time second

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.399 
slowly dissolve it over time second
thing<00:01:27.340> we<00:01:27.459> had<00:01:27.609> to<00:01:27.640> get<00:01:27.909> was<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:29.109> right<00:01:29.289> amount

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
thing we had to get was the right amount

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.559 
thing we had to get was the right amount
of<00:01:29.590> rain<00:01:29.770> because<00:01:30.399> if<00:01:30.549> it<00:01:30.640> rained<00:01:30.849> hundreds<00:01:31.420> of

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
of rain because if it rained hundreds of

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.959 
of rain because if it rained hundreds of
inches<00:01:31.899> every<00:01:32.229> year<00:01:32.679> the<00:01:33.280> rock<00:01:33.520> would<00:01:33.759> melt

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969 
inches every year the rock would melt

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.910 
inches every year the rock would melt
far<00:01:34.719> faster<00:01:35.319> a<00:01:35.590> lack<00:01:36.579> of<00:01:36.609> earthquakes<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
far faster a lack of earthquakes and the

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.319 
far faster a lack of earthquakes and the
fourth<00:01:39.159> one<00:01:39.399> is<00:01:39.610> probably<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.149> least

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
fourth one is probably the least

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.520 
fourth one is probably the least
intuitive<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.890> we're<00:01:42.039> here<00:01:42.310> right<00:01:42.520> now<00:01:43.530> this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
intuitive that we're here right now this

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.800 
intuitive that we're here right now this
is<00:01:44.709> a<00:01:44.739> living<00:01:45.129> plant<00:01:45.610> it<00:01:45.849> is<00:01:45.969> continually

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
is a living plant it is continually

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.440 
is a living plant it is continually
changing<00:01:47.729> hundreds<00:01:48.729> of<00:01:48.849> thousands<00:01:49.360> or

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
changing hundreds of thousands or

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.359 
changing hundreds of thousands or
millions<00:01:49.869> of<00:01:49.989> years<00:01:50.170> ago<00:01:50.349> these<00:01:50.829> rock<00:01:51.099> layers

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
millions of years ago these rock layers

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.179 
millions of years ago these rock layers
weren't<00:01:51.700> even<00:01:51.939> exposed<00:01:52.360> and<00:01:53.129> hundreds<00:01:54.129> of

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
weren't even exposed and hundreds of

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.709 
weren't even exposed and hundreds of
thousands<00:01:54.670> or<00:01:54.819> millions<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.329> years<00:01:55.390> in<00:01:55.689> the

thousands or millions of years in the

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.709 
thousands or millions of years in the
future<00:01:55.929> they<00:01:56.590> will<00:01:56.739> all<00:01:56.890> be<00:01:57.039> gone<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.420> we<00:01:58.689> are

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
future they will all be gone so we are

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.770 
future they will all be gone so we are
here<00:01:59.170> right<00:01:59.379> now<00:01:59.489> when<00:02:00.489> they<00:02:00.609> are<00:02:00.819> exposed<00:02:01.420> as

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
here right now when they are exposed as

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:27.580 
here right now when they are exposed as
a<00:02:01.840> garden<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.649> sculptures<00:02:03.159> for<00:02:03.399> us<00:02:03.489> to<00:02:03.670> enjoy

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.470 

one<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.250> my<00:02:28.340> favorite<00:02:28.730> things<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.209> encourage

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
one of my favorite things to encourage

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.720 
one of my favorite things to encourage
visitors<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.080> do<00:02:30.410> while<00:02:31.190> they're<00:02:31.400> here<00:02:31.610> at

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
visitors to do while they're here at

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.920 
visitors to do while they're here at
arches<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.420> not<00:02:33.170> really<00:02:33.500> an<00:02:33.620> easy<00:02:33.950> thing<00:02:34.930> but

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
arches is not really an easy thing but

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.750 
arches is not really an easy thing but
if<00:02:36.050> you<00:02:36.170> give<00:02:36.440> yourself<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:37.010> little<00:02:37.250> time<00:02:37.459> to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
if you give yourself a little time to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.960 
if you give yourself a little time to
slow<00:02:38.060> down<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.920> can<00:02:40.069> appreciate<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.760> scenery

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
slow down you can appreciate the scenery

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.070 
slow down you can appreciate the scenery
just<00:02:41.780> a<00:02:41.870> bit<00:02:42.050> more

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
just a bit more

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.290 
just a bit more
I'd<00:02:44.620> always<00:02:45.040> encourage<00:02:45.520> people<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.910> tack<00:02:46.270> on

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
I'd always encourage people to tack on

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.830 
I'd always encourage people to tack on
at<00:02:46.750> least<00:02:46.960> an<00:02:47.260> extra<00:02:47.470> half<00:02:48.010> an<00:02:48.220> hour<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:49.180> one<00:02:49.540> of

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
at least an extra half an hour to one of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.270 
at least an extra half an hour to one of
their<00:02:50.590> heights<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:52.210> find<00:02:52.570> a<00:02:52.720> place<00:02:52.960> to<00:02:53.590> step<00:02:54.010> a

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
their heights to find a place to step a

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.950 
their heights to find a place to step a
little<00:02:54.940> bit<00:02:55.180> off<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.360> trail<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.830> sit<00:02:57.130> down

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
little bit off the trail to sit down

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.100 
little bit off the trail to sit down
maybe<00:02:58.960> even<00:02:59.260> lay<00:02:59.500> down<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.570> spread<00:03:01.930> their

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
maybe even lay down and spread their
