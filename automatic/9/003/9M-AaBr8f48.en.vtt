00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:17.130
 Not before about a lot of classic guitars 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.960
 First of all I will explain from the sitting method 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.240
 Here 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.920
 A classical guitar is something that sits in a chair 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.119
 This first generation 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.240
 A waist date night before and half shallow 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.240
 Four 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.620
 It looks like this 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.280
 It continued actually 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.710
 Have a guitar 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.890
 I would like to think, but a little 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:57.410
 In my case the procedure 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.930
 This is a guitar using a tool called guitar rest 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.030
 Lift and play 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.949
 but 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.620
 Usually under the ne left foot it is say to the foot 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.870
 Place the light and put the light foot there 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.230
 Oh that you are ready 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.530
 General details of the guitar stance 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.760
 Become a form 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:25.700
 Here is there about four generations is 2000 yen 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:30.409
 Where in the case of was Tei stayed Resuto which is in about 5000 yen 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.790
 So I really want to think of a good guitar 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.610
 Hey you 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:40.880
 Use the white guitar Best to use the castle Castle 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.370
 It is the part called the left head of the guitar 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.360
 The part called the head is good 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.230
 Just a group at eye level 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.680
 You mean this high server by yourself 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.640
 The part in contact with the left thigh when using private college 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.140
 Rotate it like this 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.020
 I have this bar when using the guitar rest 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.420
 Here is what a variety of flowers bloom 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:12.660
 There are so try it yourself 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.460
 Please try to adjust to the appropriate height 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.530
 Continued 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.180
 At first I would like to explain from the stance of the right hand 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.830
 It's such Te right 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.870
 The part where the tour has stopped 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.580
 Bridge shop but I was extending the bridge 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.090
 Gitaru edge It is around this 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.599
 Right arm around here 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.599
 And so on 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.490
 And as it is 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.080
 That's right Japan 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.610
 Like a ghost 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.030
 It seems to be overturned 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.190
 That big 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.230
 Hand shape 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:57.069
 I'm very weakness state that as you do it 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.650
 Imagine the shape of that hand 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:04.980
 I try to touch in between 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.180
 And I'm on the left but my palm 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.930
 First of all 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:16.860
 Take your hand and let the day down in front of you 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:22.620
 In that state, if you bend your elbow slowly , 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:25.380
 I think the hand is touching , but in that state it is on the left side 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.770
 Let it slide 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.770
 And 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.660
 Guitar 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.810
 Say low 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.650
 this 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.650
 It dropped to 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.100
 It is normal 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.580
 Directly in this way 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.090
 It is an unfriendly stance to bring your hand around this one fret 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.800
 hand 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:02.990
 If you bring it directly to 6 , you will become a kind of person who at the beginning may feel a little 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.380
 First of all, hang your hand sideways as it is often 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.569
 And 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.000
 Raise your elbow 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.680
 Wo me along the edge 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.450
 Say go to Ride 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.790
 I will look at it consciously 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.810
 More than no black 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.260
 Turn off the way you want to handle 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.260
 There is 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.159
 Yup
