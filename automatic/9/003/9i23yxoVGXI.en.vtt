best of them I think you won probably
about<00:00:52.770> five<00:00:53.100> or<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:55.050> main<00:00:55.199> reason

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
about five or so and the main reason

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.260 
about five or so and the main reason
flat<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.890> Yod<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.520> absolutely

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
flat is Yod it's just absolutely

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.180 
flat is Yod it's just absolutely
impossible<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> comes<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> finishes

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
impossible when it comes to finishes

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.950 
impossible when it comes to finishes
because<00:00:59.340> he<00:00:59.579> reverses<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.750> much

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
because he reverses pretty much

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.479 
because he reverses pretty much
everything<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:01.980> reversed<00:01:02.280> about

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
everything I think you reversed about

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
everything I think you reversed about
Wawro<00:01:02.940> Alberti<00:01:03.420> kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.780> finally<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.439> think

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
Wawro Alberti kind of finally you think

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.530 
Wawro Alberti kind of finally you think
you<00:01:04.949> were<00:01:05.040> reversed<00:01:05.250> about<00:01:05.430> 80%<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you were reversed about 80% of the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.080 
you were reversed about 80% of the
finishes<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.140> hit<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.470> him<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.250> kind<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
finishes that hit on him so it kind of

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
finishes that hit on him so it kind of
got<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> bit<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.080> nightmare<00:01:10.290> by<00:01:10.650> little<00:01:10.890> it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
it anyway and there's the reversal twist

when<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> reversed<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> because<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
when you reversed it because the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.710 
when you reversed it because the
reversal<00:02:11.760> animation<00:02:12.209> where<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.420> comes<00:02:12.599> up

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
reversal animation where it comes up

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.030 
reversal animation where it comes up
with<00:02:12.840> l2<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.470> r2

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
with l2 and r2

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.009 
with l2 and r2
that<00:02:14.370> changes<00:02:14.819> green<00:02:15.180> if<00:02:15.390> he<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:15.629> that<00:02:15.750> time

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
that changes green if he got that time

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.539 
that changes green if he got that time
right<00:02:16.260> otherwise<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.040> time<00:02:17.220> went<00:02:17.370> wrong

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
right otherwise if you time went wrong

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.259 
right otherwise if you time went wrong

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.050 
things I actually really like about five
star<00:03:10.319> one<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.129> problems<00:03:11.400> I've<00:03:11.489> always<00:03:11.909> had

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
star one of the problems I've always had

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.670 
star one of the problems I've always had
when<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.299> comes<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.690> top<00:03:12.840> rope<00:03:13.079> finishes<00:03:13.530> is

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
when it comes to top rope finishes is

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.149 
when it comes to top rope finishes is
when<00:03:14.609> you<00:03:14.730> use<00:03:14.819> a<00:03:14.849> superstar<00:03:15.389> like<00:03:15.750> C<00:03:16.500> RVD<00:03:16.980> who

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
when you use a superstar like C RVD who

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.740 
when you use a superstar like C RVD who
really<00:03:17.670> only<00:03:17.819> has<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.239> your<00:03:18.419> top<00:03:18.569> rope

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
really only has that your top rope

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.460 
really only has that your top rope
finisher<00:03:19.340> then<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:21.120> kind<00:03:21.419> of<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:22.139> kind<00:03:22.199> of

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
finisher then it kind of it kind of

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.900 
finisher then it kind of it kind of
limits<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.829> because<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.370> only<00:03:23.579> go<00:03:23.849> at

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
limits you because you can only go at

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.520 
limits you because you can only go at
the<00:03:23.970> top<00:03:24.120> rope<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.359> perform<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:24.989> where

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
the top rope to perform that where

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.710 
the top rope to perform that where
someone<00:03:26.430> that's<00:03:26.699> got<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:26.910> regular<00:03:27.359> I'm<00:03:27.419> gonna

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
someone that's got a regular I'm gonna

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.909 
someone that's got a regular I'm gonna
shove<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.139> hit<00:03:28.349> from<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.530> standing

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
shove it and hit from a standing

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.949 
shove it and hit from a standing
position<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.430> gives<00:03:29.579> some<00:03:29.730> more<00:03:29.940> options<00:03:30.030> so

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
position it gives some more options so

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.629 
position it gives some more options so
one<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> things<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.919> five<00:03:32.129> stars<00:03:32.430> done

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
one of the things that five stars done

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.490 
one of the things that five stars done
is<00:03:32.819> when<00:03:33.569> you've<00:03:33.690> got<00:03:33.720> someone<00:03:34.049> that's<00:03:34.230> got<00:03:34.470> a

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
is when you've got someone that's got a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.900 
is when you've got someone that's got a
top<00:03:34.709> rope<00:03:34.889> finish<00:03:35.129> out<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.340> can<00:03:35.459> actually<00:03:35.579> hit

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
top rope finish out you can actually hit

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.240 
top rope finish out you can actually hit
it<00:03:36.000> from<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.359> springboard<00:03:36.900> position<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.889> not

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
it from the springboard position so not

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.920 
it from the springboard position so not
only<00:03:38.310> does<00:03:38.549> Greg<00:03:38.790> have<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.269> springboard

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
only does Greg have a springboard

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.229 
only does Greg have a springboard
Swanton<00:03:40.530> then<00:03:41.010> Harvey<00:03:41.430> D<00:03:41.579> is<00:03:41.790> actually<00:03:41.940> got<00:03:42.209> a

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
Swanton then Harvey D is actually got a

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.119 
Swanton then Harvey D is actually got a
springboard<00:03:42.750> five-star<00:03:43.379> frog<00:03:43.650> splash<00:03:43.709> in

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
springboard five-star frog splash in

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:45.589 
springboard five-star frog splash in
there<00:03:44.280> as<00:03:44.400> well<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:45.060> think<00:03:45.120> that's<00:03:45.359> really

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
there as well so I think that's really

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.300 
there as well so I think that's really
cool<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.870> just<00:03:45.959> gives<00:03:46.169> you<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.349> second<00:03:46.829> option<00:03:46.980> I

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
cool it just gives you a second option I

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.379 
cool it just gives you a second option I
think<00:03:47.519> that's<00:03:47.669> something<00:03:47.879> that<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.090> would<00:03:48.180> love

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
think that's something that I would love

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.140 
think that's something that I would love
to<00:03:48.540> see<00:03:48.690> in<00:03:48.989> more<00:03:49.530> wrestling<00:03:49.980> games<00:03:50.160> because

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
to see in more wrestling games because

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.189 
to see in more wrestling games because
it<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:51.359> gives<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.660> a<00:03:51.720> little<00:03:51.840> bit<00:03:52.019> more

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
it just gives you a little bit more

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.750 
it just gives you a little bit more
freedom<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.799> don't<00:03:52.980> always<00:03:53.160> have<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.639> do

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
freedom and you don't always have to do

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.119 
freedom and you don't always have to do
exactly<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.480> same<00:03:54.510> thing<00:03:54.900> first<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.799> think<00:03:55.889> the

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
exactly the same thing first I think the

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.530 
exactly the same thing first I think the
spawn<00:03:56.430> turn<00:03:56.639> from<00:03:56.909> the<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.150> when<00:03:57.269> actually

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
spawn turn from the it when actually

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.180 
spawn turn from the it when actually
look<00:03:57.659> really<00:03:58.109> cool<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.530> kind<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.829> preferred

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
look really cool so I kind of preferred

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.240 
look really cool so I kind of preferred
that<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.780> think<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:01.199> may<00:04:01.379> hit<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:01.859> this

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
that I think you may hit it in this

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.619 
that I think you may hit it in this
match<00:04:02.459> I'm<00:04:02.669> not<00:04:02.790> entirely<00:04:03.090> sure<00:04:03.269> if<00:04:03.480> we<00:04:03.599> did

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
match I'm not entirely sure if we did

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.360 
match I'm not entirely sure if we did
from<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.409> terminal<00:04:04.829> but<00:04:04.980> you'll<00:04:05.099> see<00:04:05.250> the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
from the terminal but you'll see the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.809 
from the terminal but you'll see the
difference

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
difference

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.189 
difference
because<00:04:06.239> it's<00:04:06.389> actually<00:04:06.510> got<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.870> taunt<00:04:07.079> in

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
because it's actually got the taunt in

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.960 
because it's actually got the taunt in
there<00:04:07.349> as<00:04:07.409> well<00:04:07.560> as<00:04:08.040> he<00:04:08.129> goes<00:04:08.310> for<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.519> whisper

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
there as well as he goes for a whisper

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.780 
there as well as he goes for a whisper
in<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.239> wind<00:04:09.269> takes<00:04:09.870> down<00:04:10.109> Harvey<00:04:10.560> D<00:04:10.790> and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
in the wind takes down Harvey D and

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.939 
in the wind takes down Harvey D and
there<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.239> there's<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.659> little<00:04:13.560> team

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
there it is there's the little team

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:18.810 
there it is there's the little team
extreme<00:04:14.400> type<00:04:14.699> torn<00:04:15.479> there<00:04:15.720> from<00:04:16.109> Greg

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.909 

so<00:04:19.820> at<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.450> moment<00:04:20.600> none<00:04:20.959> of<00:04:21.109> our<00:04:21.230> finishes<00:04:21.739> I

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
so at the moment none of our finishes I

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.040 
so at the moment none of our finishes I
did<00:04:22.730> get<00:04:22.940> one<00:04:23.090> there<00:04:23.240> before<00:04:23.570> at<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.900> same

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
did get one there before at the same

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.600 
did get one there before at the same
time<00:04:24.290> as<00:04:24.530> your<00:04:24.710> but<00:04:24.950> didn't<00:04:25.160> get<00:04:25.220> a<00:04:25.280> chance<00:04:25.490> to

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
time as your but didn't get a chance to

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.300 
time as your but didn't get a chance to
hit<00:04:25.700> this<00:04:25.850> I<00:04:26.230> don't<00:04:27.230> actually<00:04:27.500> know<00:04:27.800> if<00:04:27.980> Harvey

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
hit this I don't actually know if Harvey

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.659 
hit this I don't actually know if Harvey
D<00:04:28.430> has<00:04:28.669> a<00:04:28.700> standing<00:04:29.240> finisher<00:04:30.430> but<00:04:31.430> he<00:04:31.520> does

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
D has a standing finisher but he does

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.070 
D has a standing finisher but he does
have<00:04:31.850> quite<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.240> lot<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.480> cool<00:04:32.690> moves<00:04:32.900> so

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
have quite a lot of cool moves so

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.330 
have quite a lot of cool moves so
there's<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.500> lot<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.770> you'll<00:04:33.919> recognize<00:04:34.310> it

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
there's a lot that you'll recognize it

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.100 
there's a lot that you'll recognize it
in<00:04:34.580> there<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:35.360> was<00:04:35.480> one<00:04:35.630> them<00:04:35.780> there<00:04:35.960> with

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
in there that was one them there with

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.560 
in there that was one them there with
the<00:04:36.230> sort<00:04:36.590> of<00:04:36.680> step<00:04:36.919> up<00:04:37.040> off<00:04:37.220> this<00:04:37.460> real<00:04:38.120> ropes

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
the sort of step up off this real ropes

gets up just in time so we're still
about<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:00.979> finish<00:05:01.190> I<00:05:01.280> can't<00:05:01.910> remember<00:05:02.180> how

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
about the finish I can't remember how

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.590 
about the finish I can't remember how
long<00:05:02.540> it<00:05:02.840> lasts<00:05:03.169> maybe<00:05:03.440> something<00:05:03.889> like<00:05:04.600> 15-20

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
long it lasts maybe something like 15-20

long it lasts maybe something like 15-20
seconds<00:05:06.020> I<00:05:06.139> saw<00:05:06.400> may<00:05:07.400> be<00:05:07.460> wrong<00:05:07.729> on<00:05:07.850> that<00:05:07.910> but<00:05:08.030> I

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
seconds I saw may be wrong on that but I

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.469 
seconds I saw may be wrong on that but I
think<00:05:08.210> it's<00:05:08.479> around<00:05:08.810> that<00:05:09.020> sort<00:05:09.290> of<00:05:09.320> period<00:05:10.479> as

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
think it's around that sort of period as

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:12.969 
think it's around that sort of period as
it<00:05:11.600> is<00:05:11.960> standing<00:05:12.380> we're<00:05:12.530> out<00:05:12.620> there<00:05:12.770> you<00:05:12.830> can

it is standing we're out there you can

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.159 
it is standing we're out there you can
see<00:05:13.130> it<00:05:13.190> flashing<00:05:13.690> always<00:05:14.690> going<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.870> try<00:05:15.050> and

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
see it flashing always going to try and

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.100 
see it flashing always going to try and
get<00:05:15.320> one<00:05:15.350> in<00:05:15.590> just<00:05:15.860> there<00:05:16.130> but<00:05:16.280> run<00:05:16.760> out<00:05:16.880> oh

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
get one in just there but run out oh

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.960 
get one in just there but run out oh
nice<00:05:18.110> little<00:05:18.320> move<00:05:18.530> there<00:05:18.669> so<00:05:19.669> we<00:05:19.760> can<00:05:19.850> see

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
nice little move there so we can see

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.450 
nice little move there so we can see
that<00:05:20.150> just<00:05:20.840> like<00:05:20.960> already<00:05:21.260> added<00:05:21.710> off<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.979> kind

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
that just like already added off it kind

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.190 
that just like already added off it kind
of<00:05:22.550> hit<00:05:22.700> perfectly<00:05:22.970> it<00:05:23.479> wasn't<00:05:23.840> really<00:05:24.080> in<00:05:24.169> the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
of hit perfectly it wasn't really in the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.630 
of hit perfectly it wasn't really in the
corner<00:05:24.680> it<00:05:24.770> was<00:05:24.860> kind<00:05:25.070> of<00:05:25.160> off<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:25.310> rocks

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
corner it was kind of off the rocks

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.380 
corner it was kind of off the rocks
themselves<00:05:27.460> it's<00:05:28.460> great<00:05:28.729> again<00:05:29.120> with<00:05:29.300> the

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
themselves it's great again with the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.029 
themselves it's great again with the
finishing<00:05:29.780> at<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:30.080> don't<00:05:30.320> know<00:05:30.380> how<00:05:30.590> he<00:05:30.650> gets<00:05:30.830> it

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
finishing at I don't know how he gets it

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.570 
finishing at I don't know how he gets it
so<00:05:31.190> quick<00:05:31.460> I<00:05:31.580> think<00:05:31.729> it's<00:05:31.850> from<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.030> strikes

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
so quick I think it's from the strikes

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.680 
so quick I think it's from the strikes
so<00:05:34.580> that<00:05:34.729> is<00:05:34.820> one<00:05:34.940> of<00:05:34.970> your<00:05:35.150> favorite<00:05:35.450> moves

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
so that is one of your favorite moves

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.020 
so that is one of your favorite moves
there<00:05:35.810> so<00:05:35.960> he<00:05:36.020> just<00:05:36.200> hops<00:05:36.440> over<00:05:36.830> Greg<00:05:37.430> hits<00:05:37.850> him

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
there so he just hops over Greg hits him

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.210 
there so he just hops over Greg hits him
with<00:05:38.060> that<00:05:38.330> swipe<00:05:38.840> with<00:05:39.110> the<00:05:39.140> leg<00:05:39.440> it<00:05:40.039> just

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
with that swipe with the leg it just

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.159 
with that swipe with the leg it just
takes<00:05:40.430> him<00:05:40.580> down<00:05:40.700> the<00:05:40.850> mat<00:05:41.000> so<00:05:41.840> you<00:05:41.930> can<00:05:42.020> see

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
takes him down the mat so you can see

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.659 
takes him down the mat so you can see
they're<00:05:42.350> all<00:05:42.530> these<00:05:42.680> variations<00:05:43.039> of<00:05:43.430> the

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
they're all these variations of the

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.080 
they're all these variations of the
kicks<00:05:43.880> from<00:05:44.210> Harvey<00:05:44.630> D<00:05:45.550> so<00:05:46.550> just<00:05:46.729> lift<00:05:46.940> him

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
kicks from Harvey D so just lift him

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.590 
kicks from Harvey D so just lift him
back<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.419> his<00:05:47.510> feet<00:05:49.270> Northern<00:05:50.270> Lights<00:05:50.419> suplex

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
back to his feet Northern Lights suplex

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.560 
back to his feet Northern Lights suplex
in<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.200> bridge<00:05:51.410> with<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:51.680> pin<00:05:52.150> so<00:05:53.150> the<00:05:53.180> K<00:05:53.389> old

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570 
in the bridge with a pin so the K old

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.659 
in the bridge with a pin so the K old
system<00:05:53.930> is<00:05:54.080> just<00:05:54.440> mashing<00:05:55.100> the<00:05:55.220> buttons<00:05:55.520> to

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
system is just mashing the buttons to

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.940 
system is just mashing the buttons to
try<00:05:55.910> and<00:05:56.030> kick<00:05:56.180> out<00:05:56.300> of<00:05:56.330> it<00:05:56.539> and<00:05:56.720> I<00:05:57.350> think<00:05:57.860> it

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
try and kick out of it and I think it

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.469 
try and kick out of it and I think it
kind<00:05:58.070> of<00:05:58.190> adds<00:05:58.370> to<00:05:58.580> it<00:05:58.669> because<00:05:58.880> it<00:05:58.970> just<00:05:59.180> makes

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
kind of adds to it because it just makes

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.580 
kind of adds to it because it just makes
it<00:05:59.630> a<00:06:01.450> bit<00:06:02.450> more<00:06:02.570> exciting<00:06:02.630> I<00:06:03.139> guess<00:06:03.320> in<00:06:03.500> a<00:06:03.560> way

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
it a bit more exciting I guess in a way

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.810 
it a bit more exciting I guess in a way
as<00:06:03.950> we<00:06:04.100> go<00:06:04.220> out<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.370> top<00:06:04.400> rope

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
as we go out the top rope

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.279 
as we go out the top rope
will<00:06:04.940> we<00:06:05.030> hit<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.210> 5-star<00:06:05.810> no<00:06:06.020> Craig's

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
will we hit the 5-star no Craig's

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:07.540 
will we hit the 5-star no Craig's
getting<00:06:06.590> up<00:06:06.650> again<00:06:06.740> so<00:06:07.070> he<00:06:07.130> does<00:06:07.280> get<00:06:07.430> up

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
getting up again so he does get up

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.529 
getting up again so he does get up
pretty<00:06:07.910> quickly<00:06:09.669> but<00:06:10.669> this<00:06:10.940> may<00:06:11.210> be<00:06:11.389> the

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
pretty quickly but this may be the

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:12.969 
pretty quickly but this may be the
opportunity<00:06:11.690> that<00:06:12.110> we<00:06:12.229> need<00:06:12.410> and<00:06:12.650> see<00:06:12.800> there

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
opportunity that we need and see there

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.279 
opportunity that we need and see there
it<00:06:13.039> will<00:06:13.130> hold<00:06:13.340> in<00:06:13.490> my<00:06:13.610> sort<00:06:13.820> of<00:06:13.880> stomach

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
it will hold in my sort of stomach

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.270 
it will hold in my sort of stomach

oh there we go a three-count so it is a

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.379 
oh there we go a three-count so it is a
little<00:06:30.770> bit<00:06:30.979> longer<00:06:31.220> than<00:06:31.460> an<00:06:31.610> actual<00:06:32.030> three

little bit longer than an actual three
count<00:06:32.599> I<00:06:32.720> kind<00:06:32.930> of<00:06:33.020> prefer<00:06:33.199> that<00:06:33.530> maybe<00:06:34.370> that's

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
count I kind of prefer that maybe that's

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.619 
count I kind of prefer that maybe that's
something<00:06:34.699> that<00:06:34.909> we<00:06:35.000> should<00:06:35.030> see<00:06:35.330> in<00:06:35.479> more

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:35.629 
something that we should see in more

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:37.450 
something that we should see in more
games<00:06:35.780> because<00:06:36.139> the<00:06:36.319> three<00:06:36.590> second<00:06:36.949> window<00:06:37.189> is

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460

prolonged there and really preferred
that<00:06:41.240> it<00:06:41.300> gives<00:06:41.479> you<00:06:41.569> a<00:06:41.659> bit<00:06:41.870> more<00:06:41.900> time<00:06:42.199> it

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710

kind<00:06:42.949> of<00:06:43.009> makes<00:06:43.280> it<00:06:43.370> a<00:06:43.460> little<00:06:43.490> bit<00:06:43.789> more

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909 
kind of makes it a little bit more

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:45.580 
kind of makes it a little bit more
dramatic<00:06:44.120> as<00:06:44.479> well<00:06:44.629> as<00:06:44.750> a<00:06:44.840> kind<00:06:45.080> of<00:06:45.199> hangs<00:06:45.409> as
