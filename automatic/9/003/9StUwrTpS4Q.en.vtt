guys<00:00:28.619> we've<00:00:29.250> perfected<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.900> grappling<00:00:31.830> hook

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
guys we've perfected the grappling hook

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.459 
guys we've perfected the grappling hook
in<00:00:32.250> Minecraft<00:00:32.940> okay<00:00:33.390> using<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.930> fishing<00:00:34.290> rod

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
in Minecraft okay using the fishing rod

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.540 
in Minecraft okay using the fishing rod
and<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:35.550> will<00:00:36.180> work<00:00:36.480> anywhere<00:00:36.860> at<00:00:37.860> all<00:00:38.250> in

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and this will work anywhere at all in

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.540 
and this will work anywhere at all in
the<00:00:38.670> world<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:39.030> long<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.510> you're<00:00:39.920> fishing<00:00:40.920> as

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the world as long as you're fishing as

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.130 
the world as long as you're fishing as
long<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:41.940> mechanism<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.960> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
long as your mechanism for this is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.310 
long as your mechanism for this is
actually<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:45.000> spawn<00:00:45.300> chunk<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:46.050> in

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
actually in the spawn chunk this in

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.830 
actually in the spawn chunk this in
theory<00:00:46.590> should<00:00:46.800> work<00:00:47.480> anywhere<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> world

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
theory should work anywhere in the world

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.869 
theory should work anywhere in the world
so<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.170> quite<00:00:49.440> far<00:00:49.710> away<00:00:49.829> from<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:50.340> spawn<00:00:50.610> camp

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
so I'm quite far away from my spawn camp

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.880 
so I'm quite far away from my spawn camp
but<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:52.079> actually<00:00:52.350> works

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
but as you can see this actually works

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.450 
but as you can see this actually works
phenomenally<00:00:53.809> now<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:56.010> guys<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.370> not

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
phenomenally now if you guys are not

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.569 
phenomenally now if you guys are not

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
fishing rod is the the grappling hook

who helped me kind of fiddle around with

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.260 
who helped me kind of fiddle around with

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
it and making it work so this is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.980

phenomenal so I'm just going to show you
a<00:01:28.110> couple<00:01:28.320> more<00:01:28.560> times<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.250> throw<00:01:29.790> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
a couple more times so you can throw it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.240 
a couple more times so you can throw it
anywhere<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.570> it'll<00:01:30.960> teleport<00:01:31.920> me<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
anywhere and it'll teleport me to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.190 
anywhere and it'll teleport me to
wherever<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.270> there<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.600> no<00:01:33.930> hidden

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
wherever it is there is no hidden

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.319 
wherever it is there is no hidden
pressure<00:01:34.560> place<00:01:34.860> there's<00:01:35.189> no<00:01:35.430> nothing<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.180> is

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
pressure place there's no nothing it is

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.719 
pressure place there's no nothing it is
it<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.960> use<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> anywhere<00:01:38.100> anywhere

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
it you can use it anywhere anywhere

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210 
it you can use it anywhere anywhere
anywhere<00:01:39.090> anyway<00:01:39.509> okay<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.320> let's<00:01:40.799> go<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
anywhere anyway okay so let's go and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.800 
anywhere anyway okay so let's go and
have<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> look<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.790> how<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.390> works

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
have a look at how it works

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.520 
have a look at how it works
it's<00:01:42.930> actually<00:01:43.530> quite<00:01:44.490> simple<00:01:45.530> it's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it's actually quite simple it's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.789 
it's actually quite simple it's
surprisingly<00:01:47.460> easy<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.420> first<00:01:48.659> off<00:01:48.899> we've<00:01:49.770> got

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
surprisingly easy so first off we've got

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.219 
surprisingly easy so first off we've got
a<00:01:49.979> test<00:01:50.430> for<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.909> okay<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.390> we've<00:01:51.689> got<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.869> test

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
a test for that okay so we've got a test

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.179 
a test for that okay so we've got a test
for<00:01:52.380> at<00:01:52.740> E<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.299> entity<00:01:54.840> name<00:01:55.560> equals

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
for at E which is at entity name equals

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.660 
for at E which is at entity name equals
unknown<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.170> thing<00:01:58.530> Oh<00:01:59.250> whoopsie

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
unknown so that little thing Oh whoopsie

rocket arrows and stuff he used in

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.110 
rocket arrows and stuff he used in
ground<00:02:41.610> :<00:02:42.600> one<00:02:43.050> which<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.530> tests<00:02:44.040> not<00:02:44.610> while<00:02:44.940> is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
ground : one which it tests not while is

ground : one which it tests not while is
in<00:02:45.270> flight<00:02:45.660> it'll<00:02:46.350> test<00:02:46.620> at<00:02:46.860> what<00:02:47.130> when<00:02:47.460> it's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
in flight it'll test at what when it's

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.850 
in flight it'll test at what when it's
actually<00:02:48.120> stuck<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.960> ground<00:02:49.140> if<00:02:49.500> it's

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
actually stuck in the ground if it's

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.800 
actually stuck in the ground if it's
stuck<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.490> ground<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.970> will<00:02:51.600> then

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
stuck in the ground it will then

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.500 
stuck in the ground it will then
activate<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:53.130> it'll<00:02:53.760> it'll<00:02:53.910> then<00:02:54.090> actually

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
activate this it'll it'll then actually

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.870

say yes it does exist it'll then

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.850 
say yes it does exist it'll then
activate<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.510> comparator<00:02:58.110> which<00:02:58.500> will<00:02:58.710> then

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
activate this comparator which will then

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.760 
activate this comparator which will then
just<00:02:59.100> teleport<00:02:59.760> me<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.990> unknown<00:03:01.230> now
