00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
I was listening to this nurse give

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.069 
I was listening to this nurse give
report<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> nurse<00:01:42.210> over<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> phone<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
report to a nurse over the phone and

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.480 
report to a nurse over the phone and
this<00:01:43.470> nurse<00:01:43.680> had<00:01:43.829> been<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> nurse<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.250> about

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
this nurse had been a nurse for about

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.340 
this nurse had been a nurse for about
two<00:01:45.000> years<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.689> her<00:01:45.840> patient<00:01:46.170> had<00:01:46.320> a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
two years and her patient had a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.280 
two years and her patient had a
procedure<00:01:46.740> called<00:01:47.070> fem-pop<00:01:47.310> bypass<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:48.450> she

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
procedure called fem-pop bypass and she

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.050 
procedure called fem-pop bypass and she
was<00:01:49.829> struggling<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.369> give<00:01:50.490> her<00:01:50.579> horn<00:01:50.850> she's

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
was struggling to give her horn she's

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.460 
was struggling to give her horn she's
like<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:51.600> I'm<00:01:51.780> just<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:52.290> familiar

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
like you know what I'm just not familiar

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.260 
like you know what I'm just not familiar
with<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:52.950> procedure<00:01:53.310> she<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.119> just

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
with this procedure she was just

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.859 
with this procedure she was just
laughing<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.750> off<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.229> was<00:01:55.259> no

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
laughing it off like it was no

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.090 
laughing it off like it was no
and<00:01:56.109> I<00:01:56.200> thought<00:01:56.350> it<00:01:56.500> was<00:01:56.560> kind<00:01:56.829> of<00:01:56.859> funny

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
and I thought it was kind of funny

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.649 
and I thought it was kind of funny
because<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.579> all<00:01:57.789> have<00:01:58.000> those<00:01:58.149> moments<00:01:58.420> when

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
because we all have those moments when

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.440 
because we all have those moments when
we<00:01:58.780> don't<00:01:58.990> know<00:01:59.109> exactly<00:01:59.289> what<00:01:59.890> to<00:02:00.039> do<00:02:00.219> or<00:02:00.399> say

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
we don't know exactly what to do or say

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.700 
we don't know exactly what to do or say
and<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.539> surely<00:02:01.780> wasn't<00:02:02.200> thinking<00:02:02.469> that<00:02:02.500> she

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
and I surely wasn't thinking that she

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.980 
and I surely wasn't thinking that she
wasn't<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:03.039> good<00:02:03.219> nurse<00:02:03.490> from<00:02:04.240> time<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.600> time<00:02:04.630> as

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
wasn't a good nurse from time to time as

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.809 
wasn't a good nurse from time to time as
a<00:02:05.020> nurse<00:02:05.200> we<00:02:05.439> all<00:02:05.560> face<00:02:05.859> situations<00:02:06.579> that<00:02:06.700> were

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
a nurse we all face situations that were

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.880 
a nurse we all face situations that were
not<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.179> familiar<00:02:07.299> with<00:02:07.659> as<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.470> nursing

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.070 
not that familiar with as a nursing
student<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.399> felt<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.119> I<00:02:10.149> wasn't<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.660> student

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
student I felt that I wasn't the student

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.960 
student I felt that I wasn't the student
that<00:02:11.230> was<00:02:11.349> on<00:02:11.530> top<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.980> her<00:02:12.069> nursing<00:02:12.489> game<00:02:12.700> I

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
that was on top to her nursing game I

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.000 
that was on top to her nursing game I
was<00:02:13.660> afraid<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.019> mess<00:02:14.319> up<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.680> make<00:02:14.739> myself

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
was afraid to mess up and make myself

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.160 
was afraid to mess up and make myself
look<00:02:15.280> bad<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:16.269> I'll<00:02:16.390> never<00:02:16.569> forget<00:02:16.959> what<00:02:17.140> my
