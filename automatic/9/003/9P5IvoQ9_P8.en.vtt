00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.080 
of ways to deal with that but they're
all<00:01:16.680> kind<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.979> ridiculous<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:17.759> not<00:01:17.939> only

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
all kind of ridiculous but here not only

motorola<00:02:17.629> was<00:02:17.989> pretty<00:02:18.260> vague<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.799> battery

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370

life here as well as compatibility

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.539

because<00:02:21.290> they<00:02:21.560> do<00:02:21.620> claim<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.129> it'll<00:02:22.340> work

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
because they do claim that it'll work

be able to use the multi-touch touchpad

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.059 
be able to use the multi-touch touchpad
here<00:02:46.939> with<00:02:47.359> anything<00:02:47.750> other<00:02:47.930> than<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.560> Motorola

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069

what<00:02:55.549> it<00:02:55.730> brings<00:02:55.939> to<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.239> table<00:02:56.389> very

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
what it brings to the table very

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:57.879 
what it brings to the table very
creative

a<00:02:57.919> smart<00:02:58.549> device<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.659> know<00:02:59.780> fittingly<00:03:00.139> is

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
a smart device and you know fittingly is

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.899 
a smart device and you know fittingly is
called<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.709> smart<00:03:00.889> controller<00:03:01.159> which<00:03:01.669> makes

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
called a smart controller which makes

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.809 
called a smart controller which makes
sense<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:02.530> again<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.560> think<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:04.069> only<00:03:04.370> drawback

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
sense so again I think the only drawback

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.159 
sense so again I think the only drawback
other<00:03:05.090> than<00:03:05.299> what<00:03:05.480> possibly<00:03:05.930> could<00:03:06.079> be

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
other than what possibly could be

other than what possibly could be
battery<00:03:06.500> life<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:06.889> of<00:03:07.010> course<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.459> price

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
battery life is of course the price

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.670 
battery life is of course the price
point<00:03:08.090> a<00:03:08.389> hundred<00:03:08.780> dollars<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.139> pretty<00:03:09.349> steep

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
point a hundred dollars is pretty steep

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.080 
point a hundred dollars is pretty steep
for<00:03:09.889> a<00:03:09.950> device<00:03:10.189> probably<00:03:10.609> would<00:03:10.730> like<00:03:10.819> to<00:03:10.939> see

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
for a device probably would like to see

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.330 
for a device probably would like to see
something<00:03:11.269> like<00:03:11.389> this<00:03:11.629> more<00:03:12.560> around<00:03:12.799> a<00:03:12.980> thirty

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
something like this more around a thirty

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.069 
something like this more around a thirty
dollar<00:03:13.489> price<00:03:13.849> point<00:03:14.150> but<00:03:14.269> again<00:03:14.329> if<00:03:14.720> they

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
dollar price point but again if they

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.599 
dollar price point but again if they
figure<00:03:15.439> if<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.680> can<00:03:15.829> afford<00:03:15.919> all<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.459> other

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
figure if you can afford all the other

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.189 
figure if you can afford all the other
accessories<00:03:17.329> that<00:03:17.359> you've<00:03:17.629> purchased<00:03:17.870> for

this<00:03:18.290> device<00:03:18.879> why<00:03:19.879> would<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.269> stop<00:03:20.540> here<00:03:20.900> I

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
this device why would you stop here I

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.349 
this device why would you stop here I
guess<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.590> there<00:03:21.799> logic<00:03:22.340> after<00:03:23.060> all<00:03:23.239> the

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
guess is there logic after all the

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.159 
guess is there logic after all the
devices<00:03:23.629> are<00:03:24.069> pretty<00:03:25.069> pricey<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:25.879> know<00:03:26.169> hdhd
