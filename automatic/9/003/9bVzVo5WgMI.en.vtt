00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
that shot at you that was a genius idea

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.510

making<00:01:08.110> half<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.470> map<00:01:08.620> unplayable<00:01:09.130> and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
making half the map unplayable and

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.000 
making half the map unplayable and
instead<00:01:10.060> we<00:01:10.240> said<00:01:10.480> it<00:01:10.600> in<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:11.110> river<00:01:11.500> which<00:01:11.860> you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
instead we said it in a river which you

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.290 
instead we said it in a river which you
could<00:01:12.159> slide<00:01:12.430> on<00:01:12.700> but<00:01:12.850> you<00:01:12.940> can't<00:01:13.180> really

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
could slide on but you can't really

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.240 
could slide on but you can't really
slide<00:01:13.659> in<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:13.930> game<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.650> that<00:01:14.920> kind<00:01:15.190> of

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
slide in this game so that kind of

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.830 
slide in this game so that kind of
defeats<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.580> purpose<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.390> next<00:01:16.510> map

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
defeats the purpose of it the next map

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.109 
defeats the purpose of it the next map
is<00:01:17.050> take<00:01:17.260> off<00:01:17.470> which<00:01:17.890> is<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.119> fan-favorite

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
is take off which is a fan-favorite

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.139 
is take off which is a fan-favorite
stadium<00:01:19.689> from<00:01:20.020> black<00:01:20.290> ops<00:01:20.619> except<00:01:21.369> we<00:01:21.850> made<00:01:22.030> it

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
stadium from black ops except we made it

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.940 
stadium from black ops except we made it
look<00:01:22.329> more<00:01:22.630> like<00:01:22.869> launch<00:01:23.229> because<00:01:23.500> apparently

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
look more like launch because apparently

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.920 
look more like launch because apparently
meltdown<00:01:24.430> didn't<00:01:24.909> look<00:01:25.030> enough<00:01:25.329> like<00:01:25.479> launch

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
meltdown didn't look enough like launch

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.770 
meltdown didn't look enough like launch
and<00:01:26.170> then<00:01:26.560> our<00:01:26.680> last<00:01:26.860> one<00:01:27.220> is<00:01:27.280> a<00:01:27.790> copy<00:01:28.390> off<00:01:28.750> of

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
and then our last one is a copy off of

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.469 
and then our last one is a copy off of
courtyard<00:01:29.770> from<00:01:29.979> world<00:01:30.280> at<00:01:30.490> war<00:01:30.700> except<00:01:31.270> we

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
courtyard from world at war except we

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.810 
courtyard from world at war except we
skinned<00:01:31.899> it<00:01:32.049> almost<00:01:32.649> like<00:01:32.979> erosion<00:01:33.640> for

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
skinned it almost like erosion for

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.420 
skinned it almost like erosion for
modern<00:01:34.180> warfare<00:01:34.360> 3<00:01:34.600> so<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.259> looks<00:01:35.439> uglier<00:01:36.189> than

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
modern warfare 3 so it looks uglier than

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.030 
modern warfare 3 so it looks uglier than
Lindsay<00:01:36.820> Lohan<00:01:36.850> after<00:01:37.689> a<00:01:37.719> coke<00:01:38.140> bender<00:01:38.680> we're
