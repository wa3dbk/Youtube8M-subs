00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
about an inch and a half so it just

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.450 
about an inch and a half so it just
depends<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:26.970> how<00:01:27.090> much<00:01:27.240> height<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:28.460> in

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
my particular case and it also depends

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
my particular case and it also depends
on<00:01:32.340> how<00:01:32.430> much<00:01:32.549> space<00:01:32.820> your<00:01:33.540> shoe<00:01:33.750> has<00:01:33.960> inside

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
on how much space your shoe has inside

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.620 
on how much space your shoe has inside

stick this one in on the right side as
you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.110> pretty<00:01:52.290> easy<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.740> like

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you can see it's pretty easy just like

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.990 
you can see it's pretty easy just like
slides<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:55.310> I'm<00:01:56.310> only<00:01:56.490> using<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.850> hand

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
slides right in I'm only using one hand

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.050 
slides right in I'm only using one hand
but<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.079> use<00:01:58.110> both<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.500> your<00:01:58.680> hands

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
but if you use both of your hands

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.300 
but if you use both of your hands
obviously<00:02:00.060> would<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> lot<00:02:00.450> easier

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.030 

maybe<00:02:04.119> going<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.540> one's<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.960> as<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.799> can<00:02:05.920> see

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
maybe going that one's in as you can see

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.710 
maybe going that one's in as you can see
