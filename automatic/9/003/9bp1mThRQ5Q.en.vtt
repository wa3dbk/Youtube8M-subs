00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:11.199
Hi. In this video I'll show
you some simple ways

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.358
to extend the battery life
of your smarthpone.

00:00:15.618 --> 00:00:19.711
Energy saving in smartphones

00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:25.311
Display has the greatest impact on the
energy consumption in smarthpnes.

00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:29.487
Therefore, it is a good idea
to reduce its brightness

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:32.123
and change the screen saver settings.

00:00:32.123 --> 00:00:38.420
Select settings ("Ustawienia")
then display ("Wyświetlacz").

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.947
You can reduce the brightness manually
or use the automatic function,

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:46.680
which adjusts the backlight
to ambient conditions.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:51.328
You may also reduce
the screen saver wait time.

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.556
To do this, select screen saver
("Wygaszacz ekranu")

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:57.799
option in the display
("Wyświetlacz") menu.

00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:01.286
Another way to conserve battery life

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:04.901
is to disable all unused
functions of your phone.

00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:09.512
If you are not using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
at the moment - disable them.

00:01:09.537 --> 00:01:14.510
Select settings ("Ustawienia") and turn off
the options you are not using at the moment.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:20.018
It should be mentioned that if you use
the Internet in your phone often,

00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:23.470
you will save more energy
by using Wi-Fi network

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.925
than by connecting to a mobile network.

00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:29.710
Another element which consumes
a significant amount of battery energy

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.964
is the GPS module
and location services.

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:37.213
Select settings ("Ustawienia"), then
location services ("Usługi lokalizacji")

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:42.438
and turn off the functions
you are not using.

00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:46.028
You can also modify the phone
synchronization settings

00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:48.529
to conserve the battery life.

00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:52.928
Applications for e-mail or social
networking websites

00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:54.624
often download data in the background.

00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:59.208
Reduction of frequency or disabling of
automatic synchronisation

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:01.668
will extend you battery life.

00:02:02.343 --> 00:02:08.253
You can also use dedicated power-saving
modes in phones with Android.

00:02:08.988 --> 00:02:11.423
Select power- save mode
("Tryb oszczędzania") in the settings

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:14.264
and select the options you prefer.

00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:23.221
Remember not to fully discharge the battery
in your smartphone too often,

00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.196
as it reduces its life.

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:29.813
This applies to lithium-ion polymer batteries,
which are most frequently used batteries

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:35.594
