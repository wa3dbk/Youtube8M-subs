00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
Indianapolis as well that's why we have

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.510 
Indianapolis as well that's why we have
a<00:02:09.810> flood<00:02:10.080> watch<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.470> extends<00:02:10.890> from<00:02:10.979> low

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
all the way to Buffalo because of the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.800 
all the way to Buffalo because of the
fact<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.460> have<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:15.000> saturated<00:02:15.600> ground

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
