00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.090
 is called alex cars karlsruher schupps 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:34.290
 enjoy endeavor travel from rollolle 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:38.820
 called mini wildcat test and shows 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:44.129
 you first not beautiful rheinufer that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.309
 whole building I find the montage and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.200
 the calibration is just what 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.350
 you can also see in my work attitude 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.350
 can 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.520
 I will also have the weights too 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.420
 Fasten and find out how to 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.239
 needs to 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.100
 for each camera was not now 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.850
 special problem went relatively 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.619
 fast 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.530
 I have two camera types used 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.799
 once here the five d-mark 2 with two 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:16.020
 different objective and also 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:21.030
 the action cam of only 150 wifi being there 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.360
 was very annoying that there was the funny 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.470
 firm screw not deep enough against 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.290
 I had a failed disc 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.290
 but use good or ok 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.860
 Here you can see I have tried now 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.899
 to work with little weight because 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.170
 the whole system is hard but 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.960
 it takes now for the camera 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:53.479
 including optics already all weights 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:02:02.000
 in my opinion is borderline but 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:04.840
 I have very good test recordings 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.890
 you can now see the same now 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.420
 a little bit oblique, I admit it 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:19.880
 but then I also balanced that out 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:22.120
 and let's try it I find the 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.440
 results are then really useful 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.430
 I have difficulties in the same way 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.840
 picked out that if then right one 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:42.980
 to go sideways slightly the turn 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:45.769
 and I lose just so well invited 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:52.579
 at a dance school he was allowed to join 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:58.180
 Braker film this time with a 12 to 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:03:00.260
 24mm lens fitting to so danced 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:06.079
 before at the first shot I had 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.799
 a 35 fixed focal length on the 5 d yes 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.620
 and now though trying different 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.850
 directions to run 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.430
 upwards downwards forwards 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.889
 behind and I noticed that stop 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.590
 especially for such fast stories 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.859
 like here with the bikers sometimes 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:29.239
 unpredictable in the direction of her camera 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:34.400
 legs move that I with the mini 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:36.590
 stabilizer very nice here you can see 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.180
 also nice circle rides really fun 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.960
 made 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.750
 without a big wobble 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.340
 yes that you are very fast very 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.510
 flexible one comes very far down 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.260
 which I think is great, too 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.260
 ground parks 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.530
 Yes 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.320
 I almost got caught one 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:04.620
 a little timelapse built in and can 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.780
 back and forth you have to look that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.740
 you do not move too fast that is 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.370
 Of course, for the camera now 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.810
 elvis one can also sometimes the camera 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.680
 move vertically 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.419
 the rides are quiet it is relative 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.340
 exhausting because you can not 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.840
 bracket on the arm or something but has it 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.790
 is really we 'll come now 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.510
 you can vary a little bit too 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.850
 with balance again 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.570
 around and two fingers lightly on and one 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.580
 rod holds 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.910
 I also tried it without it 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:45.310
 Let's talk about good things going on 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:47.350
 also quickly quiet now to 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.820
 next part of a test 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.310
 I now have the action cam on 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.520
 insider screwed as I said with a 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.460
 minor chunk okay and he 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.540
 it is now the lowest one 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.710
 weight class so to speak I have one 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.020
 small weights and screw it 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.600
 can 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.200
 when going backwards slowly not quite 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.500
 so easy but i think it 's ok and 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.240
 that is fun 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.250
 I can already see the stamp eiser 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.260
 Tell a friend price performance is bin 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:21.640
 I am ok the processing is great 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.919
 device is in my opinion 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.919
 really fast done so top 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.610
 the
