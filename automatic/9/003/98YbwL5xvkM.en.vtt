for this type of quantitative

experiments and modeling we can develop

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.810 
experiments and modeling we can develop
better<00:04:28.500> understanding<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.190> living<00:04:29.460> systems

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
better understanding of living systems

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.930 
better understanding of living systems
in<00:04:30.060> other<00:04:30.330> contexts<00:04:30.870> from<00:04:31.620> basic<00:04:32.160> science<00:04:32.190> and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
in other contexts from basic science and

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.810 
in other contexts from basic science and
clinical<00:04:33.060> standpoint<00:04:33.950> we<00:04:34.950> have<00:04:35.190> a<00:04:35.430> new

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
clinical standpoint we have a new

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.970 
clinical standpoint we have a new
mechanism<00:04:36.060> of<00:04:36.630> cell<00:04:37.110> migration<00:04:37.320> and

mechanism of cell migration and

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.250 
mechanism of cell migration and
therefore<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:38.970> better<00:04:39.390> understanding<00:04:40.140> of

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
therefore a better understanding of

therefore a better understanding of
