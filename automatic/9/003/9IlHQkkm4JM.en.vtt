00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.319
 good guys and girls in as is 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.600
 it got here and it started to make me 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:11.500
 of 'I do not shit on everything and we're in a 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.509
 new career with subscribers and good 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.209
 in this race the truth is very very 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.160
 cool because you have to climb a wall 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.320
 almost entire vertical 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.320
 we are going to leave here gifts 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 long it 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.460
 very difficult to get up there now if 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.460
 is that we played it before 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:39.030
 yes hello 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.140
 we are going to distribute yes or no they were going and that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.400
 what is saying we have played it without 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.860
 people there the truth that it was very 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.340
 impossible to reach or is wadding fucker is 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.150
 practically impossible already 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.150
 it is impossible 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.829
 imagine going up there without turbo and 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.030
 we have achieved at the beginning but then 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.430
 already 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.430
 come to the opinion they said 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.180
 but there is a moment that can not be 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.950
 but good now it is going to be able 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:14.409
 quietly so let's see if 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.409
 we are very careful 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.920
 do not 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.500
 and a hair of grace 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.700
 and a lot 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.830
 good to living 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.830
 to avoid saving 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.250
 come on, let's try to win 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.650
 We are only three because I do not know 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.920
 let me invite more lethal super dive 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.920
 this 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.350
 it's two laps so we're going to have 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.560
 time to spare to catch the first 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.140
 but he is he and the other goes the limit 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 in the middle 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.090
 but that does not have my name 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.399
 I think that they have collided there that is the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.150
 another not only that was then 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.150
 the reason 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.909
 OK 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.080
 okay, let's go 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.650
 something 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.650
 I played 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.310
 and now it's still going up 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.690
 come let's reappear walk that if not 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.600
 this gives all the pain 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.030
 ok we appear to jump 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.030
 now and pick that point 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.470
 the one that we have not caught perfect perfect 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.420
 the first one is already out of us 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.980
 First we forget because we can not 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.980
 we are going to take it or have it very 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.560
 but then I take it or it's a like 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.480
 that does deserve a fucking like and cojones 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.030
 then the triangle to reappear and what 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.650
 lame falling has to take parachute 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.650
 milestone but it does not bring us could 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.860
 1800 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.570
 well let's see if we can catch 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.570
 in some way if we can give it 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.170
 how are they keeping anything 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.099
 no this was not uncle was that 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.099
 out in all 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.350
 Nadia, we're not going to fuck you guys 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.350
 seems good 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.640
 I see myself very welcome 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.640
 and he's already out there 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.370
 4 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.540
 Ole Ole 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.400
 that is, we will not catch him or stick 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.340
 but this is going to serve for what 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.520
 we can reach you perfect vale 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.380
 perfect 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.250
 to see if the failure or something the rise or 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.960
 something somehow 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.960
 so that perfect this curve 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.380
 I shit on everything I need a millimeter 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.580
 to catch a point 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.580
 come come come come 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.500
 Take shots and when we go let's go let's go 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.610
 for me 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.870
 then you can 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:40.560
 ok let's finish we know well if we're going to 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.620
 to be ahead is that is or is now all 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.800
 or nothing that at 11 4 there to see if you sneak 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.800
 sneak 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.960
 OK 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.170
 and take advantage of all the groups 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.620
 and this jump and do it right 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.580
 perfect perfect perfect 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.600
 it's there it is and it 's because we can catch 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.600
 with other writers the day 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.710

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.200

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.689

 kids and especially having taken it with 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.050
 the triangle uncle be guatafÃ¡n we are going to 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.430
 look at where the subscriber is already if 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.380
 I want to see where it is because I think it's going 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.450
 to arrive and less than two seconds to 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.750
