00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
me the klitschko fight right now

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.580 
me the klitschko fight right now
is<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.619> doable<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:24.570> maybe<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.049> tomorrow<00:01:25.320> but

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
is it doable it's maybe not tomorrow but

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.670 
is it doable it's maybe not tomorrow but
it's<00:01:26.579> doable<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.420> again<00:01:27.719> I<00:01:27.750> don't<00:01:27.899> think<00:01:28.380> it's

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
it's doable but again I don't think it's

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.060 
it's doable but again I don't think it's
fair<00:01:29.100> compensation<00:01:29.520> for<00:01:29.909> him<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
fair compensation for him and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.350 
fair compensation for him and
so<00:01:32.190> will<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> very<00:01:32.610> strong<00:01:32.880> position<00:01:33.030> of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so will be a very strong position of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.440 
so will be a very strong position of
artists<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.530> would<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.800> foolish<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.460> just

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
artists so it would be foolish to just

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.180 
artists so it would be foolish to just
take<00:01:36.600> anything<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:37.110> offer<00:01:37.140> right<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:37.620> when

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
take anything they offer right now when

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.500 
take anything they offer right now when
in<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> few<00:01:38.610> months<00:01:38.729> you'll<00:01:39.150> be<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.300> much

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
in a few months you'll be a much

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.460 
in a few months you'll be a much
stronger<00:01:39.690> position<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> lot<00:01:40.440> more

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
stronger position to get a lot more

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.910 
stronger position to get a lot more
money<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.970> end<00:01:42.260> everything<00:01:43.260> comes<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
money so in the end everything comes to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.770
