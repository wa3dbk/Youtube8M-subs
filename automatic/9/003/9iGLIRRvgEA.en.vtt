00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.689
 to the UN 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.940
 at the risk that the state but binds with so many colors now 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.980
 finally comes v 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.009
 a why it is important to know tree sitting by at GP 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.179
 but BVB is in the end with Mr.'s 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.579
 the whole equipment three suburbs 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:17.960
 if we are so 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.199
 that stands or so value 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.179
 the green 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.470
 there is something to get there 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.210
 Miss Blum 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.689
 Lauener samples 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.779
 through these three drivers 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.320
 more computationally have the possibility on 16 commas 7 millions different 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.310
 To dye 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.300
 Mix this together by women depending on how much I mix 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.970
 Command form off 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.210
 for example 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.250
 Completely red, Vogts praised me 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 and completely green I get her horny head 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.220
 If you pull here 2 50 times 50 0 Kunkel Post believes 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.090
 I switch all formal 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.660
 com note come 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.760
 about these 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.570
 three color values ​​come arithmetically to 16 KUMAS 7 million why can I 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.270
 represent any color 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.540
 the one you're used to the computer is not anymore »Ford 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.850
 Must be brave that has already left me on the nature walk 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.240
 also appropriate 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.240
 especially since the eye world can not stand anymore like these 16 "Gunners" 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.630
 even in the computer world have inaccurate this compilation 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.850
 and these three Aldi BVB 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.260
 Of course it's very common 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.290
 pigeons 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.960
 Witcher December indicated 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.640
 So not in Biograd had medics 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.320
 from 0 to 3 0 5 oct 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.200
 Summer Team Witcher December means 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.039
 we have now with «from beside 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.340
 from 1 to 0 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.750
 but of members 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.280
 is enough at 19 and from zero to 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.680
 what is 4 pm 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.590
 numbers up 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.310
 at the back 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.820
 09 just the same 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.160
 9 is still the same 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.290
 to change the model than ten did not have 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.930
 Witcher added topic 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.410
 Altis b 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.640
 12 to 10 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.470
 13b 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.950
 there are empty and 15 AP and then jumps in principle 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 I have 17 now 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.760
 can sum this up 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.850
 For example, Goal com through the Sixth Gentner numbers has been paid 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.769
 refrain it is about 11 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.189
 No, but do not be put off 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.189
 the typical values ​​Schwarzenstein is all about 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:23.579
 if the last two completely different so say FTF speaks of 5 50 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.859
 then Aldi b will be the 02 05 50 

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:30.469
 and all that is not so wild 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.579
 the reptile three times to understand where are these Ad Pale statements 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.039
 if I'm such an input scene with von Manndecker is Dirk Nier 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.739
 it is probably a heater the carpentry Sal 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.929
 to the representation of the color 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:45.869
 usually has six places 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.869
 in a few cases, ORF had three positions that the SEC did 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.709
 and good 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.530
 Afterwards, you can watch how the colors are cooked 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.519
 piece by piece Fauck theory 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.129
 and so on Collins 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.269
 at the color wheel it's really exciting 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.269
 this subsided during a halt of primary colors 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.279
 Blue Roth 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.479
 these are the questions that did not believe me that really bring 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.139
 are 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.099
 Misik the now together I come to the SEC and the Polish he means yellow 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.629
 and a pool too, I come to green 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.340
 or means yellow a red-green Jews Orange we come to secondary-form 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.789
 Misik the lead this SEC and the colors 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.889
 Of course, I never get on a yellow rotten even brighter so 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:31.739
 Roth 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.059
 so this circle continues to show 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:37.120
 the exciting in the circle responsible what it has been used 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.180
 Oldersum and is 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.180
 what brings us what brings us spoilage sites 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:46.059
 Quite simply with ability to get haum very fast without a boss 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.809
 that's a point where many people are struggling with how I am now 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:51.960
 somehow believe you 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.600
 get harmonic and I always scare myself to death like the website m 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.359
 Coupe 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.849
 by means of different possibilities the one only by analogue doors 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:03.939
 300 cattle are the purchase price 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.280
 If you ran up the place these pictures were taken very often 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.389
 Similar forms of nature occur here also at the main election 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.069
 I have in tube strings and yellow our right green 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.120
 the hormones school destroyed the analogue command bridge "that I 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.090
 Rip me off for a long time now 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.449
 the other are complementary in shape 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.409
 for example here 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:30.009
 with us also Pierre Jung that green in it that red-green info Crossley lies 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.160
 exactly opposite is the color combination 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.160
 which generates the highest attention 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.190
 whether that's brave on more beautiful it gets something different but also not extreme here 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.190
 Kiprop to the carport witnesses 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.110
 and because it's so nice and quiet 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.069
 next to Dinky spread 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.930
 so if I was as custom 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.270
 practice here and blue 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.449
 and I pro green and yellow I custom build only a few more folds 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.840
 spreads up here at an angle 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.789
 to the same extent 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.789
 So it is not for our reputation »space miracle 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.319
 by this spreading to the same extent 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:11.319
 the pigeons work harmonics 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.669
 left to the colors orange and Robbie Web sometimes come there 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.759
 there's it 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.759
 gradually more and more left 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.059
 there you can see very nice percent samples 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:36.029
 at the left 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:38.180
 FV Mottet com below left 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.310
 why meadows run tool called Cucolo of Nando 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.439
 This is very exciting 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.439
 Mother put it on 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.889
 even I can get in shape very quickly 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.509
 Toni make me sleepless nights 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.739
 Deco Mira formally proposed form clock Andre have already put together 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.870
 can you salo 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.870
 with the baking creek 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.539
 start playing yourself and can do sector here 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:12.380
 Way to the north 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.320
 that with these analogous gates I spread you the angle dispute it for 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.539
 all 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.539
 Round the demand continued to come through and 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.550
 domestic harmonious 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.879
 in no bloody tears i like 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:28.569
 take out the brightness 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:31.569
 Dekker gv vigorously cheerful one raus 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:36.239
 and can there times look what will end up fit the zoned form for 

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:38.389
 the product around a project 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.409
 now of course green nature project percent should be the aviator 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.749
 in the already green are in it 

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:47.520
 I'm gonna do some cinema here Gumbo, you're really idiots 

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:49.279
 to have 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:52.659
 per ton of matchmaking the report then Paulo appeared with four or her 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:53.369
 come 

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:55.610
 what is there just different Mrs. Mohr 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.009
 their psychological effect », of course, in the game 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.399
 Also there's blooming today 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:01.780
 a possibility so 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.830
 often need to come 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.830
 this couleur damages and it increases differently 

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:09.939
 another way to get colors 

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:13.549
 new here and clarified butter ask what wish monochrome complementary 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.199
 Triad so talk to Erwin the spread 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.830
 and then start 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.819
 Storkau Vitesse works here to the right 

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:25.229
 and in the Adam from Trebur 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:27.509
 SEQIS Witcher the ten times values 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:29.379
 which result from it 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:33.240
 The unworthy UN is there to damage in front then stand in concrete exactly that 

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:34.300
 Form displayed 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.790
 Please have a look with him
