00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.250
 So pump the pumping festival something 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.520
 completely new team what we offer 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.449
 first time boy sorry the stage that 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.269
 orders children 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.160
 Of course we offer professional 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.470
 bands such example, and let's 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.989
 but offer next to the whole 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.059
 stage time in the anno stÃ¤nde like for 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.600
 for example, many food stalls from 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.230
 Grill from the front body until summer 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.790
 only 1 to the bread we bind 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.750
 We take care of the youth with a tie 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.640
 train with one of the projects 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.250
 and perform exactly here so it is 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:01.219
 a colorful mixed festival of music 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.620
 and culture afternoon program cockpits 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.990
 The driver is a dance group with 105 children 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.890
 that occurred 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.720
 just there in the evening is then just for 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.130
 concert passed over for young and old 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.869
 always there 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.750
 the music directions for everyone 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.970
 So it's really for Postberg 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.539
 what nice weather is special spirit 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.250
 of course that name alone is this 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.989
 is humpen pumps festival stirs 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.910
 natural animal one remember the people 

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:27.020
 to say that hey what is it? 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.250
 Pump the pump 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.160
 and now he has newspaper articles 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.030
 that is just that 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.770
 collide and the drink goes 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.869
 together with wrestling with the greens 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.970
 So of course we have the wish that 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.000
 everything runs smoothly on the delite network 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.860
 that we from the team that you put everything on 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.690
 3 went about it but actually go out 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.310
 Of course we hope for many 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.369
 people want to celebrate the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.830
 sparingly on the dance the give yes 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.720
 Of course we want to get bigger like everybody else 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.340
 will hope that ministers expand 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.720
 can hope that my success 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.009
 have to come with the event 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.489
 revive next year 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.929
 We can then agree positive 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:05.360
 So the preparation phase is very 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.619
 long lasting since september was too 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.629

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.260
 but those in front of him then stand in total 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.090
 have as a team of good 15 people 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.980
 Volunteer help us with it 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.620
 Help wants to serve and stage helpers 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.620

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.010
