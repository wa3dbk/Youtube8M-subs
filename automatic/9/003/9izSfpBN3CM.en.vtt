so<00:00:07.770> it's<00:00:07.919> been<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> few<00:00:08.280> months<00:00:08.460> since<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
so it's been a few months since the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.259 
so it's been a few months since the
rover<00:00:10.170> sd1<00:00:10.320> was<00:00:10.920> put<00:00:11.130> back<00:00:11.340> onto<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.059> road

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
rover sd1 was put back onto the road

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.570 
rover sd1 was put back onto the road
last<00:00:13.170> video<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.559> saw<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:13.980> when<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.309> took<00:00:14.460> it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
last video you saw is when we took it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.039 
last video you saw is when we took it
down<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.969> Dorset

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
down to Dorset

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.800 
down to Dorset
I<00:00:16.130> don't<00:00:17.130> even<00:00:17.279> had<00:00:17.580> its<00:00:17.699> MOT<00:00:18.150> for<00:00:18.449> about<00:00:18.600> two

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
I don't even had its MOT for about two

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.320 
I don't even had its MOT for about two
weeks<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.470> there's<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.279> bit<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.550> risk<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.090> it

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
weeks so there's a bit of a risk but it

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.599 
weeks so there's a bit of a risk but it
made<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:22.039> good<00:00:23.330> but<00:00:24.330> now<00:00:24.830> it<00:00:25.830> needs<00:00:25.859> more<00:00:26.369> work

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
made it good but now it needs more work

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.000 
made it good but now it needs more work
we've<00:00:27.300> known<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.779> long<00:00:27.900> time<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
we've known for a long time that the the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.070 
we've known for a long time that the the
edge<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.369> leaking<00:00:29.730> oil<00:00:29.910> from<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.480> number<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
edge it is leaking oil from a number of

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.370 
edge it is leaking oil from a number of
places<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.769> we've<00:00:32.610> also<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
places and we've also know that the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.900 
places and we've also know that the
clutch<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.969> needs<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.450> replaced<00:00:37.910> Ryan

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
clutch really needs to be replaced Ryan

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
clutch really needs to be replaced Ryan
also<00:00:39.059> suspects<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.260> camshaft<00:00:40.770> is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
also suspects that the the camshaft is

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.510 
also suspects that the the camshaft is
quite<00:00:41.219> badly<00:00:41.489> worn<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.649> certainly<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
quite badly worn and certainly when I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520 
quite badly worn and certainly when I
was<00:00:44.730> driving<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.210> down<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> Dorset

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
was driving it down to Dorset

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.360 
was driving it down to Dorset
it<00:00:46.800> wasn't<00:00:47.160> exactly<00:00:47.340> fast<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.920> plan<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it wasn't exactly fast so the plan is to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.420 
it wasn't exactly fast so the plan is to
take<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> engine<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:52.010> give<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> bit<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
take the engine out give it a bit of a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.229 
take the engine out give it a bit of a
refurb<00:00:53.910> puts<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.960> better<00:00:55.890> camshaft<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.000> we

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
refurb puts a better camshaft in it we

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.540 
refurb puts a better camshaft in it we
should<00:00:57.480> hopefully<00:00:57.629> give<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.050> some<00:00:58.230> more<00:00:58.320> power

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
should hopefully give it some more power

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.330 
should hopefully give it some more power
we'd<00:00:59.550> also<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.359> compression

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
we'd also like to have the compression

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.700 
we'd also like to have the compression
replace<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.520> clutch<00:01:03.110> generally<00:01:04.110> clean<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
replace the clutch generally clean and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.039 
replace the clutch generally clean and
tidy<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> rust<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.270> nastiness<00:01:06.750> at

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
tidy all of the rust and nastiness at

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.590 
tidy all of the rust and nastiness at
the<00:01:07.140> engine<00:01:07.409> bay<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.210> then<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.390> everything

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
the engine bay and then get everything

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.420 
the engine bay and then get everything
back<00:01:09.840> together<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.350> hopefully<00:01:10.830> we'll<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
back together and hopefully we'll have a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.300 
back together and hopefully we'll have a
car<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.760> drives<00:01:12.210> better<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:13.590> easier<00:01:14.189> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
car that drives better it's easier to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.020 
car that drives better it's easier to
drive<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.409> also<00:01:16.409> has<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> nice<00:01:17.159> clean<00:01:17.520> engine

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
drive and also has a nice clean engine

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.539 
drive and also has a nice clean engine
bay<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.720> no<00:01:18.900> rust

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.819 

so<00:01:23.549> today<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.240> beginning<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.439> lot<00:01:25.649> of

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
so today is the beginning of a lot of

00:01:25.829 --> 00:02:50.729 
so today is the beginning of a lot of
work<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:27.180> engine<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.840> coming<00:01:28.229> out

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:03:02.470 

that's<00:02:51.739> what<00:02:51.890> either<00:02:52.129> and<00:02:52.430> I<00:03:01.360> really<00:03:02.360> don't

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
that's what either and I really don't

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:39.850 
that's what either and I really don't
want<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:29.110> contain<00:03:30.110> some<00:03:30.530> of<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:38.410> had<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.440> slight

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
want to contain some of it had a slight

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.160 
want to contain some of it had a slight
incident<00:03:40.370> would<00:03:40.730> involve<00:03:40.970> its<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.720> coolant

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
incident would involve its and coolant

00:03:42.170 --> 00:04:15.800 
incident would involve its and coolant
that<00:03:42.620> always<00:03:42.950> happens

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.210 

right<00:04:16.810> much<00:04:17.470> progress<00:04:17.739> has<00:04:18.040> been<00:04:18.070> made

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
right much progress has been made

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.920 
right much progress has been made
unfortunately<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:18.940> camera<00:04:19.090> went<00:04:19.390> flat<00:04:19.630> so

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
unfortunately the camera went flat so

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.680 
unfortunately the camera went flat so
you've<00:04:20.320> missed<00:04:20.620> some<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:20.920> it<00:04:21.570> manifolds<00:04:22.570> are

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
you've missed some of it manifolds are

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.180 
you've missed some of it manifolds are
off<00:04:22.810> there<00:04:23.290> are<00:04:23.380> other<00:04:23.590> bits<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:23.830> pieces<00:04:23.980> are

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
off there are other bits and pieces are

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.110 
off there are other bits and pieces are
off<00:04:24.280> alternators<00:04:25.090> off<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.570> after<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.320> lot<00:04:26.800> of

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
off alternators off and after a lot of

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.720 
off alternators off and after a lot of
brute<00:04:28.120> force<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:29.670> crank<00:04:30.670> bolt<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.630> now<00:04:31.870> out<00:04:32.730> so

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
brute force the crank bolt is now out so

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.850 
brute force the crank bolt is now out so
got<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:33.880> few<00:04:33.940> more<00:04:34.150> things<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.510> do<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:35.650> then

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
got a few more things to do and then

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.270 
got a few more things to do and then
ready<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.760> come<00:04:36.910> out<00:04:37.440> we<00:04:38.440> get<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.100> prop

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
ready to come out we get to the prop

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.460 
ready to come out we get to the prop
shaft<00:04:39.310> we<00:04:39.850> need<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.060> take<00:04:40.270> off<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.840> Y<00:04:41.020> section

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
shaft we need to take off the Y section

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.659 
shaft we need to take off the Y section
for<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.710> exhaust<00:04:42.010> because<00:04:42.220> it's<00:04:42.490> hanging

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
for the exhaust because it's hanging

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:59.070 
for the exhaust because it's hanging
down<00:04:42.900> it's<00:04:43.900> going<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.080> be<00:04:44.169> in<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.380> way

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.909 

I<00:04:59.250> managed<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.310> get<00:05:01.229> it's<00:05:02.229> an<00:05:02.349> easy<00:05:02.560> deal<00:05:02.710> box

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
I managed to get it's an easy deal box

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.210 
I managed to get it's an easy deal box
and<00:05:03.550> then<00:05:03.759> the<00:05:03.879> prop<00:05:04.150> shaft<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:05.740> is<00:05:05.860> bolted

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
and then the prop shaft this is bolted

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.330 
and then the prop shaft this is bolted
on<00:05:06.370> here<00:05:06.689> so<00:05:07.689> we<00:05:07.840> need<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.110> disconnect<00:05:08.949> this

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
on here so we need to disconnect this

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.760 
on here so we need to disconnect this
get<00:05:09.550> this<00:05:09.699> off<00:05:09.939> and<00:05:10.300> then<00:05:11.050> all<00:05:11.199> of<00:05:11.259> this<00:05:11.500> lock

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
get this off and then all of this lock

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.219 
get this off and then all of this lock
with<00:05:12.219> the<00:05:12.340> engine<00:05:12.669> can<00:05:13.539> be<00:05:13.569> lifted<00:05:13.810> out<00:05:14.110> of<00:05:14.169> the

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
with the engine can be lifted out of the

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.920 
with the engine can be lifted out of the
car<00:05:14.729> as<00:05:15.729> you<00:05:15.879> can<00:05:16.030> see<00:05:16.180> there's<00:05:16.360> not<00:05:16.479> a<00:05:16.539> lot<00:05:16.659> of

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
car as you can see there's not a lot of

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:41.340 
car as you can see there's not a lot of
space

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.190 

just<00:05:42.350> disconnected<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.100> speedo<00:05:43.760> cable<00:05:44.200> here

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
just disconnected the speedo cable here

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.610 
just disconnected the speedo cable here
is<00:05:45.320> your<00:05:45.560> speedo<00:05:45.950> cable<00:05:46.270> traditionally<00:05:47.270> goes

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
is your speedo cable traditionally goes

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.050 
is your speedo cable traditionally goes
up<00:05:48.620> through<00:05:48.890> there<00:05:49.100> and<00:05:49.310> into<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.580> dashboard

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
up through there and into the dashboard

00:05:50.060 --> 00:06:28.499 
up through there and into the dashboard
so<00:05:50.860> it's<00:05:51.860> nearly<00:05:52.130> ready

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:28.509 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.219 

so<00:06:29.509> after<00:06:29.810> some<00:06:29.990> faffing<00:06:30.500> it<00:06:31.490> is<00:06:31.699> now<00:06:32.169> out<00:06:33.169> of

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
so after some faffing it is now out of

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.890 
so after some faffing it is now out of
the<00:06:33.560> car<00:06:36.039> so<00:06:37.039> now<00:06:37.190> the<00:06:37.280> stripped-down<00:06:38.270> process

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
the car so now the stripped-down process

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.850 
the car so now the stripped-down process
begins<00:06:39.470> and<00:06:40.120> hopefully<00:06:41.120> we<00:06:41.629> can<00:06:41.680> speed<00:06:42.680> it<00:06:42.710> up

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
begins and hopefully we can speed it up

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.210 
begins and hopefully we can speed it up
a<00:06:43.009> bit

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
a bit

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.779 
a bit
and<00:06:43.849> actually<00:06:44.270> other<00:06:44.720> day<00:06:44.949> accelerate<00:06:45.949> which

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
and actually other day accelerate which

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:57.580 
and actually other day accelerate which
would<00:06:47.000> be<00:06:47.120> nice

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.650 

you
