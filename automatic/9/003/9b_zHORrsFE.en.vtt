00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
Bailey's right here this most of this is

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.240 
Bailey's right here this most of this is
I<00:01:35.579> can't<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.180> very<00:01:36.329> well<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.869> but

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
I can't see very well in here but

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.080 
I can't see very well in here but
probably<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.759> want<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
probably because they don't want the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.600 
probably because they don't want the
light<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> destroy<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> cream<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.340> use<00:01:41.460> it

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
light to destroy the cream but we use it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.950 
light to destroy the cream but we use it
mainly<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.939> think<00:01:41.970> that's<00:01:42.299> coffee<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.869> our

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
mainly I think that's coffee it's our

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.359 
mainly I think that's coffee it's our
coffee<00:01:43.229> thing<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.799> when<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.159> coffee

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
coffee thing like when we have coffee

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
coffee thing like when we have coffee
usually<00:01:44.820> at<00:01:44.909> night<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.899> instance

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
usually at night or for instance

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.749 
usually at night or for instance
sometimes<00:01:46.380> before<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.890> record<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.610> just

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
sometimes before we record so we just

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.840 
sometimes before we record so we just
have<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.570> energy<00:01:48.930> then<00:01:49.710> we'll<00:01:49.920> suck

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
have that that energy then we'll suck

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.660 
have that that energy then we'll suck
down<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.060> coffee<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.659> after<00:01:52.490> really<00:01:53.490> any

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
down some coffee or after really any

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.560 
down some coffee or after really any
time<00:01:53.909> we're<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.509> make<00:01:54.600> sure<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:56.390> throw<00:01:57.390> some

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
time we're to make sure you throw some

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.270
