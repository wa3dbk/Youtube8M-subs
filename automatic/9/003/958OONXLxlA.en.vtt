00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.719
 The first thing we are going to do is eliminate 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.629
 the strokes that the photograph does not have 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.710
 an absolute total form 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.170
 simply what we are going to do is 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.180
 try to mitigate some will disappear 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.400
 but most of all the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.189
 main ones the most notable are going to 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.849
 persist we will simply limit ourselves in 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.020
 this case mitigate those to some extent 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.059
 what we are going to do is create a 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.430
 duplicate of this layer we're going to press 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:34.620
 control jota or command jota and let's 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.190
 apply a filter we 're going to go to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.250
 noise filter 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.030
 back hard scratch let's click and 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.450
 let's give it a value that does not create us 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.330
 a major blur 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.120
 let's lower the threshold but if not 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.340
 be tenuous go lightly every year 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.160
 that we have, we see that it does not eliminate 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.230
 scratches but it does attenuate them maybe 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.180
 it's too marked 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.150
 we lose too much focus we are going to 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.920
 reduce the intensity even though 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.920
 Now let's apply it in a way 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.500
 selective but in spite of it we are going to 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.090
 give it a little more radio 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.050
 that way we could have it more or less 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.120
 optimal for what we are looking for 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.340
 let's click on ok let's create 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.410
 a mask and we're going to return the mask 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.630
 black that is to say we are going to annul the vision 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.940
 of this layer we are going to press control and 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.490
 we could also invest lobby to 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.900
 often obviate mask panel and now 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.500
 what we are going to do is take a brush 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.600
 white let's press x to put the 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.630
 white as front color let's take 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.740
 a soft brush and the size will depend 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.299
 of the area that we are going to work 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.979
 let's zoom in and what we're going to 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.680
 to do is to go precisely looking for all 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.530
 those areas that if scratched are going to 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.490
 catch a little bigger and we can 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.490
 allow us an opacity of one hundred 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 one hundred to work more quickly 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.010
 and in this particular we do not have the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.780
 need to go step by step since 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.240
 actually if we paint an area that does not 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.760
 we want to paint we do not have more than 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.430
 change the front color to the background color 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.780
 pressing x and we will repair the done thing 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.370
 punctually maybe we can 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.409
 it is interesting to lower the opacity 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.260
 but usually we will go painting 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.420
 directly where there are scratches from 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.310
 way that we are going to obviously save the 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.829
 face to the eyes even though you have 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.659
 some scratch we will not touch them are 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.629
 important areas where we should not 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.860
 lose focus let's go for both 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.500
 painting only 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.170
 in areas that are not transcendent my 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.790
 nose mouth to eyes if we can do it 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.980
 calmly and without fear by the helmet 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.220
 For the hair 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.590
 the more selective the better 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.950
 the less we paint if we are doing 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.950
 click on each of the flaws 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.950
 best 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.520
 if we can lose our eyebrows any 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.760
 apple measure whenever it's something 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.070
 punctual and that does not imply losing focus in 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.760
 the eye is no problem we would paint 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.760
 also around here 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.340
 releasing the mask and therefore 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.650
 allowing the vision of this layer that 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.090
 is to which we have applied the filter 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.950
 scrapes we would be retouching 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.090
 way that we are softening attenuating 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.040
 the damages 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.050
 that had the picture that as we are going 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.050
 watching are countless 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.850
 we would proceed in this way and 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.540
 we would continue doing it for the rest of 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.490
 the photograph until we have 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.190
 applied released the layer in all 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.430
 areas where we have seen some kind of 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.290
 scratch some kind of flaw if 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.700
 press jump and click on the 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.069
 mask 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.720
 we can see what we have painted 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.180
 in white what are the areas where 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.310
 we have painted precisely and therefore 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.349
 what area of ​​the photograph of the layer of 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.569
 up is visible the one that is not 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.819
 obviously it allows us to see the one below 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.580
 we click again on the day we click on 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.050
 new we can also press uppercase 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.230
 and click to see the before and the 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.230
 after 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.400
 if we zoom, we will notice more 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.220
 acted 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.970
 this layer eliminating those flaws 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.040
 that we had out there 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.450
 and we finish with the photography following 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.450
 exactly the same procedure
