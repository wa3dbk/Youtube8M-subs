00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
up so let's just assume that you've got

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.140 
up so let's just assume that you've got
the<00:01:09.720> chords<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.140> front<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:12.000> know

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the chords in front of you and you know

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.609 
the chords in front of you and you know
the<00:01:12.270> melody<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.869> time<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.049> solar<00:01:13.380> what

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the melody and it's time to solar what

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.840 
the melody and it's time to solar what
are<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.430> here's<00:01:14.640> what<00:01:14.820> I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
are you going to do so here's what I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.060 
are you going to do so here's what I
suggest<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.840> take<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> S<00:01:16.380> shape<00:01:16.650> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
suggest we just take the S shape and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.090 
suggest we just take the S shape and
there's<00:01:18.030> MLD<00:01:18.509> there<00:01:19.140> RPG<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.770> those<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.040> our

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
there's MLD there RPG of those are our

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.649 
there's MLD there RPG of those are our
melody<00:01:20.369> notes<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.820> use<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.360> melodic<00:01:22.259> rhythm

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659
