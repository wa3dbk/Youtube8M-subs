then we have a live slippery switch is a
pink<00:02:24.120> one<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.480> all<00:02:24.780> these<00:02:24.900> lip<00:02:25.200> liners<00:02:25.560> that

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
go hand in hand with the lipsticks and

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.850 
go hand in hand with the lipsticks and
then<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.960> baby<00:02:31.140> pink<00:02:31.410> one<00:02:31.620> and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
then this is like the baby pink one and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.030 
then this is like the baby pink one and
again<00:02:32.460> this<00:02:32.880> one<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.210> called<00:02:33.750> lives<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.770> breeze

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
again this one is called lives a breeze

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.480 
again this one is called lives a breeze

lipsticks but I only got three of them

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.790 
lipsticks but I only got three of them
because<00:02:44.790> there<00:02:45.390> was<00:02:45.540> one<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.840> was<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.020> really

actually wearing it on my lips today and
it<00:03:46.110> looks<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.380> little<00:03:46.500> brighter<00:03:46.740> because<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.400> do

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
it looks a little brighter because I do

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.020
