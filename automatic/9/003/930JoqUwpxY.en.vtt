00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
that when this is an application that

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.460 
that when this is an application that
runs<00:01:31.610> on<00:01:31.880> your<00:01:32.060> electronic<00:01:32.750> device<00:01:33.080> and<00:01:33.380> is

runs on your electronic device and is

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.370

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
nothing like real paper but I guess

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.200 
nothing like real paper but I guess
Facebook's<00:01:36.860> getting<00:01:37.220> to<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.550> fact<00:01:37.790> that<00:01:37.940> you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
Facebook's getting to the fact that you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.510 
Facebook's getting to the fact that you
can<00:01:38.360> flip<00:01:38.690> through<00:01:38.930> your<00:01:39.140> facebook<00:01:39.590> statuses

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
can flip through your facebook statuses

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.090 
can flip through your facebook statuses
and<00:01:40.610> things<00:01:40.850> now<00:01:41.119> so<00:01:42.020> it's<00:01:42.170> similar<00:01:42.410> to<00:01:42.590> real

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
and things now so it's similar to real

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.620 
and things now so it's similar to real
paper<00:01:43.430> I<00:01:43.580> guess<00:01:43.820> where<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.060> can<00:01:44.180> flip<00:01:44.450> through

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630

it<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:44.960> shuffle<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.159> paper<00:01:46.450> but<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:47.570> app

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
it and shuffle the paper but this app

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.050 
it and shuffle the paper but this app
definitely<00:01:48.260> reminds<00:01:48.680> me<00:01:48.830> a<00:01:48.860> lot<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.370> the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
definitely reminds me a lot of the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.820 
definitely reminds me a lot of the
application<00:01:50.659> Flipboard<00:01:51.260> if<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.560> haven't

application Flipboard if you haven't
heard<00:01:52.010> of<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.159> basically<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.880> combines<00:01:53.240> your

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450
