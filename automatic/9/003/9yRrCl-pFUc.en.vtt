the<00:00:54.090> reason<00:00:54.449> why<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> bought<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> lens<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the reason why I bought this lens and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.569 
the reason why I bought this lens and
right<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.989> stock<00:00:58.440> lens<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.399> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
right now I have the stock lens on it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.660 
right now I have the stock lens on it
and<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.270> zoomed<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.530> way<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.100> it's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and it's zoomed all the way out and it's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.090 
and it's zoomed all the way out and it's
placed<00:01:03.030> about<00:01:03.359> ten<00:01:03.719> feet<00:01:03.960> away<00:01:04.110> from<00:01:04.260> me<00:01:04.500> so

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
placed about ten feet away from me so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.410 
placed about ten feet away from me so
that's<00:01:05.339> pretty<00:01:05.640> much<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.970> reason<00:01:06.090> why<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that's pretty much the reason why I

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.120 
that's pretty much the reason why I
didn't<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.260> stock<00:01:07.470> lenses<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:07.950> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
didn't like the stock lenses because it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.320 
didn't like the stock lenses because it
pretty<00:01:08.280> much<00:01:08.369> zooms<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.970> without<00:01:09.270> even

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
pretty much zooms in without even

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.289 
pretty much zooms in without even
zooming<00:01:10.130> another<00:01:11.130> reason<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.850> course<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
zooming another reason is of course I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.350 
zooming another reason is of course I
wanted<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.810> wider<00:01:13.170> angle<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.979> my<00:01:14.100> videos<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
wanted a wider angle for my videos the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.120 
wanted a wider angle for my videos the
things<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.930> about<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.380> wide-angle<00:01:16.950> lens

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
things I like about this wide-angle lens

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.630 
things I like about this wide-angle lens
is<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.939> first<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:20.040> matches<00:01:20.490> my

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
is that first of all it matches my

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.929 
is that first of all it matches my
camcorder<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.450> silver<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.409> my<00:01:22.590> camcorder

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
camcorder it's silver so as my camcorder

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.429 
camcorder it's silver so as my camcorder
matches<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> looks<00:01:24.270> great<00:01:24.540> another<00:01:25.080> thing<00:01:25.350> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
matches it looks great another thing I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.440 
matches it looks great another thing I
like<00:01:25.650> about<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.130> lens<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.150> does<00:01:27.299> not

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
like about this lens is that it does not

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.020 
like about this lens is that it does not
show<00:01:27.750> any<00:01:28.229> black<00:01:28.530> edges<00:01:28.950> around<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.520> video

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
show any black edges around the video

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
show any black edges around the video
frame<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.780> third<00:01:31.079> thing<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:31.710> this

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
frame the third thing I like about this

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.789 
frame the third thing I like about this
is<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.820> there<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.329> no<00:01:33.720> fisheye<00:01:34.290> lens<00:01:34.590> when

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
is that there is no fisheye lens when

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.690 
is that there is no fisheye lens when
you<00:01:34.890> put<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.280> on

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you put this on

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.990 
you put this on
fisheye<00:01:36.540> means<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.100> were<00:01:38.220> looking<00:01:38.610> out

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
fisheye means as if you were looking out

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
fisheye means as if you were looking out
of<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.780> fisheye<00:01:40.170> fish's<00:01:40.890> eye<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
of it fisheye fish's eye it's like a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.749 
of it fisheye fish's eye it's like a
spheric<00:01:42.119> shape<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.930> if<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.770> were<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.159> bring

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
spheric shape and if you were to bring

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.149 
spheric shape and if you were to bring
an<00:01:44.880> image<00:01:45.000> way<00:01:45.540> close<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.680> would<00:01:46.829> distort

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
an image way close up it would distort

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.800 
an image way close up it would distort
the<00:01:47.369> image<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.119> were<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.450> bowl<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the image as if you were in a bowl and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.319 
the image as if you were in a bowl and
the<00:01:49.350> fourth<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> fourth<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.119> final

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the fourth thing in the fourth and final

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.780 
the fourth thing in the fourth and final
thing<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:51.960> about<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.640> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
thing I like about this one is that it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.940 
thing I like about this one is that it
definitely<00:01:54.119> widens<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.380> view<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.799> your

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
definitely widens the view of your

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.429 
definitely widens the view of your
camcorder<00:01:56.479> however<00:01:57.479> there's<00:01:57.810> some<00:01:58.079> things<00:01:58.290> I

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
camcorder however there's some things I

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530 
camcorder however there's some things I
don't<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.770> about<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.969> first<00:02:00.270> thing<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
don't like about this the first thing I

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.209 
don't like about this the first thing I
don't<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.810> about<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.009> fact

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
don't like about this is that the fact

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.219 
don't like about this is that the fact
sometimes<00:02:03.060> when<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.420> zoom<00:02:03.630> up<00:02:03.810> all<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> way

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
sometimes when you zoom up all the way

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.499 
sometimes when you zoom up all the way
on<00:02:04.259> my<00:02:04.619> camcorder<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.399> borders<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.210> picture

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
on my camcorder it borders the picture

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.350 
on my camcorder it borders the picture
or<00:02:06.630> distorts<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.290> however<00:02:08.280> most<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.300> time

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
or distorts it however most of the time

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.010 
or distorts it however most of the time
it<00:02:09.720> will<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.229> that

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
it will not do that

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.260 
it will not do that
the<00:02:11.860> second<00:02:12.280> thing<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.550> do<00:02:12.610> not<00:02:12.880> like<00:02:12.940> about
