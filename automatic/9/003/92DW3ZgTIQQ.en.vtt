00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.980
 yo people yarasky remorque at one again 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.710
 new policy janice here on my channel 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.750
 guest gaming today we are going to play a game 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.099
 tried to pray with the fk and sniper 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.590
 rifle that stands for the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.210
 cruel sighs tested sniper and I have to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.080
 set up the herbal site and the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.060
 so there are built-in ones 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.199
 of course automatically on and I think that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.000
 people this janice 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.260
 I asked what I probably was alone 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.670
 but this marx gets going with the thing 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.990
 he is right now I automatically 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.460
 otherwise you don't have to chose one 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.080
 hook to table will be like that 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.750
 other site is brewers so that is 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.860
 of course a plus and oh my 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.300
 God 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.649
 Wout Jan with you wrote years I know 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.760
 yourself also shut up 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.410
 okay let's try to win the game 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.649
 I do n't have set support yet so I had to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.969
 with special games and this i will know 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.289
 really not if this thing is called morning 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.120
 get him to know what shots have 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.829
 but i think somebody these charles 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.110
 has tested in the comments because he 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.460
 probably this did get marx then 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.780
 Of course we have to find out 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.770
 Come up with what you have to do is suit 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.460
 to win you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.770
 but things don't go that easily either 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.359
 stand up for then as you know am 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.370
 I really just the biggest noobs he 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.489
 also earns but consists of call or 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.560
 duty and I always say everything wrong eh 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.479
 oh my god chose with his three by it 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.590
 channel one by one or so okay 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.290
 you can rest of it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.720
 zoom in ok let's go we have to go 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.189
 pay attention man I never play very much 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.450
 the only job of make with a sniper 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.430
 always playing city search engines line 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.409
 machines and the esl doubts and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.990
 play with the sniper yes sometimes I like it 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.119
 nice to do but usually play 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.790
 with a normal what the fuck normal 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.110
 weapon and I think also fun to 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.340
 but we just go to the fort 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.200
 you naturally try to win 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.820
 ghetto must holy shit things one more 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.350
 race white morning man I saw a real one 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.490
 this closes megahit marx k because that 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.740
 of course makes a city together 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.150
 you can just choose the year as 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.049
 the kempen 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.860
 because there runs one to the left of the 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.570
 comma 3 2 1 and go oh my god fright 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.470
 norm is also pretty gone here because i'm ate 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.720
 kempen 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.189
 i'm not know wrap around running with 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.560
 the sharpener is the way you go too 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.899
 play a little less fast because you 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.729
 of course just my no number 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.430
 is a machine sony jan de mars live 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.320
 rival so automatically you just go already 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.270
 play quietly than you normally do 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.890
 spoken probably does and that is 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.259
 a little downside to such a sniper that you 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.580
 you stand still with adjusting because 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.040
 if your card wait one with sniper 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.810
 totally a call or duty ghost 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.670
 you really can't do one bag because 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.140
 you of course only one bullet and one 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.609
 amici need the two only you up 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.959
 buy a ticket and have it two 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.700
 little bullets that they need to me 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.650
 but we are now enjoying this one 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.870
 place so just meeting point 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.120
 holy shit a nice detail a mole of holy 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.609
 fuck ok belgian man and i am here too 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.920
 long in one place oh oh shit oh shit oh 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:37.430
 shit he's having to wait for that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.650
 dildo head well he is also up there 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.420
 wait wait circle oh no oh shit man 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.040
 and stupid day because he knew me 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.269
 was at the campsite or at the spans 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.400
 have lighter on and how you are 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.750
 it wants to see it and he just stupid to it 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.370
 waiting for me from that place or none and 0 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.989
 or drink here come here and leave me 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.700
 target point in this I would also mean my 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.989
 rhythm tomek that he comes in two forms 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.359
 hey stop stop stop I must run 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.519
 kills have oh oh oh what i like the thing 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.689
 come on come on 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.549
 that the ri and left of me please 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:03.859
 Go up here and you this is not mo 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.689
 a done to buy high price 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:09.290
 someone else too and what are you doing here no 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.489
 not so kempen size oh shit this mark 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.290
 then i mean it i thought i this 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.239
 time and no get with i fly drive 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.200
 because she has such a size on it but this 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.569
 so is a bit of a drawback to this 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.250
 game 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.510
 even if your sluizer still puts that sniper 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.500
 have such a nice shot one kill his job 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.510
 by 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.010
 can of course those camper snipers 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.419
 people who really are in a corner 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.549
 can really just sit very much 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.810
 people turn that he just one shot 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.370
 one kill remains even though it says 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.049
 presso and I think that is a bit young 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.370
 and I am someone who would not agree 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.799
 We'll just do a round 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.819
 that truck hey man how build and 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.889
 You look green feathers 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.239
 rotten well I just wanted that too 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.889
 you can now place it with the sniper 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.169
 chain bridge wait oh shit 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:49.099
