personally I don't categorize boy makeup
and<00:00:32.040> girl<00:00:32.189> makeup<00:00:32.369> because<00:00:32.820> unless<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.750> says

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
and girl makeup because unless it says

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.860 
and girl makeup because unless it says
makeup<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.620> women<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.180> I'd<00:00:36.180> only<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.660> makeup

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
makeup for women and I'd only see makeup

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
makeup for women and I'd only see makeup
as<00:00:37.079> being<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.440> feminine<00:00:37.890> product<00:00:38.070> I'm<00:00:38.640> sure

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
as being a feminine product I'm sure

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.369 
as being a feminine product I'm sure
some<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.210> them<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.480> say<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.079> I'm<00:00:40.350> sure

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
some of them do say that but I'm sure

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.139 
some of them do say that but I'm sure
they<00:00:40.950> don't<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.219> any<00:00:41.370> makeup<00:00:41.579> products<00:00:42.030> I'd

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
they don't have any makeup products I'd

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209 
they don't have any makeup products I'd
say<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.540> Bend<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.800> mean

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
say for Bend so it's not like I mean

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.459 
say for Bend so it's not like I mean
just<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:45.030> wearing<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.450> doesn't<00:00:46.379> mean

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
just because I'm wearing it doesn't mean

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.959 
just because I'm wearing it doesn't mean
it's<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.829> boy<00:00:46.980> style<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:47.820> sure

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
it's just a boy style because I'm sure

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.459 
it's just a boy style because I'm sure
plenty<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.329> girls<00:00:48.600> were<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:48.989> way<00:00:49.200> it's

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
plenty of girls were it this way it's

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.220 
plenty of girls were it this way it's
like<00:00:49.590> saying<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> girl<00:00:50.399> did<00:00:50.610> tutorial<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
like saying like a girl did tutorial and

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
like saying like a girl did tutorial and
calling<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:53.039> girl<00:00:53.309> makeup<00:00:53.520> tutorial

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
calling it this a girl makeup tutorial

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
calling it this a girl makeup tutorial
because<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.870> makeup<00:00:55.230> that's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
because it's not as just makeup that's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.260 
because it's not as just makeup that's
not<00:00:55.559> girl<00:00:56.100> boy<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.120> it's

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
not girl boy it's not like that it's

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.660 
not girl boy it's not like that it's
just<00:00:57.410> whatever<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.620> feel<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:58.770> wearing<00:00:59.039> this

just whatever you feel like wearing this
is<00:00:59.879> my<00:01:00.199> interpretation<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.289> boy<00:01:01.710> makeup<00:01:02.070> it's

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
Ledo Green Day I'm trying to like people

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.570 
Ledo Green Day I'm trying to like people
who<00:01:07.049> look<00:01:07.260> more<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.369> basically

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
who look more like and it's basically

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.600 
who look more like and it's basically
just<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:08.850> dark<00:01:09.420> eyes<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.070> basically<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
just like dark eyes and basically it the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.910 
just like dark eyes and basically it the
only<00:01:11.700> thing<00:01:11.909> different<00:01:12.330> for<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> guy<00:01:13.409> makeup<00:01:13.799> I

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
only thing different for a guy makeup I

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.530 
only thing different for a guy makeup I
think<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.640> doesn't<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:14.909> passed<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
think is that it doesn't we passed the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.940 
think is that it doesn't we passed the
crease<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.470> kind<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> stays

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
crease all really it just kind of stays

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.770 
crease all really it just kind of stays
down<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.060> only<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.299> until<00:01:18.689> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
down here and you only see until the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.870 
down here and you only see until the
other<00:01:18.900> eyes<00:01:19.049> closed<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.740> um<00:01:19.920> most<00:01:20.670> guys<00:01:20.820> just

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
too much and then bringing dad's a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.670 
too much and then bringing dad's a
little<00:03:24.569> laughs<00:03:24.810> onto<00:03:25.080> just<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.530> outer

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
little laughs onto just in the outer

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.699 
little laughs onto just in the outer
corner<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.989> then<00:03:27.989> I'll<00:03:28.110> take<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.410> deeper

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
corner and then I'll take this deeper

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.699 
corner and then I'll take this deeper
dark<00:03:29.250> brown<00:03:29.940> right<00:03:30.150> here<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:31.260> it's<00:03:31.410> gonna<00:03:31.500> go

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
dark brown right here and it's gonna go

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.180 
dark brown right here and it's gonna go
over<00:03:31.830> it

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
over it

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.750 
over it
to<00:03:32.430> add<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.670> little<00:03:32.790> bit<00:03:32.880> more<00:03:32.970> depth<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:37.760> and

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
to add a little bit more depth to it and

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.009 
to add a little bit more depth to it and
the<00:03:38.880> reason<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.180> Browns<00:03:39.390> first<00:03:39.690> make<00:03:39.989> it

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
the reason the Browns first make it

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.449 
the reason the Browns first make it
easier<00:03:40.349> to<00:03:40.380> blend<00:03:40.590> outward<00:03:40.980> so<00:03:41.130> it's<00:03:41.220> not<00:03:41.280> like

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
easier to blend outward so it's not like

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.850 
easier to blend outward so it's not like
just<00:03:41.580> black<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.450> then<00:03:43.080> be<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.200> lot<00:03:43.440> more<00:03:43.530> warm

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
just black and then be a lot more warm

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.509 
just black and then be a lot more warm
or<00:03:44.010> two<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:44.430> will<00:03:44.549> be<00:03:44.700> so<00:03:44.880> um<00:03:45.319> stark<00:03:46.370> now<00:03:47.370> let's

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
or two and will be so um stark now let's

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.759 
or two and will be so um stark now let's
take<00:03:47.670> just<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.269> minor<00:03:49.049> brush<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.500> i'm<00:03:49.590> take
