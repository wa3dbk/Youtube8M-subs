00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
trellis over top some plants like beans

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.460 
trellis over top some plants like beans
and<00:01:39.060> peas<00:01:39.329> will<00:01:39.570> naturally<00:01:39.750> cling<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
and peas will naturally cling to the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.380 
and peas will naturally cling to the
trellis<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.700> those<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.970> don't<00:01:42.150> I'll

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
trellis but for those that don't I'll

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.910 
trellis but for those that don't I'll
weave<00:01:42.630> them<00:01:42.810> through<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> grid<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:43.680> grow

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
weave them through the grid as they grow

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
weave them through the grid as they grow
this<00:01:44.700> will<00:01:44.850> provide<00:01:45.090> enough<00:01:45.360> support<00:01:45.479> for

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
this will provide enough support for

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.630 
this will provide enough support for
most<00:01:46.049> plants<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.009> large<00:01:47.250> fruiting<00:01:47.610> plants

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
most plants the large fruiting plants

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.760 
most plants the large fruiting plants
like<00:01:48.030> pumpkins<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.659> watermelons<00:01:49.200> may<00:01:49.619> need

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
like pumpkins and watermelons may need

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.980 
like pumpkins and watermelons may need
additional<00:01:49.950> support<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:51.420> case<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.750> often

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
additional support in this case I often

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.649 
additional support in this case I often
use<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> harness<00:01:52.649> made<00:01:53.009> from<00:01:53.159> an<00:01:53.250> old<00:01:53.399> t-shirt

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
use a harness made from an old t-shirt

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.910 
use a harness made from an old t-shirt
wrap<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> harness<00:01:55.049> around<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.530> fruit<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
wrap the harness around the fruit and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
wrap the harness around the fruit and
then<00:01:56.219> tie<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> frame<00:01:57.079> well<00:01:58.079> that's<00:01:58.229> all

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
then tie it to the frame well that's all

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.870 
then tie it to the frame well that's all
