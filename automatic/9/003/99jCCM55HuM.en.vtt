00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
that feel to contrast having them on and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.250 
that feel to contrast having them on and
off

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.380 

I<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.770> find<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.490> lot<00:01:11.970> further<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:14.180> lot<00:01:15.180> less

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
I can find out a lot further a lot less

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.810 
I can find out a lot further a lot less
effort<00:01:15.590> okay<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.920> that's<00:01:17.160> what<00:01:17.310> we're<00:01:17.490> looking

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
effort okay so that's what we're looking

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
effort okay so that's what we're looking
for<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.120> to<00:01:18.210> build<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.540> muscle<00:01:18.720> strength<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
for is to build that muscle strength and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.340 
for is to build that muscle strength and
hip<00:01:19.530> strain<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.400> stride<00:01:20.760> out<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.300> then<00:01:21.990> you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
hip strain to stride out and then you

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.160 
hip strain to stride out and then you
know<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.890> some<00:01:23.040> drive<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.640> ball<00:01:23.880> okay<00:01:24.870> all
