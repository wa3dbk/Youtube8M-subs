today's<00:00:01.680> video<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.159> on<00:00:02.190> exponential<00:00:02.939> notation

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040 
today's video is on exponential notation

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.990 
today's video is on exponential notation
exponential<00:00:05.040> notation<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.580> also<00:00:05.819> known<00:00:05.970> as

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
exponential notation is also known as

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.690 
exponential notation is also known as
the<00:00:06.150> power<00:00:06.390> this<00:00:07.230> would<00:00:07.440> be<00:00:07.529> an<00:00:07.589> example<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.280> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
the power this would be an example of a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.680 
the power this would be an example of a
power<00:00:09.500> three<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.160> fourth<00:00:11.490> power<00:00:11.759> now<00:00:12.660> you

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
power three to the fourth power now you

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.089 
power three to the fourth power now you
have<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.049> understand<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.590> when<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.799> have<00:00:13.830> an

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
have to understand that when you have an

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:14.780 
have to understand that when you have an
exponent

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
exponent

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.180

you've<00:00:14.910> got<00:00:15.120> your<00:00:15.500> exponential<00:00:16.500> notation<00:00:16.710> you

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
you've got your exponential notation you

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.250 
you've got your exponential notation you
have<00:00:17.369> your<00:00:17.670> base<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:19.609> you<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.640> your

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
have your base and you have your

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.450

exponent<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.900> whole<00:00:25.050> thing<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.680> called<00:00:26.400> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
exponent and the whole thing is called a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.200 
exponent and the whole thing is called a
power<00:00:26.900> so<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:27.960> might<00:00:28.289> write<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.210> big

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210

if<00:01:16.549> given<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.700> variable<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.810> still<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.560> same

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
if given a variable it's still the same

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.590 
if given a variable it's still the same
number<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.790> know<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> value<00:01:21.570> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
number you just don't know the value of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.530 
number you just don't know the value of
the<00:01:21.780> number<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.770> variable<00:01:23.670> X<00:01:24.030> would<00:01:24.509> be

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the number so this variable X would be

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.499 
the number so this variable X would be
my<00:01:24.810> base<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.439> because<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.700> has<00:01:26.939> been<00:01:27.150> repeated

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
my base and because it has been repeated

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.410 
my base and because it has been repeated
five<00:01:27.960> times<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.159> exponent<00:01:29.640> would<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.210> 5

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
five times the exponent would be a 5

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
five times the exponent would be a 5
we're<00:01:33.420> asking<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.960> find<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> value<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
we're asking to find the value of the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
we're asking to find the value of the
power<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.119> helpful<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.840> write<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
power it is helpful to write it in the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.510 
power it is helpful to write it in the
expanded<00:01:38.100> form

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
expanded form

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.510 
expanded form
so<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.060> expo<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.990> power<00:01:40.290> five<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so this expo this power five to the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.080 
so this expo this power five to the
fourth<00:01:41.759> power<00:01:42.119> could<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:42.990> written<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.500> 5<00:01:44.310> times

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
fourth power could be written as 5 times

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.969 
fourth power could be written as 5 times
5<00:01:45.509> times<00:01:46.350> 5<00:01:46.740> times<00:01:47.490> 5<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.780> when<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.170> break<00:01:49.740> it

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
5 times 5 times 5 now when you break it

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.999 
5 times 5 times 5 now when you break it
down<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.490> find<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> value<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.409> could<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.710> 5

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
down to find the value you could do 5

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.090 
down to find the value you could do 5
times<00:01:53.340> 5<00:01:53.549> which<00:01:54.000> equals<00:01:54.030> 25<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.619> multiply

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
times 5 which equals 25 then multiply

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.450 
times 5 which equals 25 then multiply
that<00:01:56.310> by<00:01:56.369> 5<00:01:56.880> which<00:01:57.390> equals<00:01:57.649> 125<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.040> then

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that by 5 which equals 125 and then

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.520 
that by 5 which equals 125 and then
multiply<00:01:59.880> that<00:01:59.909> by<00:02:00.119> 5<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.049> final

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
multiply that by 5 to get the final

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.030 
multiply that by 5 to get the final
value<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:02.210> 625<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.899> 5<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.500> fourth<00:02:04.799> power

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
value of 625 so 5 to the fourth power

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.619 
value of 625 so 5 to the fourth power
equals<00:02:06.170> 625<00:02:07.849> another<00:02:08.849> way<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.330> do<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.599> same

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
equals 625 another way to do the same

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.020 
equals 625 another way to do the same
value<00:02:10.349> again

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
value again

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.530 
value again
writing<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:11.900> expanded<00:02:12.530> form<00:02:12.560> is<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:14.060> can<00:02:14.270> use

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
writing in expanded form is you can use

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.900 
writing in expanded form is you can use

answer of 625 so our in the room there
that<00:02:43.070> is<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.220> 625<00:02:44.000> down<00:02:44.270> there<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:45.739> last<00:02:45.950> thing

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
that is a 625 down there the last thing

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.520 
that is a 625 down there the last thing
you<00:02:46.310> want<00:02:46.459> to<00:02:46.520> be<00:02:46.640> aware<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:46.940> is<00:02:47.300> when<00:02:48.260> writing

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
you want to be aware of is when writing

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.170 
you want to be aware of is when writing
the<00:02:48.770> expenditure<00:02:49.250> form<00:02:49.520> they're<00:02:49.700> all<00:02:49.850> known

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
the expenditure form they're all known

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.440 
the expenditure form they're all known
as<00:02:50.390> perfect<00:02:50.959> squares<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:51.709> if<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.850> are<00:02:53.090> kind<00:02:53.330> of

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
as perfect squares so if you are kind of

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.850 
as perfect squares so if you are kind of
doing<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.720> reverse<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.200> looks<00:02:54.350> like<00:02:54.470> under

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
doing the reverse it looks like under

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.180 
doing the reverse it looks like under
squaring<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.340> number<00:02:56.110> 1<00:02:57.110> times<00:02:57.470> 1<00:02:57.800> equals<00:03:00.190> 1/2

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
squaring a number 1 times 1 equals 1/2

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.370 
squaring a number 1 times 1 equals 1/2
times<00:03:01.459> 2<00:03:01.880> equals<00:03:02.120> 4<00:03:03.070> 3<00:03:04.070> times<00:03:04.310> 3<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.760> 9<00:03:04.850> all<00:03:05.750> of

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
times 2 equals 4 3 times 3 is 9 all of

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.590 
times 2 equals 4 3 times 3 is 9 all of
these<00:03:06.500> numbers<00:03:06.739> are<00:03:07.280> known<00:03:08.060> as<00:03:08.209> perfect

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
these numbers are known as perfect

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.000 
these numbers are known as perfect
squares<00:03:09.880> because<00:03:10.880> they<00:03:11.360> are<00:03:11.420> an<00:03:11.510> answer<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.920> an

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
squares because they are an answer to an

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.560 
squares because they are an answer to an
exponent<00:03:15.220> are<00:03:16.220> there<00:03:16.820> an<00:03:16.880> answer<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.269> a<00:03:17.299> power

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
exponent are there an answer to a power

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.880 
exponent are there an answer to a power
that<00:03:18.410> has<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.330> exponent<00:03:20.330> of<00:03:20.390> 2<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:21.260> for<00:03:21.470> example

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
that has a exponent of 2 so for example

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.990 
that has a exponent of 2 so for example
1<00:03:22.580> squared<00:03:23.030> 2<00:03:23.690> squared<00:03:23.830> 3<00:03:24.830> squared<00:03:24.860> all<00:03:25.549> of

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
1 squared 2 squared 3 squared all of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.370 
1 squared 2 squared 3 squared all of
those<00:03:26.150> where<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.450> numbers<00:03:26.690> are<00:03:26.810> highlighted

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
those where the numbers are highlighted

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.370 
those where the numbers are highlighted
so<00:03:27.799> if<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:27.980> asked<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.459> if<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.670> number<00:03:29.030> 80<00:03:29.660> was<00:03:30.350> a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
so if I asked you if the number 80 was a

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.789 
so if I asked you if the number 80 was a
perfect<00:03:30.830> square<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.700> answer<00:03:32.000> would<00:03:32.090> be<00:03:32.150> no

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
perfect square the answer would be no

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.729 
perfect square the answer would be no
because<00:03:33.799> 80<00:03:34.190> you'll<00:03:34.700> see<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.150> not<00:03:36.110> one<00:03:36.709> of

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
because 80 you'll see is not one of

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.170 
because 80 you'll see is not one of
these<00:03:36.890> highlighted<00:03:37.280> numbers<00:03:37.700> now<00:03:37.910> again

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
these highlighted numbers now again

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.890 
these highlighted numbers now again
they're<00:03:38.390> highlighted<00:03:38.900> because<00:03:39.040> 9<00:03:40.040> times<00:03:40.900> 9

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
they're highlighted because 9 times 9

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.500 
they're highlighted because 9 times 9
equals<00:03:42.590> 81<00:03:42.860> there's<00:03:43.670> no<00:03:43.880> number<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.269> can<00:03:44.480> be

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
equals 81 there's no number that can be

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.080 
equals 81 there's no number that can be
multiplied<00:03:44.959> by<00:03:44.989> itself<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:45.709> equal<00:03:46.010> 80<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:46.880> if<00:03:47.000> I

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
multiplied by itself to equal 80 so if I

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.470 
multiplied by itself to equal 80 so if I
asked<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.660> if<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.200> number<00:03:48.370> 144<00:03:49.370> is<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.970> perfect

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
asked you if the number 144 is a perfect

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.710 
asked you if the number 144 is a perfect
square

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
square

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.240 
square
you'd<00:03:51.290> say<00:03:51.500> yes<00:03:51.769> because<00:03:52.690> 144<00:03:53.690> could<00:03:54.049> be

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
you'd say yes because 144 could be

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.170 
you'd say yes because 144 could be
solved<00:03:55.250> by<00:03:55.400> doing<00:03:56.030> 12<00:03:56.420> times<00:03:57.019> 12<00:03:57.380> or<00:03:57.880> 12<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:59.090> the
