00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.619
 hello to all of us to make movies today 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.920
 we are in which to demonstrate the cameras 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.070
 in preview that we have presented to 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.489
 ces of las vegas in January therefore 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.200
 we are talking about x100 s and ix20 are 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.270
 highly anticipated machines both gods 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.120
 amateur photographers and professionals for 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.859
 that integrate many new features among 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.690
 photographic quotes so that 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.260
 bring real advantages in terms of 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.300
 utilization 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.339
 for example the x100 s today complements that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.469
 which is our flower sensor 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.989
 in the buttonhole sensor then moved 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.850
 trans hicks in version 2 then 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.909
 hicks trans because we abandoned 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.050
 the matrix of buyers with a scheme 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.960
 patented by us to go eliminate 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.850
 the die at the root therefore without having to 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.980
 use an optical low pass filter 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.810
 this is having the second version 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.000
 because now we integrate photodiodes 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.549
 that allow you to do that which is 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.710
 phase-contrast focusing 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.930
 so let's have a mass 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.060
 hybrid fire when there is little light below 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.219
 i 3 v the contrast focus e 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.509
 more and more precise over the 3 we can 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.149
 go to phase contrast then one 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.750
 put very fast at the level of one 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.939
 reflex camera 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.140
 here is the x100 knows many others 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.060
 improvements 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.990
 let's say that these photodiodes that 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.640
 allow phase contrast 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.170
 they also allow you to go and do that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.280
 which is the manual image focus 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.799
 broken 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.030
 here this focus goes to remember 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.770
 to resume what was the mass 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.409
 focus on analogue SLRs of the years 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.740
 70 for example therefore any to a 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.439
 further return to features 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.710
 who are the ones who want the 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.220
 professionals then we have the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.729
 movie section that on x100 was in hd 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.220
 now we have a full hd 60 frames 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.200
 progressive we have additional accessories 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.400
 including a stereo microphone 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:24.819
 external that we can connect both the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.430
 x100 s that also other models and we have 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.590
 the winning design we already have 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.260
 tested on the x100e we have seen that 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.170
 it was the top as far as it was concerned 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.880
 usability thanks to yesterday's metal 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.230
 as regards the regulation of the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.819
 diaphragms of the times is the 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.190
 overexposure 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.410
 therefore maximum ease of use goes 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.360
 to support the x100 we say that she 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.239
 600 will remain in the price list for some more 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.060
 month at the price of 1,000 euros to the public 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.110
 and the x100 s will be sold at 1,200 euros a 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.900
 including VAT 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.269
 recommended prices in detail 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.910
 first of all we see the mounted 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.790
 additional stereo microphone by whom 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.560
 he spoke earlier and on the back 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.329
 we have several improvements and true that the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.430
 design has been kept more or less 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.500
 similar though we have a different one 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.420
 arrangement of the keys the ring the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.700
 cross selector is practically a a 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.980
 better ergonomics can be used 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.840
 much more easily 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.910
 we finally have the cus button that 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.600
 we had already seen on the pro 1 and on the e 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.000
 1 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.170
 this allows easy selection 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.930
 of the main functions of the 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.819
 camera without having to enter that 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.519
 which is the classic menu here is the classic 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.519
 menu always exists is full of features 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.170
 but very often the q key from that 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.100
 immediacy of use that serves on the 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.590
 field 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.970
 here we also see how the mass works 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.800
 manual focus expected images of 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.020
 I was talking about earlier 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.150
 the central part of the image is that 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.720
 which is affected by this technology 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.610
 which allows you to go and see ad 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.440
 highlight the focus of the 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.540
 subject 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.800
 by pressing the control dial I can 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.790
 move to focus picking 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.440
 so let's say we have the top of the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.740
 technology with regards to commissioning 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.020
 in focus both on the auto focus thanks to the 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.550
 phase contrast is on the hand to the fire 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.690
 thanks anyway to the expected image e 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.690
 just speaking 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.020
 another very interesting accessory 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.050
 for the extra wide-angle x100 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.080
 here I remember that the machine was born with 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.629
 a fixed optic equivalent to 35 mm f 2 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.729
 of opening that can however turn into 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.580
 28 mm thanks to an additional 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.409
 high-quality wide-angle and that 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.689
 you go to live with precision 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:45.120
 absolute on the camera lens 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:49.169
 just enter the menu and from 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.789
 and go to enable this additional 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.639
 wide angle to go to correct 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.639
 possible vignetting or distortion
