00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
six with its Lmax blade and I cut up

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.099

like 350 cardboard pieces you know
slices<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.770> then<00:00:20.310> tested<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.820> steel<00:00:21.060> because

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
slices and then tested the steel because

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.939 
slices and then tested the steel because
lmax<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> somewhat<00:00:22.140> controversial<00:00:22.590> steel

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
lmax is a somewhat controversial steel

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.570 
lmax is a somewhat controversial steel
and<00:00:23.660> and<00:00:24.660> then<00:00:25.470> did<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> paper<00:00:25.890> cut<00:00:26.099> test<00:00:26.340> here

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
just mist I'm gonna try and do it on the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.529 
just mist I'm gonna try and do it on the
bar<00:01:03.180> top

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
bar top

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359 
bar top
it's<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.780> easy<00:01:04.019> cuz<00:01:04.350> Emily<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.799> said<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it's not easy cuz Emily I said in the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.620 
it's not easy cuz Emily I said in the
original<00:01:05.460> video<00:01:05.940> I'm<00:01:06.080> actually<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.350> about

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
original video I'm actually at about

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.430 
original video I'm actually at about
sternum<00:01:09.630> level<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:10.080> because<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.320> actually

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
sternum level here because I'm actually

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.789 
sternum level here because I'm actually
doing<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.549> bar<00:01:11.729> top<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> self<00:01:12.360> see

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
doing this on the bar top of self see

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.580 
doing this on the bar top of self see
there's<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.009> bar<00:01:14.420> so<00:01:15.420> because<00:01:16.080> I'm<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
there's the bar so because I'm on the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.380 
there's the bar so because I'm on the
bar<00:01:16.740> top<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.159> literally<00:01:17.610> at<00:01:17.729> sternum<00:01:18.060> level

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
bar top it's literally at sternum level

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.510 
bar top it's literally at sternum level
so<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.440> an<00:01:19.560> optimal<00:01:19.950> angle<00:01:20.070> for

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
so it's really not an optimal angle for

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.149 
so it's really not an optimal angle for
paper<00:01:21.030> cutting<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.930> think<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.890> sharp

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
paper cutting but I think this is sharp

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.770 
paper cutting but I think this is sharp
enough<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.789> think<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> will<00:01:24.390> slice

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
enough now that I think it will slice

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.580 
enough now that I think it will slice
anyway

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
anyway

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.149 
anyway
I<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.930> alright<00:01:29.270> yeah<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.720> uh<00:01:31.130> it<00:01:32.130> is

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
I can do it alright yeah it's uh it is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.910 
I can do it alright yeah it's uh it is
sharp<00:01:32.640> now<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.470> don't<00:01:34.470> think<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.649> need<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> do

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
sharp now I don't think I need to do

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.020 
sharp now I don't think I need to do
more

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
more

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.050
