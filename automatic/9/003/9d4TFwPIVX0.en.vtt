00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
is organisations as organisms and there

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.170 
is organisations as organisms and there
is<00:00:52.739> even<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> reference<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.820> nature

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
is even a reference to nature

chapter<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.040> chapter<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.790> use<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> metaphor

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
chapter in this chapter I use a metaphor

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.289 
chapter in this chapter I use a metaphor
to<00:01:07.020> compare<00:01:07.439> organizations<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.670> organisms

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
to compare organizations to organisms

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.719 
to compare organizations to organisms
both<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.500> depend<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> larger<00:01:11.400> world

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
both can depend on the larger world

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.350 
both can depend on the larger world
around<00:01:12.180> them<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.750> their<00:01:12.900> various<00:01:13.290> needs<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
around them for their various needs and

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.840 
around them for their various needs and
like<00:01:15.360> organisms<00:01:16.490> organizations<00:01:17.490> adapt

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
like organisms organizations adapt

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
like organisms organizations adapt
themselves<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.689> their<00:01:18.840> environment<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.770> order

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
themselves to their environment in order

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.969 
themselves to their environment in order
to<00:01:20.130> survive<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:21.479> only<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.500> based<00:01:22.770> on

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to survive not only that but based on

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.370 
to survive not only that but based on
the<00:01:23.130> structure<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> environment<00:01:24.380> certain

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the structure of the environment certain

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.710 
the structure of the environment certain
types<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.920> organizations<00:01:26.850> tend<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.420> appear

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
types of organizations tend to appear

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.460 
types of organizations tend to appear
and<00:01:27.930> thrive<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:30.210> are<00:01:30.390> saying<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:31.290> an

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and thrive so you are saying like an

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.950 
and thrive so you are saying like an
organism<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:32.700> organization<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.630> placed

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
organism if an organization is placed

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
organism if an organization is placed
within<00:01:34.290> an<00:01:34.650> environment<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:35.939> able<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
within an environment and is not able to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
within an environment and is not able to
adapt<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.720> those<00:01:37.049> conditions<00:01:37.280> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
adapt to those conditions the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.609 
adapt to those conditions the
organization<00:01:39.119> will<00:01:39.270> slowly<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.900> weaker<00:01:39.930> or

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
organization will slowly get weaker or

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.210 
organization will slowly get weaker or
even<00:01:41.070> die

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
even die

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.889 
even die
unfortunately<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.939> exactly<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.689> case

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
unfortunately that is exactly the case

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.429 
unfortunately that is exactly the case
this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.009> only<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.579> organization<00:01:48.049> theory<00:01:49.049> but

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
this is only one organization theory but

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.380 
this is only one organization theory but
it<00:01:49.619> does<00:01:49.770> make<00:01:49.950> sense<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.640> think<00:01:50.670> about<00:01:51.060> it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it does make sense if you think about it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.620 
it does make sense if you think about it
if<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.320> parallel<00:01:52.799> molecules<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.880> individuals

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630

I<00:02:12.990> knew<00:02:13.650> he<00:02:13.890> was<00:02:14.040> crazy<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.810> theory<00:02:15.810> had<00:02:15.990> to

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
I knew he was crazy that theory had to

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.710 
I knew he was crazy that theory had to
do<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:16.410> goals<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:16.890> structure<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:18.330> talked

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
do with goals and structure it talked

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720 
do with goals and structure it talked
about<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.140> efficiency<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.800> organizations

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
about the efficiency of organizations

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.030 
about the efficiency of organizations
but<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.480> theory<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:22.050> are<00:02:22.170> discussing<00:02:22.650> tonight

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
but the theory we are discussing tonight

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.010 
but the theory we are discussing tonight
is<00:02:23.400> completely<00:02:24.060> different<00:02:24.270> isn't<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.670> right

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
is completely different isn't it right

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.780 
is completely different isn't it right
organism<00:02:28.020> theory<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.590> organizations<00:02:29.550> but

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
organism theory of organizations but

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.060 
organism theory of organizations but

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
let's move on could you please explain

let's move on could you please explain
to<00:03:56.010> our<00:03:56.130> audience<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.850> idea<00:03:57.210> of<00:03:57.330> an<00:03:57.480> open

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
to our audience the idea of an open

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.280 
to our audience the idea of an open
systems<00:03:58.290> approach<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:59.180> organization<00:04:00.290> sure

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
systems approach to organization sure

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.920 
systems approach to organization sure
like<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:02.100> said<00:04:02.370> in<00:04:02.490> my<00:04:02.520> book<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.540> idea

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
like I said in my book it's the idea

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.890 
like I said in my book it's the idea
that<00:04:04.070> organizations<00:04:05.070> like<00:04:05.640> organisms<00:04:06.450> are

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
that organizations like organisms are

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.590 
that organizations like organisms are
open<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.860> their<00:04:08.010> environment<00:04:08.790> meaning<00:04:09.360> in

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
open to their environment meaning in

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.150 
open to their environment meaning in
order<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.960> survive<00:04:10.260> they<00:04:10.530> must<00:04:10.560> have<00:04:11.010> an

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
order to survive they must have an

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.980 
order to survive they must have an
appropriate<00:04:11.760> relationship<00:04:12.540> with<00:04:12.810> their

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
appropriate relationship with their

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.670 
appropriate relationship with their
environment<00:04:13.880> so<00:04:15.110> organizations<00:04:16.110> are<00:04:16.380> not

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
environment so organizations are not

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.039 
environment so organizations are not
closed<00:04:17.040> machines<00:04:17.610> like<00:04:18.150> we<00:04:18.390> were<00:04:18.510> told<00:04:18.720> last

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
closed machines like we were told last

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.160 
closed machines like we were told last
week<00:04:19.520> not<00:04:20.520> at<00:04:20.700> all<00:04:20.850> according<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.510> this<00:04:21.630> theory

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
week not at all according to this theory

dr. Morgan we are going to take a quick

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.380 
dr. Morgan we are going to take a quick
break<00:04:24.990> I<00:04:25.500> would<00:04:26.040> like<00:04:26.340> our<00:04:26.460> viewers<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:26.940> take

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
break I would like our viewers to take

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.630 
break I would like our viewers to take
this<00:04:27.540> time<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:27.900> discuss<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.680> implications<00:04:29.430> of

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
this time to discuss the implications of

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.730 
this time to discuss the implications of
the<00:04:29.790> open<00:04:30.030> systems<00:04:30.540> approach<00:04:30.990> as<00:04:31.230> it<00:04:31.410> relates

the open systems approach as it relates

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.920 
the open systems approach as it relates
