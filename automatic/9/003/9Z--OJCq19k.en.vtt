00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 and before starting this video I would like to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.549
 announce what is being recruited 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.429
 moderators would be dedicated to the channel 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.540
 all details in the group 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.550
 Hello dear friends on my 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.410
 channel for a long time did not appear any 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.630
 videos related to command units and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.680
 last appeared about 6 months 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.539
 backwards 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.820
 that is about six months ago the last 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.769
 the video was forgive me for that i 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.930
 looked at the statistics and realized what you 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.980
 really like all sorts of console 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.900
 commands and setting up command blocks so what 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.969
 Yet today we will talk about the effects of 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.890
 by the way here but if you like think 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.610
 what is it to continue this all lessons on 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.620
 command block 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.989
 if for just write in meter type 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.320
 keep shooting i just know what 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.079
 deal and i don't like the latest version then 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.200
 there is maycroft who added a bunch there 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.940
 unnecessary shit I'm shields but so you so 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.590
 personally my opinion can you be anything 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.809
 according to grandson 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.539
 unfortunately not joining joy 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.480
 there have added very cool teams such 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.340
 like a clone with me and some kind of studying there 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.059
 such a cool team helped a lot 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.820
 any cool 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.400
 i.e. adblock there is only even well 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.040
 of course it makes the game easier but I think you 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 it will be useful that is if you are for it 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.790
 so that I shoot in new versions 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.439
 then just write there rented in new 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.100
 versions of something like this 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.580
 but today I am grana version 1 5 2 here's how 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.549
 usually that is all of the standard and of a 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.470
 effect more precisely the effect is obtained such here 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.570
 such a spell that is started 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.079
 enchantment surely every one of you knowing 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.909
 what enchantments have become available 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.340
 some kind of spell on a certain item 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.100
 but unfortunately this is conceived mainly by me 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.960
 maximum level and it is given as if 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.600
 randomly that is, the sword can fall 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.170
 tank heavenly car or force almost 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.240
 on two all sorts of shit but 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.159
 can you do so as you would 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.170
 got definitely spell tey 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.210
 a certain gain like so well 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.149
 let us show some of them then 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.750
 There are only 4 in general, there are a lot of them on the skin 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.369
 link you can then see and by 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.080
 family 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.980
 as can see if i don't choose 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.230
 inventory 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.750
 how to take which I want to enchant 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.870
 just for something the purpose doesn't hold the subject 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.050
 it is not written well what if I take a sword 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.519
 give me the enchantment give 2 then 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.980
 have this maximally frustrating on 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:32.410

 she can see like this 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.910
 far flies from me well in my opinion it is 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.440
 pretty cool as well there she will 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.360
 cast spells off others 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.890
 players in general you will not you 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.900

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.200

 underwater breath three guests were breathing 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.190
 under water efficiency will be faster 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.620
 break the blocks well and fire resistance is less 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:28.390
 I will take fire damage now 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:34.900
