00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.220
 from this photo of a fountain 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.320
 the castles on pernes near carpentras 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.000
 let's start with the young 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.360
 naples of sienna and gray of 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 hardly to make the facades of the 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.720
 fountain 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.260
 in place colors on the surface 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.899
 slightly wet 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.489
 and then we attack the stones while 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.780
 around on the right of the fountain 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.430
 always a little painful gray 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.000
 dead kaputt all mpt 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.440
 and burnt sienna a little bit of 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.440
 ultramarine above 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.680
 I deposit a few grains of salt on the 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.270
 surface before it is too dry 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.340
 to cause some effects and who 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.250
 gives the impression of moss or 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.790
 asperities to stone the others 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.540
 facades are always done with this same 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.860
 mixture of gray color of penalty on the ground 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.250
 of his burned and capua of death all 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.290
 mpt yellow of naples compared to the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.940
 photo I added these two pots of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.720
 flowers to give a little more cheerfulness 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.720
 to all 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.310
 I'm going into the details of 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.310
 outline of the fountain 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.450
 on the left I put a little bit of 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:02.640
 green of v6 with a little yellow for 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.640
 light up and give a little greenery 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.140
 with the tip of the brush I 'm doing 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.140
 bring out some stone outlines 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.700
 to give more realism I 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:39.140
 add on the bottom left some 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.910
 iris for the same principle of adding 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.910
 a little flowering to the whole 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.430
 with the tip of the brush a few 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:47.440
 keys representing small cons 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.440
 cobble stone tower cobblestones 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.390
 and the rest is just finished 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.819
 the subject's interpretation is more 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.819
 important than the realism of the photo 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.430
 a few green keys of two v6 for 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.430
 represent foliage 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.760
 now the watercolor team determined
