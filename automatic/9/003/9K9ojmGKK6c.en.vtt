00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 I'm getting more and more often lately 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.810
 asked how I manage to eat 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.460
 to make it tasty without salt 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.080
 use and I wanted a few now 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.139
 I betray tips over the years 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.480
 collected and you have almost everything 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.890
 in a take home message in one 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.240
 video and I would have me then too 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.430
 very happy if I had that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.470
 First, very important purchases 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.330
 high quality food 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.800
 they do not always have to be organic 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.410
 bio can taste shit 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.869
 I personally always prefer organic taste 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.430
 if I know of course she will 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.930
 are not bombarded with now 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.329
 any pesticides or something like that 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.489
 I have the experience made the 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.620
 less with pesticides and this whole 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.280
 chemical zeugs are loaded the more 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.840
 they taste better too and that is 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.500
 first time ever rule number 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.710
 one high quality food 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.930
 I personally hope that is actually 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.610
 only really rare in the supermarket 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.539
 and just a lot more often 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.460
 weekly markets 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.129
 since you directly to farmers the can 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.110
 you ask what did you do with it like 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.060
 taste the let me try it yes 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.710
 always a great tip and this 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.680
 There are weekly markets in every city 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.570
 Everyone can do it normally 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.350
 human to go there and there 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.270
 shopping 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.850
 That was important, of course 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.590
 how would you eat that and me 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.259
 personally found out that if 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.189
 you have three components in there once 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.159
 once cracked and once it gets 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.630
 Shaaf or something a bit sharper or something 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.000
 just something for yourself 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.970
 then it turns into a round mouth 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.850
 taste and then you even notice 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.439
 not at all the salt is missing what me 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:46.759
 is home by default 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.759
 lemons either sugar juice maple syrup 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.470
 apple sweet yes such sweet things just 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.720
 then maybe a little bit to run 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.640
 if i realize okay thats i have 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.030
 no sweet component in it so take 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.440
 I just from the outside through something like that 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.090
 freshly painted black pepper 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.790
 I, for example, always have it in my house 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.830
 I have a whole bunch of dried ones 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.660
 herbs and for example caraway or 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.800
 paprika rose sharp I have in last 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.800
 time very often used 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.410
 if you use those things the 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.239
 dried then you do the am 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.190
 best right at the beginning of pure 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.019
 so that you can develop your aroma 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.030
 if you have fresh things for example like dill 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.830
 or parsley or chive then 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.410
 preferably only in the last five 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.540
 give in minutes because otherwise the aroma 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.200
 the same thing is just overcooked 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.200
 the lemon
