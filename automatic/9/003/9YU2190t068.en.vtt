00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.760 
own time but um I've been seeing
something<00:05:04.449> a<00:05:04.630> little<00:05:04.960> bit<00:05:05.139> weird<00:05:05.350> it<00:05:05.560> seems

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
something a little bit weird it seems

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.740 
something a little bit weird it seems
like<00:05:05.979> this<00:05:06.580> story<00:05:06.940> is<00:05:07.150> different<00:05:07.540> from<00:05:07.600> the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
like this story is different from the

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.560 
like this story is different from the
first<00:05:07.780> game<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.380> first<00:05:08.530> got<00:05:08.830> here<00:05:08.979> too<00:05:09.280> I

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
first game the first got here too I

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.540 
first game the first got here too I
think<00:05:10.570> that's<00:05:10.720> how<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:10.930> is<00:05:11.050> with<00:05:11.220> burst<00:05:12.220> the

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
think that's how it is with burst the

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.550 
think that's how it is with burst the
normal<00:05:12.910> got<00:05:13.090> here<00:05:13.240> and<00:05:13.720> then<00:05:13.840> got<00:05:14.169> eater<00:05:14.380> burst

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
normal got here and then got eater burst

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.830 
normal got here and then got eater burst
but<00:05:14.919> um<00:05:15.090> hopefully<00:05:16.090> that's<00:05:16.449> not<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.690> case

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
but um hopefully that's not the case

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.909 
but um hopefully that's not the case
because<00:05:16.990> I<00:05:17.169> don't<00:05:17.290> want<00:05:17.320> to<00:05:17.470> miss<00:05:17.590> out<00:05:17.770> on

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919
