the plastic river trolls and this is how

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.200 
the plastic river trolls and this is how
I<00:00:22.289> painted<00:00:22.619> them<00:00:22.710> up<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:23.010> show<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.760> steps

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
I painted them up to show you the steps

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
I painted them up to show you the steps
I<00:00:24.420> took<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.779> get<00:00:24.869> there

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230

so<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.890> kind<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.430> took<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.789> bit<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.210> diversion

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so I kind of took a bit of a diversion

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
so I kind of took a bit of a diversion
and<00:00:27.900> couldn't<00:00:28.769> make<00:00:28.859> my<00:00:29.039> mind<00:00:29.250> originally<00:00:29.670> so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and couldn't make my mind originally so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.970 
and couldn't make my mind originally so
I<00:00:29.849> spray-painted<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.449> black<00:00:30.710> then<00:00:31.710> spray

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980

painted<00:00:32.279> them<00:00:32.340> green<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.930> then<00:00:33.930> gave<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
painted them green and then gave them a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.889 
painted them green and then gave them a
coat<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.770> NAR<00:00:35.370> LOC<00:00:35.579> green<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.149> normal<00:00:36.510> green<00:00:36.719> is

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
coat of NAR LOC green so normal green is

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
coat of NAR LOC green so normal green is
the<00:00:37.050> starting<00:00:37.649> color<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.160> although<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.879> took

this muddy olive triad okay for the bone
areas<00:01:09.270> are<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.600> using<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.930> edge

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
areas are going to be using this edge

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.270 
areas are going to be using this edge
bone<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:12.030> stone<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.930> just<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.860> triad

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
bone and the stone is just this triad

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.969 
bone and the stone is just this triad
here<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.909> put<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> base<00:01:15.930> coat<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.380> give<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
up so that's this for screen triad that

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.780 
up so that's this for screen triad that
moss-green<00:01:37.710> triad<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.250> actually<00:01:38.640> these

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
moss-green triad was actually these

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.399 
moss-green triad was actually these
hairs<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.360> forgot<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> mention<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.229> before

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
hairs I forgot to mention that before

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.700 
hairs I forgot to mention that before
and<00:01:41.630> slowly<00:01:42.630> building<00:01:43.200> everything<00:01:43.439> up

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and slowly building everything up

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.450 
and slowly building everything up
towards<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> edges<00:01:44.549> these<00:01:45.740> pieces<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:47.189> of

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
towards the edges these pieces here of

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.520 
towards the edges these pieces here of
the<00:01:47.790> seaweed<00:01:48.240> or<00:01:48.540> vines<00:01:48.990> whatever<00:01:49.380> there

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the seaweed or vines whatever there

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.330 
the seaweed or vines whatever there
that's<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.920> leaf<00:01:50.159> green<00:01:50.399> triad<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
that's that leaf green triad and

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.440 
that's that leaf green triad and
building<00:01:53.340> these<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:53.970> towards<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.360> edges

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
building these up here towards the edges

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.450 
building these up here towards the edges
so<00:01:54.720> that's<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.140> base<00:01:55.439> coat<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> bottom

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
so that's the base coat in the bottom

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.670 
so that's the base coat in the bottom
and<00:01:56.640> then<00:01:57.270> building<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> main<00:01:57.960> surface<00:01:58.200> area

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and then building the main surface area

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.620 
and then building the main surface area
and<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.950> marine<00:01:59.189> teal<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.240> edges<00:02:00.540> are

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and the marine teal and the edges are

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.950 
and the marine teal and the edges are
just<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.990> serve<00:02:01.170> aqua<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.630> see<00:02:03.780> that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
just the serve aqua and you can see that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.330 
just the serve aqua and you can see that
they're<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.200> sort<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.619> building<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.189> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
they're just sort of building just the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.719 
they're just sort of building just the
sharp<00:02:05.610> edges<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.509> highest<00:02:07.049> highlight<00:02:07.729> any

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
sharp edges on the highest highlight any

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.219 
sharp edges on the highest highlight any
of<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.000> wood<00:02:09.330> areas<00:02:09.690> they're<00:02:09.899> just<00:02:10.110> getting

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
of the wood areas they're just getting
