let's<00:00:08.680> gather<00:00:09.010> round<00:00:09.640> the<00:00:09.910> classroom<00:00:10.570> and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
let's gather round the classroom and

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.890 
let's gather round the classroom and
sing<00:00:11.320> our<00:00:11.530> bio<00:00:11.800> song<00:00:12.430> will<00:00:13.120> show<00:00:13.360> you<00:00:13.420> that

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
sing our bio song will show you that

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.830 
sing our bio song will show you that
science<00:00:14.410> can<00:00:14.620> be<00:00:14.650> fun<00:00:14.800> when<00:00:15.130> go<00:00:15.760> to<00:00:15.820> song<00:00:16.420> and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
science can be fun when go to song and

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.960 
science can be fun when go to song and
if<00:00:17.200> you<00:00:17.440> don't<00:00:17.710> think<00:00:17.980> you'll<00:00:18.190> know<00:00:18.430> this<00:00:18.670> for

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
if you don't think you'll know this for

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.970 
if you don't think you'll know this for
the<00:00:19.180> next<00:00:19.420> exam<00:00:19.900> you'll<00:00:20.200> rock<00:00:20.440> because

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
the next exam you'll rock because

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.050 
the next exam you'll rock because
mitosis<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.970> meiosis<00:00:22.210> are<00:00:22.960> easy<00:00:23.500> too

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
mitosis and meiosis are easy too

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.939 
mitosis and meiosis are easy too
mitosis<00:00:25.539> is<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.289> division<00:00:26.890> of<00:00:27.429> the<00:00:27.699> nucleus

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
mitosis is the division of the nucleus

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.349 
mitosis is the division of the nucleus
products<00:00:29.949> are<00:00:30.099> two<00:00:30.339> daughter<00:00:30.640> cells<00:00:30.849> just

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
products are two daughter cells just

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.960 
products are two daughter cells just
like<00:00:31.509> the<00:00:31.900> parents<00:00:32.439> of<00:00:32.650> which<00:00:33.220> are<00:00:33.490> diploid

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
like the parents of which are diploid

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.940 
like the parents of which are diploid
meaning<00:00:34.030> they<00:00:34.750> both<00:00:35.020> have<00:00:35.260> two<00:00:35.470> sets<00:00:35.800> of

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
meaning they both have two sets of

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.850 
meaning they both have two sets of
chromosomes<00:00:36.520> and<00:00:37.030> this<00:00:37.600> process<00:00:37.870> only<00:00:38.620> has

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
chromosomes and this process only has

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.590 
chromosomes and this process only has
four<00:00:39.160> total<00:00:39.640> steps<00:00:39.910> which<00:00:40.510> are<00:00:40.780> Coffee<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:42.550> for
