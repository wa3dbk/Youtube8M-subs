00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
when you shoot the primary firing mode

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.680 
when you shoot the primary firing mode
it's<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.679> single<00:00:32.070> bullet<00:00:32.189> very<00:00:32.640> fast<00:00:33.380> fire<00:00:34.380> rate

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
it's a single bullet very fast fire rate

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.590 
it's a single bullet very fast fire rate
and<00:00:36.860> takes<00:00:37.860> about<00:00:38.040> two<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> three<00:00:39.090> seconds<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and takes about two to three seconds to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.350 
and takes about two to three seconds to
reload<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:41.129> alternate<00:00:41.790> firing<00:00:42.180> mode

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360

reload and the alternate firing mode
like<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.379> said<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.950> shotgun<00:00:44.809> very<00:00:45.809> good<00:00:46.079> for

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
like I said it's a shotgun very good for

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.139 
like I said it's a shotgun very good for
a<00:00:46.350> closed<00:00:46.590> range<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.430> what<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.820> want<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> do

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
a closed range so what do you want to do

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.299 
a closed range so what do you want to do
usually<00:00:48.570> when<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.809> use<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.110> weapon<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
usually when I use this weapon I want to

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.619 
usually when I use this weapon I want to
shoot<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.149> deer<00:00:51.270> lens<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:53.539> assault<00:00:54.539> rifle

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
shoot a deer lens with the assault rifle

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.799 
shoot a deer lens with the assault rifle
mode<00:00:55.579> and<00:00:56.579> once<00:00:56.820> they're<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> ground<00:00:57.570> I

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
mode and once they're on the ground I

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.380 
mode and once they're on the ground I
can<00:00:58.260> come<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.800> close<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.219> them<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.820> finish

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
can come up close to them and finish

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.889 
can come up close to them and finish
them<00:01:00.570> off<00:01:00.690> with<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.230> shotgun<00:01:01.680> or<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.899> get

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
them off with the shotgun or just get

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.820 
them off with the shotgun or just get
close<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.320> them<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.500> thump<00:01:05.129> their<00:01:05.280> face<00:01:05.689> so

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
close to them and thump their face so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.820 
close to them and thump their face so
very<00:01:07.830> good<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.400> close<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.990> mid-range<00:01:09.990> weapon

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
very good for close to mid-range weapon

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.240 
very good for close to mid-range weapon
so<00:01:11.960> that's<00:01:12.960> pretty<00:01:13.500> much<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
so that's pretty much it for the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.050 
so that's pretty much it for the
evangelizer<00:01:15.020> next<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.060> negotiator

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
evangelizer next we have the negotiator

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.929 
evangelizer next we have the negotiator
so<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.080> weapon<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> bit<00:01:20.009> more<00:01:20.220> tricky<00:01:20.490> very

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
so this weapon is a bit more tricky very

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.679 
so this weapon is a bit more tricky very
bad<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> close<00:01:22.500> range<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.070> my<00:01:23.189> opinion<00:01:23.689> but

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
bad for a close range in my opinion but

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.410 
bad for a close range in my opinion but
I<00:01:25.500> know<00:01:26.130> my<00:01:26.369> girlfriend<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.180> this

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
I know my girlfriend really like this

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.480 
I know my girlfriend really like this
one<00:01:27.570> because<00:01:27.720> she<00:01:28.110> always<00:01:28.500> stays<00:01:28.920> behind<00:01:29.159> me

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
one because she always stays behind me

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.569 
one because she always stays behind me
and<00:01:30.079> she<00:01:31.079> has<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> time<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> charge<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and she has the time to charge the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.310 
and she has the time to charge the
weapon<00:01:32.700> which<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.270> required

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
weapon which is required

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.859 
weapon which is required
the<00:01:34.619> primary<00:01:35.189> firing<00:01:35.520> mode<00:01:35.729> requires<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.840> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the primary firing mode requires you to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.370 
the primary firing mode requires you to
charge<00:01:37.439> for<00:01:37.770> 2<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.220> 3<00:01:38.250> seconds<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.390> order<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
charge for 2 to 3 seconds in order to

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.520 
charge for 2 to 3 seconds in order to
fire<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.520> does<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> lot<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.030> damage<00:01:42.530> but

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
fire it but it does a lot of damage but

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.149 
fire it but it does a lot of damage but
yeah<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.549> cannot<00:01:44.880> shoot<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.659> primary<00:01:46.290> firing

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
yeah you cannot shoot the primary firing

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.730 
yeah you cannot shoot the primary firing
mode<00:01:47.369> without<00:01:47.939> charging<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.619> gonna

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
mode without charging it it's just gonna

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.630 
mode without charging it it's just gonna
like<00:01:50.149> yeah<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.509> true<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.640> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
like yeah and that's true at all and the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.420 
like yeah and that's true at all and the
alternate<00:01:54.329> firing<00:01:55.020> mode<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.799> negotiator

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
alternate firing mode of the negotiator

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.550 
alternate firing mode of the negotiator
is<00:01:56.820> pretty<00:01:57.180> much<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.540> plasma<00:01:58.079> plasma

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
is pretty much like a plasma plasma

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.320 
is pretty much like a plasma plasma
cutter

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.670 

it<00:02:02.220> goes<00:02:03.220> through<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.490> pretty<00:02:03.850> long<00:02:04.120> range<00:02:04.680> but

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
it goes through a pretty long range but

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.820 
it goes through a pretty long range but
the<00:02:06.250> firing<00:02:06.640> rate<00:02:06.790> is<00:02:07.000> very<00:02:07.270> very<00:02:07.800> slow<00:02:08.940> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the firing rate is very very slow and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.760 
the firing rate is very very slow and
reloading<00:02:11.830> speed<00:02:12.190> takes<00:02:12.640> about<00:02:13.440> two<00:02:14.440> or<00:02:14.560> three

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
reloading speed takes about two or three

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.800 
reloading speed takes about two or three
seconds<00:02:15.160> also<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:16.620> yeah<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.980> weapon<00:02:18.630> good<00:02:19.630> if

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
seconds also so yeah this weapon good if

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.880 
seconds also so yeah this weapon good if
you're<00:02:20.520> staying<00:02:21.520> in<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.700> back<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.890> killing

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890
