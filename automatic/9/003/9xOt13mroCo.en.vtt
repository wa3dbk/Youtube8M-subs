00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the mask you want to be careful because

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.880 
the mask you want to be careful because
it<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:19.180> Robert<00:02:19.930> as<00:02:20.049> you<00:02:20.230> can<00:02:20.380> see<00:02:20.560> how<00:02:20.709> it's

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
it is Robert as you can see how it's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.530 
it is Robert as you can see how it's
slotted<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:21.970> that's<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.299> way<00:02:22.420> it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
slotted there and that's the way it

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.750 
slotted there and that's the way it
comes<00:02:22.780> out<00:02:22.930> going<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.950> go<00:02:24.069> ahead<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
comes out going to go ahead on to the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.720 
comes out going to go ahead on to the
other<00:02:24.940> side<00:02:25.680> then<00:02:26.680> these<00:02:26.890> clips<00:02:27.250> can<00:02:27.489> be<00:02:27.549> a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
other side then these clips can be a

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.960 
other side then these clips can be a
little<00:02:28.090> bit<00:02:28.360> tricky<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.840> do<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.280> generally

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
little bit tricky to do but I generally

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.610 
little bit tricky to do but I generally
don't<00:02:31.120> find<00:02:31.450> them<00:02:31.540> too<00:02:31.750> hard<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.230> it's<00:02:32.349> quite

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
don't find them too hard and it's quite

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.890 
don't find them too hard and it's quite
quick<00:02:32.950> look<00:02:33.700> at<00:02:33.819> that<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.390> strap<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:34.780> all

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
quick look at that the strap is all

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.380 
quick look at that the strap is all
revealed<00:02:35.200> next<00:02:35.739> part<00:02:36.130> since<00:02:36.849> we<00:02:36.970> remove<00:02:37.239> those

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
revealed next part since we remove those

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.100 
revealed next part since we remove those
clips<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.530> earpieces<00:02:39.310> can<00:02:39.700> come<00:02:39.910> out<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.599> you

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
clips the earpieces can come out so you

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.610 
clips the earpieces can come out so you
push<00:02:41.410> there<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.239> out<00:02:43.239> they<00:02:43.450> come<00:02:43.660> do<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.500> to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
push there and out they come do that to

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.789 
push there and out they come do that to
both<00:02:44.769> sides<00:02:45.420> pop<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.600> like<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.930> next<00:02:47.680> you

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
both sides pop it like that next you

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.000 
both sides pop it like that next you
push<00:02:48.010> on<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.340> lens<00:02:48.609> on<00:02:49.480> both<00:02:49.690> sides<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.380> it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
push on the lens on both sides and it

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.530 
push on the lens on both sides and it
just<00:02:51.190> comes<00:02:51.400> out<00:02:51.489> like<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.299> have<00:02:52.420> to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
just comes out like that you have to

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.660 
just comes out like that you have to
push<00:02:52.750> inwards<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.290> little<00:02:53.500> bit<00:02:53.650> because<00:02:54.190> it

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
push inwards a little bit because it

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.170 
push inwards a little bit because it
blends<00:02:55.359> and<00:02:55.630> then<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.350> last<00:02:56.530> part<00:02:56.889> is<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.910> foam

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
blends and then the last part is a foam

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.930 
blends and then the last part is a foam
section<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.900> mask<00:02:59.109> so<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.250> take<00:03:00.519> one<00:03:00.910> of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
section of the mask so you take one of

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.390 
section of the mask so you take one of
these<00:03:01.150> things<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.859> were<00:03:03.010> kind<00:03:03.340> of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
these things that you that were kind of

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.610 
these things that you that were kind of

in the year over here and you twist the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.830 
in the year over here and you twist the
log<00:03:05.859> and<00:03:06.160> then<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.060> can<00:03:07.209> see<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.540> arrows

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
log and then you can see the arrows

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.599 
log and then you can see the arrows
there<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:08.200> it's<00:03:08.319> pointing<00:03:08.680> out<00:03:08.859> lock<00:03:09.130> or<00:03:09.400> an

I quickly do this so take your foam
section<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.900> mask<00:03:50.170> put<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.099> inside<00:03:51.220> and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
section of the mask put it inside and

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.140 
section of the mask put it inside and
then<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:53.200> need<00:03:53.349> to<00:03:53.560> make<00:03:54.160> sure<00:03:54.220> that<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.879> lock

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
then you need to make sure that the lock

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.140 
then you need to make sure that the lock
portions<00:03:56.019> match<00:03:56.680> up<00:03:56.980> with<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.370> portions<00:03:57.940> of

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150

portions match up with the portions of
the<00:03:58.810> phone<00:03:59.079> so<00:03:59.860> once<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:00.340> have<00:04:00.489> that<00:04:00.519> in<00:04:00.849> there

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
the phone so once you have that in there

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.470 
the phone so once you have that in there
you<00:04:01.510> can<00:04:01.720> use<00:04:01.900> something<00:04:02.440> like<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:03.760> to

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
you can use something like this to

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.930 
you can use something like this to
change<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:06.849> lock<00:04:07.209> from<00:04:07.950> blog<00:04:08.950> unlocked<00:04:09.519> to

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
change the lock from blog unlocked to

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.130
