00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
going to start I like to kind of keep

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.180 
going to start I like to kind of keep
the<00:00:45.910> patient's<00:00:46.300> mouth<00:00:46.420> slightly<00:00:46.780> open<00:00:47.190> not

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
wide open you're slightly open and what

00:00:50.440 --> 00:01:00.970 
wide open you're slightly open and what
it<00:00:50.559> does<00:00:50.829> I<00:00:51.129> start<00:00:53.250> penetrating<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.609> needle

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.020 

and<00:01:01.340> uniformly<00:01:02.060> injecting<00:01:02.660> I<00:01:03.550> like<00:01:04.550> to<00:01:04.699> inject

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
and uniformly injecting I like to inject

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.290 
and uniformly injecting I like to inject
as<00:01:05.270> I'm<00:01:06.050> entering<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:07.070> push<00:01:07.250> away<00:01:07.430> any<00:01:07.970> small

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
as I'm entering to push away any small

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.440 
as I'm entering to push away any small
blood<00:01:08.510> vessels<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:10.430> decreases<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.150> chance

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
blood vessels that decreases the chance

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.440 
blood vessels that decreases the chance
of<00:01:11.660> bleeding<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.260> bruising<00:01:13.210> it's<00:01:14.210> very

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
of bleeding and bruising it's very

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.150 
of bleeding and bruising it's very
common<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:14.930> bleed<00:01:15.260> and<00:01:15.440> bruise<00:01:15.650> from<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.920> lips

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
common to bleed and bruise from the lips

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.330 
common to bleed and bruise from the lips
are<00:01:16.340> very<00:01:16.520> vascular<00:01:17.260> but<00:01:18.260> doing<00:01:19.160> that

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
are very vascular but doing that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.010 
are very vascular but doing that
technique<00:01:19.729> is<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.870> little<00:01:21.020> nice<00:01:21.380> modification

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
technique is a little nice modification

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.050 
technique is a little nice modification
which<00:01:24.020> actually<00:01:24.500> lessens<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.640> chance<00:01:25.880> of

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
which actually lessens the chance of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.469 
which actually lessens the chance of
bleeding<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.540> bruising<00:01:29.800> so<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:31.479> penetration

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
bleeding and bruising so the penetration

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.870 
bleeding and bruising so the penetration
and<00:01:32.810> filling<00:01:33.259> is<00:01:33.380> from<00:01:33.530> both<00:01:33.650> sides<00:01:33.950> as<00:01:34.220> you

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
and filling is from both sides as you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.910 
and filling is from both sides as you
enter<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.509> as<00:01:35.900> I<00:01:36.020> pull<00:01:36.229> back<00:01:37.090> as<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.270> can<00:01:38.390> see

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
enter and as I pull back as you can see

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.130 
enter and as I pull back as you can see
with<00:01:39.920> her<00:01:40.130> she<00:01:40.910> is<00:01:40.970> a<00:01:41.000> very<00:01:41.180> nice<00:01:41.420> lip<00:01:41.810> roll

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
with her she is a very nice lip roll

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.820 
with her she is a very nice lip roll
which<00:01:42.979> means<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:43.400> really<00:01:43.700> see<00:01:43.910> her<00:01:44.590> red<00:01:45.590> lip

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
which means I really see her red lip

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.040 
which means I really see her red lip
nicely<00:01:46.310> this<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:47.060> partially<00:01:47.660> because<00:01:47.690> we've

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
nicely this is partially because we've

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.140 
nicely this is partially because we've
actually<00:01:48.229> injected<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:48.950> before<00:01:49.250> in<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:50.030> last

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
actually injected it before in the last

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.170 
actually injected it before in the last
few<00:01:50.420> months<00:01:50.540> but<00:01:51.440> with<00:01:51.619> this<00:01:51.800> type<00:01:52.430> of<00:01:52.460> lip<00:01:52.880> I

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
few months but with this type of lip I

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.060 
few months but with this type of lip I
don't<00:01:53.750> need<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:53.990> inject<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.619> Vermilion

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
don't need to inject the Vermilion

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.530 
don't need to inject the Vermilion
border<00:01:55.250> which<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:55.880> border<00:01:56.149> between<00:01:56.300> the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
border which is the border between the

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.870 
border which is the border between the
red<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.869> white<00:01:57.020> if<00:01:57.770> I<00:01:57.920> wanted<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.280> get<00:01:58.490> more<00:01:58.820> of

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
red and white if I wanted to get more of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.580 
red and white if I wanted to get more of
a<00:01:58.970> roll<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.450> would<00:02:00.200> do<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.440> slightly

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
a roll I would do it slightly

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.880 
a roll I would do it slightly
differently<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:03.110> take-home<00:02:03.320> message<00:02:03.770> is

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
differently the take-home message is

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.889 
differently the take-home message is
every<00:02:04.340> lip<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.640> different<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.479> injection

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
every lip is different and the injection

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.999 
every lip is different and the injection
has<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.140> be<00:02:06.259> done<00:02:06.380> differently<00:02:08.710> as<00:02:09.710> I<00:02:09.830> said

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
has to be done differently as I said

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.350 
has to be done differently as I said
before<00:02:10.190> if<00:02:10.460> you<00:02:10.610> fill<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.970> lips<00:02:11.120> like<00:02:11.300> a

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
before if you fill the lips like a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.870 
before if you fill the lips like a
sausage<00:02:11.660> like<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.770> look<00:02:12.950> like<00:02:13.010> sausage<00:02:13.610> links

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
sausage like to look like sausage links

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.350 
sausage like to look like sausage links
any<00:02:14.240> much<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.720> little<00:02:14.930> bit<00:02:15.050> a<00:02:16.240> lot<00:02:17.240> of

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
any much just a little bit a lot of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.470 
any much just a little bit a lot of
times<00:02:17.540> patients<00:02:17.780> will<00:02:18.280> not<00:02:19.280> have<00:02:19.580> sensation

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
times patients will not have sensation

times patients will not have sensation
or<00:02:20.630> control<00:02:20.990> over<00:02:21.020> their<00:02:21.380> lips<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:22.610> they<00:02:22.640> may

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
or control over their lips so they may

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.430 
or control over their lips so they may
think<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> mouth<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.720> open<00:02:23.990> when<00:02:24.290> it's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
think that the mouth is open when it's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:36.309 
think that the mouth is open when it's
not<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:25.100> just<00:02:25.190> have<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.490> gently<00:02:25.730> reminding

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.809 

after<00:02:37.099> I<00:02:37.870> fill<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.989> first<00:02:39.200> round<00:02:39.549> and<00:02:40.549> do<00:02:40.670> two

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
after I fill the first round and do two

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:41.619 
after I fill the first round and do two
things<00:02:41.000> with<00:02:41.180> my<00:02:41.299> hands

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
things with my hands

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.280 
things with my hands
one<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.319> feel<00:02:42.909> how<00:02:43.909> much<00:02:44.120> filler<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.870> have<00:02:45.140> on

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
one is I feel how much filler I have on

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.589 
one is I feel how much filler I have on
each<00:02:45.409> side<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:46.489> tactile<00:02:46.969> sensation

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
each side the tactile sensation

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.449 
each side the tactile sensation
definitely<00:02:47.959> helps<00:02:48.230> making<00:02:49.099> sure<00:02:49.250> the

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
definitely helps making sure the

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.640 
definitely helps making sure the
symmetric<00:02:49.909> fill<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.989> second<00:02:51.349> thing<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.620> does

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
symmetric fill the second thing it does

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.990 
symmetric fill the second thing it does
as<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.700> fill<00:02:52.879> the<00:02:53.000> lips<00:02:54.310> by<00:02:55.310> smoothing<00:02:55.819> it<00:02:55.909> out

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
as you fill the lips by smoothing it out

you don't have any logs for boats and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.309 
you don't have any logs for boats and
articles<00:02:58.060> okay<00:03:00.609> looking<00:03:02.049> we're<00:03:03.049> going<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.260> go

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
articles okay looking we're going to go

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:11.690 
articles okay looking we're going to go
to<00:03:03.379> the<00:03:03.530> bottom<00:03:03.680> lips<00:03:05.469> same<00:03:06.469> thing

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.360 

penetrating<00:03:13.580> filling<00:03:14.580> as<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.819> penetrated

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
penetrating filling as I penetrated

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.860 
penetrating filling as I penetrated
avoiding<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:18.390> labial<00:03:18.840> artery<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:21.540> also

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
avoiding the labial artery and also

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:31.730 
avoiding the labial artery and also
filling<00:03:22.770> as<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:23.040> pullback

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.080 

you<00:03:32.310> can<00:03:32.490> see<00:03:32.810> with<00:03:33.810> her<00:03:34.020> so<00:03:34.530> far<00:03:34.910> we<00:03:35.910> haven't

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
you can see with her so far we haven't

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.580 
you can see with her so far we haven't
encountered<00:03:36.390> any<00:03:36.600> major<00:03:36.870> vessels<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:37.530> she

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
encountered any major vessels so she

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.740 
encountered any major vessels so she
hasn't<00:03:37.800> had<00:03:37.980> any<00:03:38.010> major<00:03:38.340> bleeding<00:03:38.820> which

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
hasn't had any major bleeding which

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.390 
hasn't had any major bleeding which
means<00:03:40.020> she<00:03:40.410> won't<00:03:40.590> really<00:03:40.770> have<00:03:41.010> any<00:03:41.190> major

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
means she won't really have any major

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.330 
means she won't really have any major
bruising<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.930> far

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.729 

we're<00:03:49.910> not<00:03:50.030> quite<00:03:50.209> done<00:03:50.270> yet

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.099 

now<00:03:54.250> Christ<00:03:54.519> moving<00:03:54.909> up<00:03:55.239> I<00:03:55.269> haven't<00:03:55.780> holder

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
now Christ moving up I haven't holder

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.030 
now Christ moving up I haven't holder
look<00:03:56.290> together<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:58.299> take<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.510> step<00:03:59.409> back<00:03:59.680> to

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
look together and take a step back to

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.479 
look together and take a step back to
get<00:04:00.189> a<00:04:00.219> better<00:04:00.400> look<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:02.590> look<00:04:02.739> very<00:04:02.920> symmetric

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
get a better look it look very symmetric

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.500 
get a better look it look very symmetric
I<00:04:05.010> like<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.129> overfill<00:04:06.579> it<00:04:06.609> just<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.150> little<00:04:07.420> bit

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
I like to overfill it just a little bit

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.750 
I like to overfill it just a little bit
because<00:04:07.689> it<00:04:07.959> loses<00:04:08.109> its<00:04:09.099> volume<00:04:11.609> there's<00:04:12.609> two

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
because it loses its volume there's two

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.580 
because it loses its volume there's two
lower<00:04:12.939> areas<00:04:13.389> let<00:04:13.810> me<00:04:13.870> see<00:04:14.079> a<00:04:14.109> slight<00:04:14.409> little

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
lower areas let me see a slight little

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.490 
lower areas let me see a slight little
shadow<00:04:15.389> filling<00:04:16.389> goes<00:04:16.570> up<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.079> you<00:04:17.169> can<00:04:17.350> see

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
shadow filling goes up and you can see

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.830 
shadow filling goes up and you can see
this<00:04:17.739> is<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:17.889> different<00:04:18.190> technique

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
this is a different technique

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.350 
this is a different technique
it's<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.959> perpendicular<00:04:20.620> injection<00:04:24.360> loops

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
it's a perpendicular injection loops

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.170 
it's a perpendicular injection loops
together<00:04:25.509> again

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.210 

her<00:04:29.720> right<00:04:29.960> side<00:04:29.990> is<00:04:30.380> naturally<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:30.860> little<00:04:31.010> bit

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
her right side is naturally a little bit

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.900 
her right side is naturally a little bit
less<00:04:31.370> full<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.820> left<00:04:32.060> side<00:04:33.460> one<00:04:34.460> more<00:04:34.490> this

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
less full to the left side one more this

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.270 
less full to the left side one more this
side<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:38.510> we<00:04:38.690> done<00:04:38.840> with<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.020> lips<00:04:39.200> I<00:04:39.470> took

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
side and we done with the lips I took

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.490 
side and we done with the lips I took
about<00:04:40.430> three<00:04:41.420> quarters<00:04:41.810> of<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:42.020> syringe<00:04:42.320> of

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
about three quarters of a syringe of

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.020 
about three quarters of a syringe of
Jupiter<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:44.200> we<00:04:45.200> had<00:04:45.320> done<00:04:45.560> about<00:04:46.250> a<00:04:46.280> CC<00:04:46.820> just

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
Jupiter and we had done about a CC just

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.580 
Jupiter and we had done about a CC just
a<00:04:47.150> few<00:04:47.330> months<00:04:47.600> ago<00:04:47.690> so<00:04:47.960> this<00:04:48.050> is<00:04:48.200> just<00:04:48.380> adding

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
a few months ago so this is just adding

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.070 
a few months ago so this is just adding
up<00:04:48.740> on<00:04:48.920> top<00:04:49.100> of<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.450> what<00:04:50.450> I<00:04:50.510> like<00:04:50.660> to<00:04:50.780> do<00:04:50.870> next

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
up on top of that what I like to do next

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.800 
up on top of that what I like to do next
is<00:04:51.620> I<00:04:52.040> have<00:04:52.310> this<00:04:52.460> extra<00:04:52.820> Jupiter<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.720> you

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
is I have this extra Jupiter and you

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.410 
is I have this extra Jupiter and you
definitely<00:04:54.020> don't<00:04:54.350> want<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.590> waste<00:04:54.800> it<00:04:54.980> so<00:04:55.420> we

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
definitely don't want to waste it so we

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.210 
definitely don't want to waste it so we
have<00:04:56.690> injected<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.350> nasal<00:04:57.530> labial<00:04:57.650> folds<00:04:58.130> in

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
have injected the nasal labial folds in

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.070 
have injected the nasal labial folds in
the<00:04:58.250> past<00:04:58.490> for<00:04:58.730> her<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.630> we're<00:04:59.810> going<00:04:59.930> to<00:04:59.960> do

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
the past for her and we're going to do

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.540 
the past for her and we're going to do
the<00:05:00.200> same<00:05:00.380> thing<00:05:00.620> here<00:05:00.890> with<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.280> remainder

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
the same thing here with the remainder

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.460 
the same thing here with the remainder
of<00:05:01.700> this<00:05:01.850> is<00:05:02.030> a<00:05:02.180> fantastic<00:05:02.540> injection<00:05:03.260> for

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
of this is a fantastic injection for

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.230 
of this is a fantastic injection for
that<00:05:03.620> purpose<00:05:06.550> I'm<00:05:07.550> going<00:05:07.760> to<00:05:07.820> do<00:05:07.910> is<00:05:08.000> take<00:05:08.150> a

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
that purpose I'm going to do is take a

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.650 
that purpose I'm going to do is take a
little<00:05:08.330> alcohol<00:05:08.750> way<00:05:10.210> against<00:05:11.210> her<00:05:11.300> lightest

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
little alcohol way against her lightest

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.790

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
what I did is I changed the needle to a

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.140 
what I did is I changed the needle to a
fresh<00:05:36.810> needle<00:05:37.020> it's<00:05:37.919> sharp<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.550> it<00:05:38.699> also<00:05:38.849> it

on<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.940> what<00:05:42.060> I<00:05:42.090> do<00:05:42.740> is<00:05:43.740> I<00:05:43.979> again<00:05:44.280> have<00:05:45.150> it

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
on it and what I do is I again have it

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.960 
on it and what I do is I again have it
play<00:05:45.449> it<00:05:45.509> straight<00:05:45.810> in<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:47.610> eyes

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
play it straight in to the eyes

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.029 
play it straight in to the eyes
nasolabial<00:05:48.690> fold<00:05:49.370> and<00:05:50.720> this<00:05:51.720> technique<00:05:52.229> was

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
nasolabial fold and this technique was

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.969 
nasolabial fold and this technique was
different<00:05:55.250> than<00:05:56.250> the<00:05:56.310> filling<00:05:56.849> technique<00:05:57.979> of

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
different than the filling technique of

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.580 
different than the filling technique of
this<00:05:59.220> method<00:05:59.639> and<00:06:00.479> I<00:06:01.020> use<00:06:01.229> both<00:06:03.590> basically

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
this method and I use both basically

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:14.240 
this method and I use both basically
push<00:06:04.860> up<00:06:05.069> and<00:06:05.849> volumize<00:06:07.129> the<00:06:08.129> tissue<00:06:13.129> do<00:06:14.129> the

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
push up and volumize the tissue do the

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:23.000 
push up and volumize the tissue do the
same<00:06:14.490> thing<00:06:14.699> on<00:06:14.849> the<00:06:14.969> side

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.510 

she<00:06:23.580> doesn't<00:06:23.910> get<00:06:24.000> it<00:06:24.120> lower<00:06:24.270> down<00:06:25.460> after<00:06:26.460> I

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
she doesn't get it lower down after I

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:34.510 
she doesn't get it lower down after I
injected<00:06:27.000> and<00:06:27.540> massage<00:06:27.900> you<00:06:28.110> smooth<00:06:28.350> it<00:06:28.380> out

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.760 

as<00:06:35.300> I<00:06:35.449> feel<00:06:35.720> it<00:06:35.750> right<00:06:36.020> now<00:06:36.050> there's

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
as I feel it right now there's

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.550 
as I feel it right now there's
absolutely<00:06:36.949> no<00:06:37.400> lumpy<00:06:37.849> bumpy's<00:06:38.410> and<00:06:39.410> that's

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
absolutely no lumpy bumpy's and that's

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.520 
absolutely no lumpy bumpy's and that's
the<00:06:39.740> beauty<00:06:39.979> of<00:06:40.039> Jupiter<00:06:40.660> so<00:06:41.660> that<00:06:42.289> concludes

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
the beauty of Jupiter so that concludes

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.309 
the beauty of Jupiter so that concludes
the<00:06:42.889> injection<00:06:43.400> of<00:06:43.490> Juvederm<00:06:44.210> Ultra<00:06:44.330> to<00:06:45.199> the

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 
the injection of Juvederm Ultra to the

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.800 
the injection of Juvederm Ultra to the
lips<00:06:45.590> and<00:06:45.830> the<00:06:46.220> nasal<00:06:46.490> labial<00:06:46.819> folds<00:06:47.090> it's<00:06:47.720> a

little bit of point bleeding will not

little bit of point bleeding will not
bruise<00:06:50.599> it's<00:06:51.020> very<00:06:51.289> minor<00:06:51.590> and<00:06:52.840> essentially

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
bruise it's very minor and essentially

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.529 
bruise it's very minor and essentially
holding<00:06:54.259> pressure<00:06:54.470> for<00:06:55.009> about<00:06:55.129> just<00:06:55.550> two

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:56.539 
holding pressure for about just two

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:58.300 
holding pressure for about just two
minutes<00:06:56.690> tops<00:06:57.050> that<00:06:57.379> I'll<00:06:57.680> have<00:06:57.889> people<00:06:58.069> miss

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
minutes tops that I'll have people miss

minutes tops that I'll have people miss
drink<00:07:00.879> and<00:07:02.349> she's<00:07:03.349> lucky<00:07:03.650> that<00:07:03.770> there<00:07:03.919> was<00:07:04.039> no

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
drink and she's lucky that there was no

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.010 
drink and she's lucky that there was no
blood<00:07:04.400> vessels<00:07:04.759> in<00:07:04.849> the<00:07:04.909> way<00:07:05.030> for<00:07:05.180> the<00:07:05.240> lips<00:07:05.419> so

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
blood vessels in the way for the lips so

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.510 
blood vessels in the way for the lips so
essentially<00:07:06.650> the<00:07:06.740> lips<00:07:06.919> are<00:07:07.069> done<00:07:07.250> she

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
essentially the lips are done she

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.980 
essentially the lips are done she
shouldn't<00:07:07.789> have<00:07:07.849> any<00:07:08.060> major<00:07:08.240> bruising<00:07:08.750> so<00:07:08.930> you

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
shouldn't have any major bruising so you

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.540 
shouldn't have any major bruising so you
can<00:07:09.139> cover<00:07:09.319> it<00:07:09.530> with<00:07:09.560> lipstick<00:07:10.099> and<00:07:10.310> should<00:07:10.460> be

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
can cover it with lipstick and should be

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:25.140 
can cover it with lipstick and should be
ready<00:07:10.669> to<00:07:10.729> go<00:07:10.880> out

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150
