possible<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.360> two<00:01:27.630> years<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
possible in two years but it's going to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.460 
possible in two years but it's going to
cost<00:01:29.100> patients<00:01:29.880> over<00:01:30.210> 13<00:01:30.659> million<00:01:30.930> dollars

well<00:02:00.149> they<00:02:00.299> would<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> body<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.380> try<00:02:01.619> to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
well they would have a body and try to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440 
well they would have a body and try to

researchers<00:02:06.719> believed<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.369> have

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
researchers believed that they can have

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.490 
researchers believed that they can have
a<00:02:08.580> record-breaking<00:02:09.360> downloading<00:02:10.110> speed

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
a record-breaking downloading speed

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.650 
a record-breaking downloading speed
and<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.950> would<00:02:11.160> be<00:02:11.220> thousands<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.360> times

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
and this would be thousands of times

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.870 
and this would be thousands of times
faster<00:02:13.470> than<00:02:13.500> what<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:13.950> now<00:02:14.100> imagine

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
faster than what it is now imagine

really<00:02:18.090> sure<00:02:18.270> why<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.510> want<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.810> many

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
really sure why you want that many

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
movies so damn quickly because it takes

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.330 
movies so damn quickly because it takes
two<00:02:21.690> hours<00:02:21.930> three<00:02:22.440> hours<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.980> watch<00:02:23.130> movies

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
this researcher 5d network is going to

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.140 
this researcher 5d network is going to
be<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.770> thing<00:02:29.130> they<00:02:29.490> believe<00:02:29.790> it's<00:02:29.910> going<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.090> be

be a thing they believe it's going to be

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.180 
be a thing they believe it's going to be
possible<00:02:30.600> by<00:02:30.750> 2020<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.650> they<00:02:31.860> have<00:02:32.010> already

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
possible by 2020 and they have already

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.699 
possible by 2020 and they have already
developed<00:02:32.610> ten<00:02:33.300> breakthrough<00:02:34.050> technologies

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709
