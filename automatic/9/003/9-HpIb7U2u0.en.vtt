similar to like your your crank and
instead<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.730> pressing<00:03:22.730> in<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:23.120> bearing<00:03:23.750> into

instead of pressing in a bearing into

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.080 
instead of pressing in a bearing into
the<00:03:24.379> carbon<00:03:24.769> which<00:03:25.190> sometimes<00:03:25.910> can<00:03:26.030> be

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
the carbon which sometimes can be

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.490 
the carbon which sometimes can be
difficult<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.569> do<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:26.989> also<00:03:27.109> get<00:03:27.319> everything

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
difficult to do and also get everything

difficult to do and also get everything
to<00:03:27.680> line<00:03:27.859> up<00:03:28.010> perfectly<00:03:28.129> when<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.579> have<00:03:28.699> this

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
to line up perfectly when you have this

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.939 
to line up perfectly when you have this
many<00:03:28.970> bearings<00:03:29.389> is<00:03:29.569> we<00:03:30.139> use<00:03:30.290> what<00:03:30.470> a<00:03:30.620> headset

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
many bearings is we use what a headset

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.180 
many bearings is we use what a headset
bearing<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.459> so<00:03:31.970> there's<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.209> cup<00:03:32.829> mold<00:03:33.829> comb

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
bearing and so there's a cup mold comb

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.220 
bearing and so there's a cup mold comb
molded<00:03:34.519> into<00:03:34.669> the<00:03:34.790> frame<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:35.510> bearing<00:03:35.930> fits

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230

onto<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.620> onto<00:03:42.919> the<00:03:43.299> onto<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.329> shaft<00:03:44.599> and<00:03:44.840> you

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
onto the onto the onto the shaft and you

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.809 
onto the onto the onto the shaft and you
tighten<00:03:45.199> it<00:03:45.379> and<00:03:45.530> basically<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.220> can<00:03:46.340> adjust

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
tighten it and basically you can adjust

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.309 
tighten it and basically you can adjust
the<00:03:46.940> suspension<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:47.540> there's<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.049> take

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
the suspension so there's you can take

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.289 
the suspension so there's you can take
the<00:03:48.440> playout<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:49.040> also<00:03:49.609> make<00:03:49.790> sure<00:03:50.000> that<00:03:50.150> the

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
the playout and also make sure that the

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.140 
the playout and also make sure that the
suspension<00:03:50.900> system<00:03:51.049> moves<00:03:51.579> nicely<00:03:52.579> under

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
suspension system moves nicely under

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.030 
suspension system moves nicely under
load<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:53.660> then<00:03:54.109> this<00:03:54.199> is<00:03:54.349> just<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.560> lock<00:03:54.769> ring

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
load and then this is just a lock ring

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.830 
load and then this is just a lock ring
which<00:03:55.519> fits<00:03:55.790> over<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.329> then<00:03:56.599> you<00:03:56.690> use<00:03:56.810> a

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
which fits over and then you use a

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.110 
which fits over and then you use a
standard<00:03:57.290> mono<00:03:57.769> cassette<00:03:58.099> tool<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.790> lock<00:03:58.970> it

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
standard mono cassette tool to lock it

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.110 
standard mono cassette tool to lock it
down<00:03:59.269> in<00:03:59.510> all<00:03:59.690> three<00:04:00.019> main<00:04:00.319> pivot<00:04:01.069> points<00:04:01.549> use

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
down in all three main pivot points use

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.089 
down in all three main pivot points use

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
this bearing angular contact bearing

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.849 
this bearing angular contact bearing
system<00:04:04.489> and<00:04:04.760> there's<00:04:05.569> a<00:04:05.629> couple<00:04:05.780> benefits<00:04:06.199> one

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
system and there's a couple benefits one

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.159 
system and there's a couple benefits one
you<00:04:06.980> have<00:04:07.099> a<00:04:07.129> very<00:04:07.639> large<00:04:07.909> bearing<00:04:08.389> area<00:04:08.989> to

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
you have a very large bearing area to

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.349 
you have a very large bearing area to
hamp<00:04:09.349> to<00:04:09.560> handle<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.459> load<00:04:10.639> when<00:04:11.239> the

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
hamp to handle the load when the

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.149 
hamp to handle the load when the
suspension<00:04:11.870> is<00:04:12.019> cycling<00:04:12.379> very<00:04:12.590> fast<00:04:12.889> the

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
suspension is cycling very fast the

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.619 
suspension is cycling very fast the
suspension<00:04:13.609> will<00:04:13.790> be<00:04:13.879> very<00:04:14.120> free<00:04:14.419> which<00:04:14.599> is

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
suspension will be very free which is

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.089 
suspension will be very free which is
really<00:04:14.750> important<00:04:15.349> with<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.650> new<00:04:15.799> shocks

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
really important with the new shocks

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.599 
really important with the new shocks
with<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.430> valving<00:04:16.789> our<00:04:17.409> suspense<00:04:18.409> our<00:04:18.680> CV<00:04:19.579> a

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
with the valving our suspense our CV a

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.149 
with the valving our suspense our CV a
suspension<00:04:20.090> system<00:04:20.320> uses<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.530> very<00:04:21.889> low

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
suspension system uses a very low

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.680 
suspension system uses a very low
leverage<00:04:22.550> ratio<00:04:22.909> so<00:04:23.120> what<00:04:23.240> that<00:04:23.330> means<00:04:23.539> is

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
leverage ratio so what that means is

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.350 
leverage ratio so what that means is
you're<00:04:24.080> not<00:04:24.169> putting<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.500> lot<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.680> psi

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
you're not putting a lot of psi

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.510 
you're not putting a lot of psi
shock<00:04:25.750> but<00:04:26.289> therefore<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:27.159> want<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.400> have<00:04:27.490> a

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
shock but therefore you want to have a

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.499 
shock but therefore you want to have a
make<00:04:27.699> sure<00:04:27.789> you<00:04:27.879> have<00:04:27.969> a<00:04:28.000> suspension<00:04:28.360> system

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
make sure you have a suspension system

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.749 
make sure you have a suspension system
that<00:04:28.810> moves<00:04:29.110> very<00:04:29.199> freely<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.949> think<00:04:30.460> people

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
that moves very freely I think people

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.070 
that moves very freely I think people
would<00:04:30.849> be<00:04:30.909> surprised<00:04:31.389> if<00:04:31.599> you<00:04:31.719> take<00:04:31.930> your

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
would be surprised if you take your

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.709 
would be surprised if you take your
current<00:04:32.439> your<00:04:32.979> current<00:04:33.340> bike<00:04:33.819> unscrew<00:04:34.569> this

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:34.719 
current your current bike unscrew this

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:36.209 
current your current bike unscrew this
and<00:04:34.780> pull<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.080> shock<00:04:35.289> away<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.680> try<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:35.860> cycle

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:36.219 
and pull the shock away and try to cycle

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:38.129 
and pull the shock away and try to cycle
your<00:04:36.370> swing<00:04:36.699> arm<00:04:36.879> you'll<00:04:37.360> see<00:04:37.569> some<00:04:37.780> systems

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
your swing arm you'll see some systems

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.469 
your swing arm you'll see some systems
there's<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.710> lot<00:04:38.949> of<00:04:39.189> resistance<00:04:39.789> and<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.240> can

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
there's a lot of resistance and that can

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.909 
there's a lot of resistance and that can
really<00:04:40.689> play<00:04:40.930> with<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.229> with<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:41.590> rebound

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
really play with the with the rebound

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.679 
really play with the with the rebound
and<00:04:42.159> and<00:04:42.340> so<00:04:42.729> forth<00:04:42.969> the<00:04:43.060> adjustment<00:04:43.509> on<00:04:43.569> the

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
and and so forth the adjustment on the

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:45.809 
and and so forth the adjustment on the
bike<00:04:43.870> this<00:04:44.409> system<00:04:44.740> allows<00:04:45.009> the<00:04:45.340> shock<00:04:45.639> to

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
bike this system allows the shock to

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.909 
bike this system allows the shock to
work<00:04:45.969> really<00:04:46.539> do<00:04:46.719> its<00:04:46.870> magic<00:04:47.319> and<00:04:47.409> let<00:04:47.800> the

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
work really do its magic and let the

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.290 
work really do its magic and let the
suspension<00:04:48.430> system<00:04:48.580> move<00:04:48.909> freely<00:04:51.300> another

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
suspension system move freely another

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.629 
suspension system move freely another
neat<00:04:52.539> feature<00:04:52.569> that<00:04:52.870> isn't<00:04:53.620> visible<00:04:54.370> right

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
neat feature that isn't visible right

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.850 
neat feature that isn't visible right
away<00:04:54.939> is<00:04:55.180> they<00:04:55.810> stand<00:04:56.110> over<00:04:56.409> we've<00:04:56.620> worked

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
away is they stand over we've worked

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.249 
away is they stand over we've worked
really<00:04:56.949> hard<00:04:57.129> because<00:04:57.819> your<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.539> bike<00:04:58.810> can

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
really hard because your this bike can

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.980 
really hard because your this bike can
accept<00:04:59.650> up<00:05:00.039> to<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.400> 144<00:05:01.120> we<00:05:01.539> wanted<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.870> make

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
accept up to a 144 we wanted to make

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.360 
accept up to a 144 we wanted to make
sure<00:05:02.020> that<00:05:02.139> you<00:05:02.319> had<00:05:02.500> good<00:05:02.740> stand<00:05:02.979> over<00:05:03.219> so

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
sure that you had good stand over so

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.249 
sure that you had good stand over so
this<00:05:03.490> bike<00:05:03.789> actually<00:05:04.449> has<00:05:04.599> one<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.990> best

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
this bike actually has one of the best

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.559 
this bike actually has one of the best
stand<00:05:05.560> overs<00:05:05.860> of<00:05:06.189> an<00:05:06.400> e<00:05:06.430> 29<00:05:06.909> are<00:05:07.060> in<00:05:07.150> its<00:05:07.270> field

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
stand overs of an e 29 are in its field

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.290

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
I feel that riders you know when you're

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.390 
I feel that riders you know when you're
when<00:05:14.229> you're<00:05:14.379> going<00:05:14.500> through<00:05:14.740> a<00:05:14.830> section<00:05:15.310> and

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
when you're going through a section and

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.529 
when you're going through a section and
you're<00:05:15.520> in<00:05:15.669> the<00:05:15.759> bikes<00:05:15.939> moving<00:05:16.240> underneath

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
you're in the bikes moving underneath

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.240 
you're in the bikes moving underneath
you<00:05:16.750> you<00:05:17.139> know<00:05:17.199> the<00:05:17.529> bike<00:05:17.740> feels<00:05:17.949> a<00:05:18.159> lot

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
you you know the bike feels a lot

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.670 
you you know the bike feels a lot
smaller<00:05:18.669> than<00:05:19.270> it<00:05:19.330> is<00:05:19.629> and<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.139> think<00:05:20.319> that's<00:05:20.439> a

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
smaller than it is and I think that's a

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.540 
smaller than it is and I think that's a
nice<00:05:21.039> feature<00:05:22.409> so<00:05:23.409> the<00:05:23.650> frame<00:05:23.889> will<00:05:24.520> be

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
nice feature so the frame will be

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.490 
nice feature so the frame will be
