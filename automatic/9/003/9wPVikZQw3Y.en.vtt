teaching you manuals all right
so<00:00:30.699> manuals<00:00:31.210> I<00:00:31.449> don't<00:00:32.020> know<00:00:32.230> who<00:00:32.590> actually

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
so manuals I don't know who actually

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.690 
so manuals I don't know who actually
invented<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.910> manual<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:36.280> just<00:00:36.520> one<00:00:36.670> of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
invented the manual it's just one of

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.240 
invented the manual it's just one of
those<00:00:36.850> tricks<00:00:37.629> it<00:00:37.840> probably<00:00:38.469> was<00:00:38.649> invented<00:00:39.129> by

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
those tricks it probably was invented by

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.060 
those tricks it probably was invented by
rodney<00:00:39.610> mullen<00:00:39.940> or<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:41.620> definitely

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
rodney mullen or it definitely

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.340 
rodney mullen or it definitely
originated<00:00:42.610> in<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.390> freestyle<00:00:43.870> arena<00:00:45.030> but

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
originated in the freestyle arena but

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.000 
originated in the freestyle arena but
pretty<00:00:47.350> self-explanatory

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
pretty self-explanatory

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.330 
pretty self-explanatory
it's<00:00:48.940> like<00:00:49.120> popping<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.690> wheelie<00:00:49.719> on<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:51.039> bike

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
it's like popping a wheelie on a bike

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.110 
it's like popping a wheelie on a bike
you<00:00:52.120> know<00:00:52.149> you<00:00:53.730> definitely<00:00:54.730> want<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:54.969> learn

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
you know you definitely want to learn

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.930 
you know you definitely want to learn
you<00:00:55.750> know<00:00:56.519> how<00:00:57.519> to<00:00:58.230> balance<00:00:59.429> you<00:01:00.429> know<00:01:00.579> on<00:01:00.879> a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
you know how to balance you know on a

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.939 
you know how to balance you know on a
skateboard<00:01:01.390> before<00:01:01.780> you<00:01:02.019> attempt<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.440> manual

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
skateboard before you attempt to manual

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.580 
skateboard before you attempt to manual
but<00:01:03.760> it's<00:01:03.969> safe<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.269> say<00:01:04.600> that<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.900> manual<00:01:05.320> is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
but it's safe to say that the manual is

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.770 
but it's safe to say that the manual is
probably<00:01:06.009> the<00:01:06.189> entrance<00:01:06.400> trick<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.740> a<00:01:09.780> beret

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
probably the entrance trick to a beret

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.039 
probably the entrance trick to a beret
of<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.049> whole<00:01:11.259> bunch<00:01:11.650> of<00:01:11.799> other<00:01:12.750> manual<00:01:13.750> tricks

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
of a whole bunch of other manual tricks

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.780 
of a whole bunch of other manual tricks
that<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.290> can<00:01:14.439> do<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:14.860> first<00:01:15.130> off<00:01:15.430> you're

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
that you can do so first off you're

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.069 
that you can do so first off you're
going<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:16.090> want<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.299> learn<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.479> regular<00:01:16.840> manual

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
going to want to learn a regular manual

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.020 
going to want to learn a regular manual
then<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.710> nose<00:01:17.920> really<00:01:18.159> then<00:01:18.610> you'll<00:01:18.729> start

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
then the nose really then you'll start

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.410 
then the nose really then you'll start
doing<00:01:19.290> variations<00:01:20.290> or<00:01:20.710> 180s<00:01:21.189> into<00:01:21.579> it<00:01:21.759> 180s

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
doing variations or 180s into it 180s

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.390 
doing variations or 180s into it 180s
out<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:22.869> and<00:01:23.079> then<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.439> flip<00:01:23.710> it<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.100> trip

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
out of it and then you flip it and trip

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.359 
out of it and then you flip it and trip
out<00:01:24.579> and<00:01:24.850> then<00:01:25.000> your<00:01:25.240> stay<00:01:25.780> Wang<00:01:25.990> song<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:29.369> it's

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
out and then your stay Wang song so it's

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.719 
out and then your stay Wang song so it's
pretty<00:01:30.549> easy<00:01:30.850> basically<00:01:31.780> just<00:01:32.049> want<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.729> go
