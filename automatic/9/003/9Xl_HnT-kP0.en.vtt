 today we are going to make this delicious and delicious 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.450
 sweet bread 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.960
 Here is a list of ingredients 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.960
 that we have used 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.250
 see what he looks like he has juicy believes and 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.250
 see how it's done let's go there 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.970
 maybe when we do any 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.080
 recipes is preparing the ingredients 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.240
 before 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.450
 we start by removing the nuts 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.040
 peel we have tempered the butter 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.760
 Well you have a bain-marie or a few seconds 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.800
 in the microwave 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.660
 but we have beaten the eggs 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.089
 slightly to help it to 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.890
 incorporate better so we can already 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.469
 meet with the recipe and we start with 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.180
 the yeast flour we are going to use 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.070
 the wheeled horseshoe that 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.530
 usually comes in a few packages of about 5 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.399
 grams 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 the sugar and guayo of the spoon we counted 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.040
 good in the next step are the 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.540
 liquids 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.980
 150 milliliter milk sections 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.050
 the 100 grams of butter 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.450
 and the two eggs 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.150
 the agra tint we can use water from 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.100
 azahar a few drops of anise and a tasting 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.920
 of fruit liqueur or as in this case 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.890
 a splash of good vanilla and now 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.640
 with the help of mixing spoon not 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.640
 we start from the center 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.950
 and going out with this we're going to 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.920
 get we're going to get nothing else going 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.970
 to be rather sticky 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.970
 instead of dry 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.300
 with him we have practically mix or 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:48.340
 let's be a reality of salt nuts 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.320
 and the 120 grams of raisins and 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.370
 nuggets we keep mixing a little more 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.370
 with the porsche the first 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.950
 we are turning 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.390
 you see that we have practically no 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.200
 no line and it's time to move 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.390
 a little hand a spoon so that we 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.910
 Stick your hands, let's find them a 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.430
 little and Nazism and now we're taking the 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.530
 dough 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.400
 the only objective is to mix the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.989
 ingredients 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.989
 we spent about three or four minutes 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.420
 now we add around orange 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.420
 and we finish massage 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.520
 we make a kind of fly 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.200
 let's treat it and let it rest 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.360
 for this we are going to use a cloth or 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.140
 paper very transparent like in this 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.819
 case 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.650
 and now that we're going to do that, it deserves 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.420
 interior with a little oil this what 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.640
 we make so that when the mass rises the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.370
 fine stuck yesterday 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.110
 now we put it in an area that I am 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.480
 warm 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.090
 it is best to warm the oven 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.800
 about 50 degrees and let it sit there 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.560
 inside let's let it rest for 23 hours 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.360
 we have let three hours rest for 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.780
 throwing the oil does not stick anything 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.780
 here we have 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.930
 and we have our mass ready now what 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.260
 what we are going to do is first remove the 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.830
 air and prepare it to bake the king 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.550
 we put some oil in our hands 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.040
 people and we are going to separate now only 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.560
 we have to remove the here and divide it 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.830
 in two do it like this let's take a 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.830
 half 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.019
 two hours 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.750
 a strong 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.190
 the kitchen paper on it we extend 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.460
 one of the balls we make a test 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.460
 long 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.459
 stretching like this 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:59.910
 and we do the same with the season 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.910
 next fatty barrionuevo 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.150
 and we painted 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.609
 our bread 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.780
 well now we put the hot 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.640
 180 degrees oven and we take advantage of those 5 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.380
 or 10 minutes of rest for our bread 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.320
 but five minutes have passed and now 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.910
 before four of the oven with a 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.480
 knife we ​​make a kind of cut 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.910
 for the video 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.910
 as as liberated here the world's 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.139
 we have left a tray in the area 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.319
 lower 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.770
 as you see and here we are going to take half 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.770
 glass of water 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.250
 hot this creates a vapor cloud that 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.760
 will ask you to dry too quickly 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.760
 bread 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.610
 well here we have 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:02.150
 our sweet bread 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.860
 now the next step is to put it on 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.860
 a grate to cool 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.110
 we let you cool for a few minutes and 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.030
 we try 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.790
 well now I want to show us how it is 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.800
 inside 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.800
 look what looks like juicy 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.920
 we have another option that is to divide it into 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.770
 smaller flights instead of doing 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.140
 two we would do five or six for you 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.110
 you make an idea we have made two loaves of 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.790
 540 grams each approximately 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.470
 my desire now would be to command I know the aroma 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.990
 for the video but at the moment it's not 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.910
 possible I encourage you to try it is delicious 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.910
 rico chau see you next video
