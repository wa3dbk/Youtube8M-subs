00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.450
 welcome to creative talks about 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.880
 art and today we will be seeing a small 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.300
 guide how can we play gifted without 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.920
 have internet ok the first thing we're going to 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.380
 do is start our steam session 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.169
 and quiet quiet we'll put it 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.500
 in disconnected mode before you go to 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.500
 say nothing 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.170
 you know that it was not decoration and 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:46.250
 we could put here disconnected mode 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:51.320
 ok we leave it this way we go to 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.850
 my pc or computer dislodge files from the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.079
 x86 program 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:01.810
 if you have 64-bit windows 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:08.640
 here we go to steam 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.640
 and here we write dot to dot exc 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.390
 here we will get four files or more 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.390
 well four applications 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.190
 I'm here this executable here in the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.659
 dow is that we normally use the 6 of 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.800
 total that has the authorization of the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.430
 patches and all this endows here 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.890
 it is in the configuration the workshop does not 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.630
 I'm pretty sure it's 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.300
 and what interests us are states of 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.090
 here 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.460
 here are our configurations 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.610
 basic profile as well as saying the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.730
 command keys and the sound and those 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.730
 things 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.799
 the one of kim also of a form of foul or 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.600
 either nothing keys are set 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.600
 that we are going to open from here the third 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.120
 well let's open 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.670
 and 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.930
 Well what I want to comment on is that 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.910
 this endowment is the basic version is not the 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.910
 the one that is currently played 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.100
 we have, I think it's already here and we're going to 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.890
 play and we can play match 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.450
 of against against boots or I think that 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.490
 this would not be much when we do not have 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 internet and we want to practice with a 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.270
 new hero or maybe with a number that 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.270
 do not get too much served 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.969
 we are already here as I tell you this is 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.420
 an old version of 2 is rather 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:47.340
 to show you how the network is now 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.040
 here we see that here is just being 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.959
 structuring is not even the ones 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.129
 skeletal right now is my teacher ni 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.340
 They are even well structured the 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.340
 skids 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.040
 If we choose it, we see that they do not have the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.040
 color effects or lights 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.180
 all right 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.150
 and we left a hero 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.140
 i 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.220
 if you look closely at the prices 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.650
 we'll see what limit is the version 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.100
 old let's see that the price is 135 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.820
 of gold but instead it is currently worth 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.820
 100 gold 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.880
 and we see that map also in the version 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.680
 old and if you see here 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.040
 russian if they are on the left side and not 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.040
 in the right 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.700
 and well actually I just think that 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.860
 would be the things that should enter 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.770
 the skill and this is in the same 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.840
 rather I think that this is a version 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.100
 as I had told you before 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.090
 the other processions leave and is 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.120
 saying I'm saying that I do not think 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.940
 I'm saying it's like that so if 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.760
 someone knows what it is about 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.010
 this version could inform us since 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.900
 there is never any other information 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.920
 extra or a correction if I'm 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.709
 wrong 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.709
 everyone is wrong and good 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.080
 in this city ​​of creativity banner 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.080
 and see you in the next 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.590
 good next 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.540
 good
