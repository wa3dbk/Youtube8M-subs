about<00:00:37.730> how<00:00:37.940> buddy's<00:00:38.359> let<00:00:39.230> me<00:00:39.350> explain<00:00:39.679> why

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
about how buddy's let me explain why

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.419 
about how buddy's let me explain why
first<00:00:41.600> of<00:00:41.809> all<00:00:41.929> he<00:00:42.199> a<00:00:42.230> few<00:00:42.500> notice<00:00:42.920> here<00:00:43.129> on<00:00:43.340> the

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
first of all he a few notice here on the

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:49.599 
first of all he a few notice here on the
side<00:00:43.670> of<00:00:43.699> the<00:00:43.910> roof<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:48.410> slice<00:00:48.739> should<00:00:49.280> come

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
side of the roof the slice should come

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.729 
side of the roof the slice should come
to<00:00:49.850> approximately<00:00:50.390> there<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:51.140> reason<00:00:51.320> is<00:00:51.620> is

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
to approximately there the reason is is

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.500 
to approximately there the reason is is
because<00:00:51.769> when<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.309> rain<00:00:52.460> comes<00:00:52.820> down<00:00:53.059> he's

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
because when the rain comes down he's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.660 
because when the rain comes down he's
just<00:00:53.660> going<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:53.870> soak<00:00:54.079> straight<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.679> the<00:00:54.800> as

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
just going to soak straight to the as

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.149 
just going to soak straight to the as
far<00:00:55.910> as<00:00:55.999> I<00:00:56.089> understand<00:00:56.539> this<00:00:56.710> straight<00:00:57.710> into

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
far as I understand this straight into

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:12.240 
far as I understand this straight into
the<00:00:58.280> roof
