00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 patricia lacoste the trend 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.610
 side 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:04.730
 not like that 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.730
 as would say the other active drug 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:10.279
 with afp m 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:13.359
 video capsule here is a revolutionary technology 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.230
 a microscopic camera and that once ingested by the patient 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.920
 32 photos per second during the few hours she spends 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.679
 browse his digestive system 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.619
 sensors placed on the patient transmit images a hard drive 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.569
 external 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:31.449
 I think it's a technique 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.860
 the team was everything 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.170
 futuristic a bit anyway but for what is rather not bad because it 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.650
 lets people fall asleep 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.650
 there they have a history of radiology like anything 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.850
 he is content 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.320
 and that suddenly they have a daughter now 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.190
 a painless technique too and that allows patients to live their day 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.270
 almost normally without hospitalization 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.720
 we swallow the capsule morning and we return at night to deposit the hard drive to 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.590
 doctors 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.300
 the day went like the other days at the most 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.380
 the fact that human activities 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.820
 red cross and others 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.930
 as if there were no young people and for doctors it's handy 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.430
 because they can take their time to study the images and transmit them 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.120
 to others if needed 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.880
 since march at the clinic saint joseph has made 18 patients have 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.340
 benefited from this technique and which allows very good diagnosis 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 in the first two patients we did we found a tumor of the grail 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.500
 for example who was bleeding for months and months 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.310
 with which high technologies did not have a dwarf who did not have 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.960
 been highlighted by the menagerie optics so the pikinois patients have 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.340
 been operated 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.610
 emilie and then also under development bow small mines 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.490
 so that will definitely have some benefits in the future a little more important 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.750
 and points to the notation a little more complex the single-use capsule 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.880
 costs about 450 euros each 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.950
 since january 2009 its cost is covered by the cpe m for the exams 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.920
 small bowel
