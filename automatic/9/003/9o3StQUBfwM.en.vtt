00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.209
 many of us wanted to go back to school 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.240
 many not for those who have not yet 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.870
 returned 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.500
 and for those who already 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.080
 I have not returned yet and all 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.390
 the years always every year 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.080
 I longed to go back to school but this 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.610
 year like that not because I started with this 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.520
 of the videos and because the truth has 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.080
 given a lot of time but come on let's 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.180
 continue studying and we are going to throw all 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.460
 you want it like this and I'm going to 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.860
 start looking for me to organize with him 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 all the videos so nothing today 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.570
 I bring the next subject 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.690
 I start my day praising my face with 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.690
 an exfoliating cream 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.480
 Well the first thing I do is record my 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.410
 face like the previous images and 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.710
 then I use make-up remover and a 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.710
 cotonete 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.909
 I do this to remove the waste from 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.630
 mascara so they do not leave me all bold 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.630
 under mine 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.730
 and now I was stung by a moisturizer that 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.660
 apart from having bleach has 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.660
 sunscreen 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.190
 and now I will get corrector 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.400
 mainly my dark circles in the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.620
 machines that I do not like here yes it is 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.970
 important that you take good care of the color of 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.710
 your concealer so you do not look like that 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.830
 all the pachita that instead of covering the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.040
 dark circles highlights the color change in 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.340
 your face will put that color of shadow in 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.890
 gel in take eyelid and then I'll put one 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.410
 more coffee that is this that I am 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.580
 pointing now and I'll put it in the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.710
 parts of the outside of the eyelid and I do not expect 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.900
 and I do not want it to be super super super 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.910
 coffee so spread I think that in 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.340
 everything I do I will blur to 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.140
 I do not see his pear if I put rime 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.210
 for me the mascara is something super super 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.730
 important so I've done my two 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.700
 layers three layers of mascara and then to 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.370
 compact all my makeup with powder 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.290
 also some flush little dps your 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.790
 little bag here robberies and toy there too 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.790
 I put myself in what is the nose 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.740
 a little black boy across the line 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.230
 water a little bit do not exaggerate very natural 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.180
 very natural girl then used this 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.890
 color because I do not use gloss or when I 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.290
 like to use them like that but if you use the 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.690
 You can use all of them but I use that too 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.319
 he diffused perfumito or read pretty 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.760
 baÃ±adito and everything I love this perfume 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.209
 I like a lot of color 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.209
 I love him 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.520
 talking about hairstyles I'm not the master 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.770
 of the hairstyle but well let's do 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.630
 something easy we do little train from one side 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.630
 we make a braid of the other 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.569
 and we are going to put the transit where 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.960
 we started doing the other one so 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:39.430
 hide that you do not see everything 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:42.450
 more like another and got well and was very 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.450
 simple very easy 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.290
 and then it's time for the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.080
 confessions I really do not maquillo 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.500
 well super pretty used colors 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.870
 coffee light colors for nothing in the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.590
 home when to have home to leave 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.480
 to go to school but already a few times 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.180
 something else but I have always used 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.980
 your colors milestones and I hope that you 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.330
 also put it into practice in case you do not 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.800
 you put on makeup but at school but 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.170
 you always wanted but you did not want 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.090
 exaggerating what you have a makeup on there 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.870
 way to make up and in fact in the 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.510
 videos 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.550
 that you have seen previously like this 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.460
 it is very maquillo so super super super 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.900
 easy and then nothing left you a hug and a 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.870
 kiss and see you in the next video 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.330

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.389

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.850
