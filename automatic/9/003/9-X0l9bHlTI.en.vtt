 What is the meaning of life 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.890
 It is not uncommon for you to ask that to a 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.890
 inanimate object 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.150
 What is the meaning of life 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.860
 life that distinguishes kingdoms 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.170

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.370
 abilities to be born grow reproduce 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.500

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.240

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.140
 application on the subject although we pass 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.280

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.210
