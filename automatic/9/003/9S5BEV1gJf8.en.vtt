00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 It has to be back here my channel if 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.069
 You do not know, do not forget to give a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.410
 peek in the other videos and half 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.120
 already rolled around here today is the first 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 video of a series of videos that I will 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.910
 talk about architecture 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.830
 for those who do not know this stop 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.199
 architecture and I intend to address some 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.359
 themes around with you for chat days 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.070
 and comment on some things that happen 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.949
 in the course as that is the life of hef 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.109
 technicians of the city ​​hall and receive 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.109
 ground-to-ground feedback 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.140
 very common fts of gt will have heat from 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.920
 architecture parts architecture you go 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.870
 see in your life several times doing 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:49.469
 architecture because it could not 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:57.750
 pass engineering exams 0 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:01:14.250
 it is very common you will see is that if I 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:20.580
 I wanted to say that design 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:29.790
 standing next to each other and about it because 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:33.060
 is very complex and would become people 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.950
 has proof and more than a discipline of the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.310
 dog because it calls design 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.310
 All right then 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.049
 the tests of the expected ones we start 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.570
 in the bimester doing the project then 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.810
 some subjects have strong evidence 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.700
 some minor subjects have no proof 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.719
 because people seek and ended his 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:06.780
 social life and humanity 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:12.150
 deep inside him, I think I shared the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.260
 our own in various seminars 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.319
 will 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.079
 to see men cry when it comes to 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.980
 deliver the project you give the teacher and 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:25.230
 some of them not so little effort but 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.329
 There's evidence, people, stop it, then. 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.700
 as when asked by architects and 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:34.079
 engineers is when you 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:37.530
 comment somebody sgt tour i am 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.440
 I was in need of coral on finding 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.560
 orientation that to take a look pretends 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:58.590
 do a little pull in the background but 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:03:05.010
 also has a scene of some pressure 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:10.049
 that computing has long been the agent in 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:15.079
 cause he is asking to train with an eye and gave 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.079
 to understand that it did not 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:04:17.299
 It's cool, then, like you're better off. 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:17.299
 People say you are a nice person. 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.630
 ae 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:35.850
 the playoff 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.860
 yes, do you want to close 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.490
 account to give you what the head of the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.020
 person 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.810
 technician draws an auto cad or any 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.970
 other treaty was software that is 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.430
 using it is very laborious and very 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.980
 It's difficult, it's very complicated, you're there. 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.850
 sometimes the photo rendering that remained 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:05:00.090
 Nice but a job close to 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.210
 to that point is not only to give a 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.580
 quique animals have many and many 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.160
 clicks and cheer so you remember 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.310
 save it gives a fatal error and end with 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.520
 your life and your dignity to be a 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:18.570
 part and the modeling program does not 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.420
 It's to see if it's like this, so it's 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.340
 or it's not hard to comment 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:33.420
 this evil in one's life that she 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:35.250
 will be very affected with you guys 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.810
 can enter with sharp materials are 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:45.780
 the only ones you can take with materials 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:51.780
 in the faculty of architecture is 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:06:01.280
 It's kind of no use talking about you 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:06:04.530
 It's good to talk, it 's beautiful. 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.560
 You have to stay very, very tired. 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.750
 and on top of it you'll hear a 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.240
 I think it has all of the 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.130
 things are good and without your comments 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.160
 if you do something different and 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:22.830
 has some trolling between the courses that 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:27.090
 you blow these holes like 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:30.470
 you have enjoyed anyone who signs up 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.470
 you may receive more videos 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.640
 fast comment below that you are 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.210
 Finding the videos for me to know 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.100
 do 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.100
 Okay, okay?
