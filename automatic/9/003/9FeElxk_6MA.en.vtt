the neon and I'm going to dot the middle

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.720 
the neon and I'm going to dot the middle
of<00:04:09.550> my<00:04:09.730> diamond<00:04:11.010> like<00:04:12.010> that<00:04:12.630> okay<00:04:14.580> okay<00:04:15.580> now

of my diamond like that okay okay now
that<00:04:15.970> we've<00:04:16.090> done<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:16.600> I'm<00:04:16.810> going<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.200> move

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
that we've done that I'm going to move

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.490 
that we've done that I'm going to move
my<00:04:17.850> glopping<00:04:18.850> paper<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.359> side<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.900> why<00:04:20.470> I

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
my glopping paper to the side and why I

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.770 
my glopping paper to the side and why I
would<00:04:20.980> recommend<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.609> because<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.330> black<00:04:22.480> is

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
would recommend is because the black is

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.110 
would recommend is because the black is
so<00:04:22.810> dark<00:04:23.350> the<00:04:24.220> dot<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:24.580> do<00:04:24.700> in<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.880> middle

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
so dark the dot you do in the middle

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.090 
so dark the dot you do in the middle
will<00:04:25.510> have<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.870> dot<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.320> again<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.800> middle

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
will have to dot it again in the middle

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.100 
will have to dot it again in the middle
