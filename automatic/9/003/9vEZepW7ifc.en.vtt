00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.860
 hello youtube friends welcome to 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.649
 this the first anime video the exotic 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.939
 that this video is very special as it goes 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.129
 to deal with a pet that 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.349
 lately it has become popular in several 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:14.419
 countries like this we are talking about the hedgehog 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.100
 african pygmy this pet that for his 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.289
 size is very susceptible to have it in 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.990
 apartments as well as in houses this 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.510
 pet needs a space for 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.890
 specimen of 80 centimeters by 30 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.019
 approximately so you can 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.720
 perform their activities well 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.070
 this can be given or more the place more 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.379
 susceptible to have these pets 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.930
 would be in a cage for prey rabbits 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.270
 cages are worth me about 600 pesos 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.090
 more or less a few good cages then 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.370
 another cheaper alternative and very 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.170
 economic would be a 40-liter fish tank 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.820
 in these slates are very easy to 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.620
 get since they are the fish tanks that more 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.140
 they are commercialized and you can find them 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 in almost all aquariums then 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.640
 are you fish tank are ideal for our 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.230
 services since they keep the heat in 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.390
 our fish tank we are going to put a substrate 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.269
 Sawdust is one of the most 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.680
 this is one of the substrates that most 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.810
 they agree to the hedgehog there is another kind of 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.759
 substrate but this is what would be the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.899
 better not to put any type 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.759
 of doing well you have to put a do 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.710
 well that you go to the carpentry 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.780
 move reyno you have to put them in 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.420
 special for pets that would be this is 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.420
 this sawdust of the criminal mark are 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.280
 very good these substrates this do 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.410
 well what's coming is that it's coming 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.820
 enjoyed no longer brings any bacteria and 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.550
 in another they ended up being another and nothing 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.750
 of what could affect our 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.790
 stew 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 these substrates are very good there 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.540
 different types of substrates and then 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.090
 The most recommended for the hedgehog is the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.360
 Sawdust this sachet comes worth 10 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.070
 pesos which is very economical and is very 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.900
 easy to get too since in the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.360
 most of the pet stores 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.070
 they sell for rabbits the following thing that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.979
 we need is the trough and the trough 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.080
 the feeder can be like that we see 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.150
 there that clothes that is an agreement for 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.130
 reptile since that dining room has no weight 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.660
 so that it is not going to turn around but you 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.250
 they can also put a little dish on it 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.509
 The only thing you need is to have weight to 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.830
 that the hedgehog is not going to turn over and that 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.170
 is not very high because the gray or 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.910
 can get caught up in something else is the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.930
 sprue the sprue can put a 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.390
 drinking fountain for hamsters and mice and 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.700
 whose and since these drinkers are very 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.959
 good for them can also put 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.340
 a little dish but just as you have 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.930
 enough weight because if he did not 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.880
 then to turn around he was going to wet his habitat 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.220
 another thing that the horizon needs is the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.310
 cave like this that we see here from 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.720
 preference has to be a cave 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.209
 specific the size of the smooth they already see in 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.500
 cloth caves that are called igloos I'm going to 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.480
 look for the free market 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.319
 they come worth around 100 pesos 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.060
 each one 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.310
 I am very expensive can make one like 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.659
 this one I did with a cap too what 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.790
 can do with a carafe of milk 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.499
 there are many ways to search on youtube and 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.530
 there are several tutorials on how to do 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:52.889
 a little cave for your delight because 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.480
 some caves come out very expensive otherwise 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.670
 what our need is is a 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.090
 heating since the ellis or if it is not 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.709
 in its ideal temperature can reach 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.359
 winter and how they are not ready 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.730
 for the imagination they are going to die in the 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:09.290
 try 'of hunger what is here more 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.680
 recommendable may have plates of 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.019
 of this heat can have some 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.709
 cables equal heat but what else is 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.859
 recommends is this the focus this is a 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.170
 daylight lamp of 15 watts of exo 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:28.250
 land for reptiles this lamp is very 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.319
 good as we can see is a focus 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.079
 well this lamp is very good because 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.609
 this this lamp does not spend a lot of energy 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.620
 Being 15 watts can be maintained 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.530
 lit all the time is a lamp 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.930
 locked and this lamp we can 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.939
 have pinned all day long 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.159
 time learned for many months and 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:47.510
 nothing happens to the focus and keeps the 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.239
 Hedgehog temperature is recommended 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.299
 put it as you can see here in the 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.909
 above the hedgehog's house as it is 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.250
 up here so there's just the 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.400
 temperature and the hedgehog as it is nocturnal 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.440
 can sleep there without problems that 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.590
 have cold or something 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.180
 the next thing our 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.970
 terrarium is a lid as you can see 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.060
 here 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.790
 a grid cover so you can 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.120
 ventilate and do not go look for our and 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.859
 are these tapas come tomorrow about 60 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.220
 you can buy them in the same 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.540
 Where do fish tanks buy these 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.920
 tapas are very good and it is the most 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.020
 recommended since they already have 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.770
 rolls made for you to light lamps 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.990
 today these fish tank this stage is very good 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.510
 and its manufacture is very well thought out 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.890
 then the food of our smooth to 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.900
 Sometimes it is difficult to get a 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.140
 good food for our son and that 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.150
 cover all your whole diet then 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.410
 we can give you cat pellet 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.820
 high-end and that's like because these 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.610
 animals have a lot of weight gain if not 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.680
 they exercise then we give 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.190
 super jr and you do not have to take it out to do 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.840
 exercise can be taken to your room 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.570
 You may be playing with it in a little while 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.510
 so that to see if yes it is not going to get fat 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.669
 another thing that you can feed him with 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.410
 the pellet you can complement your 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.300
 diet with an insect more or less to the 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.680
 week so your diet is 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.479
 complemented 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.880
 the food that sometimes is not very feasible 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:23.360
 to get in some countries is this 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.970
 the masur food and this is a meal 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.160
 special for insectivores and is for the 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.110
 hedgehog for that brings his image this food 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.490
 it is sometimes difficult to get this 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.740
 160 more or less large boat costs 160 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.990
 being 90 depending where 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.880
 buy the problem of this is your 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.740
 distribution and that in some countries 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.020
 you can get it but in mercadolibre 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.030
 you can buy it since the only bad thing 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.030
 it would be the shipment that I would spend is a lot 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.120
 and ready that was some of the data 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.190
