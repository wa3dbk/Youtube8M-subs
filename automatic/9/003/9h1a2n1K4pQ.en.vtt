shortened backstory of the shoe um I

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.600 
shortened backstory of the shoe um I
guess<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.989> designer<00:00:49.350> wanted<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.890> create<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
guess the designer wanted to create a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.450 
guess the designer wanted to create a
simple<00:00:51.329> shoe<00:00:51.800> leaving<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.280> features

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it almost looked like you know gardens

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.399 
it almost looked like you know gardens
how<00:01:42.540> sometimes<00:01:42.960> gardens<00:01:43.409> had<00:01:43.530> those<00:01:43.740> rows<00:01:44.009> so

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
how sometimes gardens had those rows so

how sometimes gardens had those rows so
overall<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.560> guess<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.950> know<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.369> their

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
overall I guess you know that was their

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.660 
overall I guess you know that was their
whole<00:01:47.670> look<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.540> know<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.040> design<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.430> into

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
whole look you know in design going into

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.300 
whole look you know in design going into
this<00:01:50.820> was<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.750> idea<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.320> simplicity<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
this was just the idea of simplicity and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.380 
this was just the idea of simplicity and
like<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.579> said<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.909> know<00:01:54.000> they<00:01:54.149> felt<00:01:54.360> like

like I said you know they felt like

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.929 
like I said you know they felt like
nothing<00:01:54.600> was<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.740> simple<00:01:56.189> than<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.610> Zen

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
nothing was more simple than a Zen

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.389 
nothing was more simple than a Zen
master<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:58.409> spelled<00:01:58.799> differently<00:01:59.280> I

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
master on this spelled differently I

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.499

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.680 
here on the bottom is file on cushioning
I<00:02:52.350> haven't<00:02:52.770> walked<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.310> them<00:02:53.460> enough<00:02:53.760> yet<00:02:54.060> but

when I have walked in them the cushion

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.970 
when I have walked in them the cushion
is<00:02:56.580> definitely<00:02:57.060> soft<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.600> absorbent<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
is definitely soft and absorbent of the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.950 
is definitely soft and absorbent of the
shock<00:02:59.280> while<00:02:59.520> walking<00:02:59.820> in<00:03:00.120> them<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:00.780> could

shock while walking in them you could

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.250 
shock while walking in them you could
obviously<00:03:01.290> see<00:03:01.560> how<00:03:02.040> thick<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.180> cushion<00:03:04.050> is

so<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.830> know<00:03:04.950> they<00:03:05.100> definitely<00:03:05.520> have<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:06.060> be

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
so you know they definitely have to be

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.990 
so you know they definitely have to be
comfortable<00:03:06.660> just<00:03:07.230> looking<00:03:07.620> at<00:03:07.770> them<00:03:08.000> the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
out there that have traction that is

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.100 
out there that have traction that is
better<00:03:30.120> suited<00:03:30.240> for<00:03:30.600> running<00:03:30.959> of<00:03:31.080> course
