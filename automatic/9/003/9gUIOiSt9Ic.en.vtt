00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.589
 for all that just today I'm going to 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.750
 answer a question that sometimes are 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.330
 many great two years that is like 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.460
 I take care of my books that's basically 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.460
 in this video you are going to see how we take care of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.750
 books as I clean them as I order them and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.060
 in passing I'll give you a few 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.859
 advice for my own experience with 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.510
 this video, much less I want 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.580
 Let's have the books as if we finished you 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.640
 of buying in the bookstore but 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 we can have some healthy books and 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.800
 beautiful for many years because as 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.990
 you know you're all playing with time and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.790
 the less they spoil the more time 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.190
 we will enjoy because we all love the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.230
 books and we all want to take care of them I know 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.940
 that there are some people who like 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.310
 that you notice the passage of time in your 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.650
 books that does not mean that no 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.240
 want for many years so, as 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.490
 it's my turn to make the shelves free 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.290
 I have thought to record it for you and see 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.840
 what I do when I play these 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.950
 so entertaining sessions so is that 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.540
 let's do it 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.790
 then two types of cleaning one is more 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.170
 superficial because it removed the dust by the 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.600
 shelves 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.759
 the piece that remains free and also removed 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.130
 the dust on top of the limbs and by 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.409
 thus could slip powder versions 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.380
 which are positioned vertically les 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.119
 dusting the top with a cloth 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.799
 dry that I do a few times to 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.320
 metro cleaning more thoroughly that I'm going to 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.200
 teaching right now is what I do 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.780
 how many times a year is it to get all 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.789
 the books clean everything very well and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.619
 put back all the books 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.140
 we started we started taking out all the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.080
 books from the shelves this time the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.679
 I have placed by genre by fantasy 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.270
 for romantic young and I do not like how 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.039
 has created because I almost always have it 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.929
 ordered how to achieve from one job to another 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.369
 time it's for editorials I like it more 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.619
 in that way because there are in the ideals 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.000
 they usually make books of the same size 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.929
 more or less then they create more 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.929
 visually pretty 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.110
 I'm placing them on the ground stacked 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.110
 one above the other 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.799
 and it is already finished and now as 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.989
 You see they are super soulless and lonely 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.599
 I have all the books on the floor 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.610
 placed the books in strips on the floor 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.010
 there they are not all I have more in the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.230
 trap processing one of the tips 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.599
 What I am going to give you is that if you can avoid 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.730
 that the sun from directly to the books 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.620
 much better because they are damaged before I 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.390
 we have three milestone in twilight and the sun 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.220
 that is out there you have minimal like this is 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.959
 that I think they were well placed 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.329
 now we proceed to clean the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.120
 shelves say it's not good to throw 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.400
 chemical products to clean 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.590
 because then you can make contact with 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.960
 the books and they break down but I what 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.110
 I also do a little product 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.450
 clean the dust and then with another cloth 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.520
 wet I give it so there are no remains 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.830
 of the product once we have the 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.840
 clean shelves we can start with 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.530
 the books with a cloth this time dry 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.470
 we can give the whole cover and 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.990
 also tightening the book well we will 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.570
 that does not strain the dust droplets by 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.790
 inside the book to remove the dust 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.980
 that has accumulated on all sides 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.130
 they say it's better to place the books in 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.530
 vertical that horizontally because that's how it 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.390
 they end up deforming the loins but as 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.420
 you can check I do not have so much room 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.980
 to put all the books so hopefully I 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.960
 I would like to have them so beautiful 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.810
 but I can not fit between any other remedy than 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.560
 place them horizontally 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.200
 also after these years 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.110
 I have only noticed that they will bend 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.610
 little loins in about 5 or 6 books and 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.010
 now we can start to place 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.660
 the books and I always place the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.970
 nicer covers and the books that 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.370
 I like more in the part in sectors and 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.590
 of the bookshelf and I leave the 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.890
 more ugly quotes or those less 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.530
 I like it 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.200
 lower another advice that I give you is 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.930
 that if you can set aside a bit even if 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.390
 a half finger from the shelf to the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.390
 books is better because it circulates better 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.760
 air and it's not good to put the books 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.600
 back completely because it will not leave either 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.190
 pass the air 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.780
 I've noticed that in some books at 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.150
 put them glued to the wall of the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.280
 bookshelf have stayed this part of the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.890
 yellowish loin that is that if you can 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.890
 Leave him a few inches to breathe 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.560
 and this is the result 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.870
 As you can see, I had to play as if 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.000
 I will treat tetris as it always happens to me 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.280
 to put all the books including 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.010
 few votes left for me to put 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.380
 all and not leave me none out that yes 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.180
 you can appreciate that there are some that I 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.460
 have been a little higher than others 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.780
 but it is impossible to have everything 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.699
 perfect but more or less I have 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.010
 tried so that everything is not a 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:13.020
 same height and as I told you 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.580
 tried to have free holes for 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.560
 that can pass the air some me 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.090
 like to have as many shelves as 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.090
 to be able to put all the books in 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.600
 vertical way to have it put them like this 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.000
 and that are more crowded and less 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.169
 pretty in quotes but good for 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.729
 Now it's the only thing I can do 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.010
 hit me more and more shelves in the 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.389
 room and if you put some my mother I 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.010
 Check out my house I hope that I have 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.010
 liked the video and I have served you
