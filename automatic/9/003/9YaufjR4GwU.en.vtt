00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.499 

I<00:00:03.380> work<00:00:04.380> across<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:05.040> seven<00:00:05.430> Newton<00:00:05.759> area

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
I work across the seven Newton area

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.760 
I work across the seven Newton area
we're<00:00:07.049> going<00:00:07.140> to<00:00:07.200> take<00:00:07.350> each<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.680> these

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
we're going to take each of these

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.530 
we're going to take each of these
samples<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.340> glass<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.880> we're<00:00:09.389> going<00:00:09.510> to

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
samples of glass and we're going to

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.540 
samples of glass and we're going to
basically<00:00:09.900> impact<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.679> with<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.280> ball

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
basically impact it with this ball

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.480 
basically impact it with this ball
impact<00:00:12.349> demonstration<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.860> we<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.160> here<00:00:14.370> is

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
impact demonstration so we have here is

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.189 
impact demonstration so we have here is
the<00:00:14.610> alternative<00:00:15.089> alumina<00:00:15.540> silicate<00:00:15.929> glass

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the alternative alumina silicate glass

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.380 
the alternative alumina silicate glass
if<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.160> look<00:00:17.279> really<00:00:17.490> close<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.940> can<00:00:18.090> see<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
if you look really close you can see the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.660 
if you look really close you can see the
scratch<00:00:18.710> that's<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> glass<00:00:20.130> that

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
scratch that's in the glass that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.790 
scratch that's in the glass that
represents<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> sample<00:00:21.720> right<00:00:21.900> here<00:00:22.140> so

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
represents the sample right here so

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.540 
represents the sample right here so
we're<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.070> put<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.310> sample<00:00:23.760> envelope

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
we're going to put this sample envelope

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.749 
we're going to put this sample envelope
we're<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> impact<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.269> with<00:00:27.419> this<00:00:27.539> ball

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
we're going to impact it with this ball

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.040 
we're going to impact it with this ball
and<00:00:29.759> we're<00:00:29.939> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> happen<00:00:30.419> is<00:00:30.509> a<00:00:30.570> failure

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
and we're going to happen is a failure

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.889 
and we're going to happen is a failure
of<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.439> sample<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.759> scratch<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.540> very

that what we're going to do is we're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.670 
that what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:09.290> to<00:01:09.350> ratchet<00:01:09.710> this<00:01:09.830> up<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:10.130> little<00:01:10.370> bit

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
going to ratchet this up a little bit

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.510 
going to ratchet this up a little bit
we're<00:01:12.160> going<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.340> increase<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.240> energy<00:01:13.390> by<00:01:13.780> 3x

we're going to increase the energy by 3x

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.310 
we're going to increase the energy by 3x
and<00:01:15.520> we're<00:01:15.640> going<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:15.820> take<00:01:15.970> actually<00:01:16.510> piece

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
and we're going to take actually piece

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.110 
and we're going to take actually piece
of<00:01:17.470> aluminum<00:01:17.950> that's<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.460> same<00:01:18.640> thickness<00:01:18.880> as

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
of aluminum that's the same thickness as

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.300 
of aluminum that's the same thickness as
the<00:01:19.180> glass<00:01:19.480> just<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.900> demonstrate<00:01:20.190> kind<00:01:21.190> of

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
the glass just to demonstrate kind of

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.380 
the glass just to demonstrate kind of
energy<00:01:21.460> of<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:21.910> impact<00:01:22.030> that<00:01:22.510> you<00:01:22.630> see<00:01:22.810> here

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.660 

this<00:01:25.870> year

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
this year

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.240 
this year
what<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:28.790> can<00:01:28.970> see<00:01:29.380> is<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:30.560> puts<00:01:30.830> a<00:01:30.920> really

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
what you can see is that puts a really

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.880 
what you can see is that puts a really
nice<00:01:31.430> debt<00:01:31.729> initiative<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.440> we're<00:01:33.560> not<00:01:33.650> joking

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
nice debt initiative so we're not joking

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.290 
nice debt initiative so we're not joking
around<00:01:34.130> in<00:01:34.460> terms<00:01:34.670> of<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.850> amount<00:01:34.940> of<00:01:35.120> energy

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
around in terms of the amount of energy

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.790 
around in terms of the amount of energy
that<00:01:35.540> we're<00:01:35.780> putting<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.110> in<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.260> glass<00:01:36.470> which

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
that we're putting it in the glass which

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.390 
that we're putting it in the glass which
are<00:01:37.010> all<00:01:37.400> on<00:01:37.640> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
are all on it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.470 
are all on it
we<00:01:38.910> can<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.210> same<00:01:39.600> drop

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
we can do that same drop

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.620 
we can do that same drop
with<00:01:41.780> Gorilla<00:01:42.050> Glass<00:01:42.200> 3<00:01:42.260> again

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.850 
in a nice rebound still no failure in
the<00:01:50.670> sample

the sample

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.410 
the sample
and<00:01:53.190> that's<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.550> scratch<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.390> over

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and that's the scratch that you see over

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.700 
and that's the scratch that you see over
here<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.990> scratches<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.650> here<00:01:55.860> example

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
here the scratches you see here example

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.590 
here the scratches you see here example
but<00:01:58.220> not<00:01:58.340> even<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.729> stop<00:01:58.940> there<00:01:59.180> we<00:01:59.330> can<00:01:59.479> take

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
but not even to stop there we can take

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.270 
but not even to stop there we can take
the<00:01:59.750> same<00:01:59.930> sample<00:02:00.409> over<00:02:00.680> here<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:00.979> put<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.190> on

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
the same sample over here and put it on

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.210 
the same sample over here and put it on
our<00:02:01.310> leopard<00:02:01.640> press

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.310 

we<00:02:04.730> can<00:02:05.210> load<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.600> all<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.930> way<00:02:06.020> up<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.170> a

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
we can load this all the way up to a

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.150 
we can load this all the way up to a
hundred<00:02:06.500> pounds

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
hundred pounds

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.910 
hundred pounds
and<00:02:09.430> will<00:02:09.700> not<00:02:09.850> break<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:11.410> increase<00:02:11.770> to
