00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:02.400
 good day 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.350
 and welcome Slomka coach in the 1 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.289
 Mukran Counselor Jong 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.909
 I made this show 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.689
 I believe you to the small car Spark 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:19.000
 there are many youtube videos Elber the harmonica of which are but 70 percent 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:21.310
 of which not 20% in Spanish 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.310
 thus remains very little 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.259
 are really there 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.429
 Motors work, so to speak 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.050
 one can archive a small one 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.300
 I have also seen quite a lot on the internet but that costs money 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.730
 it gives people the FOM with the harmonica and thinks for what 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.480
 I have to buy it all 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.110
 I found Klein which fire one day 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.400
 I too am your things like that 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.090
 I give some kind of advice 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.520
 here on YouTube 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.180
 and 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.030
 give reviews about different mother Monika Somalia Oscar 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.590
 or something completely different or 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.150
 especially in terms of before 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.890
 For example, this point called itself the self-determined 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.440
 be glued colorful 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.750
 or maybe this harmonica is going to be criticized maybe it sees everything 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.750
 explained one builds something like that 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.620
 If you set yourself apart from the great man with the harmonica games 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.590
 for most, come read here 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.990
 Use small suitcases to use or store their Hartz Wenzel 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.540
 play 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.230
 yes, there are always people on 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.920
 this particular 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.000
 no microphone 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 which is not the best thing that made a good game 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.550
 if you have stuff like that 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.730
 and how would 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.730
 kept 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.990
 you can see already 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.330
 MÃ¼nster what special provided the talent must also be clear 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.220
 otherwise sentence 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.630
 the white tape in front of video 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.959
 also get by the stars 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.739
 the videos follow 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.739
 JPY lifted the shield when I first worsened 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.110
