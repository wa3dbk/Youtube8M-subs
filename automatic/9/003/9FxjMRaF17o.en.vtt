the<00:00:21.390> digital<00:00:21.840> age<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.500> indeed<00:00:22.949> corrupting<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the digital age is indeed corrupting the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.140 
the digital age is indeed corrupting the
world<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.090> photography<00:00:26.210> okay

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
world of photography okay

world of photography okay
the<00:00:30.150> problem<00:00:30.599> with<00:00:30.779> digital<00:00:31.199> photography

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the problem with digital photography

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.749 
the problem with digital photography
it's<00:00:31.949> too<00:00:32.219> easy

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
it's too easy

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.310 
it's too easy
and<00:00:33.410> once<00:00:34.410> things<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.370> too<00:00:35.550> easy<00:00:35.930> people<00:00:36.930> get

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
and once things get too easy people get

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.709 
and once things get too easy people get
sloppy<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:39.680> and<00:00:40.850> sloppiness<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.239> not<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> good

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
sloppy and and sloppiness is not a good

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.290 
sloppy and and sloppiness is not a good
thing<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.110> photography<00:00:44.120> even<00:00:45.120> though

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
thing in photography even though

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.350 
thing in photography even though
photography<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.930> fairly<00:00:46.820> simple<00:00:47.820> stuff<00:00:48.329> but

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
photography is fairly simple stuff but

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.439 
photography is fairly simple stuff but
still<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:51.030> was<00:00:51.980> non<00:00:52.980> digital<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.760> still<00:00:54.059> took<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
still it was non digital it still took a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.270 
still it was non digital it still took a
little<00:00:54.809> bit<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.079> effort<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.770> little<00:00:56.070> bit<00:00:56.190> of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
little bit of effort a little bit of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.240 
little bit of effort a little bit of
thought<00:00:56.690> but<00:00:57.690> now<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> think<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.530> chimpanzee

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
thought but now I think a chimpanzee

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.990 
thought but now I think a chimpanzee
with<00:00:59.280> a<00:01:00.260> digital<00:01:01.260> camera<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.730> pretty

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
with a digital camera can get pretty

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600 
with a digital camera can get pretty
good<00:01:03.180> results<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.809> well<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.949> at<00:01:05.040> least<00:01:05.280> not

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
good results as well or at least not

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.230 
good results as well or at least not
good<00:01:05.850> results<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:07.159> visible<00:01:08.159> results<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.090> I

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
good results but visible results and I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.399 
good results but visible results and I
think<00:01:09.270> that's<00:01:09.950> that's<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.100> problem<00:01:11.460> too<00:01:11.939> easy

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
think that's that's the problem too easy

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
think that's that's the problem too easy
too<00:01:13.409> much<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:16.100> maybe<00:01:17.100> not<00:01:17.430> too<00:01:17.700> much<00:01:17.850> thinking

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
too much and maybe not too much thinking

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.010 
too much and maybe not too much thinking
behind<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.250> don't<00:01:20.250> mean<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.780> insult<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
behind it I don't mean to insult the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.080 
behind it I don't mean to insult the
chimpanzees<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.070> play<00:01:23.310> quite<00:01:23.880> good

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
chimpanzees in the play quite good

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.539 
chimpanzees in the play quite good
photographers

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.639 

well<00:01:29.180> my<00:01:29.359> best<00:01:29.509> pictures<00:01:29.990> are<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.289> ones<00:01:30.469> I

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
well my best pictures are the ones I

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.669 
well my best pictures are the ones I
haven't<00:01:30.829> taken<00:01:31.130> absolutely<00:01:31.789> I<00:01:35.679> suppose

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
haven't taken absolutely I suppose

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.359 
haven't taken absolutely I suppose
anything<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:37.340> survives<00:01:39.009> in<00:01:40.009> street

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
anything that survives in street

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.660 
anything that survives in street
photography<00:01:41.289> is<00:01:42.289> probably<00:01:43.159> something<00:01:43.490> that

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
photography is probably something that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.090 
photography is probably something that
is<00:01:43.939> good<00:01:44.210> I'm<00:01:44.840> not<00:01:45.020> sure<00:01:45.409> that<00:01:45.590> there's<00:01:45.799> more

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
is good I'm not sure that there's more

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.940 
is good I'm not sure that there's more
of<00:01:46.219> black<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:46.700> white<00:01:46.850> photography<00:01:47.950> than

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
of black and white photography than

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.830 
of black and white photography than
color<00:01:49.159> photography<00:01:49.429> I<00:01:50.149> think<00:01:50.990> that<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:53.659> black

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
color photography I think that the black

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.480 
color photography I think that the black
and<00:01:54.049> white<00:01:54.170> photography<00:01:54.319> that<00:01:54.920> there<00:01:55.100> is<00:01:55.250> is

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
and white photography that there is is

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.350 
and white photography that there is is
the<00:01:55.610> one<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.969> survives<00:01:56.979> I<00:02:00.640> think<00:02:01.640> probably

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
the one that survives I think probably

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.719 
the one that survives I think probably
there's<00:02:02.810> much<00:02:03.020> more<00:02:03.349> color<00:02:03.890> photography<00:02:04.159> that

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
there's much more color photography that

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.940 
there's much more color photography that
is<00:02:04.759> street<00:02:05.329> photography<00:02:05.929> right<00:02:06.079> now<00:02:06.289> I<00:02:06.560> mean

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
is street photography right now I mean

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.270 
is street photography right now I mean
everybody<00:02:07.429> is<00:02:07.549> taking<00:02:07.909> colour<00:02:08.420> photography

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
everybody is taking colour photography

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.970 
everybody is taking colour photography
anybody<00:02:10.280> with<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.549> telephone<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.410> now<00:02:12.410> the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
anybody with the telephone is now the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.530 
anybody with the telephone is now the
street<00:02:13.310> photographer<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.690> by<00:02:15.349> sheer<00:02:15.709> numbers

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
street photographer so by sheer numbers

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.800 
street photographer so by sheer numbers
there<00:02:17.540> are<00:02:17.599> many<00:02:17.810> more<00:02:19.150> street<00:02:20.150> photographers

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
there are many more street photographers

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.940 
there are many more street photographers
that<00:02:20.840> are<00:02:21.730> taking<00:02:22.730> pictures<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.269> color<00:02:23.480> I

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
that are taking pictures in color I

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.410 
that are taking pictures in color I
think<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.310> black<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:25.519> white<00:02:25.849> ones<00:02:26.090> are<00:02:26.299> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
think the black and white ones are the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.420 
think the black and white ones are the
ones<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.840> have<00:02:27.410> a<00:02:27.440> little<00:02:27.709> bit<00:02:27.860> more<00:02:28.129> thought

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
ones that have a little bit more thought

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.520 
ones that have a little bit more thought
behind<00:02:28.819> them<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:29.180> there<00:02:29.959> was<00:02:30.140> one<00:02:30.379> that

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
behind them that's there was one that

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.059 
behind them that's there was one that
was<00:02:30.680> provided<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.310> think

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.759 

I<00:02:35.159> am<00:02:36.060> NOT<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:36.299> particularly<00:02:36.780> anxious<00:02:37.079> person

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
I am NOT a particularly anxious person

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.280 
I am NOT a particularly anxious person
so<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.010> don't<00:02:38.249> think<00:02:38.430> so

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.170 

when<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.320> take<00:02:44.650> pictures<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:45.100> dogs<00:02:45.460> I<00:02:45.820> certainly

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
when I take pictures of dogs I certainly

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.940 
when I take pictures of dogs I certainly
look<00:02:46.390> at<00:02:46.570> dogs<00:02:46.750> before<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.320> look<00:02:47.560> at<00:02:47.710> anything

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
look at dogs before I look at anything

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.700 
look at dogs before I look at anything
else<00:02:48.360> if<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.540> dog<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:49.930> interesting<00:02:50.410> if<00:02:50.560> the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
else if the dog is interesting if the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.680 
else if the dog is interesting if the
situation<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.520> dog<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.030> is<00:02:52.180> interesting

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
situation that dog is in is interesting

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.510 
situation that dog is in is interesting
then<00:02:53.680> then<00:02:54.550> I<00:02:54.880> might<00:02:55.360> take<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.660> picture<00:02:56.080> if

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
then then I might take a picture if

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.950 
then then I might take a picture if
other<00:02:58.350> circumstances<00:02:59.350> are<00:02:59.590> ripe

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.970 

is<00:03:04.240> I<00:03:05.240> see<00:03:05.660> my<00:03:05.870> best<00:03:06.080> pictures<00:03:06.350> when<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.770> don't

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
is I see my best pictures when I don't

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.580 
is I see my best pictures when I don't
have<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.190> camera<00:03:07.720> but<00:03:08.720> at<00:03:08.810> least<00:03:08.960> they<00:03:09.200> think<00:03:09.260> I

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
have a camera but at least they think I
