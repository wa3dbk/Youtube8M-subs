00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.500
 you're going to have to go to the supermarket 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.560
 buy the ingredients and put together the 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.690
 satisfied recipe or is an ice cream is a 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.890

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.870
 credits are super easy to be alone 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.760

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.090
 let's put it inside these little cups 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.610
 baked cream up a lot and 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.210

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.190
 work on this sponge cake lie and 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.469
 I told you previously recipes with things 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.809
 bought for example the biscuit of what 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.030
 we clearly buy al and pozuelo we read 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.579
 the instructions and we do it in 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.059
 this case has three eggs a cup of 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.460
 milk and nothing more to beat in the box 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.229
 that I bought said three eggs so 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.399
 let's incorporate three eggs we're going to 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.399
 add a cup of milk 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.000
 let's beat the eggs with the milk 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.240
 breaking the egg league well let's 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.910
 incorporate the polito can do it 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.680
 with electric mixer also eye is not 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.490
 that no trick because if not then no 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.170
 create it 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.260
 We will continue to beat until we finish 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.560
 to incorporate all the preparation of the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.560
 small box 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.520
 of peace 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.070
 one wash kilito not say I eat 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.380
 nothing and they're going to get these 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.030
 cones but in the superdome 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.220
 now we are going to fill the cups of 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.050
 ice cream with a little bit of the club 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.020
 we had made the biscuit super 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.910
 easy I advise you not to generate them 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.800
 they are all neighbors a little bit less than 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.550
 half because then they raise a 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.550
 heap in the oven 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.070
 the oven temperature 110 degrees a 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.000
 medium oven for 7 minutes and then 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.000
 already hot 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.319
 and we take it out of the oven we're going to leave 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.830
 cool and they will be so nice 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.830
 how is 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.360
 and now to decorate 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.760
 we buy the cream of the super we put it 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.390
 in a sleeve a peak and now we are going to 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.500
 decorating we do like this and they remain divine 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.500
 we make another 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.060
 we make another cleaner 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.420
 to what we are going to decorate with great 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.420
 musicians 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.410

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.410

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.410

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.180
 celestial and let's give a touch with a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.590
 pretty flower 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.719
 this is the east and you can use it 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.659
 for some birthday for a song 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:09.939
 special because they do not like these 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:16.329
 frost but how easy it is that they are and I 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:18.480

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:21.480

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.480
