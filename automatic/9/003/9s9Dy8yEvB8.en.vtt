00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
it's a the word to it and that is your

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.450 
it's a the word to it and that is your
breaking<00:01:01.210> point<00:01:01.480> it<00:01:01.719> to<00:01:02.199> it<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.739> that'll<00:01:03.280> make

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
breaking point it to it and that'll make

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:12.210 
breaking point it to it and that'll make
your<00:01:03.609> clock<00:01:03.910> like<00:01:04.720> this<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:11.890> got<00:01:12.040> your

try to practice - you've made about 30

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.270 
try to practice - you've made about 30
or<00:01:33.880> so<00:01:34.170> perfectly<00:01:35.170> when<00:01:35.710> you<00:01:35.829> can<00:01:36.100> make<00:01:36.250> a

or so perfectly when you can make a

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.999 
or so perfectly when you can make a
perfect<00:01:36.640> clock<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.780> go<00:01:37.990> on<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.530> next<00:01:38.680> step

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
perfect clock and go on to the next step

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.600 
perfect clock and go on to the next step
okay<00:01:39.579> next<00:01:40.180> step<00:01:40.500> once<00:01:41.500> you've<00:01:41.649> got<00:01:41.860> your<00:01:41.890> your

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
okay next step once you've got your your

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.319 
okay next step once you've got your your
clock<00:01:42.909> down<00:01:43.149> like<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:48.090> try<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.119> get<00:01:49.299> a

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
clock down like this try to get a

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.530 
clock down like this try to get a
two-tone<00:01:50.280> thing<00:01:51.280> going<00:01:51.610> on<00:01:51.759> so<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.149> sounds

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
two-tone thing going on so you sounds

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.810 
two-tone thing going on so you sounds
like<00:01:52.659> -<00:01:52.810> never<00:01:52.930> geeks<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:54.070> do<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.490> by

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
like - never geeks you do that by

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.480 
like - never geeks you do that by
different<00:01:55.600> breaths<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:56.200> short<00:01:56.770> burst<00:01:57.189> of<00:01:57.340> air

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
exaggerated burst of air and you can you

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.179 
exaggerated burst of air and you can you
can<00:02:03.460> grit<00:02:03.939> out<00:02:04.149> of<00:02:04.299> your<00:02:04.450> throat<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.590> or
