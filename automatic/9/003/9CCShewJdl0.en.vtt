00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
starship fill I'll get a little bit of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.999 
starship fill I'll get a little bit of
the<00:01:24.960> rust<00:01:25.710> into<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.200> it's<00:01:28.200> very<00:01:28.530> thin<00:01:28.890> I

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the rust into there and it's very thin I

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.789 
the rust into there and it's very thin I
just<00:01:29.220> start<00:01:29.400> painting<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> panel<00:01:30.799> take

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
just start painting it on the panel take

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.899 
just start painting it on the panel take
more<00:01:32.100> thinner<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.380> start<00:01:34.380> blending<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:35.009> over

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
more thinner and start blending it over

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.630 
more thinner and start blending it over
the<00:01:36.030> panel<00:01:36.479> make<00:01:37.079> sure<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.950> wet<00:01:38.250> each

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the panel make sure that you wet each

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.999 
the panel make sure that you wet each
individual<00:01:39.450> panel<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:40.079> over<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.770> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
individual panel all over so that you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.490 
individual panel all over so that you
don't<00:01:41.189> get<00:01:41.340> any<00:01:41.630> paint<00:01:42.630> drip<00:01:43.020> marks<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.470> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
don't get any paint drip marks so you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.109 
don't get any paint drip marks so you
don't<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.979> dried<00:01:44.250> edges<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.880> drives

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
don't see the dried edges if it drives

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.319 
don't see the dried edges if it drives
the<00:01:45.780> edges<00:01:46.049> dry<00:01:46.259> inside<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> panel<00:01:47.130> line<00:01:47.340> not<00:01:48.299> a

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the edges dry inside a panel line not a

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.090 
the edges dry inside a panel line not a
problem<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.290> you're<00:01:49.649> basically

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
problem you just you're basically

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.889 
problem you just you're basically
filling<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.610> panels<00:01:50.939> lines<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> wash

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
filling in two panels lines like a wash

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.800 
filling in two panels lines like a wash
if<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.740> dries<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> middle<00:01:53.549> doesn't<00:01:54.540> look

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
if it dries in the middle doesn't look

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.010 
if it dries in the middle doesn't look
so<00:01:54.990> good<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:56.430> did<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.149> panel<00:01:57.600> with

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
so good so I did that panel with

so good so I did that panel with
starship<00:01:58.890> filth<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> little<00:01:59.610> rust<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
starship filth and a little rust the

blue a little bit of the dark mud and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.580 
blue a little bit of the dark mud and
let's<00:02:06.450> start<00:02:06.689> at<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.020> side

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.580 

and<00:02:11.209> notice<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.300> don't<00:02:12.360> fill<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.930> whole<00:02:13.110> panel

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and notice I don't fill the whole panel

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.460 
and notice I don't fill the whole panel
in<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.040> make<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.060> kind<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.360> gradation<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:16.230> just

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
in I make it kind of a gradation I just

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.780 
in I make it kind of a gradation I just
um<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.980> whole<00:02:17.099> panel<00:02:17.400> gets<00:02:17.520> filled<00:02:17.730> with

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
um the whole panel gets filled with

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.210 
um the whole panel gets filled with
thinner<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.110> thinners<00:02:19.440> used<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.860> blend

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
thinner but the thinners used to blend

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.660 
thinner but the thinners used to blend
the<00:02:20.370> color<00:02:20.780> over<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> whole<00:02:22.080> panel<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.430> this

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the color over the whole panel so this

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.270 
the color over the whole panel so this
panel<00:02:24.030> ends<00:02:24.510> up<00:02:24.599> being<00:02:24.840> slightly<00:02:25.800> different

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
panel ends up being slightly different

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.670 
panel ends up being slightly different
and<00:02:26.400> tone<00:02:26.610> than<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.209> one<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:27.780> there's<00:02:28.620> a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and tone than this one so there's a

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.920 
and tone than this one so there's a
little<00:02:28.769> bit<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.099> contrast<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.360> blue<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
little bit of a contrast the blue and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.229 
little bit of a contrast the blue and
the<00:02:31.140> rust<00:02:31.410> perfect<00:02:32.069> contrast<00:02:32.430> together<00:02:32.910> for

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
the rust perfect contrast together for

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.270 
the rust perfect contrast together for
doing<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.660> sort<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.080> thing

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
doing this sort of thing

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.309 
doing this sort of thing
alright<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.120> panel<00:02:36.540> here<00:02:36.810> I'm<00:02:37.019> going<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
alright this panel here I'm going to

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.309 
alright this panel here I'm going to
leave<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.650> panel<00:02:38.150> unpainted<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.959> also

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
leave this panel unpainted that also

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.050 
leave this panel unpainted that also
gives<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.950> nice<00:02:41.099> contrast<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:41.880> going<00:02:41.970> to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
gives a nice contrast so it's going to

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.270 
gives a nice contrast so it's going to
be<00:02:42.180> lighter<00:02:42.470> now<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.530> notice<00:02:43.799> we<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:44.069> some

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
be lighter now you notice we have some

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.580 
be lighter now you notice we have some
detail<00:02:44.670> areas<00:02:45.209> here<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.750> little<00:02:46.170> bits<00:02:46.500> of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
detail areas here a little bits of

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.309 
detail areas here a little bits of
detail<00:02:46.769> here<00:02:47.190> some<00:02:47.400> pipe<00:02:47.640> here's<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.780> edge<00:02:48.959> of

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
detail here some pipe here's the edge of

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.030 
detail here some pipe here's the edge of
this<00:02:50.010> little<00:02:50.250> corridor<00:02:50.580> section<00:02:51.330> here<00:02:52.040> next

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
this little corridor section here next

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.479 
this little corridor section here next
to<00:02:53.220> those<00:02:53.400> what<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.030> do<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.430> to

add a little bit of darker color so I'm
going<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.709> add<00:02:58.890> some<00:02:59.730> dark<00:03:00.530> starship<00:03:01.530> filth

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
going to add some dark starship filth

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.530 
going to add some dark starship filth
along<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.310> edge<00:03:02.489> here<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:04.590> I'll<00:03:04.739> take<00:03:04.980> some

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
along the edge here and I'll take some

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.870 
along the edge here and I'll take some
rust<00:03:06.540> blend<00:03:07.260> some<00:03:07.470> rust<00:03:07.769> over<00:03:07.950> this<00:03:08.220> way<00:03:08.489> and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880

rust blend some rust over this way and
what<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.420> does<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:09.959> creates

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
what that does is that creates

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.620 
what that does is that creates
artificial<00:03:10.980> shadows<00:03:11.610> which<00:03:11.910> is<00:03:12.090> very<00:03:12.360> nice

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
artificial shadows which is very nice

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.490 
artificial shadows which is very nice
for<00:03:13.110> adding<00:03:13.739> depth<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.220> model<00:03:15.019> also<00:03:16.019> going

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
for adding depth to the model also going

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.370 
for adding depth to the model also going
to<00:03:16.560> take<00:03:16.739> some<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.660> starship<00:03:18.660> filth<00:03:18.989> in

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
to take some of the starship filth in

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.289 
to take some of the starship filth in
add<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> little<00:03:19.859> bit<00:03:20.100> next<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.060> detail

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299

if you find it getting into other panels

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.830 
if you find it getting into other panels
you<00:03:50.220> can<00:03:50.370> just<00:03:50.579> blend<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.970> around<00:03:51.269> it's<00:03:51.660> not<00:03:51.780> a

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you can just blend it around it's not a

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.229 
you can just blend it around it's not a
big<00:03:52.049> deal<00:03:52.260> because<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.950> know<00:03:53.040> it's<00:03:53.190> adds<00:03:53.700> to

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
big deal because you know it's adds to

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.690 
big deal because you know it's adds to
the<00:03:54.359> overall<00:03:54.690> look<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.200> being<00:03:55.380> dirty<00:03:55.700> so

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
the overall look of it being dirty so

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.789 
the overall look of it being dirty so
this<00:03:56.880> panel<00:03:57.120> here<00:03:57.600> had<00:03:57.840> some<00:03:58.049> rust<00:03:58.319> I'll<00:03:58.650> add

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
this panel here had some rust I'll add

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.569 
this panel here had some rust I'll add
some<00:03:59.040> blue<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.730> some<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:02.790> starship<00:04:03.239> fill<00:04:04.579> get

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
some blue and some the starship fill get

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.640 
some blue and some the starship fill get
that<00:04:05.790> work<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.299> in<00:04:06.510> there<00:04:07.430> blend<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.549> around

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
that work that in there blend it around

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.229 
that work that in there blend it around
what's<00:04:10.650> nice<00:04:10.859> about<00:04:10.889> blending<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:11.850> with<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
what's nice about blending it with the

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.090 
what's nice about blending it with the
thinners<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:12.959> won't<00:04:13.170> see<00:04:13.350> brush<00:04:13.620> marks<00:04:14.010> so

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
thinners you won't see brush marks so

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.150 
thinners you won't see brush marks so
you<00:04:14.160> don't<00:04:14.340> have<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.549> worry<00:04:14.790> about<00:04:16.160> blending

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
you don't have to worry about blending

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.430 
you don't have to worry about blending
it<00:04:17.430> in<00:04:17.549> any<00:04:17.700> further<00:04:17.970> with<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.479> soft<00:04:18.840> brush<00:04:19.140> like

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
it in any further with a soft brush like

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.009 
it in any further with a soft brush like
we<00:04:19.590> were<00:04:19.709> doing<00:04:20.010> on<00:04:20.159> some<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.640> other

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
we were doing on some of the other

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.780 
we were doing on some of the other
sections<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.409> tutorial

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
sections of the tutorial

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.770 
sections of the tutorial
some<00:04:23.940> more<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.240> blue<00:04:24.420> because<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:24.690> think

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
some more of the blue because I think

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.960 
some more of the blue because I think
this<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.140> all<00:04:25.290> one<00:04:25.500> panel<00:04:25.770> so<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.520> try<00:04:26.700> to<00:04:26.730> keep

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
this is all one panel so I try to keep

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.560 
this is all one panel so I try to keep
individual<00:04:27.690> panels<00:04:28.140> consistent<00:04:29.000> across<00:04:30.000> if<00:04:30.450> I

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
individual panels consistent across if I

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.190 
individual panels consistent across if I
can

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
can

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.610 
can
although<00:04:32.010> doing<00:04:32.760> this<00:04:32.880> panel<00:04:33.240> blue<00:04:33.560> then<00:04:34.560> I'm

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
although doing this panel blue then I'm

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.960 
although doing this panel blue then I'm
going<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.800> add<00:04:34.950> a<00:04:34.980> little<00:04:35.220> bit<00:04:35.400> of<00:04:35.430> rust<00:04:35.700> into

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
going to add a little bit of rust into

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.660 
going to add a little bit of rust into
it<00:04:36.240> as<00:04:36.360> well<00:04:36.770> have<00:04:37.770> fun<00:04:37.800> with<00:04:38.160> it<00:04:38.340> blend<00:04:38.640> colors

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
it as well have fun with it blend colors

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.220 
it as well have fun with it blend colors
you<00:04:41.670> know<00:04:41.790> make<00:04:42.210> it<00:04:42.240> look<00:04:42.360> grungy<00:04:42.900> make<00:04:43.110> it

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
you know make it look grungy make it

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.410 
you know make it look grungy make it
look<00:04:43.320> grimy<00:04:43.830> make<00:04:44.430> sure<00:04:44.580> each<00:04:44.760> panel<00:04:45.240> that's

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
look grimy make sure each panel that's

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.570 
look grimy make sure each panel that's
you<00:04:45.810> know<00:04:45.900> adjacent<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.530> each<00:04:46.560> other<00:04:46.830> its

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
you know adjacent to each other its

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.150 
you know adjacent to each other its
touching<00:04:47.850> is<00:04:48.350> different<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.740> get<00:04:49.950> some

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
touching is different so you get some

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.010 
touching is different so you get some
nice<00:04:50.310> contrast<00:04:50.970> going<00:04:51.420> on<00:04:51.600> because<00:04:51.900> that's

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
nice contrast going on because that's

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.470 
nice contrast going on because that's
what<00:04:53.010> this<00:04:53.160> step<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.640> all<00:04:53.820> about<00:04:54.120> just

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
what this step is all about just

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.210 
what this step is all about just
contrasting<00:04:55.230> panels<00:04:55.680> making<00:04:55.890> them<00:04:56.100> look

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
contrasting panels making them look

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.900 
contrasting panels making them look
different<00:04:57.410> now<00:04:58.410> continue<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:58.950> work<00:04:59.130> my<00:04:59.310> way<00:04:59.520> up

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
different now continue to work my way up

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.210 
different now continue to work my way up
this<00:05:00.180> way<00:05:00.420> I'll<00:05:01.170> finish<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.770> rest<00:05:02.040> of<00:05:02.160> the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
this way I'll finish the rest of the

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.360 
this way I'll finish the rest of the
model<00:05:02.610> it's<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.150> fun<00:05:03.390> step<00:05:04.100> takes<00:05:05.100> a<00:05:05.250> little

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
model it's a fun step takes a little

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.890 
model it's a fun step takes a little
while<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.820> do<00:05:05.970> because<00:05:06.450> you're<00:05:06.570> doing<00:05:06.660> each

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
while to do because you're doing each

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.500 
while to do because you're doing each
panel<00:05:07.410> individually<00:05:08.130> but<00:05:08.790> it's<00:05:09.240> kind<00:05:09.480> of

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
panel individually but it's kind of

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.180 
panel individually but it's kind of
relaxing<00:05:10.080> it's<00:05:10.230> kind<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.500> fun<00:05:10.710> this<00:05:10.980> is<00:05:11.100> the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
relaxing it's kind of fun this is the

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.560 
relaxing it's kind of fun this is the
part<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:11.520> enjoy<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.940> most<00:05:12.120> because<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.450> can

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
part I enjoy the most because you can

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.390 
part I enjoy the most because you can
just<00:05:12.660> sit<00:05:12.900> here<00:05:13.200> you<00:05:13.650> can<00:05:13.800> come<00:05:13.980> back<00:05:14.130> to<00:05:14.310> it

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
just sit here you can come back to it

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.890 
just sit here you can come back to it
later<00:05:14.430> because<00:05:15.000> it's<00:05:15.180> oil<00:05:15.450> paint

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
later because it's oil paint

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.050 
later because it's oil paint
if<00:05:15.990> you<00:05:16.440> screw<00:05:16.740> something<00:05:16.770> up<00:05:17.280> oil<00:05:17.670> paint

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
if you screw something up oil paint

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.480 
if you screw something up oil paint
cleans<00:05:18.720> up<00:05:18.900> very<00:05:19.140> nicely<00:05:19.410> and<00:05:19.860> come<00:05:20.190> back<00:05:20.310> an

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
cleans up very nicely and come back an

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.910 
cleans up very nicely and come back an
hour<00:05:20.610> later<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.150> wipe<00:05:21.840> this<00:05:22.050> off<00:05:22.290> and<00:05:22.560> work<00:05:22.710> on

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
hour later and wipe this off and work on

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.150 
hour later and wipe this off and work on
it<00:05:23.070> again<00:05:23.280> if<00:05:23.460> I<00:05:23.550> wanted<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:25.650> next<00:05:25.890> part<00:05:26.130> of

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
it again if I wanted to the next part of

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.850 
it again if I wanted to the next part of
the<00:05:26.250> tutorial<00:05:27.080> pretty<00:05:28.080> sure<00:05:28.350> is<00:05:28.500> going<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.710> be

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
the tutorial pretty sure is going to be

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.470 
the tutorial pretty sure is going to be
the<00:05:28.980> streaking<00:05:29.340> where<00:05:29.970> I'm<00:05:30.090> going<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.330> take

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
the streaking where I'm going to take

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.060 
the streaking where I'm going to take
different<00:05:30.870> colors<00:05:31.170> and<00:05:31.470> do<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.800> the

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
different colors and do the the

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.180 
different colors and do the the
weathered<00:05:32.730> streaks<00:05:33.210> on<00:05:33.450> here<00:05:33.870> but<00:05:34.470> I'll<00:05:34.620> get

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
weathered streaks on here but I'll get

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.770 
weathered streaks on here but I'll get
to<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:35.340> when<00:05:35.610> I<00:05:35.640> get<00:05:35.760> to<00:05:35.910> it<00:05:36.180> thumb<00:05:36.360> this

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
to that when I get to it thumb this

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.570 
to that when I get to it thumb this
might<00:05:37.020> take<00:05:37.230> me<00:05:37.380> a<00:05:37.410> couple<00:05:37.470> days<00:05:37.920> so<00:05:38.310> it's

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
might take me a couple days so it's

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.880 
might take me a couple days so it's
going<00:05:38.700> to<00:05:38.760> obviously<00:05:39.330> have<00:05:39.540> to<00:05:39.720> dry<00:05:39.990> for<00:05:40.830> 24

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
going to obviously have to dry for 24

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.450 
going to obviously have to dry for 24
hours<00:05:41.640> after<00:05:41.880> I'm<00:05:42.180> done<00:05:42.830> umm<00:05:43.830> hopefully<00:05:44.130> won't

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
hours after I'm done umm hopefully won't

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.620 
hours after I'm done umm hopefully won't
take<00:05:44.670> too<00:05:44.820> long<00:05:44.850> that<00:05:45.210> hopefully<00:05:45.480> the

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
take too long that hopefully the

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.830 
take too long that hopefully the
humidity<00:05:46.140> will<00:05:46.950> you<00:05:47.610> know<00:05:47.670> ease<00:05:47.910> up<00:05:48.120> on<00:05:48.300> me<00:05:48.570> and

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
humidity will you know ease up on me and
