00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.530
 hello welcome again irish to yoga 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.200
 Today I will prepare a recipe 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.680
 and that is a super orange cake 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.670
 basic and to embellish the whole family 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.620
 while I go to the kitchen to 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.990
 prepare my ingredients I leave you the 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.079
 recipe so you know what you need to 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:40.940
 this guy who jen ingredients 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.690
 a cup of orange juice 250 grams 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.690
 of butter or margarine 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.210
 6 eggs 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.720
 3 cup prepared flour 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.670
 good cup and a half of sugar 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:02.280
 a teaspoon of baking powder 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:09.060
 and two teaspoons of orange sense 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.520
 ok the sugar the eggs the essence of 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.689
 orange 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.240
 when there was orange flour with 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.210
 notes extended now that it's 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.969
 previously greased 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.619
 I'm going to add the butter that the 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.659
 I took out 10 minutes from the refrigerator 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.829
 so that it softens a little bit with the 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.799
 sugar and it is very important to beat well 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.260
 these two ingredients either with a 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.980
 tablespoon 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.750
 the classic evil metal was a blender from 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.030
 hand speaks now since you 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.280
 prefer but every important one is 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.260
 fully integrate those two 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.940
 ingredients that are well mixed and 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.310
 in that way like a half hard dough 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.290
 as you are seeing once 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.900
 this happen let's add the three 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:01.170
 first eggs to one and we're going to add 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:04.030
 the second and the third new and we're going to 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.310
 continue to beat well integrating well 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.390
 these ingredients 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.330
 the important thing is to beat until you 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.000
 they want any kind of sugar that is 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.490
 a few minutes so that it does not remain 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.680
 absolutely no sugar group 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.010
 once I'm ready and ready we're going to 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.900
 add our sifted flour and here is 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.670
 a little annoying this process 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.020
 because the dough gets a little hard 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.030
 but it does not matter because you have to have 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.000
 patience and you have to do it from everyone 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.010
 let's mix and mix well 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.130
 until everything is mixed and we're going to 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.560
 add the fourth egg 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.090
 to loosen the dough a bit and make it 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.650
 more manageable to continue integrating 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.500
 all the ingredients like you 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.430
 are watching here I'm going to add the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.990
 second cup of flour sifted you 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.270
 he does not have a servant they can do it 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.670
 with a colander and if you do not want to open in 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.310
 xÃ tiva can add you directly not 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.190
 nothing happens is the same 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.990
 here the joke is to beat fast and follow 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.580
 integrating the ingredients I will 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:14.400
 add the fifth egg to come back 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.350
 to release this mass because with our 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.900
 flour is getting an ever 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.820
 little thicker until it is in the 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.810
 mass with you are watching and adding 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.790
 the third and last cup of flour is 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.730
 important to concentrate and have the 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.250
 patience because you have to integrate in 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.190
 life that flour since it is the last 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.440
 dust could be said 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.470
 it's going to harden the nasa and we're going to 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.580
 add the sixth and last so that 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.070
 release a little bit the mass that we are 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.640
 done is the procedure we are going to beat 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:54.000
 as we integrate suffering the 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:57.030
 ingredients for about 3 to 5 minutes 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.920
 that all this integrates well even 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.010
 until the buds as you are 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.010
 seeing 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.870
 integrated well all this time we're going to 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.410
 add the orange juice 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.400
 and we will continue to beat and beat 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.950
 until all this mixes well between 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.959
 the dough and the mass of solita is going to go 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.260
 so loosening as he endured a 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:29.610
 I'm going to add the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:33.180
 is the pse of oranges ok that is already the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.150
 last ingredient that you add 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.270
 ok and I will continue beating for about 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.150
 30 more minutes to ensure that all 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.730
 the ingredients are integrated ok 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.060
 let's continue bat and brad wound of 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.400
 until everything is well integrated 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.110
 once we have finished it is already 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.810
 our dough prepared to carry 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.570
 our mold to me personally I 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.930
 like to beat it with either a spoon or 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.820
 wooden stick as you are seeing from 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:08.840
 some plastic mint as you them 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:12.470
 accommodate but the important thing is to do 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.169
 wrap shakes we should mix all 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.810
 the mass in enveloping form is 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.120
 quite at the time of advice in 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.250
 listen to raise a little more than 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.940
 put more deposits here I have my 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:29.990
 mold already in butter dow and floured 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.169
 and very carefully add the whole dough 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.260
 we have already prepared earlier that 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.030
 incidentally smells delicious but good 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.820
 let's wait a little while 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.520
 well and while we're going to add 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.810
 until the last drop that in this 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.850
 container we will not leave 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.760
 absolutely nothing and look how nice and 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:55.900
 is our mass in our mountain here 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:58.520
 I have my oven preheated to 270 degrees 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.220
 celsius and we will place as we have 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.870
 seen our that for about 10 minutes 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.240
 more at this time we are going to leave the 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.979
 temperature at 200 degrees celsius 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.370
 we're going to leave it for about 30 or 40 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.370
 minutes 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:18.360
 and we are going to start the process of 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.490
 disassemble a small bag with a plate 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.759
 big a fountain the shoe what 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:27.270
 you want and have let's place 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:29.190
 and unmold ours that we're going to 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.080
 make sure they are well focused for 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.240
 that we do not fall out 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.939
 everything is so clear and we are going to 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.039
 give small twists and taps the 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.900
 sides above I will do whatever 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.099
 for a few minutes 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:47.590
 to cool down a bit and then I'm going to 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:49.960
 return with the turns I will start to 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.969
 dismantle with you also our 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.699
 analysis and moke that look at risk that 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:57.939
 is and I'm going to let it cool down for about 5 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:00.520
 10 minutes before cutting so you do not 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:02.349
 they left me in it as I can 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:07.260
 stop but it does not matter because it came out 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:11.910
 spongy and above all nutritious 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:14.550
 this video I do not like to subscribe to 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:18.350
 facebook twitter and instagram and see you 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.350
 in another video on Tuesday
