00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
called the prime grid the prime grid is

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.089 
called the prime grid the prime grid is
it's<00:00:20.660> an<00:00:20.750> exercise<00:00:20.990> that's<00:00:21.380> great<00:00:21.890> for

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.740 
coordination and also really good for
strengthening<00:00:24.439> your<00:00:24.829> hands<00:00:25.550> I<00:00:25.880> use<00:00:26.300> this<00:00:26.449> all

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
strengthening your hands I use this all

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.509 
strengthening your hands I use this all
the<00:00:26.779> time<00:00:27.109> when<00:00:27.470> warming<00:00:27.800> up<00:00:27.890> for<00:00:28.070> gigs<00:00:28.279> and

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
the time when warming up for gigs and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.890 
the time when warming up for gigs and
just<00:00:28.699> at<00:00:28.849> home

just at home
basically<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:30.619> prime<00:00:30.859> grid<00:00:31.220> is<00:00:31.550> a<00:00:32.509> building

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
basically the prime grid is a building

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.189 
basically the prime grid is a building
block<00:00:33.320> of<00:00:33.910> rudiments<00:00:34.910> a<00:00:35.089> series<00:00:35.510> of<00:00:35.570> notes<00:00:35.839> and

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
block of rudiments a series of notes and

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.890 
block of rudiments a series of notes and
I'm<00:00:37.070> going<00:00:37.220> to<00:00:37.280> do<00:00:37.400> this<00:00:37.579> in<00:00:37.730> six<00:00:37.970> sections<00:00:38.570> and

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
I'm going to do this in six sections and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.960 
I'm going to do this in six sections and
the<00:00:39.739> left<00:00:39.920> hand<00:00:40.190> is<00:00:40.430> always<00:00:40.610> going<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.879> be

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
the left hand is always going to be

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.420 
the left hand is always going to be
doing<00:00:41.120> doubles<00:00:41.600> two<00:00:42.019> notes<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:42.650> with<00:00:43.129> a<00:00:43.160> right

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
doing doubles two notes and with a right

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.490 
doing doubles two notes and with a right
leading<00:00:43.850> hand<00:00:44.120> we're<00:00:44.719> gonna<00:00:44.780> add<00:00:45.079> up<00:00:45.110> enough

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
leading hand we're gonna add up enough

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.100 
leading hand we're gonna add up enough
stars<00:00:45.800> with<00:00:46.010> one<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:46.640> we've<00:00:46.850> got<00:00:47.000> three<00:00:47.719> four

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
stars with one so we've got three four

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.080 
stars with one so we've got three four
five<00:00:48.590> six<00:00:48.980> seven<00:00:49.579> eight

five six seven eight
basically<00:00:50.629> so<00:00:51.289> let's<00:00:51.739> check<00:00:51.980> this<00:00:52.070> out

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
basically so let's check this out

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.340 
basically so let's check this out
alright<00:00:55.010> in<00:00:55.309> this<00:00:55.969> exercise<00:00:56.420> we're<00:00:57.170> going<00:00:57.260> to

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
alright in this exercise we're going to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.709 
alright in this exercise we're going to
play<00:00:57.559> all<00:00:57.859> six<00:00:58.340> patterns<00:00:58.820> over<00:00:59.059> a<00:00:59.269> quarter

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
play all six patterns over a quarter

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.259 
play all six patterns over a quarter
note<00:00:59.899> pulse<00:01:00.489> basically<00:01:01.489> this<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.000> great

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
note pulse basically this is great

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:03.939 
note pulse basically this is great
because<00:01:02.600> when<00:01:02.809> playing<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:03.350> odd<00:01:03.530> numbers

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
because when playing the odd numbers

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.010 
because when playing the odd numbers
such<00:01:04.190> as<00:01:04.369> three<00:01:04.729> five<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.239> seven<00:01:05.660> you're

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
such as three five and seven you're

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.290 
such as three five and seven you're
really<00:01:06.289> going<00:01:06.410> to<00:01:06.470> hear<00:01:06.649> the<00:01:06.800> polyrhythm<00:01:07.399> also

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
really going to hear the polyrhythm also

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.910 
really going to hear the polyrhythm also
we're<00:01:08.420> going<00:01:08.509> to<00:01:08.600> be<00:01:08.690> doing<00:01:08.869> each<00:01:09.229> pattern<00:01:09.590> in

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
we're going to be doing each pattern in

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.999 
we're going to be doing each pattern in
cycles<00:01:10.759> of<00:01:10.970> 80<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.259> let's<00:01:12.470> start<00:01:12.740> with<00:01:12.890> the

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
cycles of 80 so let's start with the

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.020 
cycles of 80 so let's start with the
triplets<00:01:15.280> okay<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.459> the<00:01:16.550> first<00:01:16.700> pattern

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
triplets okay and the first pattern

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.669 
triplets okay and the first pattern
we're<00:01:17.240> going<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.420> be<00:01:17.539> dealing<00:01:17.690> with<00:01:17.929> sixteenth

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:18.679 
we're going to be dealing with sixteenth

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:21.279 
we're going to be dealing with sixteenth
note<00:01:18.890> triplets<00:01:19.520> over<00:01:20.330> a<00:01:20.569> quarter<00:01:20.899> note<00:01:21.080> pulse

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
note triplets over a quarter note pulse

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.680 
note triplets over a quarter note pulse
with<00:01:21.860> our<00:01:22.009> foot<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.759> we're<00:01:23.450> going<00:01:23.569> to<00:01:23.599> be

doing eight repetitions of this and only
counting<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.470> first<00:01:27.679> note<00:01:28.009> of<00:01:28.310> each<00:01:28.849> cycle

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
counting the first note of each cycle

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.570 
counting the first note of each cycle
one<00:01:30.020> which<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.739> going<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:30.979> be<00:01:31.069> something<00:01:31.429> like

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
one which is going to be something like

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.310

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
like this now let's try that with the

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:25.330 
like this now let's try that with the
quarter<00:03:09.709> note<00:03:09.829> pulse<00:03:23.409> in<00:03:24.409> exercise<00:03:25.040> five

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
quarter note pulse in exercise five

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.920 
quarter note pulse in exercise five
we're<00:03:25.670> going<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.849> be<00:03:25.940> dealing<00:03:26.120> with<00:03:26.389> groups<00:03:26.720> of

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
we're going to be dealing with groups of

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.680 
we're going to be dealing with groups of
seven<00:03:27.349> this<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.680> absolutely<00:03:28.250> my<00:03:28.519> favorite<00:03:28.760> so

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
seven this is absolutely my favorite so

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.420 
seven this is absolutely my favorite so
we're<00:03:29.810> going<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.989> be<00:03:30.049> doing<00:03:30.349> five<00:03:30.980> notes<00:03:31.280> with

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
we're going to be doing five notes with

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.640 
we're going to be doing five notes with
the<00:03:31.549> right<00:03:31.730> hand<00:03:32.000> two<00:03:32.750> notes<00:03:32.989> with<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:33.470> left

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
repetitions are going to be cycles of

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.020 
repetitions are going to be cycles of
eight<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:04.900> I'll<00:05:05.020> count<00:05:05.260> them<00:05:05.440> one<00:05:05.830> two<00:05:06.030> three
