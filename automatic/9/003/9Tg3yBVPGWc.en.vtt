 accustomed to the 10 o'clock hour 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.469
 of the Pacific and good as we can see its 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.110
 invitation simply says hopefully 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.300

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.810
 center and will be held in the center of 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.579
 flynn

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.909
 more possible both on facebook 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.680
 like on twitter and when you leave 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.299
 work on this occasion number is not going 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.450
 to give time to make the video in the 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.729
 I work because as I am right now is 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.470
 Well I'm crazy with work 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.020
 I will not allow time I think I 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.570
 the video coming back but good all the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.590
 rumors point to that in this event 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.299
 let's see the long-awaited iPhone 6 with 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.270
 the two different versions that have been 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.970
 come driving the 4.7-inch and the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.729
 5.5 inches but the news does not 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.360
 are there are also expected now with 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.450
 this invitation that presents a 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.509
 device more than pointing to that could 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.220
 be the smart watch of cupertino because 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.110
 good 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.900
 I was already reading several pages about 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.959
 of this invitation and many say that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.940
 This shadow is reflected here 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:22.030
 shadow means that it could be 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.370
 a solar charge means that it goes 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.620
 Spending time means that you 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.460
 is running out of time and many say 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.370
 what could be the water and also the 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.610
 form here of the apple of this 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.180
 small curve that you see say you could 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.530
 become the flexible screen of the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.990
 Water 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.330
 rumors speculations and good 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.360
 simply they will stay there until 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.310
 apple say the opposite and good as much 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.630
 important for those of us who wish to have 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:03:00.130
 in our hands a future iphone 6 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:02.410
 it would be that they do not change the calendar of 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.870
 releases that is if we want to have 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.840
 As soon as possible, it would be good if 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.720
 will change this calendar but good in 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.170
 the new iphone should go on sale 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.330
 if everything is planned as it was on 19 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.690
 September although you have to have in 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.660
 rumors that say they have 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.860
 problems with production although according to 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.450
 the analyst 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.200
 jp morgan 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.650
 and ensures that it will not affect the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.099
 production of this device regarding 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.739
 to the next operating system this 28 is 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.900
 expected to be released for all 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.000
 world 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.670
 minutes later a few hours after the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.550
 keynote as we are used to 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.010
 and it could also be available already 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.069
 for everyone so full I turn to 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.890
 repeat a few hours or minutes after 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.920
 end the conference and good for 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.980
 last I come back a little back with this 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.230
 topic about the surprises that could be 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.860
 the the uach time ago the rumors 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.400
 pointed out that the camp nou would be 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.099
 end of this year for water but 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.549
 the latest leaks indicate that 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.880
 the presentation of iphone 6 is already 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.000
 sharing with water this 9 of 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.880
 September and finally good apple 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.370
 send the invitation on September 9 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.500
 they do not say much I just turn you to 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.980
 repeat is an invitation as already 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.820
 accustomed very minimalist and with the 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:42.490
 legend hopefully we could say more ok 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.600
 well these same rumors have pointed 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.250
 that water 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.430
 It will be presented by the company 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:54.370
 cupertino the same day the presentation 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:56.860
 It will be almost exactly 5 years 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.160
 after the presentation of the first 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.160
 iphone and how and how have we been talking 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.669
 as we have been pointing it will bring two 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:11.740
 models again I'll repeat it to you 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:14.620
 4.7 and 5.5 inches with a processor to 8 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.130
 all apple devices are 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.669
 expect it to be simply spectacular 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.400
 and I continue in my theory as I was 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:27.220
 saying in all the videos all the 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.430
 images that we have seen filtered all 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.230
 these 2000 iphone 6 all these 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.200
 pieces everything we've seen of the 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.690
 iphone 6 is going to be true like this is going to be 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.950
 true many say is that this iphone 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.650
 it is very ugly is 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.590
 iphone is horrible, everyone goes back to what 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.310
 same said the same with the iphone 4 4 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.660
 s with 55 s and everyone dies for a 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.690
 iphone ok 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.550
 this is it, I just believe and I continue 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.710
 maintaining my theory that it has 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.400
 lost the surprise factor we no longer 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.890
 Surprise because almost almost a year 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.380
 before we know how can be the 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.540
 new iphone because when they leave 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.700
 live when they take out the iphone 6 I can you 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.520
 ensure that in December they will be 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.620
 the rumors of iphone 7 or iphone 6s 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.600
 so is this technology guys 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.980
 the surprise factor is lost and 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.050
 simply when they present you the 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.590
 phone I do not know what makes it spectacular anymore 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:26.230
 because you've seen it all because it's not 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.930
 there is nothing that surprises you and good friends 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.850
 now yes I say goodbye September 9 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.190
