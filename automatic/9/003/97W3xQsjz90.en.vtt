 times from where I finally supported and 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.000
 there I do not do small area to be the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.590
 more precise possible 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.880

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.300
 always have patience for it to be 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.120
 the most accurate possible 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.600

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.360
 takes me away right where the shares manage three 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.210
 characters now I like to find 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.920
 with a character who finds himself 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.490
 finally leading the race 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.930
