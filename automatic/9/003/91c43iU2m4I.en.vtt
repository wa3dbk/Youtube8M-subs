00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
cells in their skin that go up and down

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.390 
cells in their skin that go up and down
and<00:01:35.670> they<00:01:36.299> actually<00:01:36.450> squeeze<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.560> cells<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and they actually squeeze the cells and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.020 
and they actually squeeze the cells and
color<00:01:38.640> pigment<00:01:39.180> goes<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.780> down<00:01:39.869> instantly

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
color pigment goes up and down instantly

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.210 
color pigment goes up and down instantly
changing<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> color<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.720> octopus

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
changing the color of the octopus

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.640 
changing the color of the octopus
once<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.030> got<00:01:45.150> threatened<00:01:45.570> again<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.290> bolted

the background so hopefully predators or
divers<00:02:04.530> won't<00:02:04.800> be<00:02:04.950> able<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.520> them<00:02:05.730> they're

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
divers won't be able to see them they're

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.840 
divers won't be able to see them they're
really<00:02:07.050> one<00:02:07.230> of<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.410> most<00:02:07.500> amazing<00:02:08.070> creatures

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
I've ever seen under the ocean highly

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
I've ever seen under the ocean highly

the night time these octopus are out

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.060 
the night time these octopus are out
during<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.970> day<00:02:18.000> most<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.570> time<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.080> at<00:02:19.860> night

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
during the day most of time and at night

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.640 
during the day most of time and at night
they<00:02:20.340> actually<00:02:20.820> take<00:02:21.120> round<00:02:21.510> rocks<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.440> line

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
they actually take round rocks and line

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.199 
they actually take round rocks and line
them<00:02:22.770> up<00:02:22.920> on<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> outside<00:02:23.700> edge<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.060> their

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
them up on the outside edge of their

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.080 
them up on the outside edge of their
hole<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.810> if<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.440> predator<00:02:25.740> comes<00:02:26.160> by<00:02:26.550> they

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
hole and if a predator comes by they

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.750 
hole and if a predator comes by they
pick<00:02:27.390> up<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.750> rocks<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.350> block<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:29.100> hole<00:02:29.310> so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
pick up the rocks to block the hole so

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.480 
pick up the rocks to block the hole so
the<00:02:29.880> predator<00:02:30.300> can't<00:02:30.570> get<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.900> after<00:02:31.110> them

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
the predator can't get in after them

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.190 
the predator can't get in after them
once<00:02:32.490> again<00:02:32.670> they're<00:02:33.030> really<00:02:33.330> truly<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> rare
