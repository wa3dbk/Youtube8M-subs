00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 hi girls all right today I will teach 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.360
 to you how to nail your nails with a 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.630
 white enamel with 12 500 not to 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.529
 to stain but we will use very 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.050
 white well what I chose white 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.600
 That first tip I had is enamel 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.140
 nails with a matte base or as the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.269
 matte coating of your choice and 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.390
 expect to be fine to pass the enamel 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.020
 white but always come back to the center 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.079
 the fields let the brush very enamel 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.379
 so you can leave more uniform 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.600
 step as many times as necessary in the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.770
 you will notice that in the first 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.850
 layer of enamel has almost 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.410
 still wet with hidden between enamel and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.590
 the tips of the nail for a better 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.739
 finish when you can see the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.899
 first layer she adhered well in the base 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.010
 Mathew we're just going to finish with a 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.310
 second layer to get all the uniform 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.479
 white in two layers and without 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.390
 no stain had 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.670
 Let's now hint at an enamel 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.360
 Translucent I used coconut milk from 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.479
 kolor ana again enamel emos with 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.689
 a matte base or matte cover 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.900
 to adhere well to enamel as letters 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.159
 lucid it handles much more than the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.369
 other 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.970
 expect the base to be fine and come with 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.259
 white enamel passing baton and 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.240
 quickly 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.950
 how translucent it is going to give 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.799
 that basic hatchet 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.680
 Let's clean the place and a second 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.100
 step when the enamel is well 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.149
 dry the enamel again with the base 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.780
 Matte 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.110
 let dry again and enamel with a 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.710
 white again if necessary you can 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.520
 make one more layer of white without 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.619
 matte enamel with finish like me 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.319
 this is the end result, I hope 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.020
