or whoever I don't necessarily think

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.740 
or whoever I don't necessarily think

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
is a warmer

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.910 
is a warmer
yeah<00:02:14.920> you<00:02:15.370> know<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.240> Brown<00:02:17.080> says<00:02:17.500> basically

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
yeah you know so Brown says basically

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.020

for the vacant Commonwealth title well I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.870

mean<00:02:26.230> maybe<00:02:26.470> Tyson<00:02:26.950> Fury<00:02:27.070> could<00:02:27.340> step<00:02:27.550> in<00:02:27.730> and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
mean maybe Tyson Fury could step in and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.820 
mean maybe Tyson Fury could step in and
be<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.720> other<00:02:28.870> corner<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.380> fight<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:29.740> the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
for the title I don't know if Lucas

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.690 
for the title I don't know if Lucas
Brown<00:02:31.270> maybe<00:02:31.450> feels<00:02:31.810> he<00:02:31.960> needs<00:02:32.140> another<00:02:33.100> fight

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
Brown maybe feels he needs another fight

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.490 
Brown maybe feels he needs another fight
to<00:02:33.850> prepare<00:02:34.150> himself<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.570> fury<00:02:34.810> or<00:02:35.020> no<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.230> don't

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
know I'm not really sure what that means

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.550 
know I'm not really sure what that means
or<00:02:37.150> maybe<00:02:37.360> he<00:02:37.540> was<00:02:37.660> just<00:02:37.810> responding<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.380> what

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.860 
or maybe he was just responding to what
fury<00:02:38.770> had<00:02:38.950> said<00:02:39.160> maybe<00:02:39.730> Brown<00:02:40.390> don't<00:02:40.630> see

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
fury had said maybe Brown don't see

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.780 
fury had said maybe Brown don't see
himself<00:02:41.020> as<00:02:41.350> a<00:02:41.410> warm-up<00:02:41.860> for<00:02:41.920> fury<00:02:42.340> maybe<00:02:42.640> he

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
himself as a warm-up for fury maybe he

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.880 
himself as a warm-up for fury maybe he
sees<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.150> as<00:02:43.210> a<00:02:43.360> serious<00:02:43.780> fight<00:02:43.990> for<00:02:44.200> fury<00:02:44.410> so
