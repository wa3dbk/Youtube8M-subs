00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.780
 hello youtube friends yo so do not 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.380
 3000 and today I'm teaching you how to 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:14.370
 repair the psp of an error because when 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.030
 you are playing do not let load well 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.940
 the pcpe data and turn it off when 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.670
 is loading a game or go out or 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.260
 they leave their example and then they go to 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.510
 where are your games and they no longer have 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.550
 nothing good there is because what they load 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.340
 the data and that causes 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.140
 here in some steve cloud folder 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.380
 and good 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.370
 can see various consequences 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.370
 remove t 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.600
 you delete some folders 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.660
 or it can already reach a consequence of 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.070
 Service brickell turns off your console 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:04.400
 and practically dies and there are some 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.010
 consoles that are repairable and there are 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.790
 other consoles than not for example the psp 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.840
 3000 is no longer good for me 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:18.030
 we will continue with the repair 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.119
 well let's connect our psp to the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.150
 computer and good we will leave something 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.890
 so get me up 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.800
 the data of the folder 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.870
 and here what you can see normal good by 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.140
 regular always if they see a folder 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.140
 what is game psp and you can see 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.430
 is not the game folder so it's 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.710
 only we're going right new folder 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.320
 and we are going to create the folder with 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.320
 capital letters are going to put you well 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.220
 and once that's done 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.479
 they go and now they have the games and good 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.940
 this has been all 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.280
 I'm looking forward to it and do not go back to 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.830

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.810
