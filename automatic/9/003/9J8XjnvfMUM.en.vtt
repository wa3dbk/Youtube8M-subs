all<00:00:01.230> right<00:00:01.469> that<00:00:01.680> have<00:00:01.800> discussed<00:00:02.310> in

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
all right that have discussed in

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.059 
all right that have discussed in
comparison<00:00:03.149> for<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.480> all

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
comparison for you all

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.680 
comparison for you all
what's<00:00:06.440> encouraged<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.730> tried<00:00:09.510> some

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
what's encouraged this is I tried some

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.680 
what's encouraged this is I tried some
of<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.870> matrix<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.370> heat<00:00:12.120> bike<00:00:12.360> based

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
of this matrix on a heat bike based

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.099 
of this matrix on a heat bike based
cooler<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:14.120> before<00:00:15.120> just<00:00:15.509> putting<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.900> dot

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
cooler and before just putting the dot

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.840 
cooler and before just putting the dot
in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.350> center<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.949> was<00:00:17.310> trying<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.520> get<00:00:17.670> these

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
in the center I was trying to get these

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.769 
in the center I was trying to get these
grooves<00:00:18.359> filled<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.789> and<00:00:20.789> trying<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.480> spread

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
grooves filled in and trying to spread

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.990 
grooves filled in and trying to spread
the<00:00:21.840> thermal<00:00:22.289> paste<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.800> there<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.340> found<00:00:23.640> it

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the thermal paste in there and found it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.349 
the thermal paste in there and found it
was<00:00:24.060> binding<00:00:24.960> up<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.650> too<00:00:25.920> viscous

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
was binding up it was just too viscous

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.030 
was binding up it was just too viscous
so<00:00:28.099> just<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.189> quick<00:00:29.369> comparison<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.449> some

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
so just a quick comparison of some

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.920 
so just a quick comparison of some

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.440 
ceramic i wanted to get some mx2 paste
that<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.280> people<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:18.090> they

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that a lot of people like but they

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.330 
that a lot of people like but they
didn't<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.689> any<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:18.960> stock<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.189> only

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
didn't have any in stock this was only

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.630 
didn't have any in stock this was only
eight<00:01:20.640> bucks<00:01:21.000> for<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.390> big<00:01:21.600> 22<00:01:22.110> gram<00:01:22.380> tube<00:01:22.740> so

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
eight bucks for this big 22 gram tube so

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.510 
eight bucks for this big 22 gram tube so
and<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:25.200> gonna<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.500> better<00:01:25.650> than<00:01:26.009> your

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and it's gonna be better than your

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.690 
and it's gonna be better than your
standard<00:01:26.759> silicon<00:01:27.509> paste<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.710> that's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
standard silicon paste so that's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.130 
standard silicon paste so that's
something<00:01:30.000> I'd<00:01:30.210> probably<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.750> use<00:01:30.810> for

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
something I'd probably want to use for

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.859 
something I'd probably want to use for
clients<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.880> gonna<00:01:33.060> last<00:01:33.360> me<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> long

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
clients and that's gonna last me a long

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.850 
clients and that's gonna last me a long
time<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.930> may<00:01:37.049> also<00:01:37.170> be<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.530> pace<00:01:37.829> that's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
time and it may also be a pace that's

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.359 
time and it may also be a pace that's
good<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.930> heat<00:01:39.930> pipe<00:01:40.140> says<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:41.009> gonna<00:01:41.189> bout

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
good for heat pipe says I'm gonna bout

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.050 
good for heat pipe says I'm gonna bout
to<00:01:41.490> find<00:01:41.640> out

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
to find out

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
to find out
so<00:01:42.540> first<00:01:42.990> I'm<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.259> going<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.950> try<00:01:45.649> how<00:01:46.649> well

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
so first I'm just going to try how well

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.380 
so first I'm just going to try how well
it<00:01:47.009> spreads<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.759> under<00:01:48.000> some<00:01:48.180> light

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
it spreads just under some light

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.410 
it spreads just under some light
pressure<00:01:50.119> just<00:01:51.119> by<00:01:51.299> pressure<00:01:51.570> spreading

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
pressure just by pressure spreading

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:02.860 
pressure just by pressure spreading
press<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.899> down

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.130 

all<00:02:03.870> right<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.350> before<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.740> flip<00:02:05.190> those<00:02:05.460> over

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
all right and before I flip those over

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.800 
all right and before I flip those over
just<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:08.240> they<00:02:09.240> all<00:02:09.360> seem<00:02:09.630> to<00:02:09.660> be

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
just to see they all seem to be

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.969 
just to see they all seem to be
spreading<00:02:10.260> all<00:02:10.410> right<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.770> by<00:02:10.920> applying

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
spreading all right just by applying

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.440 
spreading all right just by applying
pressure<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:12.750> course<00:02:12.930> with<00:02:13.140> heatpipes

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
pressure of course with heatpipes

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.790 
pressure of course with heatpipes
it's<00:02:15.450> particularly<00:02:15.840> relevant<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.590> want<00:02:16.740> to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
it's particularly relevant you want to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160 
it's particularly relevant you want to
be<00:02:16.860> able<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.070> spread<00:02:17.370> under<00:02:17.820> room<00:02:18.540> temperature

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
be able to spread under room temperature

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.860 
be able to spread under room temperature
so<00:02:19.440> let's<00:02:19.740> see<00:02:20.090> how<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.150> shin-etsu<00:02:21.840> spreads

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
so let's see how the shin-etsu spreads

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:34.180 
so let's see how the shin-etsu spreads
and<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:29.700> doesn't<00:02:30.240> seem<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.600> be<00:02:30.720> clumping<00:02:31.350> up<00:02:32.780> it

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and it doesn't seem to be clumping up it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.380 
and it doesn't seem to be clumping up it
resists<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.250> little<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.910> yeah<00:02:38.900> yeah<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.050> not

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
resists a little but yeah yeah it's not

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.940 
resists a little but yeah yeah it's not
it's<00:02:42.390> definitely<00:02:42.630> as<00:02:42.990> easy<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.380> spread<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.920> a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
it's definitely as easy to spread to a

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.810 
it's definitely as easy to spread to a
silicon<00:02:44.730> pace<00:02:45.030> for<00:02:45.270> example<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:47.280> not

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
silicon pace for example but it's not

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.380 
silicon pace for example but it's not
bad

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
bad

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.480 
bad
I'd<00:02:48.600> still<00:02:49.020> rate<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.530> original<00:02:50.130> Arctic

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
I'd still rate the original Arctic

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.170 
I'd still rate the original Arctic
silver<00:02:50.880> 5<00:02:51.440> as<00:02:52.440> easier<00:02:52.920> spread<00:02:53.400> okay<00:02:53.850> let's<00:02:54.060> try

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
silver 5 as easier spread okay let's try

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.020 
silver 5 as easier spread okay let's try
the<00:02:54.709> silver<00:02:55.709> matrix<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.730> one<00:02:56.880> that

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the silver matrix this is the one that

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.910 
the silver matrix this is the one that
was<00:02:57.120> giving<00:02:57.360> me<00:02:57.450> grief<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:59.810> yeah<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:01.290> more

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
was giving me grief and yeah it's more

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.720 
was giving me grief and yeah it's more
difficult

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
difficult

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.199 
difficult
it's<00:03:03.709> comping<00:03:04.709> up<00:03:04.860> more<00:03:05.480> than<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:08.209> should

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
it's comping up more than I should

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.960 
it's comping up more than I should
another<00:03:09.540> scrape<00:03:10.020> or<00:03:10.200> hua<00:03:12.110> then<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.730> shin

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
another scrape or hua then the the shin

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.070 
another scrape or hua then the the shin
is<00:03:15.000> here<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:16.739> as<00:03:17.519> I've<00:03:18.300> already<00:03:18.450> determined

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
is here so as I've already determined

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.430 
is here so as I've already determined
it's<00:03:19.230> not<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.590> best<00:03:20.420> we're<00:03:21.420> spreading<00:03:21.840> out<00:03:22.110> at

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
it's not the best we're spreading out at

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.350 
it's not the best we're spreading out at
room<00:03:22.709> temperature<00:03:22.739> on<00:03:24.620> course<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:26.100> see<00:03:26.910> diamond

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
room temperature on course I see diamond

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.240 
room temperature on course I see diamond
okay<00:03:27.480> this<00:03:27.900> one<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.260> know<00:03:28.320> it's<00:03:28.560> gonna<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.920> a

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
okay this one I know it's gonna be a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.620 
okay this one I know it's gonna be a
pain<00:03:29.489> in<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.670> butt<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.940> spread<00:03:30.300> because<00:03:30.510> I

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
pain in the butt to spread because I

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.080 
pain in the butt to spread because I
tried<00:03:30.900> initially<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.769> yeah<00:03:32.519> this<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
tried initially and yeah this is the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.430 
tried initially and yeah this is the
worst<00:03:35.150> do<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.600> try<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.900> spread<00:03:37.290> this

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
worst do you you try to spread this

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.900 
worst do you you try to spread this
stuff<00:03:37.739> out<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:37.980> it's<00:03:38.310> just<00:03:38.430> going<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.670> clump

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
stuff out and it's just going to clump

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.990 
stuff out and it's just going to clump
up<00:03:39.120> all<00:03:39.300> over<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.860> only<00:03:41.550> way<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.730> apply

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
up all over you the only way to apply

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.120 
up all over you the only way to apply
this<00:03:42.120> stuff<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.110> put<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.769> darkness

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
this stuff is to put that darkness

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.020 
this stuff is to put that darkness
Center<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:44.790> let<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.830> pressure<00:03:47.400> spread<00:03:47.880> it

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
Center and let the pressure spread it

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.900 
Center and let the pressure spread it
out<00:03:48.150> if<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:49.170> try<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.470> spread<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.489> out<00:03:50.580> by<00:03:50.730> hand

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
out if you try to spread it out by hand

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.330 
out if you try to spread it out by hand
you're<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:51.269> gonna<00:03:51.540> create<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.810> mess<00:03:52.340> all

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
you're just gonna create a mess all

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.050 
you're just gonna create a mess all
right<00:03:53.400> now<00:03:54.330> just<00:03:54.570> by<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.840> look<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.350> it

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.370 

if<00:03:59.300> it's<00:03:59.950> sheer<00:04:00.950> shininess<00:04:01.550> the<00:04:02.380> ceramic

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
if it's sheer shininess the ceramic

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.050 
if it's sheer shininess the ceramic
looks<00:04:03.620> like<00:04:03.830> that's<00:04:04.040> just<00:04:04.220> spread<00:04:04.880> like

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
looks like that's just spread like

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.910 
looks like that's just spread like
butter<00:04:05.300> here<00:04:05.860> yeah<00:04:08.050> this<00:04:09.050> just<00:04:09.230> as<00:04:09.470> easy<00:04:09.680> to

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
butter here yeah this just as easy to

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.130 
butter here yeah this just as easy to
spread<00:04:10.280> as<00:04:12.970> there's<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.240> standard<00:04:14.630> silicon

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
spread as there's the standard silicon

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.080 
spread as there's the standard silicon
base<00:04:15.440> from<00:04:15.680> looks<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.190> it<00:04:16.280> looking<00:04:16.880> things

we<00:04:17.959> got<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.970> g7<00:04:19.970> five<00:04:20.120> on<00:04:20.299> chin<00:04:20.510> itsu<00:04:20.780> paste

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
we got the g7 five on chin itsu paste

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.000 
we got the g7 five on chin itsu paste
did<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.100> decent<00:04:22.340> job<00:04:22.550> of<00:04:22.880> spreading<00:04:23.150> out<00:04:24.010> the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
did a decent job of spreading out the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.060 
did a decent job of spreading out the
