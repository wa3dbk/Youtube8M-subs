00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
refrigerator lemons are interesting

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770 
refrigerator lemons are interesting
because<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.039> juice<00:00:53.430> has<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.000> vitamin<00:00:54.449> C

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
because the juice has the vitamin C

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
because the juice has the vitamin C
which<00:00:55.230> acts<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.680> an<00:00:55.800> antioxidant<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
which acts as an antioxidant and the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.330 
which acts as an antioxidant and the
peel<00:00:57.300> has<00:00:57.600> lemon<00:00:57.930> oil<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> which<00:00:58.980> gives<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
peel has lemon oil in it which gives it

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.880 
peel has lemon oil in it which gives it
a<00:00:59.430> very<00:00:59.820> very<00:00:59.940> intense<00:01:00.629> flavor<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.649> that's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
a very very intense flavor and that's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.619 
a very very intense flavor and that's
the<00:01:02.070> reason<00:01:02.340> sometimes<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.910> recipes<00:01:03.420> will

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the reason sometimes your recipes will

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.649 
the reason sometimes your recipes will
call<00:01:03.660> for<00:01:03.960> both<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.400> how<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
call for both so how can you get the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600 
call for both so how can you get the
peel<00:01:06.869> off<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.170> your<00:01:07.439> lemon<00:01:07.740> there<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.580> a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
peel off of your lemon there are a

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.390 
peel off of your lemon there are a
number<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:09.000> different<00:01:09.390> ways<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:10.110> this

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
number of different ways to do this

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.510 
number of different ways to do this
sometimes<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:11.970> use<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.659> box<00:01:12.960> grater

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
sometimes I just use a box grater

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.370 
sometimes I just use a box grater
because<00:01:14.520> my<00:01:14.760> grater<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.240> has<00:01:15.930> very<00:01:16.290> small

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
because my grater here has very small

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.710 
because my grater here has very small
holes<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.670> take<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.060> lemon<00:01:18.509> and

cells<00:03:05.230> inside<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.830> release<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.370> juice<00:03:06.640> you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
cells inside to release the juice you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.000 
cells inside to release the juice you
probably<00:03:07.750> don't<00:03:08.110> want<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.500> do<00:03:08.680> what<00:03:08.860> my

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
I've cleaned it out pretty well and then

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.270 
I've cleaned it out pretty well and then
once<00:04:22.019> you've<00:04:22.169> got<00:04:22.199> the<00:04:22.470> juice<00:04:22.710> again<00:04:23.070> there's

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.460 
once you've got the juice again there's
so<00:04:23.460> many<00:04:23.580> uses<00:04:23.940> for<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.509> it's<00:04:24.780> great<00:04:25.289> in

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
so many uses for it it's great in

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.620 
so many uses for it it's great in
marinades<00:04:26.039> because<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.580> acid<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.270> lemon

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
marinades because the acid and the lemon

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.480 
marinades because the acid and the lemon
juice<00:04:27.660> will<00:04:27.960> help<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.259> tenderize<00:04:28.800> meat<00:04:29.190> and

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.279 
juice will help to tenderize meat and
poultry<00:04:29.699> so<00:04:30.180> that's<00:04:30.360> one<00:04:30.600> good<00:04:30.810> use<00:04:30.990> for<00:04:31.020> it

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
poultry so that's one good use for it

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.800 
poultry so that's one good use for it
it's<00:04:32.070> also<00:04:32.340> wonderful<00:04:32.759> in<00:04:33.060> salad<00:04:33.419> dressings

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
it's also wonderful in salad dressings

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.270 
it's also wonderful in salad dressings
so<00:04:33.930> instead<00:04:34.169> of<00:04:34.229> using<00:04:34.410> vinegar<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.160> your

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
so instead of using vinegar and your

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.090 
so instead of using vinegar and your
dressing<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:35.789> can<00:04:35.940> use<00:04:36.120> lemon<00:04:36.389> instead

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
dressing you can use lemon instead

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.260 
dressing you can use lemon instead
there's<00:04:38.100> another<00:04:38.340> trick<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:38.729> might<00:04:39.030> want<00:04:39.210> to

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
there's another trick you might want to

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.060 
there's another trick you might want to
try<00:04:39.479> it's<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.720> put<00:04:39.900> lemon<00:04:40.229> juice<00:04:40.259> in<00:04:40.410> rice<00:04:40.800> when

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
try it's to put lemon juice in rice when

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.890 
try it's to put lemon juice in rice when
you're<00:04:41.220> cooking<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.820> keeps<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.300> grains<00:04:42.660> from

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
you're cooking it keeps the grains from

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.450 
you're cooking it keeps the grains from
sticking<00:04:43.169> together<00:04:43.410> so<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:44.039> works<00:04:44.250> really

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
sticking together so that works really

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.490 
sticking together so that works really
well<00:04:44.729> and<00:04:45.509> the<00:04:45.720> other<00:04:45.840> thing<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.199> is<00:04:46.380> that

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
well and the other thing is is that

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.529 
well and the other thing is is that
because<00:04:46.620> again<00:04:47.220> it<00:04:47.400> has<00:04:47.550> the<00:04:47.729> vitamin<00:04:48.120> C<00:04:48.360> you

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
because again it has the vitamin C you

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.360 
because again it has the vitamin C you
can<00:04:48.720> put<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.080> on<00:04:49.229> top<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.710> things<00:04:49.860> like<00:04:50.130> fruit
