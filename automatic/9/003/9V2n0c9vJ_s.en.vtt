00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.289
 past my present and my future 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.110

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.240
 darker my dreams my labia the rage 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.700
 of the volcano that happened and took home 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.530
 in babia I continue with my notebook it makes you 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.140
 sick is designing me the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.720
 hell is your enemy worth his punishment too 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.790

 theme rhythm sorrows and regrets my tears 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.589
 falls as many as the water of the seas 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.750
 I also hate rhyme in every wounded folio 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.789
 cousin there are a million stones in the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.370
 ground of the road because it is difficult to advance 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.590
 how to stop to think that your knuckles 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.539
 they have blood after they explode and it's 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.180
 that life goes so fast that sometimes 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.789
 only the pain makes you remember the cradle 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.670
 where do you get and there I'm reciting that 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:11.130
 this is the soundtrack of the soul 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.649
 raw of the alive and meco and bing too much 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.289
 time was the time to choose for that 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.300
 I came slow but here I am giving me what 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.700
 that I carry inside and is for you the 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.220
 rumble of my intense birth I tell you 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.630
 I am like that or at least I tried 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.090
 a straight rhythm 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.159
 in the echo of the temple today for singing 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.320
 to the fear that you have and that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.180
 you deny the good feelings that you 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.850
 heart trains me but everything is so 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.649
 confused it seems that god can no longer look 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 to the beautiful glow of the sun because I 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.170
 blind like this is life avoid disappointments 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.299
 or throw yourself into the pool just because you 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.060
 you assume it 's full of water and not 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.909
 empty depends on your decisions you 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.130
 sadness or joy although sometimes without 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.860
 reason you toss and no day you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.110
 teach to create it when that beast comes 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.909
 It is so miserable and heavy on your 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.909
 shoulders should be strong and give the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.399
 final lunge while the children are 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.649
 The blood is spilled The bitterness pours 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.450
 of perversion it kills you it kills you like 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.160
 bloodthirsty delinquent though you 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.730
 hide in the church maybe you want 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.160
 meet you the devil dress the shoe 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.769
 shirtless I met him I saw in 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.319
 smiling snake mass lies with a 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.780
 smile gives away false arms the traitor 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.430
 Never alerts you and so goes life we 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.690
 depara instants that before not even 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.700
 you imagined 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.400
 you did not even dream 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.800
 envies plots is true boycotts 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.200
 apostles of evil were born dead gives me 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.450
 Like if one day everyone resurrects 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.879
 look for your own peace as and when 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.010
 I need to strive to be humble 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.500
 inside this war but I also have 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.420
 fire for the son of a bitch 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.760
 healthy balance we crave though I am 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.260
 radical vetoing the evil that shows 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.260
 to the human being and if afterwards the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.840
 sorry that is real the words with the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.000
 wind they go literally without 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.190
 hope I know that my brain dies the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.010
 illusion in days so far comes when 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.319
 he wants to dream, imagination is free 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.989
 so free I fear disappointment without seeing it 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.299
 that is my decline thank you for sharing 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.090
 with me these bars and you can feel me 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.099
 in some of these phrases at the end and the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.650
 we are not so different always 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.650
 there is an exit for each maze
