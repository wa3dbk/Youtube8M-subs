00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and opening the door itself I think

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.160 
and opening the door itself I think
opening<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> wardens<00:01:06.689> key<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.900> much

opening it with the wardens key is much

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.719 
opening it with the wardens key is much
easier<00:01:07.200> because<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> want<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.640> is

actually one of the harder steps in this

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.770 
actually one of the harder steps in this
but<00:01:38.820> instead<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.600> cafeteria

stairs<00:01:42.840> now<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.799> similar<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.189> where<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
stairs now this is similar to where the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.490 
stairs now this is similar to where the
Tomahawks<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.420> instead<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> going<00:01:46.229> left

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500

to the Tomahawks you guys go right into

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.730 
to the Tomahawks you guys go right into
the<00:01:48.329> laundrymat<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:49.290> once<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.530> guys<00:01:49.590> go

into the laundry room there will be a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.990 
into the laundry room there will be a
afterlife<00:01:51.960> generator<00:01:52.740> thing<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.610> wall<00:01:53.640> in

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
afterlife generator thing on the wall in

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.550 
afterlife generator thing on the wall in
the<00:01:54.210> same<00:01:54.390> room<00:01:54.540> she<00:01:54.720> has<00:01:54.869> only<00:01:54.960> leave<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.470> go

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the same room she has only leave to go

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
the same room she has only leave to go
far<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:56.369> willing<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.820> go<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.000> an

far because willing to go in an
afterlife<00:01:57.299> mode<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> actually<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.200> step

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
afterlife mode to actually do this step

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.800 
afterlife mode to actually do this step
now<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.969> washing<00:02:00.299> machine<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.630> right

basically I just want to wait until it

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.360 
basically I just want to wait until it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
gets done watching and it will open and

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.040 
gets done watching and it will open and
you<00:02:57.430> simply<00:02:57.760> grab<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.390> towel<00:02:58.570> out<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.870> the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
washing machine and that is probably the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.250 
washing machine and that is probably the
hardest<00:03:01.030> step<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.570> if<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.690> guys<00:03:01.750> do<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.080> and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
hardest step and if you guys do that and

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.620 
hardest step and if you guys do that and
you<00:03:02.320> has<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.440> pretty<00:03:02.770> much<00:03:02.890> set<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:04.150> next<00:03:04.420> step

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
you has a pretty much set this next step

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.600 
you has a pretty much set this next step
is<00:03:04.810> also<00:03:05.080> fairly<00:03:05.290> hard<00:03:05.560> but<00:03:05.739> it's<00:03:05.860> actually<00:03:06.220> a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
is also fairly hard but it's actually a

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.460 
is also fairly hard but it's actually a
lot<00:03:06.790> easier<00:03:06.850> than<00:03:07.120> laundry<00:03:07.450> mat<00:03:07.660> Nolan<00:03:07.930> what

anybody that you guys have gotten a

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.319 
anybody that you guys have gotten a
couple<00:04:08.980> parts<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:09.519> far<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:09.910> yours<00:04:10.120> when<00:04:10.299> you

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
couple parts so far and yours when you

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.370 
couple parts so far and yours when you
keep<00:04:10.540> in<00:04:10.690> mind<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:10.989> guys<00:04:11.079> will<00:04:11.170> need<00:04:11.290> to

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
keep in mind that you guys will need to

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.140 
keep in mind that you guys will need to
add<00:04:11.500> parts<00:04:11.860> of<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.040> plane<00:04:12.250> during<00:04:12.519> this<00:04:12.730> you

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
add parts of the plane during this you

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.190 
add parts of the plane during this you
guys<00:04:13.269> cannot<00:04:13.480> get<00:04:13.660> them<00:04:13.780> all<00:04:13.900> at<00:04:14.019> one<00:04:14.170> time

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
guys cannot get them all at one time

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.660 
guys cannot get them all at one time
because<00:04:14.590> there<00:04:14.680> are<00:04:14.769> too<00:04:14.950> many<00:04:15.040> parts<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.459> get

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
because there are too many parts to get

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.490 
because there are too many parts to get
so<00:04:16.120> I<00:04:16.150> was<00:04:16.269> just<00:04:16.359> suggesting<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:16.959> couple<00:04:17.200> parts

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
so I was just suggesting a couple parts

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.440 
so I was just suggesting a couple parts
and<00:04:17.709> then<00:04:17.850> adding<00:04:18.850> them<00:04:18.970> and<00:04:19.120> then<00:04:19.209> coming

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
and then adding them and then coming

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.370 
and then adding them and then coming
back<00:04:19.570> into<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.019> rest<00:04:20.200> of

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
back into the rest of

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.290 
back into the rest of
now<00:04:20.950> this<00:04:21.130> next<00:04:21.310> part<00:04:21.610> is<00:04:21.730> right<00:04:21.970> next<00:04:22.120> to

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
now this next part is right next to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.510 
now this next part is right next to
where<00:04:22.420> the<00:04:22.810> last<00:04:23.260> part<00:04:23.530> was<00:04:23.710> um<00:04:23.980> it's<00:04:24.400> in<00:04:24.460> the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
where the last part was um it's in the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.980 
where the last part was um it's in the
room<00:04:24.670> right<00:04:24.850> across<00:04:24.940> from<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.600> yet<00:04:25.960> as

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
room right across from it and yet as

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.050 
room right across from it and yet as
well<00:04:26.170> basically<00:04:26.410> want<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.740> shock<00:04:26.980> the<00:04:27.880> three

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
well basically want to shock the three

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.970 
well basically want to shock the three
generators<00:04:28.420> that<00:04:28.540> are<00:04:28.720> lit<00:04:28.930> up<00:04:29.110> with<00:04:29.560> the

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
generators that are lit up with the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.500 
generators that are lit up with the
afterlife<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.820> what<00:04:30.910> this<00:04:31.000> will<00:04:31.060> do<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:31.300> it

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
afterlife and what this will do is it

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.180 
afterlife and what this will do is it
will<00:04:31.540> disable<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.350> electric<00:04:32.650> fence<00:04:32.800> in<00:04:33.070> the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
will disable the electric fence in the

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.890 
will disable the electric fence in the
warden's<00:04:33.490> room<00:04:33.700> because<00:04:34.270> in<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.570> warden's

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
warden's room because in the warden's

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.960 
warden's room because in the warden's
office<00:04:35.050> or<00:04:35.770> room<00:04:35.950> is<00:04:36.160> where<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.520> actual<00:04:36.640> last

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
office or room is where the actual last

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.450 
office or room is where the actual last
part<00:04:37.360> is<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:38.830> guys<00:04:38.920> will<00:04:39.040> probably<00:04:39.130> find

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
part is and you guys will probably find

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.710 
part is and you guys will probably find
it<00:04:39.610> if<00:04:39.730> you<00:04:39.790> guys<00:04:39.880> i've<00:04:40.030> actually<00:04:40.180> played<00:04:40.390> this

it if you guys i've actually played this

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.240 
it if you guys i've actually played this
map<00:04:40.840> a<00:04:41.020> couple<00:04:41.260> times<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.890> guys<00:04:41.980> will<00:04:42.130> find

map a couple times you guys will find

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.160 
map a couple times you guys will find
the<00:04:42.400> wardens<00:04:42.700> room<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.540> has<00:04:43.690> a<00:04:43.720> big<00:04:43.960> chain

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
the wardens room and it has a big chain

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.080 
the wardens room and it has a big chain
link<00:04:44.350> fence<00:04:44.620> around<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.100> that's<00:04:45.310> like<00:04:45.430> has

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
link fence around it that's like has

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.520 
link fence around it that's like has
some<00:04:46.300> electric<00:04:46.570> fence<00:04:46.780> around<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.260> this

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
some electric fence around it and this

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.100 
some electric fence around it and this
will<00:04:47.860> disable<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.940> electric<00:04:49.180> fence<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:50.020> you

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
will disable the electric fence so you

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.480 
will disable the electric fence so you
guys<00:04:50.200> this<00:04:50.440> basically<00:04:50.860> just<00:04:51.040> use<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.310> key<00:04:51.460> on

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
guys this basically just use the key on

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.330 
guys this basically just use the key on
the<00:04:51.700> door<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.720> will<00:04:52.840> then<00:04:53.050> open<00:04:53.230> the<00:04:54.160> door

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
the door and it will then open the door

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.160 
the door and it will then open the door
and<00:04:54.520> yours<00:04:54.670> will<00:04:54.760> grab<00:04:54.910> last<00:04:55.150> part<00:04:55.420> now<00:04:55.990> once

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
and yours will grab last part now once

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.140 
and yours will grab last part now once
you<00:04:56.230> do<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.470> you<00:04:56.710> just<00:04:56.740> want<00:04:57.010> to<00:04:57.100> build<00:04:57.280> the

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
you do that you just want to build the

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.210 
you do that you just want to build the
parts<00:04:58.330> add<00:04:58.660> them<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.110> out<00:04:59.680> of<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.010> plane

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
parts add them to the out of the plane

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.830 
parts add them to the out of the plane
then<00:05:00.430> simply<00:05:00.700> fly<00:05:00.910> away<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.330> use<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:01.600> good

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
then simply fly away and use a good

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.240 
then simply fly away and use a good
little<00:05:01.990> cutscene<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.650> you<00:05:02.950> guys<00:05:03.010> will<00:05:03.130> get
