00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.100
 the conversation with the carnival now 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.960
 paulo barros paulo I had there on the boat 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.939
 the Tagus talked to her country and to 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.320
 joked with paulo's friend in the attack 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.180
 said that the school has a lot of respect 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.380
 the legacy you left behind and the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.130
 audience she conquered with her 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.020
 passage 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.760
 there he was his right arm here who 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.529
 It's your right arm and how it's being 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.850
 this process of putting the team 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.579
 competitive society 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.039
 here I had to create a people have 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.420
 several arms that divide in this 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:42.200
 shed is because it's really that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.730
 Dude, you gotta have this team, huh? 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.399
 ready to do everything 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.040
 How much work do we do then we 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:53.329
 there's a bit of people distributed in 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.329
 each of these low 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.250
 the girl in your book I think you 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.900
 has a passage at the 2005 carnival that 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.150
 You say you suggested that Lucy 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.830
 noble use fancy make reference 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.430
 The planet of the monkeys ended up rolling 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.350
 finally she was respected until her position and 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.520
 she gave a recent interview saying that 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.900
 she bought the fancy noise of 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.729
 2015 like this 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.020
 How is your relationship matured? 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.600
 to reach this point of delivery of the 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.100
 work is that era was very 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.930
 Funny actually because when I 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.520
 I suggested that she wears a monkey there almost 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.800
 hit my face right 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.800
 The way I did the clothes of a 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.619
 monkey and this year with mine is mine 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.320
 Arrived here in town she promptly 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.490
 said what do you want to do to us? 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.250
 does 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.009
 She's creeping me out not with 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.020
 but fear is but very lively 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.070
 very excited and is believing in 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.070
 project is cool 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.020
 the cearÃ¡ 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.570
 is 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.570
 ae 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.780
 Wow 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.460
 ae 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.350
 a car here that 24 people will stay 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.390
 hidden there without showing the face 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.280
 how was there a new school and did you 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.600
 is this degree of commitment of the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.530
 people who have to buy the 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.280
 your noise just like you bought in the tijuca 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.500
 I think it's the mark of the carnival. 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.050
 exactly that you count on 24 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.820
 people who are inside the car to 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.180
 do a job where they do not 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.330
 they appear and commit to it. 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.830
 cool and this story is very funny 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.520
 dude because I've had several examples 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.430
 of this 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.170
 I made a car that was a once 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.900
 it was purgatory 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.620
 I had 140 people played some 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.600
 and after the parade 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.160
 when she was on television she pointed 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.980
 in the midst of that mess of serious people 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.990
 I'm not there you can see what was then is 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.690
 more commitment than the pleasure of 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.170
 be there doing it already they were happy 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.170
 This is cool 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.870
 on arriving in the city it seemed like a 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.780
 scorer came to barcelona in a 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.560
 and how it is for you without knowing that 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.580
 at this stage of the show still exists 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.319
 a way of revering so 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.209
 affectionately a carnival without knowing 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.500
 who is someone who is going to be the great 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.450
 art director can be so received 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.099
 Look, this is the first time I've been in the 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.080
 rope that was my presentation was 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.380
 awesome thing i never 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.349
 I hoped that I was never received from the 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.380
 which was received in youth 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.989
 For me it was not wanted, it scares me but if 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.049
 gave me more responsibility than I did 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.080
 I already have but without this collection I 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:07.130
 I realize that they have this affection has 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.250
 this respect but that they communicate 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.459
 with me but not charging but exactly 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.500
 This telling understood is it for them I 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.169
 I think they consider it as if I 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.010
 was a piece of that gear that 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.010
 has to work 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.010
 I 'm 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.010
 cool 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.059
 You, from what I see the historical search 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.069
 in the retail that more feedback the question 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.869
 plot and you count on your friends from 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.949
 ufrj science house to do all 

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:43.169
 the grounds 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.879
 finally in a case like that it was a 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.099
 he works around a number of 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.199
 hypotheses that we can take from it is 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:50.639
 more difficult to substantiate a hypothesis one 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.059
 money that revolves around a 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:58.019
 question got to stand in the defense and 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:05:00.659
 and the rationale is brilliant. 

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:02.819
 it's the girls from the house of science 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:04.139
 who have become my team or to 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:07.289
 do this job 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:10.019
 they are great guys and I work 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.629
 of plotting and defense of 

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:17.849
 Once again, this storyline was 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:20.579
 fantastic of it is pleasurable you will have 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:24.149
 opportunity to see this text of 

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:28.309
 to see is how the plot is well 

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:28.309
 defended in his writing 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.900
 So what are you going to do? 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.050
 O 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.009
 to worry here is the message for the 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.690
 the youth community that can expect 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.500
 in this carnival of 2005 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.750
 we expect the community 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.750
 participate do not wait 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.870
 Ana 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.870
 the party had a white with the apa
