pretty good um I have a 2.4 gigs so it's
use<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.409> radio<00:01:16.650> frequency<00:01:17.159> your<00:01:17.400> own<00:01:17.520> stock

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
use the radio frequency your own stock

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.380 
use the radio frequency your own stock
motor<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.369> think<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> pinion<00:01:20.939> gear<00:01:20.970> is

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
motor in it I think the pinion gear is

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.219 
motor in it I think the pinion gear is
changed<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.720> or<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> couple<00:01:25.110> more

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
changed to one more or a couple more

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.260 
changed to one more or a couple more
teeth<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.369> comes<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.090> an

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
teeth on it one that comes with it as an

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.649 
teeth on it one that comes with it as an
