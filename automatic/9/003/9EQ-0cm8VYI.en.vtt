00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.020 
but I'm reading up on the horns it's
what<00:04:48.350> they<00:04:48.470> call<00:04:48.500> a<00:04:49.240> after<00:04:50.240> burn<00:04:50.480> or

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
what they call a after burn or

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.550 
what they call a after burn or
the<00:04:52.510> unburnt<00:04:52.930> gases

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
the unburnt gases

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:31.280 
the unburnt gases
hopping<00:04:55.370> in<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.550> exhaust

00:05:31.290 --> 00:06:24.620 

the<00:05:32.290> constant<00:05:32.860> amount<00:05:33.070> of<00:05:33.250> power

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.360 

sounds<00:06:25.260> like<00:06:25.350> the<00:06:25.530> brakes<00:06:25.830> make<00:06:26.100> a<00:06:26.130> little

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
sounds like the brakes make a little

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.050 
sounds like the brakes make a little
noise<00:06:26.610> when<00:06:27.000> you<00:06:28.070> apply<00:06:29.070> the<00:06:29.130> front<00:06:29.550> ones<00:06:29.760> I

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
noise when you apply the front ones I

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.640 
noise when you apply the front ones I
think<00:06:30.480> that's<00:06:30.630> pretty<00:06:30.810> typical<00:06:31.140> of<00:06:31.530> the

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
think that's pretty typical of the

00:06:31.650 --> 00:07:17.730 
think that's pretty typical of the
floating<00:06:31.980> discs

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.180 

the<00:07:18.040> spike<00:07:18.370> handles<00:07:18.850> like<00:07:19.000> a<00:07:19.060> dream
