 I'm pretty white and applied with 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.760

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.870

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.310
 and it's quite natural and very durable very 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:14.350
 much 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:16.750

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.890
 super cheap 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.160
 another thing that I liked a lot 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.780
 combine and that discovered in May 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.610
 They discovered already had are these two 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.530
 mascara I already showed you in the 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.030
 Previous favorite video is of brooches 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:39.240
 what is the 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.240
 player volume is here 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.910
 in the black tone go that you 're going to 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.470
 teach brushing earlier and what 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.310
 that we are going to apply to me first that 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.130
 he lengthens them 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.500
 lengthen a lot but I ave like a 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.480
 fan but clear it individualizes me 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.700
 much much lashes I have it 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.849
 a lot then I look like a museum 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.560
 for it and right after it took once 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.060
 but a while since if you have a tad 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.220
 not quite because if I can not 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.280
 applied and applied is that I already had 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.280
 before it's act the time in biutiful 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.040
 that has a very cool little brush too 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.770
 has many many many many 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.459
 hairs and has curved shape I do not know if 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.810
 you see it 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.419
 and so 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:32.180
 It makes me feel more marked 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:34.880
 curves the eyelashes and puts them as 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.260
 prettier with more volume and I like it 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.800
 much the combination to 2 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.560
 I love the biggest silverware and already 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.050
 is becoming favorite 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.539
 what more like eyeshadow 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.789
 and a last stretch of this palette that 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.909
 I had a little abandoned 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:57.759
 this palette of 28 neutral colors that 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.500
 I bought in Beijing coins that as 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.080
 you know they have many 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.480
 I love brown because to me this 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.640
 palette and I pigment quite 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.940
 is using this brown specifically 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.500
 cited from here because it closely resembles the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.440
 tone of my skin is that we do not teach it 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.850
 this one here this one here resembles 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.830
 much to the tone of my skin and after 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.920
 been marking basin little muscles 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.000
 like this one or like this one in the end 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.690
 and he pulled her 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.690
 practically every day 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.430
 is that it pimenta me a lot and not 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.479
 all have brightness come to me and it has 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:43.510
 delighted I have discovered it again already 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:45.280
 It has been my recusal of the month of May 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.830
 together 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.110
 with two other things is that my 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.169
 inseparable with my brown pencil don 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.370
 lasting of s 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.840
 in the tone 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.840
 the chocolate 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.880
 which is also inseparable or I did the 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.860
 black line just say superior or 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.620
 uses again that return to it this one 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.240
 surpasses and supra color this eyeliner in 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.240
 cake on baby side pill 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.520
 so it's a pill that only 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.520
 you have to wet the brush and you have 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.570
 the eyeliner practically 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.310
 and used as a brush east of vendetta 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.060
 what is 26 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.060
 001 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.080
 it is super finite super finite 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.770
 and today I took off the brown 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.290

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.930

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.060
 something I think something I'm going to repeat 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.860
 but hey, it's going to be a month 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.770
 for another I can not discover many 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.390
