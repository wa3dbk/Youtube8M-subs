hair so this is for fine hair that's
colored<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.769> this<00:03:12.129> is<00:03:12.250> for<00:03:12.430> here<00:03:12.580> that's

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
colored and this is for here that's

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.030

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
them in the jar so two-thirds angel

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.589 
them in the jar so two-thirds angel
rinse<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.129> one-third<00:03:21.879> born<00:03:22.180> again<00:03:22.420> that's
