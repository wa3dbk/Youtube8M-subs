00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.270
 it is clear that sometimes 5 inches are 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.580
 too much for some let's talk 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.250
 of the galaxy is 4000 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.219
 first, they see the design is very, very 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.930
 similar to that of s 4 the only one that is a 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.360
 little bit smaller on the side 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.279
 volume keys top with its 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.640
 microphone your port to handle the 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.470
 television for example the infrared 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.760
 power button for its finish if you 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.400
 you set this around in cash 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.960
 charging connector another microphone for the 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.789
 noise canceling loudspeaker that 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.820
 protrudes a little bit from the housing and the 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.250
 camera from there nothing nothing to note 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.809
 because the design is I tell you 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.000
 practically identical to the one of is 4 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.790
 only one millimeter thicker given 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.570
 that they had to put the components 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.729
 distributed by a smaller surface 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.339
 well that's the reason the text is also 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:51.220
 is something less logically are 130 grams 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.170
 from the east 4 this that 4 mini weighs 107 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.430
 grams is pretty pretty light 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.769
 you can have in your hand is very very 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.949
 comfortable to arrive then regarding the 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.530
 benefits because the screen is four 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.920
 with three inches of super technology 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.670
 amoled with a resolution of qhd is 960 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.100
 x 540 pixels the s4 moves already in the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.660
 five in the five inches to many it 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.360
 it makes them big for example this size 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.790
 is the ideal a lot of people say 4 with 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.500
 39 inches is the ideal for us 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.700
 we can move by the person by the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.100
 blind top of notifications 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.400
 with 5 inches and it costs you enough 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.590
 get 4.4 how many is the ideal where that 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.720
 regarding the processor it brings a double 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.300
 core to one with seven megahertz 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.430
 regarding the 1 with 9 of the galaxy 4 for 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.630
 Annex 4 has four processors of 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.100
 has 2 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.810
 this one has 5 gb and the s 4 brings 2 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.219
 it's also a little less ram but 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.070
 with hardly noticeable in the day to day 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:49.720
 certainly the internal memory of this 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.759
 device are 8 gigs compared to the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.710
 16 of the older brother but both are 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.470
 expandable by micro sd therefore if 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.179
 we bought a large 32gb micro sd 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.740
 for example we are going to have more than 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.409
 There is a lot of capacity to store our 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.979
 movies our music and all that kind 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.500
 of things 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.210
 that yes to emphasize that the only memory 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.849
 that you can use for applications is 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.959
 the internal plus or minus in the 4 s mini 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.260
 they are available approximately 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.970
 about 4 gb 4 or 5 gigabytes more than 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.260
 enough for any users 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.750
 older then you will have that 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.340
 application space problem 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.400
 the version that brings as I'm going to 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.140
 to teach is the 4 2 2 the last one that brings 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.020
 android to today 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.860
 then the camera for example these of 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.110
 8 megapixels in galaxy 4 is 13 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.790
 a little bit smaller in this case but it 's 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.050
 only in terms of megapixels in 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.980
 As for quality, the truth is that in 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.290
 tests that we have done in the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.150
 laboratory there was a difference very 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.300
 remarkable between both devices in 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.440
 Regarding image quality in photos 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.000
 then for who is suitable this 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.040
 phone, especially for those of you 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.810
 those who like the s4 but the screen 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.920
 they were too big to handle it 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.140
 with your hand because this is a good 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.819
 device has some benefits 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.410
 cut out the smaller screen and with 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.810
 something greater definition a processor 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.400
 something slower and less storage 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.340
 series the camera is a little bit weaker 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.600
 but still with that with that and everything 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.550
 it's still a range smartphone 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.950
 medium-high with a great relationship 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.090
 value course thus a 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.570
 good choice for you like a 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.840
 mobile device without carrying large 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.840
