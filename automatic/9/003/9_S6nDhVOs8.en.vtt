00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
streaming in so we're going to use a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.159 
streaming in so we're going to use a
flash<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:25.369> just<00:00:25.580> balance<00:00:25.820> this<00:00:26.179> all<00:00:26.419> out<00:00:26.660> and

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:27.169 
flash to just balance this all out and

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.529 
flash to just balance this all out and

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
notice my flash yet as a white card this

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.150 
notice my flash yet as a white card this
just<00:00:32.720> bounces<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.410> light<00:00:33.440> off<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:34.010> and

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
just bounces the light off it and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.630 
just bounces the light off it and
softens<00:00:34.730> it<00:00:34.820> up<00:00:34.940> for<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.390> really<00:00:35.809> nice<00:00:35.960> portrait

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
quite well indoors and then you take

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:48.070 
quite well indoors and then you take
your<00:01:37.250> photo<00:01:42.700> look<00:01:43.700> right<00:01:43.910> here<00:01:47.080> perfect

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.000 

with<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.260> on-camera<00:01:53.680> flash

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.660 

and<00:01:56.730> without<00:01:57.510> any<00:01:57.900> flash<00:01:58.260> you<00:01:59.160> can<00:01:59.190> see<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and without any flash you can see what a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.730 
and without any flash you can see what a
great<00:01:59.970> difference<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.570> flash<00:02:00.810> makes<00:02:01.170> the

great difference to flash makes the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.250 
great difference to flash makes the
subject<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:02.880> well-lit<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.630> your

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
subject is not really well-lit and your

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.400 
subject is not really well-lit and your
background<00:02:04.800> is<00:02:04.980> really<00:02:05.280> well<00:02:05.460> exposed

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
background is really well exposed

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.900 
background is really well exposed
remember<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.950> keep<00:02:08.369> your<00:02:08.520> camera<00:02:08.820> in

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
remember to do this keep your camera in

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.910 
remember to do this keep your camera in
manual<00:02:09.180> mode<00:02:09.440> expose<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.649> background

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
manual mode expose for the background

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.240 
manual mode expose for the background
without<00:02:11.340> any<00:02:11.730> flash<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.510> then<00:02:13.320> reduce<00:02:14.070> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
without any flash and then reduce the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.430 
without any flash and then reduce the
power<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.730> your<00:02:14.850> flash<00:02:15.150> just<00:02:15.720> enough<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.290> it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
power of your flash just enough so it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.730 
power of your flash just enough so it
balances<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:17.040> background
