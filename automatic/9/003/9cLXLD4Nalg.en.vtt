00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.030 
really shows but he did and one of the
first<00:02:32.340> things<00:02:33.379> Alejandro's<00:02:34.379> questioning<00:02:34.890> was

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
first things Alejandro's questioning was

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.099 
first things Alejandro's questioning was
he<00:02:35.519> had<00:02:35.780> burned<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.930> lot<00:02:37.049> of<00:02:37.109> pasture<00:02:37.650> land<00:02:37.890> and

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
he had burned a lot of pasture land and

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.479 
he had burned a lot of pasture land and
there's<00:02:40.109> other<00:02:40.230> ways<00:02:40.439> for<00:02:40.739> people<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.069> do

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
there's other ways for people to do

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.610 
there's other ways for people to do
things<00:02:41.670> rather<00:02:41.909> than<00:02:42.030> setting<00:02:42.659> it<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:42.870> fire<00:02:42.930> is

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
things rather than setting it on fire is

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.129 
things rather than setting it on fire is
a<00:02:44.010> typical<00:02:44.519> typical<00:02:45.239> way<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.690> clear<00:02:45.989> land

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
a typical typical way to clear land

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.349 
a typical typical way to clear land
quickly<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.579> you<00:02:47.879> kill<00:02:48.120> all<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
quickly but you kill all the

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.140 
quickly but you kill all the
microorganisms<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.379> soil<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:50.040> it's<00:02:50.819> not

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
microorganisms in the soil so it's not

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.420 
microorganisms in the soil so it's not
very<00:02:51.329> good<00:02:51.420> results<00:02:51.959> in<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.799> long<00:02:52.980> term<00:02:53.159> for

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
very good results in the long term for

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.160 
very good results in the long term for
the<00:02:53.489> farm<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.909> he<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.629> saying<00:02:54.780> well<00:02:54.959> I'm<00:02:55.019> going

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
to bring in new microorganisms and it's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.119 
to bring in new microorganisms and it's
like<00:02:57.090> well<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.389> didn't<00:02:57.599> have<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.750> burn<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.950> so
