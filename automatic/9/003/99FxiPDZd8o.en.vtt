before they can actually destroy them so

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.730

pick<00:01:24.990> up<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> zombie<00:01:25.530> shield<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.039> he's<00:01:26.280> going

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
pick up the zombie shield and he's going

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.340 
pick up the zombie shield and he's going
to<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> glitch<00:01:26.729> where<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.390> where<00:01:28.229> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to do the glitch where you are where you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.170 
to do the glitch where you are where you
pick<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.100> while<00:01:29.250> holding<00:01:29.579> zombie<00:01:30.000> shield

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
pick up like while holding zombie shield

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.730 
pick up like while holding zombie shield
you<00:01:30.299> hold<00:01:30.509> X<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> turbine<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.350> pick<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
you hold X on the turbine to pick up the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.289 
you hold X on the turbine to pick up the
turbine<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.789> will<00:01:32.850> do<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.060> it'll

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
turbine and what this will do is it'll

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.520 
turbine and what this will do is it'll
drop<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.689> zombie<00:01:33.960> shield<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.409> then

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
drop the zombie shield and then

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.719 
drop the zombie shield and then
basically<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.009> wanna<00:01:35.159> keep<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.399> previous

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
basically just wanna keep a previous

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.849 
basically just wanna keep a previous
process<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.479> you'll<00:01:37.049> want<00:01:37.109> to<00:01:37.259> pick<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
process so you'll want to pick up the

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.520 
process so you'll want to pick up the
the<00:01:38.100> new<00:01:38.810> shield<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.990> your<00:01:40.109> friend<00:01:40.320> sets

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the new shield that your friend sets

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.459 
the new shield that your friend sets
down<00:01:40.649> for<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:41.250> then<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.450> want<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> drop

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
down for you and then you want to drop

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.440 
down for you and then you want to drop
your<00:01:43.740> turbine<00:01:44.070> pick<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.969> zombie<00:01:45.240> shield

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
your turbine pick up the zombie shield

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.910 
your turbine pick up the zombie shield
that<00:01:45.570> he<00:01:45.719> has<00:01:46.049> dropped<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.829> then

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that he has dropped for you and then

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.410 
that he has dropped for you and then
this<00:01:47.070> pick<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.549> your<00:01:47.670> turbine<00:01:47.909> again<00:01:48.149> while

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
this pick up your turbine again while

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.330 
this pick up your turbine again while
holding<00:01:48.689> zombie<00:01:49.140> shield<00:01:49.320> now<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.250> this

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
holding zombie shield now if you do this

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.889 
holding zombie shield now if you do this
correctly<00:01:50.490> it'll<00:01:50.909> drop<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.630> zombie

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
correctly it'll drop is the zombie

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.899 
correctly it'll drop is the zombie
shield<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.649> will<00:01:52.799> have<00:01:52.979> your<00:01:53.549> turbine

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
shield and you will have your turbine

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.069 
shield and you will have your turbine
back<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.359> you<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.509> wanna<00:01:54.659> keep<00:01:54.750> repeating

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
back so you just wanna keep repeating

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.870 
back so you just wanna keep repeating
this<00:01:55.140> process<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:56.159> basically<00:01:56.429> guys<00:01:56.640> that's

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
this process but basically guys that's

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.760 
this process but basically guys that's
ball<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.359> the<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.840> glitch<00:01:58.109> i<00:01:58.350> mean<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.619> can

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
ball for the the glitch i mean you can

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
ball for the the glitch i mean you can
build<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.460> intricate<00:02:00.270> designs<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.869> like

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
build like intricate designs this like

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.469 
build like intricate designs this like
mia<00:02:01.380> forbes<00:02:01.679> and<00:02:01.890> shit<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.969> get<00:02:03.149> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
mia forbes and shit but you get it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.599 
mia forbes and shit but you get it
pretty<00:02:03.780> much<00:02:03.869> isn't<00:02:04.079> limited<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.100> bus<00:02:05.310> and

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
pretty much isn't limited the bus and

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:06.980 
pretty much isn't limited the bus and
like<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.240> zombies<00:02:06.509> will<00:02:06.539> destroy<00:02:06.899> them

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
like the zombies will destroy them

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.930 
like the zombies will destroy them
eventually<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.649> i<00:02:07.890> guess<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> bus<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.820> hit

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
eventually but i guess the bus will hit

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.609 
eventually but i guess the bus will hit
them<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.210> they're<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.990> way<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> bus<00:02:10.350> but

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
them if they're in the way the bus but

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.410 
them if they're in the way the bus but
if<00:02:10.800> they're<00:02:11.340> off<00:02:11.490> to<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.820> side<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.030> zombies

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
if they're off to the side of zombies

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.390 
if they're off to the side of zombies
will<00:02:12.540> hit<00:02:12.629> them<00:02:12.690> eventually<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:14.250> can

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
will hit them eventually but you can

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.740 
will hit them eventually but you can
keep<00:02:14.610> just<00:02:14.760> redoing<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.540> keep

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
keep just redoing this just keep

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.899 
keep just redoing this just keep
