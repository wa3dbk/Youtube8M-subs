 to make a little more basic material to have 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.139
 so I do not know I have not found here no better quality 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.759
 but with steve there is anyway yesterday women working on 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.510
 models 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.640
 if no problem 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.560
 not the only one 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.320

 for many it's ridiculous 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.850
 why have a plate with a little more 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.430
 the activity begins 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.550
