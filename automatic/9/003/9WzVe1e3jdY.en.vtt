any longer and so going from 4 32 gb to
was<00:00:38.340> quite<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> big<00:00:38.760> step<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.510> making<00:00:39.870> the

during a Formula One race it is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.899 
during a Formula One race it is

think for a lot of drivers come in to

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.240 
think for a lot of drivers come in to
form<00:01:52.690> one<00:01:52.870> they<00:01:53.080> would<00:01:53.230> naturally<00:01:53.590> struggle

through<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.200> season<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.530> would<00:01:56.710> gradually

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
through the season you would gradually

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.580 
through the season you would gradually
get<00:01:57.610> better<00:01:57.730> and<00:01:58.090> I've<00:01:58.960> been<00:01:59.140> very<00:01:59.200> fortunate

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
first corner pre and during the season

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.280 
first corner pre and during the season
you<00:02:30.490> sort<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:31.450> don't<00:02:31.630> train<00:02:31.810> as<00:02:31.960> much<00:02:32.110> as

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
you sort of you don't train as much as

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.110 
you sort of you don't train as much as
that<00:02:32.410> because<00:02:32.830> you're<00:02:33.220> racing<00:02:33.730> which<00:02:33.940> is

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
that because you're racing which is

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.180 
that because you're racing which is
which<00:02:34.540> is<00:02:34.690> almost<00:02:34.840> training<00:02:35.350> in<00:02:35.500> itself<00:02:35.950> and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
which is almost training in itself and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.130 
which is almost training in itself and
then<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:37.090> just<00:02:37.210> need<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.450> maintain<00:02:37.600> it<00:02:37.960> so

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
then you just need to maintain it so

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.200 
then you just need to maintain it so
it's<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.890> huge<00:02:38.920> part<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.670> see<00:02:39.940> his

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
it's a huge part of it I see his

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.360 
it's a huge part of it I see his
strength<00:02:40.570> has<00:02:40.750> improved<00:02:41.230> dramatically<00:02:41.740> his

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
strength has improved dramatically his

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.240 
strength has improved dramatically his
cardiovascular<00:02:42.790> endurance<00:02:43.360> has

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
cardiovascular endurance has

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.310 
cardiovascular endurance has
dramatically<00:02:45.250> increased<00:02:45.600> his<00:02:46.600> next<00:02:47.080> strength

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
dramatically increased his next strength

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.050 
dramatically increased his next strength
is<00:02:47.500> lower<00:02:47.680> back<00:02:47.950> strength<00:02:48.340> strength<00:02:49.000> strength

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
is lower back strength strength strength

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.240 
is lower back strength strength strength
around<00:02:49.600> his<00:02:49.690> pelvis<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.770> has<00:02:50.950> really

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
around his pelvis that has really

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.220 
around his pelvis that has really
developed<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:52.360> has<00:02:52.540> definitely<00:02:52.720> extremely

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
developed it has definitely extremely

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.930 
developed it has definitely extremely
encouraging<00:02:54.160> when<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.400> go<00:02:54.490> in<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.700> erase

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
encouraging when you go in to erase

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.390 
encouraging when you go in to erase
knowing<00:02:55.240> that<00:02:55.420> you're<00:02:55.570> fitter<00:02:55.930> or<00:02:56.620> probably

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
knowing that you're fitter or probably

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.130 
knowing that you're fitter or probably
the<00:02:57.670> fittest<00:02:58.060> driver<00:02:58.300> there<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.720> that's<00:02:59.020> got

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
the fittest driver there is that's got

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.900 
the fittest driver there is that's got
to<00:02:59.230> be<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.410> aim<00:02:59.500> it's<00:02:59.860> definitely<00:03:00.100> push<00:03:00.760> your

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
to be the aim it's definitely push your

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.070 
to be the aim it's definitely push your
mind<00:03:01.060> at<00:03:01.150> ease<00:03:01.270> and<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.570> gives<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.840> room<00:03:02.020> to

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
mind at ease and it gives you room to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.230 
mind at ease and it gives you room to
then<00:03:02.680> just<00:03:03.100> think<00:03:03.520> out<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.760> whole<00:03:03.880> weekend

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
then just think out the whole weekend

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.390 
then just think out the whole weekend
and<00:03:04.420> think<00:03:05.290> clearly<00:03:05.380> and<00:03:05.650> at<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.160> end<00:03:06.250> of<00:03:06.340> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
and think clearly and at the end of the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.330 
and think clearly and at the end of the
day<00:03:06.459> it's<00:03:06.640> extremely<00:03:07.150> stressful<00:03:08.010> intense<00:03:09.010> and

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
day it's extremely stressful intense and

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.390 
day it's extremely stressful intense and
if<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.390> can<00:03:10.570> have<00:03:10.810> one<00:03:11.230> issue<00:03:11.950> out<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.280> way

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
if you can have one issue out the way

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.970 
if you can have one issue out the way
then<00:03:13.300> it<00:03:13.420> makes<00:03:13.570> it<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.900> whole<00:03:14.230> lot<00:03:14.290> easier<00:03:14.650> for

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
then it makes it a whole lot easier for

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.199 
then it makes it a whole lot easier for
the<00:03:15.040> weekend<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.430> go<00:03:15.550> through<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:15.940> think<00:03:16.150> the

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
the weekend to go through I think the

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.490 
the weekend to go through I think the
physical<00:03:16.600> training<00:03:16.870> gives<00:03:17.020> Lewis<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.350> lot<00:03:17.470> a

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
physical training gives Lewis a lot a

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.770 
physical training gives Lewis a lot a
lot<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:18.070> mental<00:03:18.370> energy<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.000> prepares<00:03:19.660> him

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
lot of mental energy and prepares him

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.810 
lot of mental energy and prepares him
