00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.030
 very good girls very good guys today 

00:00:02.479 --> 00:00:06.520
 day but we are in a new news and 

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.309
 as you can read in the title 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.549
 playstation 4 would say a step back 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.160
 with respect to the xbox 720 and I do not say 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.769
 I said a webpage and all 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.900
 What am I doing is informing you since 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.759
 this website has taken all the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.820
 rumors all the presto what has been 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.650
 speculated by the since since a 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.769
 year and peak until today is worth the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.230
 new generation machines and has done 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.379
 a little scheme and has valued that 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.850
 console would be the most powerful vale 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.039
 I tried and I have come to the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.710
 next conclusion that playstation 4 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:46.100
 would go a step back regarding the 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.190
 next xbox 720 is worth the truth is that 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.660
 why because of output the console 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.329
 Microsoft would have 8 gigabytes of memory 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.610
 twice the 4 gigabytes speculated 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.240
 what would the sony machine have 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.250
 this the truth is that it has led to 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.700
 Many fan discussions in forums 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.730
 especially because the sony console 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.280
 would have half the memory that 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.900
 next xbox 720 and this would limit a lot 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.430
 the machine sun and it always 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.410
 based on the web page in 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.520
 speculations and rumors until the day 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.210
 today because there is nothing confirmed 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.830
 ok also says that sony is still 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.370
 before the possibility of being able to expand 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.490
 this memory to match the 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.720
 future xbox 620 but for the time being 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.930
 which it has confirmed what has been 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.910
 filtered would go behind he also says 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.500
 that there is a very serious problem 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.660
 the followers of the sony console 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.610
 they are quite angry at the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.740
 possibility that your next console does not 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.259
 be directly compatible with games 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.200
 earlier this means that they are and 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.000
 as it has already been leaked and it has been said in 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.680
 the rumors because we are basing ourselves 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.750
 always in rumors of the new 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.850
 generation of remains and that will be 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.399
 included in the next playstation 4 and 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.560
 who are and want the classic games 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.940
 it's worth any game of this 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.250
 generation 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.710
 Only one could play through 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.150
 gaikai and would have to pay to use 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.070
 this service but they are the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.650
 speculations and this is what angers 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.740
