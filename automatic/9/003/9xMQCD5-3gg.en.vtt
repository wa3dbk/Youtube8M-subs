 showing here at the mobile world congress 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.560
 Hi guys 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.390
 hello to all the readers of telefonino.net 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.100
 however the things we announced 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.809
 last week we are doing 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.910
 come here now to the world then kong 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.540
 I am 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.540
 partnership with 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120
 but that is a clothing company that in a 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.280
 month and its own 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.750
 angry birds to know everyone and currency 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.890
 the interesting thing 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.920
 we are showing this 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.560
 now this is a partner space ie 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.450
 when you attack the cover of 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.550
 you will have access to this dedicated space 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.370
 therefore there is a direct channel to clippers 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.380
 by companies towards 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.540
 the user 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.680
 and dedicated 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.110
 with 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.780
 in this example they can be gods 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.280
 personalized content and aside 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.220
 of the companies that decide to do 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.620
 this kind of resolution exactly 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.170
 here we come to the same concept 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.680
 explained it is made for this company of 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.240
 Finnish clothes are wondering but who is 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.860
 obviously this is a concept of 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.720
 this extended to whatever it takes 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.850
 any company you want 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.590
 requires continuous details to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.829
 probably through our time 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.829
 and then 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.020
 confident that the partnership in 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.299
 very famous company 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.750
 Finnish security firm to offer to 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.750
 our users 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.710
 the cloud solutions 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.259
 storage 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.720
 and here is directly accessible 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.090
 FBI 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.340
 as for if the tcs are what they are 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.030
 the innovations that await us in one 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.370
 next release 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.060
 obviously improved the stability of the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.110
 fixed system for many 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.480
 plus also added 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.629
 there 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.010
 leinster mons all applications 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:36.010
 messaging as note messages or 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.010
 e-mail 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.940
 you do n't want to see 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.940
 now a little bit 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.360
 also in the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.550
 then dad the web browser works on the web 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.160
 will be improved and if we are testing the 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.170
 new version 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.860
 water that the engine 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.860
 that 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.540
 no 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.579
 then we improved 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.690
 the usability theme the camera that 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.090
 see that they will be there 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:13.290
 Last time than controls 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.930
 we have also improved quality 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.450
 of the photos we have 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.640
 added the very interesting function 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.319
 which I found very interesting when 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.230
 i tried this phone we have 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.909
 added touch to focus for example 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.780
 therefore it is no longer in focus to have 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.650
 the central fire 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.590
 yes now we can choose where 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.310
 to put timer focus 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.310
 in short we have 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.110
 here are the main things there 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.080
 will wait for the next one 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.480
 we will leave them as risks 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.940
 March hands 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.799
 and this is that it contained the simple se 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.010
 then we also announced 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.650
 the fact that we are working on selfish 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.790
 to have it downloaded directly to 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.190
 android devices 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.050
 we will start with a launcher disentis 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.540
 this 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.240
 with a system that can complete 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.220
 in head installed 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.560
 then the community of android too 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.690
 I have seen that developers are very active 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.850
 many roads have already arrived 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.610
 many native applications for simple 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.130
 in our store there are about 150 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.380
 applications also of excellent quality 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.630
 in short, in two months for a platform 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.480
 completely new a famous a little 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.830

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.040
