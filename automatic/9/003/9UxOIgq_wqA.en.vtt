00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.500
 an institution there in Guadalajara from 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.250
 that the Bergara family and the group arrived 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.070
 of unemployed the terror 90 leave already had 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.270
 controlled the source and the reporters 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.370
 that the rudder covers are no longer you 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.980
 to help take advantage of these 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.960
 presences that control when one or 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.600
 two but several that had them to them 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.790
 they have a dread but a dread 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.160
 scary for pretty but please not only 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.720
 of dir is about flows in favor of 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.440
 they did not know what to say when they are in 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.070
 checked 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.410
 to see up the agent resuscitator 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.840
 lady sources these two ladies or not 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.460
 eugenia so that it does not filter 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.300
 information if it's smart 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.520
 sir vergara goodbye here does not make the subject 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.280
 not thing like it seems that everything 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.930
 that smells in some other angelic way 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.910
 sources that has to do with the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.750
 institution today little by little is 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.790
 doing 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.560
 the coral this you speak the lawyer that 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.000
 they ran when palencia left that 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.020
 which is the one that I think can give 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.090
 very good note 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.340
 and do not charge for advice but that guy 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.960
 but you must say to can you say the one 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.680
 I knew many things and not necessarily 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.690
 I tell you in my profession, not everything in 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.700
 confidentiality clauses I do not know 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.250
 Assembly now coming to 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.229
 we were going to that topic it does not seem very 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.970
 the note in the newspaper reform 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.930
 is right the people that is 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.950
 in the corporate of the new era 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:14.890
 take off the newspaper's crunches 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:17.410
 newspaper that we do not see it in him 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.110
 they are very early when one gets up 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.730
 you know how to exercise hard chamba 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.569
 It also gets you up at six o'clock 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.980
 tomorrow and start stealing all the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.260
 rises to produce fly in clinker 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.030
 swim but already the serious one in the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.030
 corporate what was said not the people who 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.040
 is there in front you can not quote 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.600
 an assembly a substitute commissioner 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.940
 when the commissioner has not been heard 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.739
 holder then lacks foundation 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.570
 there is no reason to be what is 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.590
 summoning angelica sources skillfully 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.660
 he tells the media I think that what 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.209
 does to buy time to distract the 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.760
 public attention but I think it's 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.280
 a tremendous confusion they want 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.690
 generate with that nothing more young 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.220
 assembly in fact nothing else if it is a 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.440
 ordinary assembly we leave the brand 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.540
 for 29 April and see if 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.390
 carries out who should summon the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.519
 authorized persons or those who 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.050
 angelic follow sources that I want it 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.239
 make colloquial sound but to do it 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.580
 clear in public because he has to summon 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.050
 the commissioner of the company does not 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.090
 people who say angelica sources though 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.230
 a counterattack strategy not for 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.550
 part of angels distractions 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.930
 I say the Mayan issue that is up to 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.360
 us and at least in sports 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.550
 they start to move away people who were 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.410
 inmiscuido there in the club and that therefore 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.170
 as you said you had to control the source 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.550
 or suddenly there are press chiefs and what 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.260
 we have seen then that they even feel 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.030
 as owners of the institution this is 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.170
 those really are the ones who move it 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.190
 genius was one of them 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:49.710
 with an experience with what I saw 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.160
 you also have to say it effective when you 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:56.220
 I was trying of 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:04:01.030
 will finally help you in this other part 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.460
 that this pair of lashes especially the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.050
 source to the premises nationwide 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.140
 he was very intelligent he knew how to 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.210
 try but in the local press it was from a 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.130
 bad tweets or something that I did not like was 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.490
 find the correspondent's boss or the 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.350
 reporter to get him down a little bit 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.870
 buds then they started to move 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.670
 the waters there in chivas let's see in 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.890
 what for this lawsuit that surely 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.890
 will have jorge vergara and angelica sources
