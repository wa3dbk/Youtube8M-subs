show you how i reduced white noise on my

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.480 
show you how i reduced white noise on my
mic<00:00:18.109> pretty<00:00:19.109> much<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.770> thirty-five<00:00:20.279> dollars

mic pretty much for thirty-five dollars
for<00:00:21.119> some<00:00:21.300> people<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.720> could<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:22.020> free

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
for some people it could be free

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.689 
for some people it could be free
depending<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.859> software<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.340> hardware

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
depending on the software and hardware

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.939 
depending on the software and hardware
setup<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.269> your<00:00:24.300> computer<00:00:24.900> especially<00:00:25.800> if<00:00:25.890> you

have a soundcard as you can hear there's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.050 
have a soundcard as you can hear there's
probably<00:00:29.070> white<00:00:29.340> noise<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.670> here<00:00:29.820> because<00:00:29.880> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
probably white noise on here because I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.880 
probably white noise on here because I
don't<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.359> any<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.689> these<00:00:30.779> settings<00:00:31.140> enabled

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
don't have any of these settings enabled

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.830 
don't have any of these settings enabled
for<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.219> purposes<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.000> video<00:00:33.180> just<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
show you how much better it will sound

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.090 
show you how much better it will sound
without<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.090> afterwards<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.980> walk<00:00:37.980> you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
without it afterwards and walk you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.479 
without it afterwards and walk you
through<00:00:38.340> everything<00:00:39.379> what<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.410> got<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.250> my

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
through everything what I got for my

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.950 
through everything what I got for my
setup<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.030> kind<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.329> Jimmy<00:00:42.510> rig<00:00:42.719> setup

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
setup and it's kind of a Jimmy rig setup

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.810 
setup and it's kind of a Jimmy rig setup
is<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.590> little<00:00:43.829> control<00:00:44.129> panel<00:00:44.460> program

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
is this little control panel program

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790 
is this little control panel program
right<00:00:45.000> here<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.600> virtual<00:00:46.020> audio<00:00:46.350> cable

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
right here is for virtual audio cable

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.470 
right here is for virtual audio cable
and<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.789> where<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
and this is where you do all the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.010 
and this is where you do all the
settings<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.899> there<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.320> have<00:00:49.469> teamspeak<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
settings in there we have teamspeak and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.110 
settings in there we have teamspeak and
so<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.469> thing<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.100> free<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
so the thing that is not free here is

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.270 
so the thing that is not free here is
virtual<00:00:54.719> audio<00:00:54.989> cable<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.980> try<00:00:56.219> this

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
virtual audio cable you can try this

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.349 
virtual audio cable you can try this
solution<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.149> free<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:59.000> when<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
solution for free but when you do the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.400 
solution for free but when you do the
trial<00:01:00.629> version<00:01:00.750> there's<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
trial version there's going to be a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.900 
trial version there's going to be a
female<00:01:01.590> voice<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.489> can<00:01:02.670> see<00:01:02.850> if

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
female voice on it so you can see if

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
female voice on it so you can see if
will<00:01:03.030> work<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.449> or<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> test<00:01:04.409> it

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
will work for you or not just to test it

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.810 
will work for you or not just to test it
out<00:01:04.650> at<00:01:04.860> least<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.250> don't<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.670> buy

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
out at least so you don't have to buy

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.370 
out at least so you don't have to buy
the<00:01:05.880> program<00:01:06.420> just<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.110> works<00:01:07.290> or

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the program just to see if it works or

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.230 
the program just to see if it works or
not<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.700> get<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> full<00:01:09.060> version

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
not but if you get the full version

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.910 
not but if you get the full version
you'll<00:01:09.540> take<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:10.140> female<00:01:10.500> voice<00:01:10.680> out

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you'll take that little female voice out

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.980 
you'll take that little female voice out
of<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.159> happens<00:01:11.790> every<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.150> often<00:01:12.390> but

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
of it that happens every so often but

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.830 
of it that happens every so often but
it's<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> 30<00:01:13.439> 35<00:01:13.890> dollar<00:01:14.130> program<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> what

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it's like a 30 35 dollar program so what

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.090 
it's like a 30 35 dollar program so what
you<00:01:15.930> want<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.350> go<00:01:16.500> into<00:01:16.650> your<00:01:16.830> control

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.200 
should be good to go you only need one
cable<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.920> yeah<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:38.970> thing's<00:01:39.150> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
cable for this and yeah this thing's a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
cable for this and yeah this thing's a
little<00:01:39.270> confusing<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.409> lot<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.100> stuff<00:01:41.280> will

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
little confusing a lot of stuff will

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.889 
little confusing a lot of stuff will
adjust<00:01:41.610> quality<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.420> play<00:01:42.570> around<00:01:42.689> with

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
adjust quality you can play around with

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.149 
adjust quality you can play around with
it<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> default<00:01:43.500> setting<00:01:43.799> should<00:01:44.009> be

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
it but the default setting should be

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.819 
it but the default setting should be
good<00:01:44.310> enough<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.970> will<00:01:45.780> not<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:46.320> too<00:01:46.560> far<00:01:46.770> into

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
good enough so will not get too far into

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.460 
good enough so will not get too far into
that<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:48.149> ahead<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.450> exit<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.780> out<00:01:48.960> when

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
that I go ahead and exit out out when

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.880 
that I go ahead and exit out out when
done<00:01:50.250> fit<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> make<00:01:51.540> sure<00:01:51.680> virtual<00:01:52.680> audio

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
done fit and make sure virtual audio

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.230 
done fit and make sure virtual audio
cables<00:01:53.250> working<00:01:53.520> right<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.790> want<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.000> go<00:01:54.090> into

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
cables working right you want to go into

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.620 
cables working right you want to go into
your<00:01:54.680> audio<00:01:55.680> devices<00:01:56.060> you<00:01:57.060> got<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.270> playback

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
your audio devices you got your playback

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.569 
your audio devices you got your playback
in<00:01:57.750> your<00:01:57.869> according<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.009> see<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.280> both

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
in your according as you can see on both

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.999 
in your according as you can see on both
of<00:01:59.610> them<00:02:00.020> here<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.409> line<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.799> from

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
of them here it is the line one from

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.370 
of them here it is the line one from
virtual<00:02:02.369> audio<00:02:02.549> cable<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.149> pretty<00:02:04.079> much<00:02:04.140> what

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
virtual audio cable and pretty much what

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.380 
virtual audio cable and pretty much what
this<00:02:04.530> will<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.100> when<00:02:05.610> these<00:02:05.759> are<00:02:05.880> enabled

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
this will do is when these are enabled

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.770 
this will do is when these are enabled
your<00:02:07.140> playback<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:08.300> line<00:02:09.300> one<00:02:09.569> hears

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
your playback if line one hears

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.850 
your playback if line one hears
something<00:02:09.989> it'll<00:02:10.319> push<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
something it'll push it to the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.520 
something it'll push it to the
microphone<00:02:11.340> line<00:02:11.550> 14<00:02:11.940> virtio<00:02:12.420> cable<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
microphone line 14 virtio cable and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.990 
microphone line 14 virtio cable and
vice<00:02:13.680> versa<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.819> it's<00:02:14.940> pretty<00:02:15.180> much<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.750> hybrid

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
vice versa so it's pretty much a hybrid

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.420 
vice versa so it's pretty much a hybrid

leave this open for now because we're

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.620 
leave this open for now because we're
going<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.750> possibly<00:02:22.290> play<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> thud<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.630> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
to reduce noise for like other streaming

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.400 
to reduce noise for like other streaming
programs<00:03:03.569> like<00:03:03.720> if<00:03:03.840> you're<00:03:03.989> using<00:03:04.110> open

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
have their own noise reduction or maybe

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.910 
have their own noise reduction or maybe
for<00:03:09.120> skype<00:03:09.360> or<00:03:09.510> something<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.530> what<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.769> want

remove background noise and then you'll

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.460 
remove background noise and then you'll
do<00:03:43.530> test<00:03:44.209> luckily<00:03:45.209> then<00:03:45.450> echo<00:03:45.750> thankfully<00:03:46.260> and

what this is doing now is you can see up
here<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:50.459> actually<00:03:51.019> pushing<00:03:52.019> what<00:03:52.920> it's

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
here it is actually pushing what it's

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.640 
here it is actually pushing what it's
hearing<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.459> in<00:03:53.519> teamspeak<00:03:53.760> into<00:03:54.480> here<00:03:54.840> with

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
hearing it in teamspeak into here with

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.120 
hearing it in teamspeak into here with
the<00:03:56.190> filters<00:03:56.579> on<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:57.720> here<00:03:58.320> we<00:03:58.470> got<00:03:58.890> into<00:03:59.100> our

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
the filters on so here we got into our

the filters on so here we got into our
recording<00:03:59.730> tab<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.570> can<00:04:00.600> see<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:00.989> getting

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
recording tab you can see it getting

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.650 
recording tab you can see it getting
pushed<00:04:01.440> there<00:04:01.650> too<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.209> you'll<00:04:03.209> want<00:04:03.359> to<00:04:03.450> set

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
pushed there too and you'll want to set

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.410 
pushed there too and you'll want to set
line<00:04:03.900> one<00:04:04.079> as<00:04:04.230> your<00:04:04.350> default<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:05.030> then<00:04:06.030> with

line one as your default and then with

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.030 
line one as your default and then with
teamspeak<00:04:06.959> just<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.350> make<00:04:07.500> sure<00:04:07.530> it's<00:04:07.650> out<00:04:07.980> of

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
teamspeak just to make sure it's out of

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.410 
teamspeak just to make sure it's out of
the<00:04:08.220> way<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.400> don't<00:04:08.670> accidentally<00:04:09.030> close<00:04:09.269> it

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
the way you don't accidentally close it

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.569 
the way you don't accidentally close it
or<00:04:09.510> anything<00:04:09.660> they're<00:04:10.590> going<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.769> just<00:04:11.010> put

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
or anything they're going to just put

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.210 
or anything they're going to just put
that<00:04:11.790> away<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.739> then<00:04:13.739> you<00:04:13.920> can<00:04:14.040> probably

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
that away and then you can probably

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.300 
that away and then you can probably
close<00:04:14.519> this<00:04:14.730> too<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.590> you<00:04:16.590> could<00:04:16.769> probably<00:04:17.039> go

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
close this too and you could probably go

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.060 
close this too and you could probably go
in<00:04:17.430> here<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:18.079> go<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.140> sound<00:04:19.440> recorder<00:04:19.919> or

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
in here and go to sound recorder or

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.039 
in here and go to sound recorder or
something<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.419> see<00:04:21.599> it's<00:04:21.750> picking

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
something and you can see it's picking

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.990 
something and you can see it's picking
up<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.260> sound<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:23.039> can<00:04:23.190> do<00:04:23.310> yourself<00:04:23.430> a

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
up the sound and you can do yourself a

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.510 
up the sound and you can do yourself a
little<00:04:24.419> test<00:04:24.860> I'm<00:04:25.860> going<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.099> stop<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.400> video

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
little test I'm going to stop the video

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.560 
little test I'm going to stop the video
right<00:04:26.849> here

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
right here

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.590 
right here
and<00:04:28.560> then<00:04:28.980> I'm<00:04:29.100> gonna<00:04:29.250> apply<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.060> settings<00:04:30.300> to

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
and then I'm gonna apply the settings to

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.730 
and then I'm gonna apply the settings to
recording<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.290> you<00:04:31.350> can<00:04:31.470> hear<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
recording and you can hear the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.410 
recording and you can hear the
difference<00:04:31.860> for<00:04:32.190> yourself<00:04:32.340> before<00:04:33.030> going

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
difference for yourself before going

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.250 
difference for yourself before going
through<00:04:33.690> all<00:04:33.780> this<00:04:38.210> so<00:04:39.210> as<00:04:39.360> you<00:04:39.420> can<00:04:39.630> hear<00:04:39.990> this

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
through all this so as you can hear this

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.710 
through all this so as you can hear this
is<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.620> settings<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:42.180> i<00:04:42.240> just<00:04:42.360> showed<00:04:42.480> you

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
is the settings that i just showed you

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.960 
is the settings that i just showed you
on<00:04:42.810> my<00:04:42.930> recording<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:44.160> white<00:04:44.310> noise<00:04:44.460> that

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
on my recording and the white noise that

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.850 
on my recording and the white noise that
you<00:04:45.060> heard<00:04:45.210> before<00:04:45.360> should<00:04:45.870> be<00:04:46.050> pretty<00:04:46.650> much

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
you heard before should be pretty much

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.890 
you heard before should be pretty much
gone<00:04:47.010> my<00:04:47.880> voice<00:04:48.090> probably<00:04:48.480> does<00:04:48.600> sound<00:04:48.840> a

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
gone my voice probably does sound a

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.970 
gone my voice probably does sound a
little<00:04:48.990> bit<00:04:49.170> different<00:04:49.560> but<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:49.770> don't

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
little bit different but I don't

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.650 
little bit different but I don't
consider<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.400> too<00:04:50.640> big<00:04:50.850> of<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.000> deal<00:04:51.240> it

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
consider that too big of a deal it

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.080 
consider that too big of a deal it
doesn't<00:04:51.990> sound<00:04:52.370> degraded<00:04:53.370> or<00:04:53.580> anything<00:04:53.970> just

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
doesn't sound degraded or anything just

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.180 
doesn't sound degraded or anything just
sounds<00:04:54.330> different<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.840> me<00:04:54.960> another<00:04:55.890> small

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
sounds different to me another small

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.920 
sounds different to me another small
disadvantage<00:04:56.790> is<00:04:57.030> there's<00:04:57.180> probably<00:04:57.450> a<00:04:57.510> small

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
disadvantage is there's probably a small

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.560 
disadvantage is there's probably a small
lag<00:04:58.200> time<00:04:58.500> on<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.740> mic<00:04:58.920> but<00:04:59.640> it's<00:05:00.330> probably

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
lag time on the mic but it's probably

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.000 
lag time on the mic but it's probably
not<00:05:00.720> a<00:05:00.750> big<00:05:00.900> deal<00:05:01.020> either<00:05:01.080> at<00:05:01.560> least<00:05:01.620> not<00:05:01.800> for

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
not a big deal either at least not for

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.150 
not a big deal either at least not for
me<00:05:02.130> it's<00:05:02.310> not<00:05:02.540> so<00:05:03.680> this<00:05:04.680> is<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.920> best<00:05:05.070> solution

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
me it's not so this is the best solution

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.890 
me it's not so this is the best solution
I<00:05:05.460> found<00:05:05.700> as<00:05:05.910> all<00:05:06.240> the<00:05:06.360> information<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:06.870> found
