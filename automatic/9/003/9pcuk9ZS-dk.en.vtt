00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
come back I'm a slow learner no actually

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.260 
come back I'm a slow learner no actually
every<00:00:16.949> time<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.190> come<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.760> learned<00:00:18.029> something

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
every time I come I learned something

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.029 
every time I come I learned something
different<00:00:18.750> every<00:00:19.260> coach<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.680> has<00:00:19.710> come

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
different every coach that has come

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.320 
different every coach that has come
through<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.369> program<00:00:20.490> has<00:00:20.880> always<00:00:21.180> had

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
through the program has always had

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.689 
through the program has always had
something<00:00:22.070> different<00:00:23.070> something<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.519> little

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
something different something a little

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.269 
something different something a little
bit<00:00:23.939> different<00:00:24.630> than<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.930> others<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:26.099> learn

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
bit different than the others to learn

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:58.860 
bit different than the others to learn
from<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.789> that's<00:00:27.500> basically<00:00:28.500> why<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:29.010> here

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.869 

really<00:00:59.320> like<00:00:59.469> the<00:00:59.620> principles<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.520> i<00:01:00.699> think

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
really like the principles and i think

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.610 
really like the principles and i think
that<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.090> principles<00:01:01.570> that<00:01:01.899> they<00:01:02.140> teach<00:01:02.350> here

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
that the principles that they teach here

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.820 
that the principles that they teach here
really<00:01:03.129> made<00:01:03.610> our<00:01:03.730> program<00:01:04.059> better<00:01:04.269> and<00:01:04.830> you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
really made our program better and you

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.649 
really made our program better and you
know<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.010> training<00:01:06.340> methods<00:01:06.700> i<00:01:07.000> think<00:01:07.479> are

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
know the training methods i think are

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.960 
know the training methods i think are
great<00:01:07.810> so<00:01:08.560> I<00:01:08.590> think<00:01:08.680> that<00:01:09.100> we<00:01:09.520> get<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.729> lot<00:01:09.909> of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
great so I think that we get a lot of

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.060 
great so I think that we get a lot of
mileage<00:01:10.210> out<00:01:10.479> of<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:11.710> thing<00:01:11.920> that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
mileage out of that one thing that

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.289 
mileage out of that one thing that
golden<00:01:12.280> l<00:01:12.369> squared<00:01:12.670> does<00:01:12.850> really<00:01:13.090> well<00:01:13.240> is

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
golden l squared does really well is

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.270 
golden l squared does really well is
they<00:01:13.570> have<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:13.840> lot<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.110> research<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.830> lot<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.220> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
they have a lot of research a lot of the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.160 
they have a lot of research a lot of the
principles<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.940> supper<00:01:16.300> research<00:01:16.659> in<00:01:16.930> and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
principles of a supper research in and

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.230 
principles of a supper research in and
watching<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:18.009> game<00:01:18.220> and<00:01:18.399> studying<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.060> game

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
watching the game and studying the game

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.480 
watching the game and studying the game
and<00:01:19.450> then<00:01:19.540> motor<00:01:20.110> learning<00:01:20.409> itself<00:01:20.920> learning

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
and then motor learning itself learning

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.040 
and then motor learning itself learning
the<00:01:21.580> aspects<00:01:22.000> of<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.270> body<00:01:22.479> and<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.750> human

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
the aspects of the body and the human

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.350 
the aspects of the body and the human
movements<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.619> think<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.790> present<00:01:25.240> these

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
movements I think to present these

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.020 
movements I think to present these
materials<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:25.960> coaches<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.649> big<00:01:27.550> bonus<00:01:27.909> to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
materials to coaches is big bonus to

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.550 
materials to coaches is big bonus to
have<00:01:28.180> all<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.600> data<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.020> all<00:01:29.200> that<00:01:29.350> research

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
have all that data and all that research

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.460 
have all that data and all that research
to<00:01:30.100> allow<00:01:30.250> us<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.549> learn<00:01:31.060> I<00:01:31.330> like<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:31.960> way<00:01:32.110> that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
to allow us to learn I like the way that

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.139 
to allow us to learn I like the way that
gold<00:01:32.710> metal<00:01:32.920> spirit<00:01:33.160> hasn't<00:01:33.340> rested<00:01:33.789> on<00:01:34.000> its

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
gold metal spirit hasn't rested on its

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.760 
gold metal spirit hasn't rested on its
laurels<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.600> what<00:01:34.780> it<00:01:34.869> did<00:01:35.050> 20<00:01:35.440> or<00:01:35.530> 30<00:01:35.710> years

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
laurels of what it did 20 or 30 years

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.600 
laurels of what it did 20 or 30 years
ago<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:36.460> that<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.240> continues<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:38.020> build

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
ago and that it continues to build

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.160 
ago and that it continues to build
statistics<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.940> continues<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.690> look<00:01:40.840> for<00:01:41.080> the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
statistics and continues to look for the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.430 
statistics and continues to look for the
past<00:01:41.440> methods<00:01:42.429> based<00:01:42.940> on<00:01:43.270> science<00:01:43.869> they're

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
past methods based on science they're

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.440 
past methods based on science they're
always<00:01:44.560> learning<00:01:44.830> as<00:01:45.550> coaches<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.179> think<00:01:46.330> our

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
always learning as coaches and think our

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.719 
always learning as coaches and think our
job<00:01:46.630> is<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.869> continue<00:01:47.350> learning<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:48.009> I<00:01:48.460> really

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
job is to continue learning and I really

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.100 
job is to continue learning and I really
appreciate<00:01:49.270> an<00:01:49.450> organization<00:01:50.080> that's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
appreciate an organization that's

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.380 
appreciate an organization that's
willing<00:01:50.679> to<00:01:50.860> change<00:01:51.100> things<00:01:51.460> well<00:01:52.030> last<00:01:52.240> year

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
willing to change things well last year

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.760 
willing to change things well last year
we<00:01:52.600> said<00:01:52.780> this<00:01:52.960> but<00:01:53.259> we've<00:01:53.440> done<00:01:53.619> more

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
we said this but we've done more

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.410 
we said this but we've done more
research<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.580> turns<00:01:54.610> out<00:01:54.970> this<00:01:55.179> year

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
research and it turns out this year

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.749 
research and it turns out this year
we're<00:01:55.600> going<00:01:55.750> to<00:01:55.869> say<00:01:56.050> this<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:56.530> me<00:01:57.429> means<00:01:57.670> a

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
we're going to say this that me means a

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.950 
we're going to say this that me means a
lot

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
lot

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.840 
lot
actually<00:01:59.290> trying<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.010> get<00:02:00.190> better<00:02:00.340> with<00:02:00.700> their

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
actually trying to get better with their

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.810 
actually trying to get better with their
doing

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.230 

I<00:02:03.909> think<00:02:04.750> because<00:02:04.960> GMS<00:02:05.710> is<00:02:05.950> so<00:02:06.370> scientifically

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
I think because GMS is so scientifically

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.540 
I think because GMS is so scientifically
based<00:02:07.540> on<00:02:07.960> data<00:02:08.289> driven<00:02:08.590> principles<00:02:09.250> and

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
based on data driven principles and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.460 
based on data driven principles and
methods<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.479> gives<00:02:10.660> coaches<00:02:11.200> new

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
methods that it gives coaches new

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.410 
methods that it gives coaches new
coaches<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.100> reason<00:02:12.610> for<00:02:12.820> doing<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.180> drill<00:02:13.390> a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
coaches of reason for doing a drill a

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.120 
coaches of reason for doing a drill a
certain<00:02:13.780> way<00:02:13.900> or<00:02:13.930> reason<00:02:14.560> for<00:02:15.070> giving

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
certain way or reason for giving

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.890 
certain way or reason for giving
positive<00:02:15.520> feedback<00:02:16.209> with<00:02:16.420> mindful

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
positive feedback with mindful

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.750 
positive feedback with mindful
repetitions<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.830> like<00:02:18.160> their<00:02:18.430> coaching

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
repetitions it's like their coaching

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.610 
repetitions it's like their coaching
experience<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.330> going<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.570> laugh<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.140> inspire

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
experience is going to laugh and inspire

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.170 
experience is going to laugh and inspire
and<00:02:20.950> they're<00:02:21.130> going<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.340> continue<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:22.000> learn

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
and they're going to continue to learn

that<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.110> kind<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.440> clinic<00:02:47.620> really<00:02:48.100> does

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
that this kind of clinic really does

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.530 
that this kind of clinic really does
better<00:02:48.550> than<00:02:48.640> anything<00:02:49.030> else<00:02:49.270> that<00:02:49.360> I've

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
better than anything else that I've

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.870 
better than anything else that I've
heard<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.920> as<00:02:51.100> coaches<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.610> think<00:02:51.820> the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
heard of and as coaches I think the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.540 
heard of and as coaches I think the
hands-on<00:02:52.270> aspect<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.930> you

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
hands-on aspect of you

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.640 
hands-on aspect of you
so<00:02:53.790> important<00:02:54.240> we<00:02:54.360> get<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.600> go<00:02:54.690> out<00:02:54.840> there<00:02:55.080> to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
so important we get to go out there to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.230 
so important we get to go out there to
get<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.040> things<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:56.490> we're<00:02:56.610> also<00:02:56.730> actively

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
get to do things but we're also actively

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.570 
get to do things but we're also actively
engaged<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.960> I<00:02:58.140> think<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:58.500> way<00:02:58.710> we<00:02:58.890> absorb<00:02:59.220> a

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
engaged and I think this way we absorb a

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.000 
engaged and I think this way we absorb a
significant<00:03:00.570> bit<00:03:00.960> more<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> information

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
significant bit more of the information

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.340 
significant bit more of the information
just<00:03:02.430> because<00:03:02.760> we're<00:03:03.030> actively<00:03:03.450> doing<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.140> as

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
just because we're actively doing it as

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.960 
just because we're actively doing it as
well<00:03:04.590> as<00:03:04.740> hearing<00:03:05.100> about<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.460> it's<00:03:05.790> just

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
well as hearing about it it's just

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.600 
well as hearing about it it's just
certainly<00:03:06.270> worth<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.720> took<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.830> couple<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.430> our

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
certainly worth it took a couple of our

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.600 
certainly worth it took a couple of our
club<00:03:09.060> we<00:03:09.720> hate<00:03:09.930> them<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.650> come<00:03:10.860> here<00:03:11.130> there

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
club we hate them to come here there

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.710 
club we hate them to come here there
have<00:03:11.700> been<00:03:11.790> coming<00:03:12.000> back<00:03:12.240> at<00:03:12.450> their<00:03:12.600> own

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
expense for the last couple of years

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.309 
expense for the last couple of years
because<00:03:14.520> they<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.330> love<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:15.660> much
