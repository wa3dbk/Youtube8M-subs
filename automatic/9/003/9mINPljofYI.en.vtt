00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.550 

the<00:00:03.000> giant<00:00:03.449> squid<00:00:03.810> is<00:00:03.840> thought<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.230> have<00:00:04.500> the

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
the giant squid is thought to have the

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.369 
the giant squid is thought to have the
most<00:00:04.859> acute<00:00:05.279> vision<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:05.910> any<00:00:06.150> animal<00:00:06.660> because

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
most acute vision of any animal because

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.160 
most acute vision of any animal because
four<00:00:07.620> eyes<00:00:07.770> size<00:00:08.670> matters<00:00:11.030> so<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.300> would<00:00:13.019> be

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
four eyes size matters so that would be

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.620 
four eyes size matters so that would be
how<00:00:13.320> big<00:00:13.610> their<00:00:14.610> eye<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.759> they<00:00:15.240> would<00:00:15.389> fit<00:00:15.540> in

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
how big their eye is they would fit in

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.490 
how big their eye is they would fit in
this<00:00:15.719> whole<00:00:15.870> space<00:00:16.109> like<00:00:16.320> that

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
this whole space like that

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.029 
this whole space like that
that's<00:00:16.740> Wow<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.720> eye<00:00:18.750> would<00:00:18.900> be<00:00:19.080> deep<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.890> this

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
that's Wow the eye would be deep in this

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.140 
that's Wow the eye would be deep in this
or<00:00:20.220> sticking<00:00:20.609> out<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.150> would<00:00:21.449> be<00:00:21.480> very<00:00:22.410> much

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
or sticking out it would be very much

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.720 
or sticking out it would be very much
lateral<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.390> shape<00:00:24.900> much<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> car<00:00:26.310> tire

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
lateral and shape much like a car tire

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.890 
lateral and shape much like a car tire
but<00:00:26.849> what's<00:00:27.000> popped<00:00:27.300> out<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.720> little

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
but what's popped out of that little

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.330 
but what's popped out of that little
aperture<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.470> you've<00:00:28.619> got<00:00:28.800> there<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
aperture that you've got there is the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.429 
aperture that you've got there is the
lens<00:00:29.609> I've<00:00:30.029> got<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.480> other<00:00:31.019> eye<00:00:31.109> this

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
lens I've got here the other eye this

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.920 
lens I've got here the other eye this
side<00:00:31.679> by<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:31.980> way<00:00:32.390> let's<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.719> if<00:00:33.809> it's

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
side by the way let's just see if it's

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.299 
side by the way let's just see if it's
got<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> lens<00:00:34.380> in<00:00:34.649> there<00:00:36.920> okay<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.160> see

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
got the lens in there okay we can see

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.780 
got the lens in there okay we can see
that<00:00:38.460> actually<00:00:38.579> those<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.270> lens<00:00:39.450> there<00:00:39.690> look

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
that actually those the lens there look

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.860 
that actually those the lens there look
and<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.879> oh<00:00:41.910> that's<00:00:42.270> brilliant<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.750> can

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and you oh that's brilliant you can

and you oh that's brilliant you can
actually<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.500> two<00:00:43.649> halves<00:00:43.920> joined

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
actually see the two halves joined

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.479 
actually see the two halves joined
together<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.670> perfectly<00:00:45.530> see<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.710> oh<00:00:46.920> that

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
together here perfectly see that oh that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.889 
together here perfectly see that oh that
is<00:00:47.700> cool<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.660> lens<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.730> still<00:00:50.730> attached<00:00:51.149> can

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
is cool the lens is still attached can

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.900 
is cool the lens is still attached can
you<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.350> I've<00:00:52.710> done<00:00:52.920> about<00:00:53.010> 130<00:00:53.760> of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you see that I've done about 130 of

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.779 
you see that I've done about 130 of
these<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.690> never<00:00:55.110> seen<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.949> before

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
these and I have never seen that before

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.020 
these and I have never seen that before
that's<00:00:57.210> pretty<00:00:57.449> remarkable<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:59.670> squid<00:00:59.910> eye

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that's pretty remarkable the squid eye

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.209 
that's pretty remarkable the squid eye
and<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.539> vertebrate<00:01:00.930> eye<00:01:01.020> are<00:01:01.350> really<00:01:01.649> very

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and the vertebrate eye are really very

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.979 
and the vertebrate eye are really very
similar<00:01:02.489> they've<00:01:02.789> converged<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> same

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
similar they've converged on the same

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.200 
similar they've converged on the same
pattern<00:01:04.320> from<00:01:05.100> very<00:01:05.460> different<00:01:05.670> starting

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
pattern from very different starting

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.940 
pattern from very different starting
points<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.110> an<00:01:07.380> interesting<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
points there is an interesting and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.390 
points there is an interesting and
revealing<00:01:08.100> difference<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.560> squid<00:01:10.860> eye<00:01:11.010> is

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
revealing difference the squid eye is

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.460 
revealing difference the squid eye is
you<00:01:11.729> might<00:01:11.939> say<00:01:11.970> well<00:01:12.420> designed<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you might say well designed because the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.010 
you might say well designed because the
retina<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> right<00:01:14.220> way<00:01:14.430> around<00:01:14.659> with<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
retina is the right way around with the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.320 
retina is the right way around with the
light-sensitive<00:01:16.590> cells<00:01:17.159> pointing<00:01:17.820> towards

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
light-sensitive cells pointing towards

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
engineer would have designed them and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.609

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the vertebrate eye does work very well

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.480 
the vertebrate eye does work very well
it's<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.930> good<00:01:49.049> example<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.860> evolution<00:01:50.340> of

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it's a good example in evolution of

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.300 
it's a good example in evolution of
recovery<00:01:51.329> from<00:01:52.020> what<00:01:52.500> might<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:52.829> first<00:01:53.070> sight

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
recovery from what might at first sight

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.020 
recovery from what might at first sight
have<00:01:53.549> looked<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.850> bad<00:01:54.570> design
