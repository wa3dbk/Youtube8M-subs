00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.810
 areas of Brazil will have more rain 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.000
 the areas of brazil will have less rain 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.820
 during this period and we can 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.549
 see that we will have a condition of 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.949
 less rain in south-central areas right 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.170
 we will have a little more instability 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.330
 about the region of mato grosso do sul but 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.240
 southeastern areas are already starting to have a 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.849
 accumulated, the predominance is already 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.220
 rainfall and the order of 30 millimeters 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.260
 in these orange tones but some areas 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.840
 de sÃ£o paulo de minas gerais and also 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.940
 even large river must have volumes 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.920
 of rain that can reach 70 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.079
 accumulated in the south of the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.989
 Brazil the passage of a cold front will 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.550
 bring rain to areas of south-central 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.649
 region of rio grande do sul 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.230
 but in other areas the trend is also 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.390
 the rainfall is predominant over the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.460
 northeastern region of brazil is also 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.440
 a subsistence of air over areas 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.629
 central we should not have large 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.609
 accumulated rainfall in this area 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.100
 during the next 15 days but 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.260
 the coastal area is still subject to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.750
 of moisture coming from the ocean 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.210
 there will be some rain showers in 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.090
 the entire eastern strip and also in areas of the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.549
 Northeastern and north coast 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.860
 to the losses we can see that until the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.020
 day we will have a drastic reduction of 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.840
 rain on areas of southeastern Brazil the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.030
 predominance will be more polar air and more 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.250
 time than actually attending. 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.170
 instability and rain we do not have 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.090
 no system organizing the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.000
 instability in the region and we see that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.189
 we will hardly have volumes of 30 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.380
 millimeters 15 mm accumulated in 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.090
 some areas of southern Brazil 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.270
 still has the passage of some systems 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.939
 which promises to bring rain but not great 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.630
 accumulated volumes in these 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.399
 orange 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.799
 we will hardly reach 30 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.659
 millimeters accumulated during this 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.180
 period, we can also see a 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.340
 little less than instability over areas 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.290
 from the west center we will still have a little 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.689
 more rain on areas of the region 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.360
 north of Brazil where areas especially 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.540
 of the north central region of Amazonas 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.209
 and even the northern tip of the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.830
 will have volumes that can reach the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.830
 150 mm accumulated
