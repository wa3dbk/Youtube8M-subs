a little incorrect i think 12 is a good
number<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:31.160> don't<00:00:31.490> think<00:00:31.580> it's<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.210> minimum

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660

avenge<00:01:59.899> runs<00:02:00.170> I<00:02:00.319> guess<00:02:00.499> but<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.490> right<00:02:01.700> play

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
avenge runs I guess but the right play

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.730 
avenge runs I guess but the right play
was<00:02:02.060> to<00:02:02.210> do<00:02:02.299> that<00:02:02.479> we<00:02:02.689> didn't<00:02:02.899> want<00:02:03.049> land<00:02:03.229> we

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
was to do that we didn't want land we

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.539 
was to do that we didn't want land we
want<00:02:03.950> some<00:02:04.130> gas<00:02:04.310> at<00:02:04.549> this<00:02:04.700> point<00:02:06.549> surprisingly

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
want some gas at this point surprisingly

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.910 
want some gas at this point surprisingly
this<00:02:07.789> deck<00:02:08.030> draws<00:02:08.509> gas<00:02:08.810> constantly<00:02:09.679> and

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
this deck draws gas constantly and

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.860 
this deck draws gas constantly and
you'll<00:02:10.039> see<00:02:10.280> like<00:02:10.490> it<00:02:10.670> almost<00:02:10.970> always<00:02:11.420> works

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
you'll see like it almost always works

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.320 
you'll see like it almost always works
out<00:02:12.110> this<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.740> littlest<00:02:13.490> gas<00:02:13.700> like<00:02:14.060> you'll

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
out this is the littlest gas like you'll

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.110 
out this is the littlest gas like you'll
generally<00:02:14.840> see<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.319> like<00:02:15.560> one<00:02:15.830> Walker<00:02:16.120> until

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
generally see is like one Walker until

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.580 
generally see is like one Walker until
you<00:02:17.240> can<00:02:17.480> trip<00:02:17.750> into<00:02:18.020> something<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.440> few

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
you can trip into something a few

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.690 
you can trip into something a few

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
and I've just I got a counter that I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.740 
and I've just I got a counter that I
don't<00:02:24.489> like<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> lot<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.910> fliers<00:02:25.209> on<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.540> board

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
there's three of them threes the exact

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.170 
there's three of them threes the exact
right<00:02:32.200> number<00:02:32.590> Gideon<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.670> good<00:02:33.940> against

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
right number Gideon is good against

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.960
