hunters<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:07.610> think<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.820> hope<00:01:09.090> he<00:01:09.270> told<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:09.720> I

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
hunters I think I hope he told it but I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.390 
hunters I think I hope he told it but I
think<00:01:09.840> he<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.229> bring<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> arachnid<00:01:11.070> helmet

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
think he will bring the arachnid helmet

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.500 
think he will bring the arachnid helmet
even<00:01:11.790> though<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.000> pretty<00:01:12.150> much<00:01:12.299> useless

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
even though it's pretty much useless

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.789 
even though it's pretty much useless
because<00:01:12.810> when<00:01:13.110> your<00:01:13.229> aim<00:01:13.350> down<00:01:13.470> sights<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
because when your aim down sights that

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.929 
because when your aim down sights that

the golden gonna gives you extra

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.870 
the golden gonna gives you extra
accuracy<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:16.310> really<00:01:17.310> hope<00:01:17.430> he<00:01:17.490> doesn't<00:01:17.790> bring

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
accuracy I really hope he doesn't bring

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.310 
accuracy I really hope he doesn't bring
that<00:01:18.090> because<00:01:18.240> that's<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.659> crappy<00:01:18.840> exotic
