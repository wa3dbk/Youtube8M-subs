00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
the ability to do that at least not

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.380 
the ability to do that at least not
right<00:00:54.950> now<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:55.610> when<00:00:55.790> you're<00:00:55.910> when<00:00:56.270> you're

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
right now so when you're when you're

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.840 
right now so when you're when you're
actually<00:00:56.720> saving<00:00:57.470> and<00:00:57.950> silver<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:58.400> gold

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
actually saving and silver and gold

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.840 
actually saving and silver and gold
you're<00:00:59.660> basically<00:01:00.079> taking<00:01:00.350> what<00:01:01.280> we<00:01:01.400> think<00:01:01.700> of

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
you're basically taking what we think of

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.700 
you're basically taking what we think of
as<00:01:01.970> capital<00:01:02.540> out<00:01:02.720> of<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.930> market<00:01:03.200> for<00:01:03.650> some

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
as capital out of the market for some

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.630 
as capital out of the market for some
future<00:01:04.220> purchase<00:01:04.850> at<00:01:05.030> some<00:01:05.269> point<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:06.280> it's<00:01:07.280> a

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
future purchase at some point and it's a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.810 
future purchase at some point and it's a
saving<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:08.479> it's<00:01:08.659> good<00:01:08.960> from<00:01:09.229> that<00:01:09.380> aspect<00:01:09.890> but

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
saving so it's good from that aspect but

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.499 
saving so it's good from that aspect but
it<00:01:11.000> isn't<00:01:11.420> really<00:01:11.659> helping<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:12.350> economy<00:01:13.509> grow

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
it isn't really helping the economy grow

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.420 
it isn't really helping the economy grow
when<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:14.899> take<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.290> out<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:15.439> just<00:01:15.680> hold<00:01:15.950> on<00:01:16.159> to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
when you take it out and just hold on to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.010 
when you take it out and just hold on to
it<00:01:16.460> in<00:01:16.759> other<00:01:16.880> words<00:01:17.149> it's<00:01:17.360> more<00:01:17.840> or<00:01:17.900> less<00:01:17.930> a

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
it in other words it's more or less a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.300 
it in other words it's more or less a
stagnant<00:01:18.770> investment<00:01:19.750> so<00:01:20.830> coming<00:01:21.830> back<00:01:22.040> on

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
stagnant investment so coming back on

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.399 
stagnant investment so coming back on
point<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:24.550> like<00:01:25.550> dollar<00:01:26.120> cost<00:01:26.420> averaging<00:01:26.960> and

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
point I like dollar cost averaging and

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.840 
point I like dollar cost averaging and
if<00:01:27.530> you're<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.830> bull<00:01:27.979> market<00:01:28.010> you<00:01:28.490> just<00:01:28.670> put

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
if you're in a bull market you just put

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.940 
if you're in a bull market you just put
in<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.060> same<00:01:29.360> amount<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:29.840> dollars<00:01:30.080> or<00:01:30.500> euros

or Frank's or whatever into the market

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.340 
or Frank's or whatever into the market
every<00:01:33.620> month<00:01:34.130> at<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:35.270> same<00:01:35.540> time<00:01:35.930> more<00:01:36.290> or

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
less and you build your silver and gold

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.910 
less and you build your silver and gold
money<00:01:40.130> that<00:01:40.490> way<00:01:40.760> and<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:41.840> one<00:01:42.409> like<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.860> said

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
money that way and that one like I said

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.550 
money that way and that one like I said
gets<00:01:43.280> rid<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.580> emotion<00:01:44.150> it<00:01:44.600> teaches

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
gets rid of the emotion it teaches

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.830 
gets rid of the emotion it teaches
discipline<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.460> over<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.210> long<00:01:47.360> term<00:01:47.420> you'll

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
discipline and over the long term you'll

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.960 
discipline and over the long term you'll
get<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:47.990> good<00:01:48.229> average<00:01:48.470> price<00:01:48.890> but<00:01:49.670> what<00:01:49.790> most

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970

into what's called accumulation

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.410 
into what's called accumulation
and<00:02:25.980> then<00:02:26.310> they<00:02:26.490> do<00:02:26.910> what's<00:02:27.270> called

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
and then they do what's called

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.540 
and then they do what's called
distribution<00:02:28.320> they<00:02:28.860> have<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.280> bigger

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
distribution they have to bigger

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.080 
distribution they have to bigger
positions<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.480> get<00:02:30.660> into<00:02:30.930> any<00:02:31.140> market<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:32.520> one

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
fast so if they want to get a position

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.220 
fast so if they want to get a position
they<00:02:38.400> will<00:02:38.580> accumulate<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.240> over<00:02:39.480> time<00:02:39.690> and

never<00:02:43.560> looking<00:02:44.040> for<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> exact<00:02:44.640> bottom<00:02:45.060> or

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
never looking for the exact bottom or

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.120 
never looking for the exact bottom or
the<00:02:45.300> exact<00:02:45.690> top<00:02:45.960> they're<00:02:46.260> looking<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.650> take<00:02:46.890> a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
the exact top they're looking to take a

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.980 
the exact top they're looking to take a
good<00:02:47.490> portion<00:02:47.850> out<00:02:48.240> of<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.480> middle<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
good portion out of the middle of the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.410 
good portion out of the middle of the
market<00:02:49.230> which<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.040> exactly<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.940> best<00:02:51.090> way<00:02:51.360> to

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
market which is exactly the best way to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.660 
market which is exactly the best way to
do<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.320> would<00:02:52.590> say<00:02:52.709> dollar<00:02:52.950> cost<00:02:53.220> average

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
do it so I would say dollar cost average

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.320 
do it so I would say dollar cost average
is<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.360> best<00:02:54.570> way<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.780> approach<00:02:55.080> it
