00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.760
 hello everyone and if michel 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.230
 lacasse canine educator 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.389
 today I explain to you how 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.969
 train a switch 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 behavior or if you prefer the stop 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.760
 which is very useful when you have a dog 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.760
 or a show 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.290
 a few weeks ago I put in 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.480
 line a video in which 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.090
 I was driving a switch 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.950
 behavior as soon as I said to August the 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.480
 unfortunate had to stop because he 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.460
 was doing and coming to see me 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.960
 and there you were very numerous 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.910
 ask me how I had done for 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.500
 teach him that so if what I do you 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.540
 explain today it's nothing 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.820
 difficult and the switch of 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.629
 behavior barely served at all but bar 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.190
 circumstances 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.350
 the dog that directs to the door in 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.300
 yapping the chef too who will eat 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.699
 something that shines is forbidden to 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.980
 inside or outside one can 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.690
 also use it to handle the game that 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.180
 start to be a little bit too much 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.870
 intense between two dogs short is a 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.330
 commandment 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.830
 we can almost always use for 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.870
 renowned locality that as you know 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.110
 do not tell dogs what he has to 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.090
 make 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.680
 when you enter a dog to do 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.290
 something new you have to 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.850
 always do it without distraction for 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.560
 the shelling needs of videos 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.510
 we are on the outside but I am 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.490
 advise to start in the house 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.640
 to put all the chances of your 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.640
 side 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.479
 the first step is to pack 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.159
 the dog at the word stop using you 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.040
 treats one seeks to create a 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.930
 association that is really positive on 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.670
 said stop we give a treat and we 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.740
 repeat exercise two or three times by 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.420
 day for a few days usually 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.280
 the dog against a guide after the 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.700
 stop it give him something 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.700
 delicious 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.200
 it 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.800
 stop 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.140
 once we have conditioned the word stop 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.390
 we add a little distance and 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.580
 distraction we move away from the dog 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.740
 we say stop and if he comes to see us we 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.970
 gives a treat in the video for 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.220
 better said follow me and always stay 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.470
 I think that speaks of distance so I 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.300
 just waited he sniffs for 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.840
 give him the command and that has 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.530
 worked 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.530
 Bravo 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.630
 Stadium 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.349
 finally for the third stage we 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.599
 train with different objects me I 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.640
 I used to play that I danced at 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.720
 stop your who was supposed to stop his race 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.190
 came to see me 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.780
 obviously as required to 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.640
 a lot of value for him I 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.530
 started with toys we had a 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.540
 little bit less when after the dog 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.120
 we do not forget we always have to 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.810
 put in a situation where he's going to have 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.810
 success 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.920
 good cap 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.830
 whore 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.700
 and what does it give to the everyday 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.700
 bath here's an example 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.360
 the thur and that's how we learn 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.190
 a behavior switch it's 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.780
 simple and I invite you to do it and to 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.640
 you use it in all kinds of 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.720
 situations at home a thing 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.850
 important specified 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.730
 when your dog does a behavior 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.680
 of my pots and that you say stop 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.760
 redirect it then into something else and 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.410
 if in training 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.000
 you have difficulty it is 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.770
 maybe because you're going too fast 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.540
 then go back 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.850
 go quietly with short 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.070
 distraction center sessions early 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.860
 and always with rewards that the 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.360
 dog loves a lot about this nice tool good
