her that and that she I think she never
refused<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.410> I<00:01:31.410> guess<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.280> house<00:01:32.460> was

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
refused and I guess your house was

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.310 
refused and I guess your house was

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
argue with one of my articles a lot i

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.770 
argue with one of my articles a lot i
think<00:02:04.560> he<00:02:04.739> was<00:02:04.860> smoking<00:02:05.429> or<00:02:05.580> some<00:02:05.729> tighter<00:02:05.970> and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
think he was smoking or some tighter and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.740 
think he was smoking or some tighter and
she<00:02:07.380> wouldn't<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.190> him<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.399> smoke<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.690> she

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
she wouldn't want him to smoke so so she

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.040 
she wouldn't want him to smoke so so she
would<00:02:10.020> throw<00:02:10.200> water<00:02:10.440> him

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
would throw water him

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.440 
would throw water him
she<00:02:13.050> made<00:02:13.230> me<00:02:13.350> think<00:02:14.120> recently<00:02:15.120> about

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
she made me think recently about

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.220 
she made me think recently about
importance<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.350> ideas<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.130> we<00:02:17.340> hold<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.230> how

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
importance of ideas that we hold and how

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.059 
importance of ideas that we hold and how
they<00:02:19.440> shape<00:02:19.830> over<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> lifetime<00:02:21.860> tricky<00:02:22.860> tricky

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069

they shape over a lifetime tricky tricky
tricky<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:24.360> seems<00:02:24.780> as<00:02:24.990> there<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> pattern

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
tricky it seems as there is a pattern

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.970 
tricky it seems as there is a pattern
where<00:02:26.340> people<00:02:26.880> abandon<00:02:27.450> their<00:02:28.020> ideals<00:02:28.500> when

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980
