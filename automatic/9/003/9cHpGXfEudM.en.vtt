users are links users you need to have
open<00:04:19.850> Java<00:04:20.090> to<00:04:20.390> open<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:22.190> UI<00:04:22.370> so<00:04:23.180> here<00:04:23.360> it

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
open Java to open the the UI so here it

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.930 
open Java to open the the UI so here it
goes<00:04:24.940> ok<00:04:26.050> so<00:04:27.050> this<00:04:27.560> top<00:04:27.830> one<00:04:27.860> right<00:04:28.160> here<00:04:28.400> says

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
goes ok so this top one right here says

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.940 
goes ok so this top one right here says
SDK<00:04:29.900> platform<00:04:30.410> android<00:04:30.800> 2.2<00:04:31.370> api<00:04:31.940> 8<00:04:32.800> make<00:04:33.800> sure

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
SDK platform android 2.2 api 8 make sure

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.830 
SDK platform android 2.2 api 8 make sure
that<00:04:34.160> says<00:04:34.370> except<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:35.000> then<00:04:35.510> you<00:04:35.660> can

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
that says except and then you can

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.080 
that says except and then you can
uncheck<00:04:36.110> all<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.770> other<00:04:37.040> ones<00:04:37.340> right<00:04:37.580> here<00:04:37.610> so

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
uncheck all the other ones right here so

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.810 
uncheck all the other ones right here so
reject<00:04:38.570> all<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.870> other<00:04:38.990> ones<00:04:40.120> ok<00:04:42.640> so<00:04:43.640> there's

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
reject all the other ones ok so there's

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.130 
reject all the other ones ok so there's
a<00:04:43.880> bunch<00:04:44.060> of<00:04:44.120> them<00:04:44.210> just<00:04:44.510> reject<00:04:44.870> all<00:04:45.050> the

a bunch of them just reject all the

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.450 
a bunch of them just reject all the
other<00:04:45.290> ones<00:04:45.470> you'll<00:04:45.650> need<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:45.920> download<00:04:46.070> those

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460
