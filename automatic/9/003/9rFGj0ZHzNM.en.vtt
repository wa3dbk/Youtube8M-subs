corresponding sizes in other countries

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.700 
corresponding sizes in other countries
and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.250> has<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.420> diameter<00:01:30.869> number

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
and then it has the diameter number

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.359 
and then it has the diameter number
which<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.869> millimeters<00:01:33.869> across<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
which is the millimeters across the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.550 
which is the millimeters across the
inside<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> ring<00:01:36.240> from<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.780> side<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.200> the

inside of the ring from one side to the
other<00:01:37.710> directly<00:01:38.610> across<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:40.079> also<00:01:40.439> with

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
other directly across and then also with

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.550 
other directly across and then also with
that<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.460> has<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.140> circumference<00:01:43.140> in

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
that it has a circumference in

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.310 
that it has a circumference in
millimeters<00:01:44.189> which<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.990> took<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
millimeters which is if you took a

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.160 
millimeters which is if you took a
thread<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.610> measured<00:01:48.000> around<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.360> inside<00:01:48.840> of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
thread and measured around the inside of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.420 
thread and measured around the inside of
the<00:01:49.290> ring<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.619> that's<00:01:49.740> very<00:01:50.009> important<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the ring and that's very important to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.429 
the ring and that's very important to
the<00:01:50.490> inside<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.210> ring<00:01:51.420> all<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.170> way

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
the inside of the ring all the way

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.440 
the inside of the ring all the way
around<00:01:52.530> that's<00:01:53.100> how<00:01:53.220> many<00:01:53.399> millimeters<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
around that's how many millimeters it is

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.550 
around that's how many millimeters it is
to<00:01:54.899> fit<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:56.070> certain<00:01:56.640> size<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:58.049> get<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
to fit a certain size so you can get the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200 
to fit a certain size so you can get the
these<00:01:58.890> ring<00:01:59.130> size<00:01:59.340> charts<00:01:59.670> anywhere<00:02:00.030> just

Google

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.550 
Google
is<00:02:02.750> o-ring<00:02:03.740> sizes<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.759> you'll<00:02:05.540> find<00:02:06.140> what<00:02:06.439> you

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
is o-ring sizes and you'll find what you

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.080 
is o-ring sizes and you'll find what you
need<00:02:06.770> put<00:02:07.189> that<00:02:07.399> out<00:02:07.579> because<00:02:07.850> you're<00:02:08.000> gonna

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
need put that out because you're gonna

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.990 
need put that out because you're gonna
use<00:02:08.330> it<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.599> lot

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
use it a lot

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000 
use it a lot
okay<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:12.550> first<00:02:13.550> ring<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:15.170> gonna<00:02:15.349> be<00:02:15.560> hammered

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
okay so first ring is gonna be hammered

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.820 
okay so first ring is gonna be hammered
with<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.280> 16<00:02:16.730> gauge<00:02:17.000> wire<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.720> I'm<00:02:18.709> gonna

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
with the 16 gauge wire and I'm gonna

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.630 
with the 16 gauge wire and I'm gonna
make<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.250> size<00:02:19.459> 6<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:21.230> I'm<00:02:21.920> gonna<00:02:22.130> look<00:02:22.340> on<00:02:22.489> my

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
make it a size 6 so I'm gonna look on my

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.339 
make it a size 6 so I'm gonna look on my
chart<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:26.080> 51.9<00:02:27.550> millimeters

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
chart and that is a 51.9 millimeters

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.640 
chart and that is a 51.9 millimeters
circumference<00:02:30.349> now<00:02:31.569> what<00:02:32.569> I<00:02:32.599> do<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.410> other

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
circumference now what I do and other

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.559 
circumference now what I do and other
other<00:02:34.280> people<00:02:34.370> do<00:02:34.790> probably<00:02:35.120> do<00:02:35.390> this

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
other people do probably do this

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.509 
other people do probably do this
differently<00:02:36.049> but<00:02:36.319> this<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.620> what<00:02:36.799> I<00:02:36.830> do<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.459> it

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
differently but this is what I do and it

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.870 
differently but this is what I do and it
works<00:02:37.670> for<00:02:37.910> me<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.650> take<00:02:39.650> my<00:02:39.860> flat<00:02:41.380> flat<00:02:42.380> edge

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
works for me I take my flat flat edge

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.030 
works for me I take my flat flat edge
nippers<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.930> make<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.350> end<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.830> wire

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
nippers and I make the end of the wire

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.680 
nippers and I make the end of the wire
flat<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.620> then<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.920> measure<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.760> half<00:02:50.239> size

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
flat and then I measure a half size

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.160 
flat and then I measure a half size
larger<00:02:51.049> then<00:02:51.709> I'm<00:02:51.860> gonna<00:02:52.069> make<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.150> Rings

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
larger then I'm gonna make the Rings

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.320 
larger then I'm gonna make the Rings
so<00:02:55.600> for<00:02:56.600> six-and-a-half<00:02:57.080> its<00:02:58.330> 53.1

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
so for six-and-a-half its 53.1

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.690 
so for six-and-a-half its 53.1
millimeters<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:02.049> just<00:03:03.190> lay<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.250> flat<00:03:04.489> here

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
millimeters I just lay it flat here

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.580 
millimeters I just lay it flat here
measured

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.750 

53.1<00:03:12.590> and<00:03:13.519> then<00:03:14.300> I<00:03:14.750> take<00:03:15.050> my<00:03:15.430> clippers<00:03:16.430> again

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
53.1 and then I take my clippers again

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.930 
53.1 and then I take my clippers again
on<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.180> flat<00:03:17.450> side<00:03:18.040> it's<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.099> flat<00:03:19.340> side<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.790> on

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
on the flat side it's a flat side is on

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.070 
on the flat side it's a flat side is on
the<00:03:20.060> part<00:03:20.300> of<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.480> water<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.810> you're<00:03:20.870> going

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
the part of the water that you're going

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.750 
the part of the water that you're going
to<00:03:21.140> use<00:03:21.349> for<00:03:21.379> the<00:03:21.650> Rings<00:03:21.860> to<00:03:22.010> do<00:03:22.129> the<00:03:22.250> nice<00:03:22.430> flat

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
to use for the Rings to do the nice flat

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.979 
to use for the Rings to do the nice flat
cut<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.239> cut<00:03:23.390> right<00:03:23.599> on<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.900> line<00:03:25.959> now<00:03:26.959> I

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
cut and cut right on that line now I

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.110 
cut and cut right on that line now I
have<00:03:27.319> my<00:03:27.560> piece<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.400> silver<00:03:28.700> that's<00:03:28.879> going<00:03:29.060> to

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
have my piece of silver that's going to

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.420 
have my piece of silver that's going to
make<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.420> ring<00:03:29.599> and<00:03:29.900> that's<00:03:30.049> how<00:03:30.890> long<00:03:31.099> I<00:03:31.220> cut

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
make the ring and that's how long I cut

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.210 
make the ring and that's how long I cut
it<00:03:31.580> now<00:03:32.330> for<00:03:32.599> the<00:03:32.690> flat<00:03:33.140> wire<00:03:33.410> that's<00:03:33.830> going<00:03:33.950> to

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
it now for the flat wire that's going to

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.940 
it now for the flat wire that's going to
be<00:03:34.310> made<00:03:34.519> into<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.849> smooth<00:03:35.239> band<00:03:35.769> I'm<00:03:36.769> also

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
be made into a smooth band I'm also

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.190 
be made into a smooth band I'm also
gonna<00:03:37.220> cut<00:03:37.519> this<00:03:37.670> Versailles<00:03:38.239> six<00:03:38.660> but<00:03:39.170> the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
gonna cut this Versailles six but the

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.839 
gonna cut this Versailles six but the
process<00:03:39.680> is<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:39.860> little<00:03:40.190> bit<00:03:40.310> different<00:03:40.700> since

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
process is a little bit different since

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.280 
process is a little bit different since
you're<00:03:41.030> not<00:03:41.150> hammering<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.870> have<00:03:42.019> to<00:03:42.140> be<00:03:42.260> a

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
you're not hammering you have to be a

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.839 
you're not hammering you have to be a
little<00:03:42.500> bit<00:03:42.680> more<00:03:42.860> precise<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.519> you<00:03:43.579> have<00:03:43.730> to

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
little bit more precise and you have to

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.150 
little bit more precise and you have to
do<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.000> different<00:03:44.269> type<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:45.170> calculation<00:03:46.010> and

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
do a different type of calculation and

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.770 
do a different type of calculation and
you're<00:03:46.340> measuring<00:03:46.670> to<00:03:46.940> make<00:03:47.329> sure<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:47.660> the

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
you're measuring to make sure that the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.319 
you're measuring to make sure that the
ring<00:03:47.959> comes<00:03:48.260> out<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.650> right<00:03:48.829> size<00:03:49.329> without

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
ring comes out the right size without

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.380 
ring comes out the right size without
having<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.170> alter<00:03:51.980> it<00:03:52.160> in<00:03:52.310> any<00:03:52.519> way<00:03:52.790> or<00:03:53.120> Hammer

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
having to alter it in any way or Hammer

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.699 
having to alter it in any way or Hammer
it<00:03:53.690> because<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.019> want<00:03:54.200> to<00:03:54.230> have<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.410> smooth

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
it because you want to have a smooth

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.369 
it because you want to have a smooth
finish<00:03:54.980> so<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.819> make<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.120> size<00:03:56.390> six<00:03:56.810> now<00:03:57.200> I'm

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
finish so to make a size six now I'm

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.250 
finish so to make a size six now I'm
going<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.739> check<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.129> diameter<00:03:59.260> measurement

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
going to check the diameter measurement

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.979 
going to check the diameter measurement
first<00:04:00.500> size<00:04:00.709> six<00:04:01.099> which<00:04:01.549> is<00:04:01.579> sixteen<00:04:02.569> point

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
you're gonna add in to that the widths

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.379 
you're gonna add in to that the widths
are<00:04:15.920> the<00:04:16.130> thickness<00:04:16.639> of<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:18.049> stock<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.680> this

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
are the thickness of the stock and this

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.710 
are the thickness of the stock and this
stock<00:04:20.389> is<00:04:20.660> one<00:04:20.900> millimeter<00:04:21.320> thick<00:04:22.180> and<00:04:23.180> I<00:04:23.510> can

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
stock is one millimeter thick and I can

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.920 
stock is one millimeter thick and I can
make<00:04:23.990> sure<00:04:24.020> with<00:04:24.560> my<00:04:24.639> caliper<00:04:25.639> here<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.750> is

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
make sure with my caliper here that is

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.839 
make sure with my caliper here that is
and<00:04:27.380> verify<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:27.889> it<00:04:28.280> is<00:04:28.310> one<00:04:28.849> millimeter

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
and verify that it is one millimeter

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.219 
and verify that it is one millimeter
okay<00:04:32.919> so<00:04:33.919> add<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:34.580> one<00:04:35.150> millimeter<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.930> my

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
okay so add that one millimeter to my

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:37.810 
okay so add that one millimeter to my
sixteen<00:04:36.620> point<00:04:36.830> five<00:04:37.010> millimeters<00:04:37.669> which

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
sixteen point five millimeters which

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.940 
sixteen point five millimeters which
gives<00:04:38.060> me<00:04:38.210> said<00:04:38.440> seventeen<00:04:39.440> point<00:04:39.800> five

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
gives me said seventeen point five

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.950 
gives me said seventeen point five
millimeters<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:40.820> that's<00:04:41.630> where<00:04:41.840> my

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
millimeters and that's where my

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.900 
millimeters and that's where my
calculator<00:04:42.500> comes<00:04:42.800> in<00:04:43.039> handy<00:04:43.280> because<00:04:43.550> what

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
calculator comes in handy because what

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.719 
calculator comes in handy because what
you're<00:04:44.030> gonna<00:04:44.150> do<00:04:44.419> to<00:04:44.720> get<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:45.020> actual<00:04:45.729> inner

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
you're gonna do to get the actual inner

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.390 
you're gonna do to get the actual inner
circumference<00:04:47.450> of<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.900> ring<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:49.010> earth

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
circumference of the ring that earth

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.360 
circumference of the ring that earth
that<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:49.789> need<00:04:50.090> you're<00:04:50.720> gonna<00:04:50.810> take<00:04:51.370> 17.5

that you need you're gonna take 17.5

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.570 
that you need you're gonna take 17.5
times<00:04:53.530> pi<00:04:54.530> which<00:04:55.340> is<00:04:55.370> 3.14<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:57.590> seventeen

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
times pi which is 3.14 so seventeen

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.700 
times pi which is 3.14 so seventeen
point<00:04:58.910> five

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.260 

turning<00:05:02.430> on<00:05:03.740> 17.5<00:05:04.740> times<00:05:05.360> 3.14<00:05:07.039> equals<00:05:08.270> 54

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
turning on 17.5 times 3.14 equals 54

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.510 
turning on 17.5 times 3.14 equals 54
point<00:05:09.630> nine<00:05:09.810> five<00:05:10.139> okay<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.039> i'm<00:05:11.130> gonna<00:05:11.310> round
