00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
that the bar we have to have that let's

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.970 
that the bar we have to have that let's
go<00:02:47.630> ahead<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.870> put<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.049> together<00:02:48.200> now<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
go ahead and put it together now the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.550 
go ahead and put it together now the
concept<00:02:49.430> behind<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.819> toy<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.420> take<00:02:50.720> Mike

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
concept behind the toy is to take Mike

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.900 
concept behind the toy is to take Mike
and<00:02:52.269> flip<00:02:53.269> him<00:02:53.510> over<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.739> bar<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.730> he

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
and flip him over the bar so that he

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.180 
and flip him over the bar so that he
goes<00:02:56.209> up<00:02:56.480> here<00:02:56.750> like<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.069> sounds

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
goes up here like so then that sounds

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.569 
goes up here like so then that sounds
cool<00:02:58.400> Bobby<00:02:59.890> well<00:03:00.890> there's<00:03:01.130> also<00:03:01.310> these

a lot of neat little place at things to
this<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.340> only<00:03:16.519> thing<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:16.910> would<00:03:17.090> be

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
this the only thing that I would be

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.569 
this the only thing that I would be
concerned<00:03:17.930> about<00:03:18.140> being<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.069> parent<00:03:19.250> is<00:03:19.549> the

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
concerned about being a parent is the

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.289 
concerned about being a parent is the
flipping<00:03:20.299> so<00:03:21.220> let's<00:03:22.220> do<00:03:22.400> some<00:03:22.610> flipping<00:03:23.060> Bobby

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
flipping so let's do some flipping Bobby

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.610 
flipping so let's do some flipping Bobby
you<00:03:23.480> want<00:03:23.569> to<00:03:23.720> try<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.019> see<00:03:24.170> if<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.319> can<00:03:24.470> make

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
you want to try and see if we can make

00:03:24.620 --> 00:04:37.670 
you want to try and see if we can make
not<00:03:24.859> might<00:03:25.239> go<00:03:26.239> over<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.600> bar<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.049> up<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.319> here

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.020 

so<00:04:38.680> what<00:04:38.830> do<00:04:38.920> you<00:04:38.980> think<00:04:39.130> about<00:04:39.220> Mike<00:04:39.550> flipping

Haymitch yes Bobby he didn't flip that
much<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.920> that's<00:04:45.070> one<00:04:45.220> of<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.370> main<00:04:45.550> things

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
much and that's one of the main things

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.940 
much and that's one of the main things
that<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.330> was<00:04:46.930> looking<00:04:47.350> at<00:04:47.500> when<00:04:47.710> we<00:04:47.830> were

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
that I was looking at when we were

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.950 
that I was looking at when we were
playing<00:04:48.220> with<00:04:48.490> us<00:04:48.640> when<00:04:48.820> he<00:04:48.910> would<00:04:49.120> flip<00:04:49.420> he

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
playing with us when he would flip he

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.360 
playing with us when he would flip he
was<00:04:50.110> hitting<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.410> ropes<00:04:50.650> here<00:04:50.950> more<00:04:51.190> than

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
was hitting the ropes here more than

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.780 
was hitting the ropes here more than
anything

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
anything

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.280 
anything
wasn't<00:04:52.120> he<00:04:52.180> Bobby<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.540> we<00:04:52.660> only<00:04:52.780> got<00:04:53.020> him<00:04:53.230> to

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
wasn't he Bobby and we only got him to

00:04:53.290 --> 00:05:00.570 
wasn't he Bobby and we only got him to
go<00:04:53.440> up<00:04:53.620> here<00:04:54.130> one<00:04:54.400> time<00:04:58.530> well<00:04:59.530> that's<00:05:00.370> what

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
go up here one time well that's what

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.330 
go up here one time well that's what
concerns<00:05:00.760> me<00:05:01.090> Bobby<00:05:01.390> because<00:05:02.160> Mike<00:05:03.160> the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
concerns me Bobby because Mike the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.230 
concerns me Bobby because Mike the
knight<00:05:03.490> himself<00:05:04.090> is<00:05:05.130> solid<00:05:06.130> plastic<00:05:06.640> so<00:05:06.880> he's

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
knight himself is solid plastic so he's

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.450 
knight himself is solid plastic so he's
for<00:05:07.780> two<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.170> up<00:05:08.290> he<00:05:08.980> doesn't<00:05:09.160> have<00:05:09.310> any

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
for two and up he doesn't have any

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.670 
for two and up he doesn't have any
moving<00:05:09.670> parts<00:05:09.820> so<00:05:10.270> there's<00:05:10.540> no<00:05:10.660> joking<00:05:11.320> answer

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
moving parts so there's no joking answer

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.240 
moving parts so there's no joking answer
being<00:05:11.890> anything<00:05:12.310> but<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.990> platform<00:05:14.920> with<00:05:15.220> the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
being anything but the platform with the

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.550 
being anything but the platform with the
flipping<00:05:15.580> action<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:16.360> mean<00:05:16.660> I'm<00:05:16.810> an<00:05:16.930> adult<00:05:17.380> and

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
flipping action I mean I'm an adult and

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.470 
flipping action I mean I'm an adult and
I<00:05:17.710> think<00:05:18.070> flipping<00:05:18.460> this<00:05:18.640> and<00:05:18.970> he<00:05:19.120> was<00:05:19.240> only

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
I think flipping this and he was only

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.760 
I think flipping this and he was only
going<00:05:19.750> up<00:05:19.870> in<00:05:20.020> this<00:05:20.170> area<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.470> I<00:05:20.530> was<00:05:20.650> having

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
going up in this area and I was having

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.680 
going up in this area and I was having
to<00:05:20.950> put<00:05:21.100> a<00:05:21.130> lot<00:05:21.340> of<00:05:21.490> force<00:05:21.670> and<00:05:21.940> effort<00:05:22.270> into<00:05:22.540> it

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
to put a lot of force and effort into it

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.320 
to put a lot of force and effort into it
and<00:05:23.250> he<00:05:24.250> wasn't<00:05:24.580> doing<00:05:24.640> what<00:05:24.910> he<00:05:25.030> was<00:05:25.180> supposed

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
and he wasn't doing what he was supposed

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.930 
and he wasn't doing what he was supposed
to<00:05:25.690> so<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.500> little<00:05:26.860> child<00:05:27.250> you<00:05:27.490> know<00:05:27.610> it's<00:05:27.760> two

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
to so a little child you know it's two

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.580 
to so a little child you know it's two
years<00:05:28.060> old<00:05:28.330> it's<00:05:28.660> gonna<00:05:28.750> really<00:05:29.110> have<00:05:29.380> some

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590

years old it's gonna really have some
problems<00:05:30.010> doing<00:05:30.310> this<00:05:30.490> so<00:05:31.450> this<00:05:31.990> may<00:05:32.200> not<00:05:32.230> be<00:05:32.590> a

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
problems doing this so this may not be a

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.240 
problems doing this so this may not be a
toy<00:05:32.980> for<00:05:33.760> two<00:05:34.600> and<00:05:34.810> up<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:35.200> maybe<00:05:35.530> for<00:05:35.980> three
