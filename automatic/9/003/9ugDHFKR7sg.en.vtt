00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.000
 Now this time, 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:18.270
 Let's take a look at the pentatonic scale. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:25.699
 It is sk which you should keep the scale which is used a lot 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.699
 The party came out the expression you see in the picture I KJV Obok paddle 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:37.809
 Fingerboard is haebomyeon looks a lot more and get going up here so plan 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:43.089
 This is the life for 4g pentatonik scale gonna take place on that point 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:49.510
 The part to do today is the 5th part 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:55.180
 255 days in writing loosen flash yoreotge yo yo form of huge blocks furnace 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:01:01.239
 What I'll study about is what the pattern next time will continue 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:05.950
 I'm going to study Scale, but today is Part 5 Play and 7 Play 8 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.600
 I hope to study for the open section between the player completely herpes 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.930
 You'll be crying. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:19.570
 Now, let's see how and when it actually connects to Kita. 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:25.210
 So when we look at it, we have a power knuckle. 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:30.280
 The requirement is that a floats on a minor pentatonic scale a 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.760
 Now that's why pentatonic is Ohi . 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.620
 Here. 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.330

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:43.580
 top 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:51.380
 Even if you move it like this, 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:53.030
 And yet another example referred to US Write him doing ah And it goes to the end in the US 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.050
 It will be like this.

 I'm sorry. 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:08.220
 So now it 's a block. Let's try this block today. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:13.590
 So , I'll see you doing that and I'll keep studying. 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:19.050
 Yes, I'll take a look at the pentatonic scale. 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:24.870
 1 and 2 are empty and empty. 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.900

 5 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.520
 I have a superiority other than ah, so I can usually arrive at any location 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.620
 You have to do a lot. 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.970
 So then, you can play something at night and make a play. 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.090
 I'll see. 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.800

 You're young, you're going anywhere. 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:41.659

 After correctly grasping the other prayer, keep the armor 2 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.370
