and thinks it's I think it's a great
topic<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> cover<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.650> I'm<00:00:31.710> going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.890> shoot<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
topic to cover so I'm going to shoot a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.040 
topic to cover so I'm going to shoot a
quick<00:00:32.579> video<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.000> lesson<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.899> tell

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
quick video and lesson on it and tell

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.380 
quick video and lesson on it and tell
you<00:00:34.140> some<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.500> thoughts<00:00:35.149> so<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> whole

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you some of my thoughts so the whole

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.220 
you some of my thoughts so the whole
idea<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:37.760> basically<00:00:38.760> when<00:00:39.510> you're<00:00:39.690> let's

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
idea is that basically when you're let's

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.049 
idea is that basically when you're let's
just<00:00:40.440> take<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> minor<00:00:41.129> pentatonic<00:00:41.250> scale

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
just take the a minor pentatonic scale

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.389 
just take the a minor pentatonic scale
because<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.450> very<00:00:42.840> popular<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.590> easy<00:00:43.739> let's

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
because it's very popular and easy let's

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.010 
because it's very popular and easy let's
say<00:00:44.550> you're<00:00:44.700> coming<00:00:44.940> backwards<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.870> or

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
say you're coming backwards on it or

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.050 
say you're coming backwards on it or
descending

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.120 

so<00:00:51.060> what<00:00:51.180> happens<00:00:51.630> a<00:00:51.930> lot<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.320> times<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.980> in

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
so what happens a lot of times and in

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.800 
so what happens a lot of times and in
this<00:00:53.280> case<00:00:53.490> what<00:00:53.670> Jim<00:00:53.880> was<00:00:53.910> talking<00:00:54.360> about<00:00:54.450> if

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
this case what Jim was talking about if

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.750 
this case what Jim was talking about if
my<00:00:55.140> finger<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> come<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.400> and<00:00:56.610> hit

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
my finger is going to come down and hit

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.580 
my finger is going to come down and hit
the<00:00:56.790> sixth<00:00:57.270> string<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.810> could<00:00:57.840> feel<00:00:58.380> it

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the sixth string I could feel it

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.370 
the sixth string I could feel it
touching<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.730> fifth<00:01:00.090> string<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.840> below<00:01:01.200> it

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
touching the fifth string right below it

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.620 
touching the fifth string right below it
and<00:01:01.530> was<00:01:02.489> wondering<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.060> is<00:01:03.300> something

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
and was wondering if that is something

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.630 
and was wondering if that is something
that<00:01:03.840> causes<00:01:04.410> a<00:01:04.559> problem<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:05.190> if<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.370> a<00:01:05.460> good

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
that causes a problem or if it's a good

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.790 
that causes a problem or if it's a good
thing<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.600> input<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.620> it's<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
thing and my input is actually it's a

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.700 
thing and my input is actually it's a
really<00:01:08.040> good<00:01:08.160> thing<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:09.210> long<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.380> does<00:01:10.530> not

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
what I teach a lot of students is that a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.410 
what I teach a lot of students is that a
big<00:01:22.110> part<00:01:22.410> about<00:01:22.860> playing<00:01:23.160> guitar<00:01:23.580> well<00:01:24.119> is

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
big part about playing guitar well is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.840 
big part about playing guitar well is
controlling<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:25.590> strings<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.340> don't<00:01:26.610> want

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
controlling the strings you don't want

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.270 
controlling the strings you don't want
to<00:01:27.060> ring<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.530> best<00:01:28.740> way<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
to ring out and the best way to do that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.160 
to ring out and the best way to do that
is<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> use<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:30.030> fingers<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.690> meet<00:01:30.899> a<00:01:30.930> lot<00:01:31.110> of

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
the silent or a lot of the noise

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.150 
the silent or a lot of the noise

all the extra noise all that stuff even
louder<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.250> control<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.479> want

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
louder so to control that what we want

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.690 
louder so to control that what we want
to<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.080> use<00:01:46.229> our<00:01:46.410> fingers<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> touch<00:01:47.399> other

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
to do is use our fingers to touch other

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.900 
to do is use our fingers to touch other
strings<00:01:48.289> to<00:01:49.289> mute<00:01:49.470> them<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.920> couple<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.640> ways<00:01:50.729> I

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
strings to mute them a couple of ways I

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.550 
strings to mute them a couple of ways I
really<00:01:51.240> use<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.930> time<00:01:52.170> are<00:01:52.440> in

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
really use this all the time are in

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.740 
really use this all the time are in
power<00:01:52.800> chords

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
power chords

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
power chords
so<00:01:54.750> let's<00:01:54.930> say<00:01:55.080> I'm<00:01:55.200> playing<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:56.040> power<00:01:56.280> chord

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
so let's say I'm playing a power chord

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.660 
so let's say I'm playing a power chord
on<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.030> fifth<00:01:57.570> fret<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.950> string<00:01:59.070> I'm

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
on the fifth fret of the a string I'm

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.960 
on the fifth fret of the a string I'm
using<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.570> tip<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:01.080> my<00:02:01.140> first<00:02:01.619> finger<00:02:02.190> to<00:02:02.369> very

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
using the tip of my first finger to very

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.590 
using the tip of my first finger to very
lightly<00:02:03.330> touch<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.780> big<00:02:04.170> string<00:02:04.560> alright<00:02:05.600> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
lightly touch the big string alright and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.419 
lightly touch the big string alright and
that's<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.930> way<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.320> could<00:02:07.590> really<00:02:08.010> crank

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that's a way that I could really crank

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.370 
that's a way that I could really crank
into<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:08.910> whole<00:02:09.090> guitar<00:02:09.239> even<00:02:09.810> hitting<00:02:10.290> the

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
into the whole guitar even hitting the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.000 
into the whole guitar even hitting the
big<00:02:10.590> string<00:02:10.950> because<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.310> know

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
big string because I know

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.360 
big string because I know
fifth<00:02:13.819> fret<00:02:14.000> who's<00:02:14.239> got<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.420> harmonica<00:02:15.370> you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
fifth fret who's got a harmonica you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.020 
fifth fret who's got a harmonica you
know<00:02:16.489> basically<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.159> case<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.730> lot<00:02:19.909> of

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
know basically in the case of a lot of

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.860 
know basically in the case of a lot of
PowerPoint<00:02:21.909> that<00:02:22.909> harmonic<00:02:23.450> doesn't<00:02:23.720> cause

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
PowerPoint that harmonic doesn't cause

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.570 
PowerPoint that harmonic doesn't cause
any<00:02:24.080> problems<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.650> if<00:02:24.739> it's<00:02:24.860> in<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.069> clean<00:02:25.310> tone

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
any problems and if it's in a clean tone

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.640 
any problems and if it's in a clean tone
you<00:02:28.580> know<00:02:29.049> that's<00:02:30.049> usually<00:02:30.440> what<00:02:30.560> you're

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
you know that's usually what you're

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.180 
you know that's usually what you're
hearing<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.319> fact<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:33.830> could<00:02:34.010> use

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
hearing so the fact that I could use

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.850 
hearing so the fact that I could use
that<00:02:34.220> finger<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.879> mute<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.500> has<00:02:36.500> been<00:02:36.620> really

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
that finger to mute it has been really

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.259 
that finger to mute it has been really
well<00:02:37.069> through<00:02:37.370> everything<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.910> then<00:02:38.060> in<00:02:38.180> the

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
well through everything and then in the

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.020 
well through everything and then in the
bottom<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:39.230> same<00:02:39.500> type<00:02:39.709> idea<00:02:40.190> I'm<00:02:40.430> using<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
bottom the same type idea I'm using the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.030 
bottom the same type idea I'm using the
skin<00:02:41.390> from<00:02:41.599> this<00:02:41.750> part<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.049> my<00:02:42.170> finger<00:02:42.470> to

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
skin from this part of my finger to

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.229 
skin from this part of my finger to
touch<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.400> last<00:02:43.579> two<00:02:43.819> strings<00:02:45.849> actually<00:02:46.849> the

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
touch the last two strings actually the

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.290 
touch the last two strings actually the
last<00:02:47.420> three<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:47.900> they<00:02:48.049> mute

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
last three so they mute

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.330 
last three so they mute
one<00:02:49.870> other<00:02:50.050> really<00:02:50.290> cool<00:02:50.620> way<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.830> use<00:02:50.980> this

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
one other really cool way to use this

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.180 
one other really cool way to use this
whole<00:02:51.520> idea<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:52.240> in<00:02:52.750> your<00:02:52.900> right<00:02:53.140> hand<00:02:53.170> if<00:02:53.680> I'm

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
whole idea is in your right hand if I'm

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.590 
whole idea is in your right hand if I'm
playing<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.610> scale<00:02:54.910> and<00:02:55.120> let's<00:02:55.300> say<00:02:55.480> I'm

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
playing a scale and let's say I'm

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.600 
playing a scale and let's say I'm
ascending<00:02:56.320> so<00:02:56.680> going<00:02:56.860> higher<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.370> pitch<00:02:59.610> one

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
ascending so going higher in pitch one

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.610 
ascending so going higher in pitch one
of<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.760> things<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:01.030> do<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.480> move<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:02.080> that<00:03:02.290> the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
of the things I do is I move is that the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.610 
of the things I do is I move is that the
palm<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.160> my<00:03:03.280> hand<00:03:03.700> is<00:03:03.970> sliding<00:03:04.960> across<00:03:05.230> the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
palm of my hand is sliding across the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.160 
palm of my hand is sliding across the
strings<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.370> keep<00:03:06.580> them<00:03:06.760> quiet<00:03:06.990> listen<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.050> the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
strings to keep them quiet listen to the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.970 
strings to keep them quiet listen to the
difference<00:03:08.620> if<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:09.130> don't<00:03:09.430> do<00:03:09.640> that

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.860 

okay<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:15.610> I'm<00:03:15.819> still<00:03:16.150> letting<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.480> two<00:03:16.660> big

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
okay so I'm still letting the two big

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.949 
okay so I'm still letting the two big
strings<00:03:17.200> ring<00:03:17.410> out<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.800> if<00:03:17.890> you<00:03:18.010> notice<00:03:18.959> they

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
strings ring out and if you notice they

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.720 
strings ring out and if you notice they
were<00:03:19.989> ringing<00:03:20.410> out<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.680> whole<00:03:20.830> time<00:03:21.160> because

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
were ringing out the whole time because

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.759 
were ringing out the whole time because
I<00:03:21.970> wasn't<00:03:22.330> keeping<00:03:22.629> my<00:03:22.900> palm<00:03:23.170> down<00:03:23.500> there<00:03:23.650> and

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
I wasn't keeping my palm down there and

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.770 
I wasn't keeping my palm down there and
controlling<00:03:24.400> now<00:03:24.879> I<00:03:24.910> might<00:03:25.150> not<00:03:25.330> seem<00:03:25.599> like<00:03:25.660> a

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
controlling now I might not seem like a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.270 
controlling now I might not seem like a
lot<00:03:25.870> when<00:03:26.349> you<00:03:26.440> got<00:03:26.620> all<00:03:26.769> these<00:03:26.860> other<00:03:27.010> notes

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
lot when you got all these other notes

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.610 
lot when you got all these other notes
screaming<00:03:27.790> up<00:03:27.910> top<00:03:28.180> but<00:03:28.900> all<00:03:29.140> that<00:03:29.260> extra

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
screaming up top but all that extra

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.250 
screaming up top but all that extra
noise<00:03:29.860> adds<00:03:30.310> into<00:03:30.790> just<00:03:31.060> noise<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.080> more

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
noise adds into just noise so the more

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.110 
noise adds into just noise so the more
you<00:03:32.349> control<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:33.040> you'll<00:03:33.580> get<00:03:33.730> really

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
you control that you'll get really

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.600 
you control that you'll get really
really<00:03:34.599> good<00:03:34.750> clean<00:03:35.050> plane<00:03:35.410> someone<00:03:36.310> good<00:03:36.489> or

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
really good clean plane someone good or

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.190 
really good clean plane someone good or
that's<00:03:36.819> probably<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.510> best<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:37.930> this<00:03:38.019> is

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
that's probably the best that this is

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.680 
that's probably the best that this is
Eric<00:03:38.470> Johnson<00:03:38.739> comes<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.370> mind<00:03:39.550> his<00:03:40.000> plane<00:03:40.450> is

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
Eric Johnson comes to mind his plane is

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.440 
Eric Johnson comes to mind his plane is
so<00:03:40.959> super<00:03:41.440> clean<00:03:41.769> because<00:03:42.519> he<00:03:43.060> knows<00:03:43.239> how<00:03:43.390> to

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
so super clean because he knows how to
