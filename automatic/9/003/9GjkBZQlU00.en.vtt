00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:11.119
 That's how to solve is I cross-border speed range of the quadratic equation of went Yes 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:14.869
 But there was enough in the door mathematics 1 but there was nothing what the other quadratic equation It is think here 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:21.260
 Nothing it's Naru selfish I have a need to be in the new in the mathematics and 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:26.810
 The solution of the quadratic equation in this mathematics also considers the range of this imaginary number. 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.950
 If you are not familiar with it more specifically, it is possible that the inside of the route may be negative. 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.239
 It is a thing 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:37.580
 I when Attan is you were a quadratic equation in the range of mathematics i 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:41.250
 I think that I used the formula of the solution of the coder well well but the contents of this route were always live 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:45.510
 Well, if it comes to the wind, such an equation is curled Tear 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.170
 Even though the scope of this math has already been several places 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.680
 The square root of this route is minus in the route 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:58.350
 I'm doing the Tteyuu Yeah, no but minus 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:03.269
 In it say whether it has and negative root Oh With this route ai 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.900
 I've already learned this, and let's use this and paint more quadratic equations 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:12.240
 It is a place to say that you can not think about various things deeply 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:16.350
 Is I know the other along with math i of Tteyuu how to solve basic quadratic equation 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.340
 Here I will try to be able to cope with the case where this route becomes negative. 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.810
 It's just that practice 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.670
 2 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.299
 So this No.1 or No.2 is a problem that can be solved enough even by the person before doing math for you 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.480
 Right 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.890
 It is this that solving a quadratic equation 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:36.450
 It was about trying to find a value of x that would make this formula work. 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.530
 Then it is overwhelming to try to factor as much as possible as to how to find it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.840
 Because it is fast 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:47.470
 Official use if I'm annoying appearance of the factorization mark eating or cat of the meeting is to this form 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.920
 There is also a shape like the second in the past , but for this I already have some math i 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.100
 I think I 'm used to it, and I already have no deep thing 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:59.470
 In this way, it is 3x above- x -6 = 0 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:04.450
 When I think of a factoring of a sticky gap and I think it's time to put it on here 's 1 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.500
 With 3x and x , this is the place to go This is a combination that will be nana 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.460
 I'm looking for 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.810
 Because it is -6, it is 1 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.350
 Variously thought also note this millionaire Puramai in Toka's multiplying lock Toka knee multiplying 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.140
 Go 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.459
 Whether Thats can do with this 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.440
 Thanks to this for the sound , I think I will do so much in Math 1 so I will not do it deeply here 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.490
 We will proceed even on the premise that we can 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:29.830
 So the answer grass-2/3 Mr. Naa I came like 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:33.640
 The second is also together I think that I think that it can be factored when I see this formula 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.130
 And nearly a method such that when you are always in this both ends 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.920
 Or something 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:44.450
 It is square of something to open 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:46.550
 So 25 of the after x- Baato old bankruptcy square or theft and here - because it is 3 o'clock millionaire -8 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.370
 I'm going to check with you 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.590
 Here is Korekake Marnie draw-go that it is the form of the square of the appearance that is consistent with this subjected to over-3 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.910
 It is what ok from the previous 307 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.350
 So you may not be good at 503-2 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.150
 I 'm already doing that great but I'm already in the switch 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.480
 We doing to mon Ya that with 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.720
 It is to say that it is to be divided with three of this Exa issue 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:14.550
 The point like 3rd is the point 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:21.060
 Here I I'm also doing the official itself of Fair meeting also this new there 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.930
 I was not allowed to progress 6x to Son Nekko's x try to use the official of the solution when the Hen can factorization 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.940
 Don't say 0 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:32.430
 No matter how much I think, this factor can not be factored, and it costs 3 yen to 3x and x 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.570
 Over 7 or 71 from here or better or whatever you put in + 6x 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.540
 If it does not become 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.260
 So if Tsu try 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:42.849
 I'm glad I use the lattice gas-buying at the time you made 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:47.950
 Because huge official says what kind of official and x 2 square + bx seems this zero 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:51.500
 The meeting of the absolute is negative x 2 English minus plus root b 20-4 ac 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:58.280
 It's there I'm was able to wind say 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:02.240
 Deato was also the Tteyuu simple formula when a portion where part of the 9 b of the even 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:06.860
 Well I will hold this firmly I can also use summer 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:11.490
 The way to use this is for now as you look slowly at the mart 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:15.690
 And without remember here take a look at the official coach server 3x Lotus log x 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:22.500
 + There is no choice but to use the formula of change that can not be factored with this 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.310
 Now if officially go fit this solution and I in the root is negative to the hot air and -48 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.790
 That's right 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:31.510
 Tatte Kokkara say point to point is just secondary equations of this math's in mathematics 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:37.120
 What if the inside of the envelope becomes negative 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.230
 The process is already done last time, is n't it right? 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.340
 I want to shape 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.480
 It is good to take the route in the form of Maeda Tsutsu route 48 love 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.440
 I'm doing 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:51.500
 Easy to four because the root's Ya the rest is say in route 48 and to this 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.590
 After about a minute, I will be rooted at -3/3 + bias 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:59.390
 It's just the story 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:02.840
 So I already say it's about 5 minutes long, but what I say is just this 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.660
 Become through and root ai do you will either after switch became minus a in you 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:10.760
 It's all the way it is-I mean 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:13.220
 ok i wonder if the master still dies once these things are already here 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.580
 Let's definitely wear it here 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:21.539
 This b part is even 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:26.490
 Please think about this even number of half when saying what to do when it is half number of half 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:29.009
 Think of it and collage b Think of a half with these two small b and hips 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.569
 Please , half of 6 is this 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:40.929
 When these three is when the even number I that think in the base say whether the video is official 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:47.709
 Half of minus half plus or minus root half of English-20 and I acd 

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:53.259
 That was half of the 3 minutes from'm not I'm Yeah ship of English to - this plus or minus 

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:54.189
 Official is true that say this route it over to four Raz that it does not enter the square -4 number of this 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:54.590
 Right 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:59.510
 Just so 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.110
 Is to be calculated to go and this is also still comfortable'm out necessary Toka or no immediate answer of translation 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.310
 is not it 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.410
 If this part of b is even, please be a coach when you write it in mother clause 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:11.060
 It's about how important it is 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.140
 In mathematics we did figure out how to solve quadratic equations of here in the quadratic equation imaginary range by saying yes 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.510
 It is the range of 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.400
 In terms Naya 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:21.160
 What's newly added is that if it only becomes a route minus, it will be a route ai 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:27.390
 The rest is as you have already done with the switch 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.390
 Let's find a strike and practice it better than you can not deny
