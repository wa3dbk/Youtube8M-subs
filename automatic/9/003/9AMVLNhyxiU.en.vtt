tournament comm and today I'm gonna be
going<00:00:06.060> over<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.299> very<00:00:06.600> basic<00:00:06.899> build<00:00:07.290> it's

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
going over a very basic build it's

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.709 
going over a very basic build it's
pretty<00:00:07.710> much<00:00:07.859> Protoss<00:00:08.400> one<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:08.849> one<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.269> that

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
pretty much Protoss one on one and that

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.350 
pretty much Protoss one on one and that
is<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.230> four<00:00:10.650> gate<00:00:10.860> now<00:00:11.460> before<00:00:11.910> gate<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.210> not

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
is the four gate now before gate is not

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.820 
is the four gate now before gate is not
as<00:00:12.450> strong<00:00:12.599> as<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.840> used<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:13.049> be<00:00:13.200> because<00:00:13.349> the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
as strong as it used to be because the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.919 
as strong as it used to be because the
research<00:00:14.250> time<00:00:14.519> for<00:00:14.730> warp<00:00:15.150> gate<00:00:15.389> tech<00:00:15.660> was

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
research time for warp gate tech was

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.170 
research time for warp gate tech was
nerfed<00:00:16.170> an<00:00:16.410> awful<00:00:16.830> long<00:00:16.949> time<00:00:17.190> ago<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:18.029> it's

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
nerfed an awful long time ago but it's

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.849 
nerfed an awful long time ago but it's
still<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.390> very<00:00:18.570> potent<00:00:18.960> build<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.470> still

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
still a very potent build and it's still

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.830 
still a very potent build and it's still
seen<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> lot<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.430> PvP<00:00:20.970> especially<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.600> maps

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
seen a lot in PvP especially on maps

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.660 
seen a lot in PvP especially on maps
without<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.470> natural<00:00:22.890> ramp<00:00:23.160> where<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> can't

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
without a natural ramp where you can't

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.150 
without a natural ramp where you can't
force<00:00:23.939> field<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.380> tutorial<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.010> mainly

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
force field so this tutorial is mainly

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.009 
force field so this tutorial is mainly
aimed<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.670> say<00:00:26.910> bronze<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.510> silver<00:00:27.810> players

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
aimed at say bronze to silver players

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.900 
aimed at say bronze to silver players
but<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:28.800> you've<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.220> done<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.580> getting<00:00:29.760> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
but if you've not done for getting a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.429 
but if you've not done for getting a
long<00:00:30.029> time<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.390> want<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> brush<00:00:30.689> up<00:00:30.869> that's

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
long time you want to brush up that's

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.810 
long time you want to brush up that's
cool<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.859> I'm<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.099> gonna<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.399> doing<00:00:32.730> this

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
cool so I'm just gonna be doing this

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.880 
cool so I'm just gonna be doing this
against<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> AI<00:00:33.360> doesn't<00:00:34.170> really<00:00:34.440> matter

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
against the AI doesn't really matter

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.420 
against the AI doesn't really matter
ah<00:00:35.480> let's<00:00:36.480> go<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.899> game<00:00:37.079> now<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:38.040> gate<00:00:38.250> is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
ah let's go to the game now for gate is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.459 
ah let's go to the game now for gate is
I<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:39.450> some<00:00:39.690> people<00:00:39.899> call<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.110> cheese<00:00:40.440> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
I know some people call it cheese I

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.229 
I know some people call it cheese I
wouldn't<00:00:41.040> say<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.399> cheese<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.030> very

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
wouldn't say it's cheese but it is very

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.119 
wouldn't say it's cheese but it is very
all<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> fails<00:00:43.320> completely<00:00:43.980> you

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
all in is if it fails completely you

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.920 
all in is if it fails completely you
will<00:00:44.280> probably<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.940> very<00:00:45.180> far<00:00:45.480> behind<00:00:45.629> your

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
will probably be very far behind your

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.510 
will probably be very far behind your
opponent

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
opponent

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.799 
opponent
okay<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.700> screen<00:00:47.910> went<00:00:48.090> black<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.660> came

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
okay the screen went black but it came

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.250 
okay the screen went black but it came
back<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.170> was<00:00:49.289> interesting<00:00:50.719> anyway<00:00:51.719> ah<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
back that was interesting anyway ah the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.420 
back that was interesting anyway ah the
first<00:00:52.379> thing<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.649> want<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.010> course<00:00:53.219> set

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
your workers to mine and build your

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.979 
your workers to mine and build your
first<00:00:55.620> probe<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.129> say<00:00:56.309> good<00:00:56.550> luck<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.940> fun

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
first probe we say good luck have fun

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.819 
first probe we say good luck have fun
with<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> little<00:00:58.410> heart<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:01.410> we're<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.710> gonna

with a little heart and we're just gonna
start<00:01:01.980> building<00:01:02.460> probes<00:01:02.699> now<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.480> pretty

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
start building probes now as with pretty

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.179 
start building probes now as with pretty
much<00:01:03.870> every<00:01:04.140> prospal<00:01:04.589> we're<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.890> build<00:01:05.070> our

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
much every prospal we're gonna build our

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.780 
much every prospal we're gonna build our
pylon<00:01:05.640> at<00:01:05.820> 9<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:07.260> we're<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.500> gonna<00:01:07.740> get<00:01:08.640> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
pylon at 9 so we're just gonna get that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.450 
pylon at 9 so we're just gonna get that
going<00:01:09.409> it's<00:01:10.409> actually<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.770> hard<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.189> me<00:01:11.310> not

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
going it's actually very hard for me not

to spam I'm so used to spamming and I'm
not<00:01:14.130> saying<00:01:14.369> any<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.640> my<00:01:14.760> normal<00:01:15.119> map<00:01:15.330> hotkeys

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
not saying any of my normal map hotkeys

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
not saying any of my normal map hotkeys
up<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> moment<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:16.979> anyway<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.210> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
up at the moment but anyway so we get to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.080 
up at the moment but anyway so we get to
9<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.869> that's<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:20.070> we're<00:01:20.490> gonna<00:01:20.580> pull<00:01:20.909> off<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
9 and that's just we're gonna pull off a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.120 
9 and that's just we're gonna pull off a
probe<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.259> was<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> last<00:01:22.710> we'll

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
probe that one that was the last we'll

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.130 
probe that one that was the last we'll
switch<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.729> next<00:01:23.970> probe<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.630> spot

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
switch the next probe to be that spot

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
switch the next probe to be that spot
and<00:01:25.799> we're<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.040> gonna<00:01:26.159> build<00:01:26.400> our<00:01:26.490> pylon

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and we're just gonna build our pylon

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.980 
and we're just gonna build our pylon

the<00:01:32.909> situation<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.079> click<00:01:34.320> on

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the situation like that you can click on

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
the situation like that you can click on
a<00:01:34.470> probe<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.700> keep<00:01:35.909> right-clicking

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
a probe and then keep right-clicking

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.840 
a probe and then keep right-clicking
until<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.200> does<00:01:37.530> mine<00:01:37.770> from<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.280> double

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
until it does mine from it so you double

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.910 
until it does mine from it so you double
up<00:01:38.970> your<00:01:39.150> probes<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:40.890> that

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
up your probes like that you see on that

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.240 
up your probes like that you see on that
mineral<00:01:41.310> patch<00:01:41.520> now<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.770> now<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:43.920> soon<00:01:44.100> as

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
mineral patch now and now as soon as

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.920 
mineral patch now and now as soon as
that<00:01:44.340> pylon<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.759> complete<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.360> chrono<00:01:45.659> boost

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
that pylon is complete we chrono boost

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.810 
that pylon is complete we chrono boost
our<00:01:46.200> Nexus<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.100> we<00:01:47.189> should<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.460> eleven

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
our Nexus so we should be on eleven

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.630 
our Nexus so we should be on eleven
supply<00:01:48.149> now<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:49.590> queue<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.070> another<00:01:50.340> probe

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
supply now and we queue up another probe

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.550 
supply now and we queue up another probe
but<00:01:51.000> we're<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> build<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.960> gateway<00:01:52.170> now

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
but we're going to build a gateway now

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.830 
but we're going to build a gateway now
on<00:01:52.799> 12<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.579> let's<00:01:53.880> rally<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.299> probe<00:01:54.570> over

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
on 12 so let's rally this probe over

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.800 
on 12 so let's rally this probe over
there<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:56.040> he's<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.880> gonna<00:01:57.000> sit<00:01:57.240> round<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
there and he's just gonna sit round and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.490 
there and he's just gonna sit round and
we're<00:01:58.079> gonna<00:01:58.170> build<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.560> gateway<00:01:59.329> woohoo

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
we're gonna build a gateway woohoo

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.200 
we're gonna build a gateway woohoo
gateway<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:02.250> down<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.729> send<00:02:02.939> them<00:02:03.030> back<00:02:03.149> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
gateway going down we send them back to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.709 
gateway going down we send them back to
mine<00:02:03.829> now<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:05.759> need<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.969> build<00:02:06.090> another<00:02:06.390> probe

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
mine now we need to build another probe

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.919 
mine now we need to build another probe
and<00:02:07.280> then<00:02:08.280> chrono<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:08.970> well<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.479> to

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and then chrono that as well so to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.720 
and then chrono that as well so to
chrono<00:02:10.229> boosts<00:02:10.619> get<00:02:10.800> used<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.280> Nexus

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
chrono boosts get used on the Nexus

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.369 
chrono boosts get used on the Nexus
as<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.150> four<00:02:12.360> game<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.870> we're<00:02:13.170> going<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
as it in a four game and we're going to

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.960 
as it in a four game and we're going to
rally<00:02:13.620> this<00:02:13.800> probe<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.430> gas<00:02:14.670> geyser

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
rally this probe to this gas geyser

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.839 
rally this probe to this gas geyser
because<00:02:15.330> we<00:02:15.450> build<00:02:15.659> our<00:02:15.780> gas<00:02:15.989> on<00:02:16.260> 14<00:02:16.950> with<00:02:17.819> a

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
because we build our gas on 14 with a

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.070 
because we build our gas on 14 with a
four<00:02:18.120> gate<00:02:18.590> there<00:02:19.590> we<00:02:19.739> go<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.870> remember<00:02:21.870> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
four gate there we go and remember the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.420 
four gate there we go and remember the
doubling<00:02:22.409> up<00:02:22.530> thing<00:02:22.709> I'll<00:02:22.830> sure<00:02:23.040> I'll<00:02:23.190> do<00:02:23.310> it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
doubling up thing I'll sure I'll do it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.240 
doubling up thing I'll sure I'll do it
intentionally<00:02:23.879> but<00:02:23.909> we<00:02:24.150> build<00:02:24.629> another<00:02:24.900> probe

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
intentionally but we build another probe

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.770 
intentionally but we build another probe
there<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:26.370> go<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:28.099> on<00:02:29.099> 16<00:02:29.790> supply<00:02:30.269> we<00:02:30.480> will<00:02:30.660> be

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
there we go and on 16 supply we will be

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.150 
there we go and on 16 supply we will be
building<00:02:31.080> our<00:02:31.230> next<00:02:31.470> pylon<00:02:31.860> now<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.010> know

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
building our next pylon now I know

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.619 
building our next pylon now I know
you've<00:02:32.370> got<00:02:32.549> Corona<00:02:32.849> boost<00:02:33.060> by<00:02:33.209> now<00:02:33.269> but<00:02:33.510> do

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
you've got Corona boost by now but do

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.839 
you've got Corona boost by now but do
not<00:02:33.750> use<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.140> we've<00:02:34.260> used<00:02:34.560> two<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.580> is<00:02:35.700> what

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
not use it we've used two that is what

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.970 
not use it we've used two that is what
you<00:02:36.000> use<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:36.930> we're<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:37.140> rallying<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.769> probe

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you use so we're just rallying a probe

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.759 
you use so we're just rallying a probe
out<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.790> build<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.060> pylon<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.590> now<00:02:40.709> we

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
out to build that pylon and now we

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.589 
out to build that pylon and now we
instantly<00:02:41.280> put<00:02:41.519> three<00:02:41.760> on<00:02:41.879> gas<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.299> second

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
instantly put three on gas the second

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.030 
instantly put three on gas the second
the<00:02:42.690> assembly<00:02:43.049> is<00:02:43.110> complete<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.650> queue<00:02:43.950> up

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
the assembly is complete so queue up

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.890 
the assembly is complete so queue up
another<00:02:44.250> probe<00:02:44.579> once<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.060> get<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.329> sixteen<00:02:45.720> so

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
another probe once you get to sixteen so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.050 
another probe once you get to sixteen so
we've<00:02:46.019> got<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.379> cute<00:02:46.739> now<00:02:47.459> we'll<00:02:47.610> pull<00:02:47.849> one<00:02:48.030> off

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
we've got to cute now we'll pull one off

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.710 
we've got to cute now we'll pull one off
the<00:02:48.269> mineral<00:02:48.569> line<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.989> build<00:02:49.140> this

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
the mineral line to build this

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.280 
the mineral line to build this
cybercorps<00:02:52.700> cool<00:02:53.700> cool<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.720> now<00:02:54.900> we're<00:02:55.200> gonna

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
cybercorps cool cool and now we're gonna

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.930 
cybercorps cool cool and now we're gonna
build<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:56.420> zealot<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:59.160> cool<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.549> know<00:02:59.609> there's<00:02:59.879> a

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
build a zealot so cool I know there's a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.520 
build a zealot so cool I know there's a
few<00:03:00.120> variations<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.019> there<00:03:01.260> differ

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
few variations of this there differ

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.160 
few variations of this there differ
slightly<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.250> where<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.790> do<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.359> then

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
slightly this is where I do it and then

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.750 
slightly this is where I do it and then
as<00:03:04.319> soon<00:03:04.440> as<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.590> cell<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.129> built<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.579> more

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
as soon as that cell it's built one more

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.270 
as soon as that cell it's built one more
program<00:03:06.180> we<00:03:06.269> want<00:03:06.450> 20<00:03:06.840> probes<00:03:07.079> in<00:03:07.290> total<00:03:07.650> this

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
program we want 20 probes in total this

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.190 
program we want 20 probes in total this
will<00:03:08.579> read<00:03:08.849> 22<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.690> we're<00:03:09.989> going<00:03:10.109> to

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
will read 22 because we're going to

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.990 
will read 22 because we're going to
build<00:03:10.349> two<00:03:10.650> stalkers<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.430> idea<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.879> to

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
build two stalkers and the idea is to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.229 
build two stalkers and the idea is to
get<00:03:12.150> our<00:03:12.599> full<00:03:12.959> 26<00:03:13.829> supply<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.879> zealot<00:03:15.150> is

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
get our full 26 supply so the zealot is

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.949 
get our full 26 supply so the zealot is
to<00:03:15.450> two<00:03:15.870> stalkers<00:03:16.349> that's<00:03:16.590> four<00:03:16.889> and<00:03:17.959> we've

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
to two stalkers that's four and we've

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.479 
to two stalkers that's four and we've
already<00:03:19.109> started<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.620> zealots<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.190> we<00:03:20.310> want

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
already started the zealots so we want

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.879 
already started the zealots so we want
one<00:03:20.700> more<00:03:20.819> probe<00:03:21.060> after<00:03:21.329> this<00:03:21.510> one<00:03:21.859> you've<00:03:22.859> got

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
one more probe after this one you've got

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.490 
one more probe after this one you've got
to<00:03:23.069> get<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.340> right<00:03:23.579> it's<00:03:23.730> critical<00:03:24.500> you'll

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
to get this right it's critical you'll

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.349 
to get this right it's critical you'll
see<00:03:25.680> what<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:25.829> mean<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.940> should<00:03:27.209> finish

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
see what I mean and this should finish

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.210 
see what I mean and this should finish
it<00:03:27.510> approximately<00:03:28.109> at<00:03:28.169> the<00:03:28.200> same<00:03:28.260> time<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.040> we

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
it approximately at the same time so we

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.400 
it approximately at the same time so we
start<00:03:29.549> walking<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.660> chrono<00:03:30.900> where<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.230> build

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
start walking and chrono where and build

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.470 
start walking and chrono where and build
our<00:03:31.530> stalker<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.069> notice<00:03:32.280> we're<00:03:32.430> at<00:03:32.519> 24<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:33.000> 26

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
our stalker and notice we're at 24 of 26

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.479 
our stalker and notice we're at 24 of 26
no<00:03:33.989> more<00:03:34.200> probes<00:03:34.500> after<00:03:34.829> this<00:03:34.950> one<00:03:35.099> because<00:03:35.340> we

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
no more probes after this one because we

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.759 
no more probes after this one because we
need<00:03:35.639> the<00:03:35.790> supply<00:03:36.060> for<00:03:36.299> our<00:03:36.419> next<00:03:36.630> stalker<00:03:37.019> so

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
need the supply for our next stalker so

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.349 
need the supply for our next stalker so
let's<00:03:37.919> just<00:03:38.160> move<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.489> sell<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.940> out<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> bit

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
let's just move on sell it out a bit

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.830 
let's just move on sell it out a bit
forward<00:03:40.609> now<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.669> next<00:03:42.000> stage<00:03:42.389> will<00:03:42.810> be

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
forward now the next stage will be

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.559 
forward now the next stage will be
building<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.470> lot<00:03:43.680> more<00:03:43.859> gateways<00:03:44.250> now<00:03:45.000> ideally

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
building a lot more gateways now ideally

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.449 
building a lot more gateways now ideally
you<00:03:45.780> build<00:03:46.049> your<00:03:46.260> gateways<00:03:46.680> about<00:03:47.190> when<00:03:47.340> this

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
you build your gateways about when this

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.890 
you build your gateways about when this
is<00:03:47.609> halfway<00:03:47.819> done<00:03:48.120> what<00:03:48.359> gets<00:03:48.599> halfway

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
is halfway done what gets halfway

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.809 
is halfway done what gets halfway
research<00:03:49.500> that's<00:03:49.859> cool<00:03:50.130> which<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.430> usually

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
research that's cool which is usually

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.990 
research that's cool which is usually
around<00:03:51.200> 4:30<00:03:52.200> ish<00:03:52.470> sometimes<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.579> bit<00:03:53.730> earlier

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
around 4:30 ish sometimes a bit earlier

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.580 
around 4:30 ish sometimes a bit earlier
it<00:03:54.090> depends<00:03:54.540> how<00:03:54.780> good<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.109> are<00:03:55.169> at<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.410> build

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
it depends how good you are at the build

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.349 
it depends how good you are at the build
and<00:03:56.160> notice<00:03:56.430> we<00:03:56.549> are<00:03:56.669> stacking<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:57.120> lot<00:03:57.269> of

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
and notice we are stacking a lot of

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.309 
and notice we are stacking a lot of
minerals<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.810> since<00:03:57.930> we've<00:03:58.049> got<00:03:58.200> those

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
minerals and since we've got those

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.009 
minerals and since we've got those
minerals<00:03:58.799> now<00:03:58.980> we<00:03:59.760> are<00:03:59.849> gonna<00:03:59.970> go<00:04:00.060> one<00:04:00.480> two

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
minerals now we are gonna go one two

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.039 
minerals now we are gonna go one two
three<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:02.250> we<00:04:02.819> instantly<00:04:03.239> want<00:04:03.510> to<00:04:03.599> chrono

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
three and we instantly want to chrono

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.750 
three and we instantly want to chrono
the<00:04:04.169> warp<00:04:04.410> gate<00:04:04.470> again<00:04:04.889> and<00:04:05.099> start<00:04:05.340> our<00:04:05.430> second

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
the warp gate again and start our second

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.240 
the warp gate again and start our second
store<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.180> now<00:04:06.299> we<00:04:06.989> can<00:04:07.139> move<00:04:07.290> out<00:04:07.500> we<00:04:08.160> have

send a probe out and our probe is just
gonna<00:04:11.819> build<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.060> proxy<00:04:12.419> pylon<00:04:12.569> this<00:04:13.199> is<00:04:13.379> kind

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
gonna build a proxy pylon this is kind

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.490 
gonna build a proxy pylon this is kind
of<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:14.459> yeah<00:04:14.940> this<00:04:15.060> is<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.299> proxy<00:04:15.690> panel<00:04:16.049> you

of the yeah this is the proxy panel you

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.870 
of the yeah this is the proxy panel you
will<00:04:16.680> be<00:04:16.859> building<00:04:17.130> another<00:04:17.220> pylon<00:04:17.760> which

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
will be building another pylon which

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.400 
will be building another pylon which
will<00:04:18.000> be<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.150> lot<00:04:18.359> closer<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.840> your<00:04:19.019> opponent's

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
will be a lot closer to your opponent's

moving to the front and now look after
you<00:04:44.729> gonna<00:04:44.819> try<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.240> sneak<00:04:45.419> our<00:04:45.599> probe<00:04:45.870> in<00:04:46.080> to

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319 
you gonna try and sneak our probe in to

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.370 
you gonna try and sneak our probe in to
build<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.740> much<00:04:46.979> closer<00:04:47.280> pylon<00:04:48.080> now<00:04:49.080> look<00:04:49.289> at

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
build a much closer pylon now look at

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.020 
build a much closer pylon now look at
the<00:04:49.440> gateways<00:04:49.860> and<00:04:50.099> warp<00:04:50.310> gate<00:04:50.520> finishing<00:04:50.910> up

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
the gateways and warp gate finishing up

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.180 
the gateways and warp gate finishing up
it<00:04:51.150> almost<00:04:51.690> exactly<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.289> same<00:04:52.530> time<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:53.009> turn

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
it almost exactly the same time you turn

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.939 
it almost exactly the same time you turn
all<00:04:53.430> four<00:04:53.669> gateways<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.060> warp<00:04:54.389> gates<00:04:54.740> get<00:04:55.740> that

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
all four gateways to warp gates get that

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.730 
all four gateways to warp gates get that
pylon<00:04:56.340> going<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.259> should<00:04:58.440> see<00:04:58.590> I'm

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
pylon going and you should see I'm

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.890 
pylon going and you should see I'm
pressing<00:04:58.949> W<00:04:59.280> W<00:04:59.849> so<00:05:00.000> hot<00:05:00.120> people<00:05:00.300> warp<00:05:00.659> gates

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
pressing W W so hot people warp gates

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.510 
pressing W W so hot people warp gates
all<00:05:01.110> warp<00:05:01.349> gates<00:05:01.590> selected<00:05:02.009> just<00:05:02.250> as<00:05:02.370> that

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
all warp gates selected just as that

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.760 
all warp gates selected just as that
pylon<00:05:02.759> finishes<00:05:03.240> up<00:05:03.360> okay<00:05:03.690> normally<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.530> would

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
pylon finishes up okay normally I would

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.159 
pylon finishes up okay normally I would
get<00:05:04.949> three<00:05:05.280> stalkers<00:05:05.789> and<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.270> zealot<00:05:06.599> but<00:05:06.870> I

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
get three stalkers and the zealot but I

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.350 
get three stalkers and the zealot but I
just<00:05:07.800> had<00:05:08.009> enough<00:05:08.250> gas<00:05:08.430> for<00:05:08.490> stalkers<00:05:09.090> I<00:05:09.180> must

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
just had enough gas for stalkers I must

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.909 
just had enough gas for stalkers I must
have<00:05:09.479> forgot<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.810> timing<00:05:10.110> slightly<00:05:10.740> wrong

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
have forgot the timing slightly wrong

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.559 
have forgot the timing slightly wrong
but<00:05:11.490> at<00:05:11.580> this<00:05:11.669> point<00:05:11.909> you<00:05:12.090> literally<00:05:12.330> just

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
but at this point you literally just

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:15.379 
but at this point you literally just
attack<00:05:13.280> it's<00:05:14.280> very<00:05:14.460> cool<00:05:14.729> we'll<00:05:15.000> just<00:05:15.240> go<00:05:15.360> up

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
attack it's very cool we'll just go up

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.499 
attack it's very cool we'll just go up
the<00:05:15.539> ramp<00:05:15.659> oh<00:05:16.520> I'm<00:05:17.520> gonna<00:05:17.729> focus<00:05:18.000> down<00:05:18.300> those

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
the ramp oh I'm gonna focus down those

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:19.730 
the ramp oh I'm gonna focus down those
Marauders<00:05:18.930> because<00:05:19.169> I've<00:05:19.289> got<00:05:19.440> a<00:05:19.470> lot<00:05:19.650> of

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
Marauders because I've got a lot of

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.680 
Marauders because I've got a lot of
stalkers<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:20.400> stalkers<00:05:21.120> are<00:05:21.150> flying<00:05:21.449> meet

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
stalkers and stalkers are flying meet

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.600 
stalkers and stalkers are flying meet

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
tumor orders Oh ideal and we've not lost

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.189 
tumor orders Oh ideal and we've not lost
any<00:05:26.849> units<00:05:27.120> and<00:05:27.240> of<00:05:27.300> course<00:05:27.330> you<00:05:27.630> keep<00:05:27.810> warping

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
any units and of course you keep warping

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.020 
any units and of course you keep warping
in<00:05:28.349> let's<00:05:28.830> warp<00:05:29.039> and<00:05:29.190> some<00:05:29.310> zealots<00:05:29.699> send<00:05:29.909> them

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
in let's warp and some zealots send them

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.390 
in let's warp and some zealots send them
straight<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.479> mineral<00:05:30.630> line<00:05:30.949> let's<00:05:31.949> try

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
straight to the mineral line let's try

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.189 
straight to the mineral line let's try
and<00:05:32.520> focus<00:05:32.669> down<00:05:32.880> these<00:05:33.150> SCV's<00:05:33.719> to<00:05:33.900> keep<00:05:34.050> that

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
and focus down these SCV's to keep that

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.540 
and focus down these SCV's to keep that
weakened<00:05:34.710> zealot<00:05:35.070> alive

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
weakened zealot alive

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.810 
weakened zealot alive
oh<00:05:35.580> and<00:05:35.880> Marauder<00:05:36.150> pops<00:05:36.419> out<00:05:36.630> let's<00:05:37.259> kill<00:05:37.500> that

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
oh and Marauder pops out let's kill that

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.510 
oh and Marauder pops out let's kill that
and<00:05:38.820> then<00:05:38.969> you<00:05:39.120> just<00:05:39.300> basically<00:05:39.509> troll

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
and then you just basically troll

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.129 
and then you just basically troll
obviously<00:05:41.520> this<00:05:42.000> is<00:05:42.210> a<00:05:42.240> lot<00:05:42.479> harder<00:05:42.509> against

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
obviously this is a lot harder against

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.290 
obviously this is a lot harder against
human<00:05:43.409> players<00:05:43.650> but<00:05:43.979> against<00:05:44.789> bronze<00:05:45.090> and

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
human players but against bronze and

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.370 
human players but against bronze and
silver<00:05:45.419> players<00:05:45.719> this<00:05:45.900> is<00:05:46.050> actually

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
silver players this is actually

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.839 
silver players this is actually
amazingly<00:05:46.770> effective<00:05:47.009> and<00:05:47.340> it<00:05:47.430> can<00:05:47.550> even<00:05:47.759> work

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
amazingly effective and it can even work

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.170 
amazingly effective and it can even work
in<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.090> highly<00:05:48.240> to<00:05:48.719> so<00:05:48.930> GG<00:05:49.830> that<00:05:50.580> is<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:50.820> basic

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
in the highly to so GG that is the basic

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.050 
in the highly to so GG that is the basic
four<00:05:51.360> gate<00:05:51.570> build<00:05:51.810> I<00:05:51.960> will<00:05:52.440> post<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:53.460> build

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
four gate build I will post the build

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.360 
four gate build I will post the build
order<00:05:54.360> in<00:05:54.509> the<00:05:54.630> description<00:05:55.199> doesn't<00:05:56.039> have<00:05:56.250> to

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
order in the description doesn't have to

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.920 
order in the description doesn't have to
be<00:05:56.460> exact<00:05:56.819> but<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.120> attack<00:05:57.389> if<00:05:57.599> you<00:05:57.630> if<00:05:57.900> the

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
be exact but the attack if you if the

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.779 
be exact but the attack if you if the
attacks<00:05:58.259> hitting<00:05:58.530> later<00:05:58.830> than<00:05:59.159> six<00:05:59.460> minutes

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
attacks hitting later than six minutes

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.040 
attacks hitting later than six minutes
you<00:05:59.849> know<00:06:00.030> you've<00:06:00.210> probably<00:06:00.419> done<00:06:00.750> it<00:06:00.870> wrong

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
you know you've probably done it wrong

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.409 
you know you've probably done it wrong
so<00:06:01.949> you<00:06:02.039> just<00:06:02.370> keep<00:06:02.550> practicing<00:06:02.729> it<00:06:03.150> until<00:06:03.360> you

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
so you just keep practicing it until you

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.580 
so you just keep practicing it until you
can<00:06:03.539> do<00:06:03.630> that<00:06:03.780> and<00:06:03.870> it's<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.050> very<00:06:04.319> powerful

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
can do that and it's a very powerful

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.730 
can do that and it's a very powerful
aggressive<00:06:05.099> strategy<00:06:05.759> and<00:06:05.940> I<00:06:06.780> hope<00:06:07.409> it<00:06:07.560> works

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
aggressive strategy and I hope it works

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.719 
aggressive strategy and I hope it works
out<00:06:07.889> for<00:06:07.949> you<00:06:08.159> guys<00:06:08.449> see<00:06:09.449> you<00:06:09.509> later
