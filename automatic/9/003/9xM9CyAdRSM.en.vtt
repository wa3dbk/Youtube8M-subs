has a grade on it so you know you have
another<00:03:04.870> percent<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.680> just<00:03:05.829> show<00:03:05.980> a

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
little bit quickly how we test it so

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.140 
little bit quickly how we test it so
this<00:03:08.319> is<00:03:08.409> syrup<00:03:08.799> not<00:03:09.159> boiled<00:03:09.549> like<00:03:09.940> just

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150

this is syrup not boiled like just
straight<00:03:10.690> syrup<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.379> I'll<00:03:11.680> be<00:03:11.829> assuming<00:03:12.040> on

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
straight syrup and I'll be assuming on

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.729 
straight syrup and I'll be assuming on
the<00:03:12.400> glass<00:03:12.670> here<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:12.970> little<00:03:13.090> bit<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.530> glass

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
the glass here a little bit on the glass

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.030 
the glass here a little bit on the glass
on<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.280> glass<00:03:15.489> right<00:03:15.700> here<00:03:15.760> okay<00:03:16.389> all<00:03:16.450> right

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
on the glass right here okay all right

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.140 
on the glass right here okay all right
well<00:03:18.040> what<00:03:18.160> what<00:03:18.280> happened<00:03:18.639> is<00:03:18.730> when<00:03:18.849> you<00:03:18.970> put

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
well what what happened is when you put

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.629 
well what what happened is when you put
in<00:03:19.269> your<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:19.959> your<00:03:20.410> syrup<00:03:21.220> right<00:03:21.370> there

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
in your your your syrup right there

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.000 
in your your your syrup right there
it'll<00:03:21.849> just<00:03:22.090> dissipate<00:03:22.599> so<00:03:23.379> I<00:03:23.410> see<00:03:23.590> now<00:03:23.859> this

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
it'll just dissipate so I see now this

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.210 
it'll just dissipate so I see now this
is<00:03:24.069> cold<00:03:24.599> but<00:03:25.599> if<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:25.959> was<00:03:26.169> hot<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:26.949> would<00:03:27.040> just

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
is cold but if it was hot it would just

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.509 
is cold but if it was hot it would just
dissolve<00:03:27.609> in<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.760> water<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:32.620> I<00:03:32.859> am<00:03:33.010> going<00:03:33.250> to

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
dissolve in the water and I am going to

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.400 
dissolve in the water and I am going to
oh<00:03:33.549> it's<00:03:33.910> just<00:03:34.150> starting<00:03:34.419> to<00:03:34.540> really<00:03:34.780> froth<00:03:35.199> up

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
oh it's just starting to really froth up

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.900 
oh it's just starting to really froth up
so<00:03:35.590> we're<00:03:35.769> hoping<00:03:36.069> it's<00:03:36.220> gonna<00:03:36.340> be<00:03:36.549> ready<00:03:36.730> if

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.050 
this is taking water out of the most out
of<00:03:59.199> condense<00:03:59.590> yeah<00:04:00.099> let<00:04:00.280> condensed<00:04:00.609> more<00:04:00.849> and

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
of condense yeah let condensed more and

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.099 
of condense yeah let condensed more and
you'll<00:04:01.180> get<00:04:01.359> more<00:04:01.480> of<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.629> sure<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.930> bit<00:04:02.079> more
