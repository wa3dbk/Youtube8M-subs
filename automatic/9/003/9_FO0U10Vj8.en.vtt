00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.300
 eric ciotti I hope you're fine 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.950
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.020
 first tutorial on outbreak so the 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.060
 first map of the exo his bide call of 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.680
 duty modern warfare so we expected 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.510
 there is a lot of resemblance 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.940
 with the zombie of treyarch that is to say 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.930
 world at war black ops a black ops 2 i 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.210
 do not know if you remember but 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.730
 on most maps of this famous 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.730
 zombies treyarch we had breed 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.530
 majority three objects to activate so on 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.050
 its marks whether it's summer releases 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.700
 meteorite stones and that's it we 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.930
 put a music in the background just the 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.230
 incomplete music time plus the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.270
 reactivate and well that jenner handed this 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.450
 system there so there are three objects to 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.390
 activate then I will describe to you their 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.890
 placements with exact zone names 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.509
 to see the names of the areas you have 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.400
 just to look above the doors 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.050
 when you enter a kind of 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.060
 room and in general this will be displayed 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.619
 so when you go to the exo 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.840
 doctor you will open a door to 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.750
 750 points that will bring you to a 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.560
 wrench so this area is called 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.240
 administration over the door 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.800
 then you just have to maintain the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.319
 action button on your controller 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.899
 say it's cross on finally x on 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:32.270
 xbox or squares on ps3 you just have to 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.280
 you hold back this button in front of the 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.600
 wrench which is in charge 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.840
 in the wall then you will have to 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.060
 return to the area 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.289
 two of the disguises tests where it seems to me 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.359
 good brief this is the area where you will find 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.520
 your exoskeleton behind a door 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.840
 you will have some kind of settling on a 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.069
 object I did not pay attention to that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.119
 this is the object I thought I believe that 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:49.359
 it's a stretcher or I do not know anymore 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.520
 what 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.569
 finally the last object will be 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.479
 find in the area that is 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.039
 name holding so it's towards the box 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.679
 current that is used to get started 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.569
 the exo soldiers and exo health so if you 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.189
 do you get from a surgical instrument to 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.780
 a cada that once you have 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.030
 left three objects you'll hear the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.679
 music rise of the walking with who will 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.129
 activate they last about 5-6 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.959
 minutes 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.340
 so here is a little history 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.810
 very nice so I tried 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.480
 to send this video I have like 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.160
 it's an easter egg so about 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.630
 the church says I intend to seek 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.920
 still a lot of history so 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.970
 do not hesitate to see them my channel if 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.640
