00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
at those moments at that key moment I

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:09.589 
at those moments at that key moment I

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.380 

I<00:03:09.629> mean<00:03:10.170> I'd<00:03:10.260> call<00:03:10.499> that<00:03:10.530> probably<00:03:11.069> more<00:03:12.060> power

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
I mean I'd call that probably more power

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.110 
I mean I'd call that probably more power
than<00:03:12.659> bet<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.980> got<00:03:14.249> us<00:03:14.370> past<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.760> truck<00:03:14.939> and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
than bet that got us past the truck and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.670 
than bet that got us past the truck and
then<00:03:15.239> got<00:03:15.420> us<00:03:15.540> put<00:03:15.719> on<00:03:15.780> straight<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.230> jail<00:03:16.469> with

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
then got us put on straight to jail with

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.259 
then got us put on straight to jail with
the<00:03:16.799> speeding<00:03:17.099> ticket<00:03:17.370> that's<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.969> problem

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
the speeding ticket that's the problem

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.229 
the speeding ticket that's the problem
there<00:03:18.599> so<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:20.519> has<00:03:20.760> about<00:03:21.060> as<00:03:21.209> much

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
there so it has about as much

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.059 
there so it has about as much
acceleration<00:03:21.989> as<00:03:22.230> anything<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.799> could<00:03:22.950> put

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
acceleration as anything you could put
