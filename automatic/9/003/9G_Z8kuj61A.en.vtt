00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.720 
just on to demonstrate the first bit you
can<00:03:24.420> see<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> waves<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:26.450> did<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.630> knitting

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
can see the waves I did that knitting

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.600 
can see the waves I did that knitting
just<00:03:29.730> knit<00:03:29.940> stitch<00:03:30.209> other<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.380> next<00:03:31.530> bits<00:03:31.830> all

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
just knit stitch other the next bits all

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.930 
just knit stitch other the next bits all
purl<00:03:33.330> stitch<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:34.019> as<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.260> can<00:03:34.380> see<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:35.610> gives

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
purl stitch and as you can see it gives

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.940 
purl stitch and as you can see it gives
you<00:03:36.090> exactly<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.630> same<00:03:36.840> effect<00:03:37.260> with<00:03:37.560> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
you exactly the same effect with the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.750 
you exactly the same effect with the
waves<00:03:38.540> front<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.750> back<00:03:40.099> as<00:03:41.099> the<00:03:41.459> knit<00:03:41.640> stitch

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
waves front and back as the knit stitch

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.490 
waves front and back as the knit stitch
so<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.269> doesn't<00:03:42.510> matter<00:03:42.569> if<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.840> do<00:03:42.959> all<00:03:43.200> knit

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
so it doesn't matter if you do all knit

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.309 
so it doesn't matter if you do all knit
stitch<00:03:44.000> or<00:03:45.000> purl<00:03:45.540> stitch<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.049> will<00:03:46.140> have<00:03:46.290> the
