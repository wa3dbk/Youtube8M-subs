 the subliminal messages have been 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.830
 used for a very long time and it is 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.480
 that you could say that using messages 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.220
 subliminal in the creation of movies 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.420
 animated is the disney way of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.730
 have a little fun with the audience 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.139
 thus introducing words or sentences 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 highly inappropriate movies 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.619
 children as we all know disney 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.850

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.890
 innumerable accusations of 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.869

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.130

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.630
 extremely badly effective or for having 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.640

 sex network to 2 the adaptation of rapunzel in 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.050
 the relatively new movie 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.120
 Tangled was published a while ago 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.809
 back it includes a promotional poster 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.309
 that contained the letters sx hidden in 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.070
 this poster were the characters 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.320
 main as flynn rapunzel maximum 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.820
 and pascal they looked like a funny 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.199
 interpretation of the movie until 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.030
 a person started to analyze the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.680
 situation and he found another one of the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.930
 disney pranks this could be 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.879
 blame pure and simple chance but 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.170
 if we see it in perspective what are 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.910
 the odds of a poster 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.040
 created by a company like Disney it 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.150
 wrong and unintentionally put these 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.160
 three letters 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.360
 is also that Disney already had a reputation for 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.100
 do this before so the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.510
 chance he just did not play a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 real paper I do not understand you want to use 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.600
 these disney people are like I'm 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.580
 boring I'm going to put a word 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.650
 incredibly inappropriate as sex in 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.960
 a story for children and the number two 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.060
 is at the dim says good teenagers 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.710
 take off your clothes if we remember well the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.480
 movie of the dim there is a scene where 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.190
 the protagonist flies towards the balcony of 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.470
 jasmine and is received by the tiger of 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.330
 jasmine called raja at that time can 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.970
 listen to a subtle voice in the background that 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.230
 says teenagers take five clouds that in 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.540
 Spanish could be translated to 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.280
 good teens take off your clothes or 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.990
 something like that , listen carefully 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.350
 realize the way he says it 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.350
 aladdin 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.260
 Disney has always denied him 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.850
 claiming that his movie in that part 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.500
 of the script said something different but from 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.610
 same way because they did that aladir 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.770
 will whisper instead of just 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.420
 say it I guess we'll never know 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.100
 but of course that part of the 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.380
 movie you hear something that should not 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.229
 be there number 3 is the lion king 'of 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.210
 sex then if disney did it again a 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.700
 new 4 year old child new 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.290
 york saw this image I bet you what 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.120
 you want you never saw this 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.040
 sure they were very busy watching the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.150
 majestic lion going through little more than 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.740
 half movie 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.960
 we can observe a new land that 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.610
 is formed when simba pumba and rudder are 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.020
 called these were seeing the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.820
 stars of a cliff if you see from 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.800
 stopped the newly formed cloud of 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.350
 Earth seems to spell the word 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.840
 sex that in Spanish would translate to sex 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.820
 number 4 we have the friend of box bond 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.740
 and I think we can all remember this 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.870
 incredibly funny caricature box 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.420
 bone was very funny and completely 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.670
 healthy not good not not 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.950
 in 1942 a chapter was given to air the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.780
 called rabbit that came to dinner in 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.790
 this specific episode showed a 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.260
 little more than we needed to see if 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.910
 pay attention to the image and 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.230
 observe carefully may be given 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.790
 realize that there is something more 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.129
 two animated characters in that scene 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.510
 maybe some will say that simply the 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.120
 space between the legs of the adorable 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.860
 rabbit but if it was like that because to do 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.110
 this scene in this way so that 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.150
 it seemed like something else I guess I never 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.280
 we'll know disney's thanks for ruining 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.620
 my cartoons once again number five 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.299
 is the erection minister when we were 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.980
 children I'm more than sure that more than 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.540
 one of us was on the edge of 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.160
 our chair in this scene the witch 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.170
 Ãšrsula had not only achieved a 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.150
 attractive human body and hypnotized the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.610
 prince eric to love her but that 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.989
 in addition he had stolen the voice ariel and 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.790
 to do all this better was 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.680
 making married by a minister during 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.690
 Ursula's wedding in the animated movie 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.970
 of the little mermaid we can observe a 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.280
 small bulge coming out of the region 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.739
 pelvic minister the bundle was made 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.910
 so that later 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.859
 It seems that it was the knee of the 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.359
 minister but I think we all know what 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.670
 that I really wanted to be disney to 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.310
 create this scene number 6 is the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.170
 cover of the lion king 'in the year 2002 the 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.549
 Lion King was released for a second time 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.510
 in theaters around the world for a 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.700
 limited time 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.620
 during this time only the first end 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.160
 the week the film managed to raise more 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.430
 1.5 million 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.200
 more than 15.5 the first view the poster 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.390
 of the movie looks pretty innocent and 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.950
 even striking but when analyzing this 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.840
 image more closely and had 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.970
 we can clearly observe what 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.890
 she looks like a half-naked woman wearing what 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.540
 that seems to be a thong in the way 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.489
 that is, we have to accept the disney 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.040
 very good way to hide your message 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.140
 hidden number 7 is the strange castle 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.120
 of the little mermaid in some copies of vhs 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.010
 of the little mermaid we can observe something that 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.810
 It seems to be more than just a tower 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.010
 a castle the rumor says that the artist 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.260
 who created this did it in a way 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.060
 vengeful and here he's going to be fired and it's 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.560
 that has so much similarity to the organ 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.180
 male reproductive that is almost 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.040
 impossible to see it as something else 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.720
 nevertheless disney acclaimed that the rumor 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.550
 was false and that the artist in no 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.870
 moment he was going to lose his job and that the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.670
 who created the cover not even 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.470
 the artist worked for the company 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.360
 he said back that he was rushed to 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.850
 finish the job so he did not give 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.740
 much importance to the background or things 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.540
 that drew something that does not have much 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.160
 meaning if they ask me number 8 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.810
 there are the private parts of jessica 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.550
 serious if you're the kind of person who 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.470
 excited by more animated characters 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.270
 such as jessica rabbit I think that I 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.610
 I would see in versionar what is more look 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.259
 help luckily for you 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.240
 of the movie called who cheated on 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.009
 roger rabbit launched one another 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.479
 in front of this character without clothes 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.460
 interior in scene where jessica rabbit 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.020
 is going through a tuna village in the 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.520
 animated car with bob hoskins 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.319
 we can see if we look 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.180
 carefully when it is released 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.860
 out of the taxi what appear to be 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.479
 your private parts can observe how 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.990
 her dress gets up and gives us something to see 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.219
 that looks like britney I guess everything 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.930
 this time in front of the computer 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.610
 drawing animated characters like this 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.889
 woman if a man can affect you 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.419
 number 9 is the nude woman that 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.340
 I would have imagined that a movie 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.990
 that will involve a couple of mice 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.610
 trying to save a girl from a 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.409
 band of treasure hunters and going to 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.389
 have such a revelation not 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.370
 literally while white and bernard 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.289
 flying around the city in a box 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.090
 sardines tied to a car we can 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.610
 observe that she is a naked woman without 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.689
 underwear on top and that 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.069
 rhyme how weird 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.090
 I suppose that at this moment is where you 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.979
 you hope that there is a story 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.930
 hidden or that is simply a lie or 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.210
 it was denied, well, that's not 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.279
 so it will happen in this scene if there is 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.990
 the that does not occur after 38 minutes 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:11.879
 the movie disney has said that this 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.889
 image was not edited but rather 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.390
 they confirmed that if he was in the movie 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.670
 and they realized this 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.590
 20 years of releasing the film to the market 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.810
 again intake number the joke of 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.420
 oral sex the brave toaster is a 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.460
 pretty dark movie is scary and 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.470
 we can also see abandon problems 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.120
 personal shortcomings and shortcomings 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.320
 quite dark is also the part of 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.270
 oral sex in which the air 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.990
 conditioning basically tells the 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.430
 Vacuum cleaner

 I'm really scared kerry what 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.060
 You are going to make me suck until I die 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.890
 although I have been quite disturbing and 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.840
 may have damaged childhood 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.460

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.730
