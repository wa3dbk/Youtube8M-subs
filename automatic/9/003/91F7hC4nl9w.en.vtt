which is gonna lead to a short match in
your<00:00:57.149> favor<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.620> second<00:00:59.010> pattern<00:00:59.100> you're

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
your favor the second pattern you're

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.860 
your favor the second pattern you're
gonna<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.460> learning<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.090> strong<00:01:00.420> side

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
gonna be learning is the strong side

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
gonna be learning is the strong side
assault<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:02.250> reason<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.550> love<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.059> pattern

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
assault the reason I love this pattern

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.060 
assault the reason I love this pattern
so<00:01:03.539> much<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> catches<00:01:04.979> your

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
so much is because it catches your

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370 
so much is because it catches your
opponent<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.580> guard<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.930> strong<00:01:07.170> side

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
opponent off guard the strong side

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.990 
opponent off guard the strong side
assault<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.610> forehand

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
assault is where you go to the forehand

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.490 
assault is where you go to the forehand
because<00:01:09.479> they're<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.720> expecting<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
because they're not expecting it and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.320 
because they're not expecting it and
then<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.040> use<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.520> open<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:12.180> their

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
then you use that to open up their

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.670 
then you use that to open up their
weakness<00:01:12.630> which<00:01:12.840> could<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> backhand

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
weakness which could be the backhand

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.300 
weakness which could be the backhand
this<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> great<00:01:15.170> opportunity<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.650> kind<00:01:17.280> of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
this is a great opportunity to kind of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100 
this is a great opportunity to kind of
catch<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:17.790> opponent<00:01:18.119> off<00:01:18.180> guard<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.720> then

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
catch your opponent off guard and then

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.440 
catch your opponent off guard and then
use<00:01:19.409> their<00:01:19.650> strength<00:01:20.130> against<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
use their strength against them so you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.060 
use their strength against them so you
can<00:01:21.570> attack<00:01:21.840> their<00:01:22.049> weakness<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.830> third

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
can attack their weakness and the third

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.410 
can attack their weakness and the third
pattern<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.460> love<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> most<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> strong

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
pattern I love the most is the strong

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420 
pattern I love the most is the strong
side<00:01:24.659> strong<00:01:24.900> side<00:01:25.140> attack<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.130> strong

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
side strong side attack now the strong

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
side strong side attack now the strong
side<00:01:26.700> strong<00:01:27.060> side<00:01:27.299> attack<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.869> where<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.200> go

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
side strong side attack is where we go

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.990 
side strong side attack is where we go
to<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.710> strength<00:01:29.009> again<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.939> time

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
to the strength again but this time

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.340 
to the strength again but this time
we're<00:01:30.299> going<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:30.659> behind<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.290> opponent

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
we're going to go behind your opponent

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.499 
we're going to go behind your opponent
and<00:01:31.829> attack<00:01:32.640> their<00:01:32.850> strength<00:01:33.090> again<00:01:33.360> this

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and attack their strength again this

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
and attack their strength again this
works<00:01:33.750> great<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.350> fast<00:01:34.650> players<00:01:35.009> because

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
works great with fast players because

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.010 
works great with fast players because
you're<00:01:35.369> gonna<00:01:35.460> wrong-foot<00:01:36.030> them<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.810> only

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
you're gonna wrong-foot them not only

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
you're gonna wrong-foot them not only
that<00:01:37.170> you're<00:01:37.380> attacking<00:01:37.619> them<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.340> mental

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
that you're attacking them on the mental

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.819 
that you're attacking them on the mental
plane<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.659> you're<00:01:40.079> making<00:01:40.439> them<00:01:40.560> worried

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
plane because you're making them worried

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.140 
plane because you're making them worried
about<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> strengths<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
about you going to the strengths and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.730 
about you going to the strengths and
their<00:01:42.689> weaknesses<00:01:42.720> are<00:01:43.700> gonna<00:01:44.700> maybe<00:01:45.590> just<00:01:46.590> do

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
their weaknesses are gonna maybe just do

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.770 
their weaknesses are gonna maybe just do
a<00:01:46.770> changeup<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.520> go<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> strength<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
a changeup and go to the strength so

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.120 
a changeup and go to the strength so
they<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.229> guard<00:01:49.439> from<00:01:49.619> both<00:01:49.860> sides

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
they have to be on guard from both sides

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.880 
they have to be on guard from both sides
now

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
now

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.740 
now
so<00:01:51.310> now<00:01:51.460> I<00:01:51.490> want<00:01:51.730> to<00:01:51.760> do<00:01:51.850> a<00:01:51.880> quick<00:01:52.120> review<00:01:52.240> so

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
so now I want to do a quick review so

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.970 
so now I want to do a quick review so
you<00:01:52.840> understand<00:01:53.200> exactly<00:01:53.290> what<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:53.830> should

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
you understand exactly what you should

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.500 
you understand exactly what you should
be<00:01:54.070> doing<00:01:54.100> your<00:01:54.370> match<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.000> patterns<00:01:55.390> that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
be doing your match of the patterns that

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.610 
be doing your match of the patterns that
we've<00:01:55.630> talked<00:01:55.900> about<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.260> you<00:01:56.380> should<00:01:56.560> be

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
we've talked about that you should be

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.950 
we've talked about that you should be
using<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.490> first<00:01:57.730> pattern<00:01:58.000> is<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.600> weakside

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
using the first pattern is the weakside

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.110 
using the first pattern is the weakside
hammer<00:01:59.260> this<00:01:59.920> is<00:01:59.980> where<00:02:00.280> we<00:02:00.610> just<00:02:00.640> were

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
hammer this is where we just were

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.700 
hammer this is where we just were
hammering<00:02:01.600> their<00:02:01.780> weakness<00:02:02.080> over<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.560> over

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
hammering their weakness over and over

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.920 
hammering their weakness over and over
again<00:02:02.800> from<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.550> get-go<00:02:03.760> this<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.480> great<00:02:04.750> for

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
again from the get-go this is great for

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.200 
again from the get-go this is great for
breaking<00:02:05.410> them<00:02:05.530> down<00:02:05.790> taking<00:02:06.790> away<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.000> lot<00:02:07.090> of

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
breaking them down taking away a lot of

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.090 
breaking them down taking away a lot of
their<00:02:07.360> confidence<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.320> second<00:02:08.710> pattern<00:02:08.830> is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
their confidence the second pattern is

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.130 
their confidence the second pattern is
the<00:02:09.250> strong<00:02:09.490> side<00:02:09.790> assault<00:02:10.149> this<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.899> where<00:02:11.050> we

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
the strong side assault this is where we

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.410 
the strong side assault this is where we
go<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.710> strengths<00:02:12.010> first<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.820> then<00:02:13.210> we

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
go to the strengths first and then we

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.850 
go to the strengths first and then we
attack<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.870> weakness<00:02:14.170> we<00:02:14.290> catch<00:02:14.470> them<00:02:14.710> off

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
attack the weakness we catch them off

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.160 
attack the weakness we catch them off
guard<00:02:14.920> this<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.850> great<00:02:16.090> for<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.300> changeup<00:02:16.810> when

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
guard this is great for a changeup when

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.810 
guard this is great for a changeup when
they're<00:02:17.290> not<00:02:17.440> expecting<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.070> when<00:02:18.610> they've

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
they're not expecting it when they've

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.580 
they're not expecting it when they've
possibly<00:02:19.360> been<00:02:19.510> attacking<00:02:19.840> us<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.200> lot<00:02:20.350> using

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
possibly been attacking us a lot using

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.230 
possibly been attacking us a lot using
their<00:02:20.830> forehand<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.459> they<00:02:21.760> think<00:02:22.000> we're<00:02:22.150> not

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
their forehand and they think we're not

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.240 
their forehand and they think we're not
gonna<00:02:22.390> go<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.840> forehand<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.980> third

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
gonna go to the forehand and the third

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.010 
gonna go to the forehand and the third
and<00:02:24.520> final<00:02:24.580> pattern<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.480> strong<00:02:25.750> side

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
and final pattern is the strong side

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.840 
and final pattern is the strong side
strong<00:02:26.320> side<00:02:26.530> attack<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.520> where<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:27.700> go

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
strong side attack this is where we go

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.270 
strong side attack this is where we go
out<00:02:28.060> wide<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.750> then<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.530> wrongs<00:02:29.800> with<00:02:30.040> them<00:02:30.160> by

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
out wide and then we wrongs with them by

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.250 
out wide and then we wrongs with them by
going<00:02:30.550> back<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.060> their<00:02:31.239> strengths<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
going back to their strengths this is a

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.040 
going back to their strengths this is a
great<00:02:32.680> play<00:02:32.980> when<00:02:33.670> you<00:02:34.030> haven't<00:02:34.510> maybe<00:02:34.810> went

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
great play when you haven't maybe went

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.780 
great play when you haven't maybe went
through<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.260> strength<00:02:35.530> enough<00:02:35.830> or<00:02:36.100> when<00:02:36.700> you

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
through the strength enough or when you

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.190 
through the strength enough or when you
go<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:36.970> their<00:02:37.150> strengths<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.720> wrong<00:02:37.930> foot

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
go to their strengths the wrong foot

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.930 
go to their strengths the wrong foot
them<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:38.770> they're<00:02:38.920> not<00:02:39.010> running<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.640> open

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
them so they're not running to the open
