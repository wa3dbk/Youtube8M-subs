go here go to the Bison alright so here

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.080 
go here go to the Bison alright so here
is<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.790> Bison<00:00:33.350> on<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.250> foregrip<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
is the Bison on it I have the foregrip I

have the muzzle break so the foregrip

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.220 
have the muzzle break so the foregrip
helps<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:38.879> recoil<00:00:39.420> obviously<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
helps with recoil obviously this is a

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.479 
helps with recoil obviously this is a
gun<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.680> definitely<00:00:40.829> want<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> use<00:00:41.460> that

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
gun that you definitely want to use that

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.060 
gun that you definitely want to use that
on<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:43.050> makes<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> experience<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
on it just makes the experience of the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.580 
on it just makes the experience of the
gun<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.520> lot<00:00:45.000> better<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.989> don't<00:00:46.140> use<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
gun a lot better if you don't use it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.810 
gun a lot better if you don't use it
you're<00:00:46.710> gonna<00:00:46.829> deal<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.129> some<00:00:47.430> pretty

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
you're gonna deal with some pretty

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.910 
you're gonna deal with some pretty
difficult<00:00:48.059> recoil<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.110> mean<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.680> can't

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
difficult recoil I mean if you can't

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.529 
difficult recoil I mean if you can't
manage<00:00:50.129> recoil<00:00:50.670> pretty<00:00:51.030> well<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
manage recoil pretty well then you

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.299 
manage recoil pretty well then you
should<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.780> okay<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.800> would<00:00:53.039> highly

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
should be okay but I would highly

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
should be okay but I would highly
recommend<00:00:53.340> using<00:00:53.910> four<00:00:54.480> grip<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.140> obviously

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
recommend using four grip and obviously

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.930 
recommend using four grip and obviously
the<00:00:55.710> muzzle<00:00:55.949> brake<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.340> makes<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> gun

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the muzzle brake just makes the gun

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.970 
the muzzle brake just makes the gun
better<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.480> range<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.170> damage<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
better in range and damage and all that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.599 
better in range and damage and all that
kind<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> good<00:00:59.219> stuff

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
kind of good stuff

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
kind of good stuff
and<00:00:59.789> you'll<00:01:00.359> notice<00:01:00.570> faster<00:01:01.079> kill<00:01:01.260> times<00:01:01.500> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and you'll notice faster kill times and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.280 
and you'll notice faster kill times and
you'll<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.250> able<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.430> kill<00:01:02.640> enemies<00:01:03.000> from<00:01:03.660> our

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
be very good and then we have quick-draw

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.050 
be very good and then we have quick-draw
which<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.599> just<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.530> makes<00:02:46.739> SMG<00:02:47.609> is<00:02:47.670> insane

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
possible and quick-draw is definitely a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.750 
possible and quick-draw is definitely a
good<00:02:58.049> perk<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.920> will<00:02:59.129> help<00:02:59.220> out<00:02:59.430> with<00:02:59.519> that

then<00:03:00.180> hardline<00:03:00.720> if<00:03:01.530> you're<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.769> for<00:03:01.889> those

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
then hardline if you're going for those

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.140 
then hardline if you're going for those
Kemp<00:03:02.430> strikes<00:03:02.670> or<00:03:02.819> if<00:03:02.939> you're<00:03:03.030> running

assault<00:03:03.569> or<00:03:04.079> anything<00:03:04.349> actually<00:03:04.829> it<00:03:04.950> just

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
assault or anything actually it just

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.740 
assault or anything actually it just
helps<00:03:05.519> with<00:03:05.579> anything<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:06.239> it's<00:03:06.359> overall<00:03:06.629> a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
helps with anything so it's overall a

helps with anything so it's overall a
good<00:03:07.019> perk<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.650> then<00:03:08.069> we<00:03:08.159> have<00:03:08.280> gambler<00:03:08.700> just

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
good perk and then we have gambler just

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.360 
good perk and then we have gambler just
so<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.389> you<00:03:10.290> can<00:03:10.379> maybe<00:03:10.560> potentially<00:03:10.950> get<00:03:11.340> a
