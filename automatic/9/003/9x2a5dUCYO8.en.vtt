00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
that you is actually going into the down

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.960 
that you is actually going into the down
motion<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:25.830> other<00:00:25.890> words<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.490> always<00:00:26.730> to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
motion so in other words it's always to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.910 
motion so in other words it's always to
the<00:00:27.090> bottom<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.170> when<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.410> pull<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.740> one

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the bottom so when we pull this one

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
the bottom so when we pull this one
right<00:00:29.220> out<00:00:29.510> we'll<00:00:30.510> slip<00:00:30.689> those<00:00:30.900> right<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.940> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
right out we'll slip those right in and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.220 
right out we'll slip those right in and
I<00:00:33.719> always<00:00:33.989> use<00:00:34.410> these<00:00:34.590> tangle-free<00:00:35.780> bands<00:00:36.780> so

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
I always use these tangle-free bands so

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.630 
I always use these tangle-free bands so
it<00:00:37.320> doesn't<00:00:37.590> rip<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> paper<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.550> I'm

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it doesn't rip the paper so when I'm

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.880 
it doesn't rip the paper so when I'm
storing<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.500> then<00:00:40.500> I'm<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> show

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
once you would remove these you can just

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.310 
once you would remove these you can just

go right around and hold your paper
same<00:00:49.590> way<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.219> end<00:00:50.460> doesn't<00:00:51.059> matter

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
same way with on this end doesn't matter

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.930 
same way with on this end doesn't matter

what color you basically hold the paper

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.869 
what color you basically hold the paper
now<00:00:54.600> we're<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> load<00:00:55.050> another<00:00:55.640> same<00:00:56.640> way

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
now we're going to load another same way

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.450 
now we're going to load another same way
let's<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.629> undo<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> door<00:00:58.320> slide<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.309> up

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
let's just undo the door slide it up

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
let's just undo the door slide it up
slide<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.239> back<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:02.989> now<00:01:03.989> I've<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.409> two

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
slide it back on and now I've got two

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.810 
slide it back on and now I've got two
rolls

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
rolls

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.550 
rolls
and<00:01:07.180> now<00:01:07.810> we're<00:01:07.960> going<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.110> add<00:01:08.230> the<00:01:08.350> third

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
and now we're going to add the third

and now we're going to add the third
make<00:01:09.460> sure<00:01:09.670> that<00:01:09.850> at<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.030> papers<00:01:10.450> in<00:01:10.660> the<00:01:11.260> down

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
make sure that at the papers in the down

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.580 
make sure that at the papers in the down
position<00:01:13.560> we're<00:01:14.560> going<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.740> load<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:15.070> on<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
position we're going to load that on and

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.020 
position we're going to load that on and
we're<00:01:17.740> going<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:17.920> basically<00:01:18.070> show<00:01:18.310> you<00:01:18.520> how

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
we're going to basically show you how

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.300 
we're going to basically show you how
the<00:01:19.090> utility<00:01:19.840> bar<00:01:20.050> and<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.620> Guide<00:01:20.800> bar<00:01:21.010> works

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
the utility bar and the Guide bar works

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.740 
the utility bar and the Guide bar works
so<00:01:22.210> now<00:01:22.720> I<00:01:22.750> can<00:01:23.020> pull<00:01:23.200> these<00:01:23.320> off<00:01:24.750> and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
so now I can pull these off and

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.410 
so now I can pull these off and
basically<00:01:26.410> they<00:01:27.130> just<00:01:27.160> snap<00:01:27.910> back<00:01:27.970> together

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
basically they just snap back together

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.740 
basically they just snap back together
straight<00:01:28.990> which<00:01:29.350> they<00:01:29.530> are<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.740> coolest<00:01:30.750> my

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
straight which they are the coolest my

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.400 
straight which they are the coolest my
kids<00:01:31.990> love<00:01:32.200> them<00:01:32.320> anyway<00:01:33.070> we<00:01:33.820> pull<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:34.150> out

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
kids love them anyway we pull this out

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.090 
kids love them anyway we pull this out
these<00:01:35.410> are<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.620> things<00:01:35.800> you're<00:01:35.950> going<00:01:36.040> to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
these are the things you're going to

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.200 
these are the things you're going to
need<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.580> use<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.210> sharpie<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:39.000> labels<00:01:40.000> or

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
need I use a sharpie for labels or

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.870 
need I use a sharpie for labels or
whatever<00:01:40.509> sometimes<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.380> also<00:01:42.280> my<00:01:42.430> scissors

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
whatever sometimes and also my scissors

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.120 
whatever sometimes and also my scissors
would<00:01:43.300> still<00:01:43.509> fit<00:01:43.690> right<00:01:43.900> here<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.950> keep

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
would still fit right here and I keep

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.150 
would still fit right here and I keep
four<00:01:45.460> pins<00:01:45.759> shuttling<00:01:46.690> this<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.740> pins<00:01:47.979> go

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
four pins shuttling this the pins go

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.050 
four pins shuttling this the pins go
right<00:01:48.400> in<00:01:48.550> here

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.400 

the<00:01:52.060> reason<00:01:52.360> why<00:01:52.479> these<00:01:52.540> pins<00:01:52.930> are<00:01:53.050> like<00:01:53.200> that

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
the reason why these pins are like that

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.850 
the reason why these pins are like that
so<00:01:54.250> when<00:01:54.610> I<00:01:54.670> do<00:01:54.729> bring<00:01:55.119> in<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.380> can<00:01:56.560> store

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
so when I do bring in and I can store

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.490 
so when I do bring in and I can store
ribbon<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.850> can<00:01:58.330> put<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.570> revenue<00:01:58.900> on<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.350> take

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
ribbon I can put the revenue on and take

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.190 
ribbon I can put the revenue on and take
it<00:01:59.619> off<00:01:59.740> or<00:01:59.920> on<00:02:00.070> now<00:02:00.910> each<00:02:01.509> one<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:01.810> these<00:02:01.990> are

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
it off or on now each one of these are
