00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 Hello everyone, then today will be on 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.820
 thrown buckwheat porridge with duck and porridge 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.370
 pearl barley with beef means porridge 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.990
 buckwheat with duck cost 99 at a loss 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.800
 Canned food was sent to me from Russia 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.699
 buckwheat porridge with duck patriot product 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:27.000
 so let's please 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:34.260
 who are interested in macro are considered 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.489
 stickers labels and barley porridge with 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.149
 beef 1 and 3 dollars 100 years narrow 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.149
 meat yard 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.640
 that is interesting we pause 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.620
 Itâ€™s all worth a sign without 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.620
 smoke 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.180
 I can certainly not say the truth is 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.119
 not true since they still meet 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.090
 dry stew lately not very 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.680
 rather bad bad rather good 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.009
 tell rarely found at all 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.439
 bad but 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.350
 sin sin producers happen to us 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.740
 a little deceiving means let's 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.110
 first try this pack of cans so 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.850
 which is a very convenient jar too 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.150
 somewhere with me how I love you know 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.079
 low close to run canned too 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.880
 here 's a lower tank 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.009
 more precisely not lower field big 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.750
 low bank here that is, remove that 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.200
 jar as a plate but this is in my opinion 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:53.009
 also cool size this dosage for now 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.759
 I can not see the volume of this can I do not know 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.780
 almost invisible 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.490
 not written volume banks what is 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.080
 almost half of this 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:07.150
 the trims are also more often high tip too 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.340
 good access for one person 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.100
 even when you had no choice, I would take 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.410
 not such a jar of dances 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:28.319
 it looks like this guitar is also Panama to the cottage 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:31.450
 drove being even wash well 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.380
 There is no smell of fat in general 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.860
 missing smell from the false was not 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.860
 let's roll out 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.940
 only smells like barley swing barley 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:54.819
 Beef porridge with cold 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:03:00.720
 Of course, pearl barley is felt 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:06.040
 beef at all on the planet can be ready 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:14.650
 even though we dig up thanks to the bottom 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:18.209
 there is still a small but very alive 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.209
 bottom take a piece and try 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.830
 You know what, I'll tell you what the composition 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.820
 to taste this porridge with a little 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.220
 a small amount of beef fat here 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.650
 here the meat is not felt at all here 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:04:03.220
 no it's not spring let's try urka 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:06.510

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.060
 Largely and light you buy for 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.400

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.390

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.390

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:50.420

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.850
 porridge even without some 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.890
 micro taste meat smell a little there 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:01.460

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.540

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.550
 And on change, I certainly turn on you 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.600
 if we have nothing to say, there is nothing 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.060
