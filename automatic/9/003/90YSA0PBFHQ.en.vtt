your number up the lunging why you like
me

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.930 

you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.689 

it<00:00:58.719> has<00:00:58.870> a<00:00:58.899> more<00:00:59.170> hi-fi<00:00:59.620> type<00:00:59.920> sound<00:01:00.250> from<00:01:00.609> a

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
it has a more hi-fi type sound from a

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.580 
it has a more hi-fi type sound from a
smaller<00:01:01.000> amp<00:01:01.300> so<00:01:01.480> you're<00:01:01.629> getting<00:01:01.899> it's<00:01:02.379> not

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
smaller amp so you're getting it's not

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.930 
smaller amp so you're getting it's not
boxy<00:01:03.129> sound<00:01:03.309> that's<00:01:03.519> what<00:01:03.640> that's<00:01:03.850> the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
boxy sound that's what that's the

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.760 
boxy sound that's what that's the
complaint<00:01:04.210> we<00:01:04.360> get<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.750> most<00:01:04.930> about<00:01:05.229> any<00:01:05.590> of

complaint we get the most about any of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.470 
complaint we get the most about any of
that<00:01:05.799> small<00:01:06.159> is<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.430> box

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
that small is that box

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:44.800 
that small is that box
you

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:58.770 

you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.030 

this<00:01:59.680> is<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.890> 6v6<00:02:00.909> which<00:02:01.270> is<00:02:01.479> it's<00:02:02.290> a<00:02:02.470> it's<00:02:02.500> also

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
this is a 6v6 which is it's a it's also

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.950 
this is a 6v6 which is it's a it's also
an<00:02:03.159> American<00:02:03.520> tube<00:02:03.700> like<00:02:03.940> a<00:02:03.970> 6l6<00:02:04.420> but<00:02:04.810> it's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
an American tube like a 6l6 but it's

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.289 
an American tube like a 6l6 but it's
smaller<00:02:05.290> it's<00:02:05.799> smaller<00:02:06.070> less<00:02:06.400> output<00:02:06.610> type

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
smaller it's smaller less output type

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:08.520 
smaller it's smaller less output type
tube<00:02:07.509> it's<00:02:07.659> what<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.930> would<00:02:08.050> have<00:02:08.140> found<00:02:08.259> and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
tube it's what you would have found and

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:22.260 
tube it's what you would have found and
also<00:02:08.890> fender<00:02:09.580> amplifiers<00:02:09.789> but<00:02:10.209> lower<00:02:10.450> power

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.120 

so<00:02:23.270> uh<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.780> don't<00:02:24.140> know<00:02:24.350> how<00:02:24.470> he's<00:02:24.620> done<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.860> but

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
so uh I don't know how he's done it but

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.160 
so uh I don't know how he's done it but
he<00:02:25.190> has<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.819> most<00:02:26.000> massive<00:02:26.360> sounding<00:02:26.840> reverb

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
he has the most massive sounding reverb

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.080 
he has the most massive sounding reverb
in<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:27.470> small<00:02:27.709> amplifier<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.550> really<00:02:28.880> um

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
in that small amplifier so it really um

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:39.270 
in that small amplifier so it really um
it's<00:02:29.870> cool

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.700 

yeah<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.180> think<00:02:40.480> I'm<00:02:40.750> better<00:02:40.930> fits<00:02:41.200> in<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.380> salad

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
yeah I think I'm better fits in a salad

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.170 
yeah I think I'm better fits in a salad
-<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:41.920> don't<00:02:42.220> think<00:02:42.400> they're<00:02:42.520> just<00:02:42.730> retro

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
- I don't think they're just retro

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.030 
- I don't think they're just retro
looking<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.630> think<00:02:43.690> they're<00:02:43.930> they're<00:02:44.590> retro

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
looking I think they're they're retro

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.920 
looking I think they're they're retro
they're<00:02:45.430> more<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.940> roots<00:02:46.330> type<00:02:46.630> sound

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
they're more of a roots type sound

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.190 
they're more of a roots type sound
anyway<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:49.270> that's<00:02:49.510> now<00:02:49.780> that's<00:02:49.960> just<00:02:50.050> a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
anyway that that's now that's just a

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.510 
anyway that that's now that's just a
palette<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.770> work<00:02:50.800> with<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.160> doesn't<00:02:51.430> mean

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
palette to work with that doesn't mean

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.980 
palette to work with that doesn't mean
you<00:02:51.610> have<00:02:51.820> to<00:02:51.850> play<00:02:52.090> roots<00:02:52.360> music<00:02:52.720> with<00:02:52.870> it

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
you have to play roots music with it

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.260 
you have to play roots music with it
right<00:02:53.140> but<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.500> more<00:02:53.770> vintage<00:02:54.130> voiced<00:02:54.400> um<00:02:54.760> I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
right but it is more vintage voiced um I

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.690 
right but it is more vintage voiced um I
like<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.990> crank<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.290> April<00:02:56.620> fire<00:02:56.770> up<00:02:56.980> because

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
like to crank that April fire up because

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.370 
like to crank that April fire up because
I<00:02:57.730> love<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.090> weight<00:02:58.240> naturally<00:02:58.480> compresses

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
I love the weight naturally compresses

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.530 
I love the weight naturally compresses
and<00:02:59.560> I<00:03:00.010> like<00:03:00.640> when<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.940> hit<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.150> with<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.270> really

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
and I like when you hit it with a really

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.720 
and I like when you hit it with a really
hot<00:03:01.690> signal<00:03:01.870> what<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.260> does<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:03.459> think<00:03:03.490> a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
hot signal what it does and I think a

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
hot signal what it does and I think a
lot<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:03.970> people<00:03:04.209> that's<00:03:04.300> probably<00:03:04.600> what

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
lot of people that's probably what

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.420 
lot of people that's probably what
they're<00:03:04.870> going<00:03:04.990> to<00:03:05.080> do<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.260> mean<00:03:05.470> if<00:03:06.160> they're

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
they're going to do I mean if they're

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.470 
they're going to do I mean if they're
recording<00:03:06.790> with<00:03:06.910> it<00:03:07.000> they're<00:03:07.090> going<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.240> crank

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
recording with it they're going to crank

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.330 
recording with it they're going to crank
it<00:03:07.600> all<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.780> way<00:03:07.900> up<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.320> they're<00:03:08.830> gonna<00:03:08.920> you

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
it all the way up and they're gonna you

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.160 
it all the way up and they're gonna you
know<00:03:09.430> hit<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.120> huge<00:03:10.390> chord<00:03:10.660> with<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:10.990> listen

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
know hit a huge chord with it and listen

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.050 
know hit a huge chord with it and listen
to<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.320> amp<00:03:11.440> overdrive<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.130> naturally

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
to the amp overdrive and naturally

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:22.180 
to the amp overdrive and naturally
compress

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.580 

it's<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.730> very<00:03:22.940> robust<00:03:23.630> it's<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.020> very<00:03:24.200> robust

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
it's a very robust it's a very robust

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.170 
it's a very robust it's a very robust
nameplate<00:03:24.920> it's<00:03:25.010> very<00:03:25.190> thick<00:03:25.490> and<00:03:25.670> it's<00:03:25.970> on

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
nameplate it's very thick and it's on

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.840
