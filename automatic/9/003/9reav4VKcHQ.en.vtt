00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
an integra view as well they got one

review is available there and you can
see<00:02:17.530> even<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.920> s6<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.430> s6<00:02:18.760> edge<00:02:19.030> units<00:02:19.990> was

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
see even the s6 and s6 edge units was

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.960 
see even the s6 and s6 edge units was
not<00:02:20.620> consistent<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.490> they<00:02:21.640> were<00:02:21.700> showing

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
not consistent and they were showing

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.330 
not consistent and they were showing
different<00:02:22.360> white<00:02:22.780> points<00:02:23.350> one<00:02:23.950> unit<00:02:24.190> was

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
different white points one unit was

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.640 
different white points one unit was
showing<00:02:24.640> 6,000<00:02:25.270> 450<00:02:25.780> somewhere<00:02:26.140> around<00:02:26.290> that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
showing 6,000 450 somewhere around that

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.410 
showing 6,000 450 somewhere around that
region<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.700> other<00:02:27.820> one<00:02:28.030> was<00:02:28.210> showing

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
region and the other one was showing

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.380 
region and the other one was showing
6200<00:02:29.320> something<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:29.890> obviously<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.970> unit

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
6200 something and obviously the unit

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.140 
6200 something and obviously the unit
with<00:02:31.540> showing<00:02:31.810> with<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.430> lower<00:02:33.430> number<00:02:33.850> will

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
with showing with the lower number will

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.810 
with showing with the lower number will
appear<00:02:34.420> warmer<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.130> see<00:02:36.310> once<00:02:36.670> again

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
appear warmer so you can see once again

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.670 
appear warmer so you can see once again
there<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.270> variation<00:02:37.540> going<00:02:37.960> on<00:02:38.110> even<00:02:38.500> with

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
there is a variation going on even with

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.490 
there is a variation going on even with
the<00:02:38.710> to<00:02:39.400> review<00:02:39.730> units<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.780> they<00:02:41.050> received

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
the to review units that they received

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.630 
the to review units that they received
if<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.370> hate<00:02:42.580> iphone<00:02:43.420> 6<00:02:44.380> or<00:02:44.650> 6<00:02:44.890> plus<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.370> much

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
if you hate iphone 6 or 6 plus that much

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.810 
if you hate iphone 6 or 6 plus that much
so<00:02:46.090> let's<00:02:46.270> compare<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.960> s6<00:02:47.830> edge<00:02:48.010> screen<00:02:48.370> with

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
so let's compare the s6 edge screen with

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.390 
so let's compare the s6 edge screen with
the<00:02:48.850> note<00:02:49.270> for<00:02:49.540> my<00:02:50.230> note<00:02:50.440> 4<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.770> able<00:02:51.100> to<00:02:51.220> show

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
the note for my note 4 is able to show

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.420 
the note for my note 4 is able to show
better<00:02:51.820> white<00:02:52.120> point<00:02:52.510> as<00:02:52.720> compared<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.440> s6

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
better white point as compared to the s6

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.320 
better white point as compared to the s6
edge<00:02:54.760> as<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.900> can<00:02:56.020> see<00:02:56.260> in<00:02:56.470> these<00:02:57.330> comparison

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
edge as you can see in these comparison

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.170 
edge as you can see in these comparison
photos<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.530> not<00:02:59.740> easy<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.370> show<00:03:00.700> all<00:03:01.000> these

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
photos it is not easy to show all these

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.510 
photos it is not easy to show all these
differences<00:03:01.690> on<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.170> camera<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.310> can

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
differences on the camera but you can

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.840 
differences on the camera but you can
see<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.260> note<00:03:05.560> 4<00:03:05.800> is<00:03:06.010> showing<00:03:06.670> little

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
see that the note 4 is showing little

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.420 
see that the note 4 is showing little
bit<00:03:07.120> more<00:03:07.510> pinkish<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.470> sky<00:03:08.740> as<00:03:08.950> compared

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
bit more pinkish on the sky as compared

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.760 
bit more pinkish on the sky as compared
to<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.550> six<00:03:09.910> edge<00:03:10.420> which<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.320> showing<00:03:11.590> little

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
to the six edge which is showing little

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.980 
to the six edge which is showing little
bit<00:03:12.040> more<00:03:12.280> yellow<00:03:12.460> so<00:03:13.330> let's<00:03:13.510> compare<00:03:13.810> the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
bit more yellow so let's compare the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.750 
bit more yellow so let's compare the
same<00:03:14.200> photos<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.740> I<00:03:14.770> have<00:03:14.890> compared<00:03:15.460> using

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
same photos that I have compared using

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.500 
same photos that I have compared using
the<00:03:16.150> iphone<00:03:16.720> 6<00:03:16.990> plus<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.070> 6<00:03:18.370> edge<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:19.300> can

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
the iphone 6 plus and the 6 edge you can

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.290 
the iphone 6 plus and the 6 edge you can
clearly<00:03:19.750> see<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.110> difference<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.970> legs

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
clearly see the difference that the legs

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.730 
clearly see the difference that the legs
of<00:03:22.510> this<00:03:23.200> lady<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:24.360> yellowish<00:03:25.360> on<00:03:25.660> s6<00:03:26.530> edge

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
of this lady is yellowish on s6 edge

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.820 
of this lady is yellowish on s6 edge
whereas<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.700> note<00:03:28.090> 4<00:03:28.390> is<00:03:28.660> showing<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
whereas the note 4 is showing the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.590 
whereas the note 4 is showing the

lightly pinkish or more fleshy color so
tell<00:03:34.780> me<00:03:34.810> now<00:03:35.100> what<00:03:36.100> display<00:03:36.520> mate<00:03:36.700> has<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.090> say

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
tell me now what display mate has to say

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.880 
tell me now what display mate has to say
about<00:03:37.300> this<00:03:37.540> one<00:03:37.930> because<00:03:38.200> they<00:03:38.560> are<00:03:38.650> saying

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
about this one because they are saying

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.210 
about this one because they are saying
that<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.459> s6<00:03:39.760> edge<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:40.800> similar<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.040> note

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
that the s6 edge is similar to the note

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.510 
that the s6 edge is similar to the note
4<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.760> both<00:03:43.120> these<00:03:43.330> displays<00:03:43.810> are<00:03:44.310> number<00:03:45.310> one

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
4 and both these displays are number one

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.840 
4 and both these displays are number one
you<00:03:46.360> can<00:03:46.540> see<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:47.340> variation<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.490> display

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
you can see the variation in the display

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.690 
you can see the variation in the display
very<00:03:49.450> easily<00:03:49.630> over<00:03:50.050> here<00:03:50.260> all<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:51.400> screens

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
very easily over here all the screens

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.840 
very easily over here all the screens
has<00:03:52.690> some<00:03:53.260> variation<00:03:53.860> during<00:03:54.250> manufacturing

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
has some variation during manufacturing

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.730 
has some variation during manufacturing
because<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.840> manufacturer<00:03:56.440> does<00:03:56.709> not

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
because the manufacturer does not

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.820 
because the manufacturer does not
calibrate<00:03:57.459> each<00:03:57.670> and<00:03:58.240> every<00:03:58.630> screen<00:03:58.990> the

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
calibrate each and every screen the

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.800 
calibrate each and every screen the
manufacturing<00:04:00.490> process<00:04:00.520> will<00:04:01.180> get<00:04:01.480> very

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
manufacturing process will get very

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.770 
manufacturing process will get very
expensive<00:04:01.990> if<00:04:02.530> they<00:04:03.070> have<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.550> calibrate<00:04:04.270> each

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
expensive if they have to calibrate each

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.260 
expensive if they have to calibrate each
and<00:04:05.200> every<00:04:05.560> screen<00:04:05.940> they<00:04:06.940> have<00:04:07.150> to

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
and every screen they have to

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.620 
and every screen they have to
mass-produce<00:04:07.739> these<00:04:08.739> screens<00:04:09.580> so<00:04:10.420> they

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
mass-produce these screens so they

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.420 
mass-produce these screens so they
always<00:04:10.989> have<00:04:11.200> slight<00:04:11.470> variation<00:04:12.070> here<00:04:12.220> and

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
always have slight variation here and

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.580 
always have slight variation here and
there<00:04:12.640> but<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.570> molality<00:04:13.780> screen<00:04:14.290> has

there but the molality screen has

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.220 
there but the molality screen has
slightly<00:04:15.250> more<00:04:15.610> variation<00:04:16.180> than<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.630> LCD

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
slightly more variation than the LCD

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.229 
slightly more variation than the LCD
screens<00:04:17.530> because<00:04:17.799> they<00:04:18.160> are<00:04:18.280> more<00:04:18.310> complex<00:04:18.850> in

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
screens because they are more complex in

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.260 
screens because they are more complex in
nature<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.650> structure<00:04:20.979> so<00:04:21.820> they<00:04:22.000> usually

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
nature and structure so they usually

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
nature and structure so they usually
tend<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.840> show<00:04:23.050> little<00:04:23.260> bit<00:04:23.500> more<00:04:23.710> variation

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
tend to show little bit more variation

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.640 
tend to show little bit more variation

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
emotional things in order to avoid all

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.130 
emotional things in order to avoid all
this<00:05:46.490> it<00:05:46.790> is<00:05:46.910> better<00:05:47.090> not<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.570> voice<00:05:47.870> such

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
this it is better not to voice such

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.530 
this it is better not to voice such
videos<00:05:48.500> if<00:05:49.310> you<00:05:49.370> have<00:05:49.670> found<00:05:49.910> me<00:05:50.090> saying

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
videos if you have found me saying

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.210 
videos if you have found me saying
something<00:05:50.780> good<00:05:51.080> about<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.500> iphone<00:05:51.950> in

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
something good about the iphone in

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.180 
something good about the iphone in
comparison<00:05:52.880> to<00:05:53.030> some<00:05:53.210> other<00:05:53.360> Android<00:05:53.900> phone

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
comparison to some other Android phone

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.340 
comparison to some other Android phone
then<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.400> reason<00:05:55.700> might<00:05:56.030> be<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.870> iphone

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
then the reason might be that the iphone

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.110 
then the reason might be that the iphone
is<00:05:57.380> giving<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.920> better<00:05:58.100> experience<00:05:58.640> if<00:05:58.790> i<00:05:58.910> say

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
is giving the better experience if i say

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.540 
is giving the better experience if i say
that<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.510> iphone<00:05:59.900> 6<00:06:00.230> or<00:06:00.500> 6<00:06:00.770> plus<00:06:01.010> runs<00:06:01.340> the

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
that the iphone 6 or 6 plus runs the

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.000 
that the iphone 6 or 6 plus runs the
games<00:06:01.760> better<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.210> smoother<00:06:02.750> then<00:06:03.470> that's<00:06:03.830> not

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
games better a smoother then that's not

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.160 
games better a smoother then that's not
a<00:06:04.040> lie<00:06:04.310> or<00:06:04.640> that's<00:06:04.940> not<00:06:05.120> favoring<00:06:05.570> any<00:06:05.750> device

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
a lie or that's not favoring any device

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.800 
a lie or that's not favoring any device
that's<00:06:06.530> just<00:06:06.830> a<00:06:06.980> reality<00:06:07.160> you<00:06:08.150> have<00:06:08.360> to<00:06:08.540> accept

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
that's just a reality you have to accept

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.440 
that's just a reality you have to accept
it<00:06:09.050> and<00:06:09.230> if<00:06:09.770> i<00:06:09.890> like<00:06:10.160> a<00:06:10.190> display<00:06:10.670> of<00:06:10.880> a<00:06:11.090> certain
