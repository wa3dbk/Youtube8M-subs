have two pairs that are kind of diagonal
from<00:00:21.869> each<00:00:22.050> other<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.769> one<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
from each other like one is here and

from each other like one is here and
once<00:00:23.670> here<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.160> and<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:26.340> happens<00:00:26.640> is

once here like that and what happens is

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.750 
once here like that and what happens is
when<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.150> try<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.390> put<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> slot<00:00:28.760> like

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
when you try to put it in the slot like

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.070 
when you try to put it in the slot like
so<00:00:30.090> let's<00:00:30.330> say<00:00:30.420> you're<00:00:30.539> trying<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.810> put<00:00:30.960> this

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so let's say you're trying to put this

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.830 
so let's say you're trying to put this
blue<00:00:31.349> red<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:32.730> happens<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.600> end<00:00:33.630> up

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
blue red in what happens is you end up

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.650 
blue red in what happens is you end up
messing<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.890> slot<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.790> had<00:00:36.000> so

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
messing up the slot that you had so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.540 
messing up the slot that you had so
let's<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.050> watch<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.100> put<00:00:38.370> in

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
let's just watch this one as I put in

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.209 
let's just watch this one as I put in
the<00:00:39.090> blue<00:00:39.300> red<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.170> piece<00:00:40.379> separates<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the blue red and the piece separates and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.040 
the blue red and the piece separates and
they<00:00:42.090> become<00:00:43.160> separated<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.690> way<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> get

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
they become separated so the way to get

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.350 
they become separated so the way to get
around<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.980> instead<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> using<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
around this is to instead of using the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.240 
around this is to instead of using the
pull<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.020> then<00:00:49.260> align<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:50.039> pull

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
pull up and then align and then pull

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.510 
pull up and then align and then pull
down<00:00:50.510> you're<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.690> use<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.370> just<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
down you're going to use the just the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.860 
down you're going to use the just the
straight<00:00:53.789> pull<00:00:54.059> down<00:00:54.239> method<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.750> you're

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
straight pull down method so you're

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.939 
straight pull down method so you're
going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> take<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.800> corner<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
going to take the the corner here and

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.660 
going to take the the corner here and
you're<00:00:58.949> just<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> pull<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.460> straight

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you're just going to pull it straight

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.229 
you're just going to pull it straight
down<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.789> then<00:01:02.789> you're<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> move

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
down like so then you're going to move

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.260 
down like so then you're going to move
it<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.840> way<00:01:04.049> further<00:01:04.739> down<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:06.119> what

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
it out of the way further down so what

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.219 
it out of the way further down so what
you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.659> bring<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.049> back<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.750> then<00:01:09.750> align

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you can bring that back and then align

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.550 
you can bring that back and then align
the<00:01:10.710> other<00:01:11.340> edge<00:01:11.670> again<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> again<00:01:13.260> let's<00:01:13.470> do

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the other edge again so again let's do

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.870 
the other edge again so again let's do
that<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.740> more<00:01:13.860> time<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.400> you'll<00:01:14.610> notice

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that one more time and you'll notice

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.920 
that one more time and you'll notice
when<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:17.150> doesn't<00:01:18.150> mess<00:01:18.479> up<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
when you do this it doesn't mess up that

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.800 
when you do this it doesn't mess up that
back<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.880> ok<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:20.939> again<00:01:21.240> one<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.750> time

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
back there ok so again one more time

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
back there ok so again one more time
you're<00:01:22.259> going<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.470> take<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.950> edge<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
you're going to take the edge and the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.580 
you're going to take the edge and the
corner<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.540> pull<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> straight<00:01:24.990> into<00:01:25.350> its

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
corner and pull it straight into its

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.590 
corner and pull it straight into its
slot<00:01:25.770> now<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.240> be<00:01:27.299> misaligned

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
slot now this is going to be misaligned

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.789 
slot now this is going to be misaligned
so<00:01:27.990> you're<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.259> need<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.530> pull<00:01:28.680> it

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
so you're going to need to pull it

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.300 
so you're going to need to pull it
downward<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.640> realign<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.890> then<00:01:31.890> realign

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
downward to realign it and then realign

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.120 
downward to realign it and then realign
this<00:01:32.520> right<00:01:33.030> there<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.409> when<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
this right there and when you do that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.870 
this right there and when you do that
quickly<00:01:35.310> look<00:01:35.729> something<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:37.880> there

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
quickly look something like this there

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.649 
quickly look something like this there
you<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.560> okay<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> next<00:01:41.189> case<00:01:41.600> okay<00:01:42.600> so

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you go okay on to the next case okay so

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.950 
you go okay on to the next case okay so
some<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.049> these<00:01:43.170> next<00:01:43.640> f2l<00:01:44.640> cases<00:01:45.030> are<00:01:45.659> going

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
some of these next f2l cases are going

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.889 
some of these next f2l cases are going
to<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.229> pretty<00:01:46.770> simple<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.720> might

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
to be pretty simple and you might

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.719 
to be pretty simple and you might
already<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.290> them<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.130> need<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> go

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
already know them but I do need to go

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.200 
already know them but I do need to go
over<00:01:50.820> them<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.689> later<00:01:51.960> videos<00:01:53.210> you

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
over them so that in later videos you

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.569 
over them so that in later videos you
know<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.570> I'm<00:01:54.659> talking<00:01:54.689> about<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
know what I'm talking about so the the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.450 
know what I'm talking about so the the
very<00:01:56.729> first<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.799> actually<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.100> next<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.369> I'm

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
very first one actually the next one I'm

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.270 
very first one actually the next one I'm
going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> show<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.409> this<00:02:01.409> one<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.829> where<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
going to show is this one here where the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.120 
going to show is this one here where the
corner<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.969> correctly<00:02:03.659> oriented<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
corner is correctly oriented and it is

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.630 
corner is correctly oriented and it is
in<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.490> correct<00:02:05.939> slot<00:02:06.420> okay<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:08.069> edge<00:02:08.250> is

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
in the correct slot okay and the edge is

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.690 
in the correct slot okay and the edge is
eat<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.539> either<00:02:09.959> side<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> basic

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
eat on either side this is the basic

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.539 
eat on either side this is the basic
move<00:02:12.000> from<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> layer-by-layer<00:02:12.480> method

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
move from the layer-by-layer method

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.649 
move from the layer-by-layer method
repair<00:02:15.549> it<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.909> then<00:02:16.180> put<00:02:17.079> it<00:02:17.349> in<00:02:17.439> the<00:02:17.530> spot<00:02:18.659> ok

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
repair it and then put it in the spot ok

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.330 
repair it and then put it in the spot ok
this<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:19.989> left<00:02:20.530> version<00:02:21.189> of<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
this is the left version of the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.800 
this is the left version of the
algorithm<00:02:21.640> with<00:02:21.969> the<00:02:22.060> corners<00:02:22.359> on<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.599> left

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
algorithm with the corners on the left

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.309 
algorithm with the corners on the left
again<00:02:23.799> these<00:02:24.010> are<00:02:24.069> from<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.609> beginner<00:02:25.319> layer

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
again these are from the beginner layer

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.410 
again these are from the beginner layer
layer<00:02:26.590> method<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.579> you<00:02:27.670> should<00:02:27.969> really<00:02:28.209> know

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
layer method so you should really know

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.780 
layer method so you should really know
these<00:02:28.629> just<00:02:29.379> in<00:02:29.469> case<00:02:29.700> ok<00:02:30.810> ok<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.109> next

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
these just in case ok ok the next

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.759 
these just in case ok ok the next
algorithm<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:34.060> probably<00:02:34.689> the<00:02:34.870> easiest<00:02:35.230> f2l

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
algorithm is probably the easiest f2l

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.339 
algorithm is probably the easiest f2l
you'll<00:02:36.010> have<00:02:36.359> a<00:02:37.359> lot<00:02:37.989> of<00:02:38.019> f<00:02:38.530> 2<00:02:38.590> l's<00:02:39.959> use<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> set

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
you'll have a lot of f 2 l's use a set

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.899 
you'll have a lot of f 2 l's use a set
up<00:02:41.470> move<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.829> gets<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.519> point<00:02:42.730> so

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
up move that gets you to this point so

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.369 
up move that gets you to this point so
it's<00:02:43.120> important<00:02:43.659> that<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.780> understand<00:02:44.200> this

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
it's important that you understand this

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.080 
it's important that you understand this
move<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.670> where<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:47.500> red<00:02:47.889> or<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:48.909> this<00:02:49.030> case

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
move it's where the red or in this case

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.379 
move it's where the red or in this case
the<00:02:49.780> red<00:02:50.379> and<00:02:50.500> green<00:02:50.609> corner<00:02:51.609> is<00:02:51.700> here<00:02:52.060> it's

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
the red and green corner is here it's

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.740 
the red and green corner is here it's
above<00:02:52.629> its<00:02:52.810> lot<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.379> its<00:02:54.370> edge<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:55.090> across

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
above its lot and its edge is across

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.860 
above its lot and its edge is across
from<00:02:56.139> it<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:57.549> it's<00:02:57.819> not<00:02:58.030> across<00:02:58.480> from<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
from it and it's not across from the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.809 
from it and it's not across from the
white<00:02:58.900> so<00:02:59.379> if<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.560> look<00:02:59.739> at<00:02:59.889> it<00:03:00.010> like<00:03:00.189> as<00:03:00.459> in<00:03:00.730> a

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
white so if you look at it like as in a

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.860 
white so if you look at it like as in a
row<00:03:01.030> like<00:03:01.299> this<00:03:01.359> the<00:03:02.200> red<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:03.239> across<00:03:04.239> from<00:03:04.750> the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
row like this the red is across from the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.619 
row like this the red is across from the
green<00:03:05.139> not<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.889> white<00:03:06.189> but<00:03:07.060> what<00:03:07.389> you<00:03:07.510> don't

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
green not the white but what you don't

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.240 
green not the white but what you don't
want<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.930> do<00:03:08.049> is<00:03:08.169> confuse<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.680> with<00:03:08.709> this

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
want to do is confuse it with this

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.199 
want to do is confuse it with this
pattern<00:03:10.349> what's<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:12.040> white<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.340> across<00:03:12.909> from

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
pattern what's the white is across from

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.479 
pattern what's the white is across from
the<00:03:13.299> edge<00:03:13.419> you<00:03:13.629> don't<00:03:13.780> want<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:14.220> you<00:03:15.220> want<00:03:15.400> it

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
the edge you don't want that you want it

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.580 
the edge you don't want that you want it
this<00:03:15.639> way<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.870> what<00:03:17.019> you<00:03:17.109> want<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.349> do<00:03:17.439> is<00:03:17.560> you

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
this way so what you want to do is you

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.229 
this way so what you want to do is you
want<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.829> make<00:03:17.889> sure<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.519> two<00:03:18.760> colors<00:03:18.970> on

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
want to make sure that the two colors on

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.719 
want to make sure that the two colors on
top<00:03:19.299> are<00:03:19.810> opposite<00:03:20.349> so<00:03:20.560> in<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:20.769> case<00:03:21.010> green

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:21.729 
top are opposite so in this case green

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.689 
top are opposite so in this case green
and<00:03:21.970> red<00:03:22.269> so<00:03:22.720> they<00:03:22.840> are<00:03:22.989> opposites<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:24.519> all

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
and red so they are opposites and all

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.129 
and red so they are opposites and all
you<00:03:24.849> do<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.150> really<00:03:25.479> really<00:03:25.599> simple<00:03:25.810> move

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
you do is a really really simple move

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.339 
you do is a really really simple move
you<00:03:26.319> bring<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.650> corner<00:03:26.979> to<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> edge<00:03:27.489> like<00:03:28.030> so

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
you bring the corner to the edge like so

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.780 
you bring the corner to the edge like so
then<00:03:29.349> you<00:03:29.500> bring<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.919> white<00:03:30.220> over<00:03:30.489> here

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
then you bring this white over here

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.289 
then you bring this white over here
towards<00:03:31.889> this<00:03:32.889> edge<00:03:33.250> here<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.849> then<00:03:34.030> pull<00:03:34.180> it

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
towards this edge here and then pull it

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.059 
towards this edge here and then pull it
right<00:03:34.449> back<00:03:34.629> down<00:03:34.840> that's<00:03:35.530> probably<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.919> most

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
right back down that's probably the most

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.430 
right back down that's probably the most
basic<00:03:36.489> algorithm<00:03:37.060> you'll<00:03:37.209> need<00:03:37.389> to<00:03:37.510> know<00:03:37.690> here

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
basic algorithm you'll need to know here

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.369 
basic algorithm you'll need to know here
it<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.590> again<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:40.239> lot<00:03:40.449> of<00:03:40.479> algorithms<00:03:41.079> use

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
it is again and a lot of algorithms use

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.339 
it is again and a lot of algorithms use
this<00:03:41.620> simple<00:03:42.720> concept<00:03:43.720> here<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.049> from<00:03:44.169> the

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
this simple concept here it is from the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.490 
this simple concept here it is from the
left<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:45.220> here<00:03:45.400> we<00:03:45.489> go<00:03:45.519> the<00:03:45.940> corners<00:03:46.299> off<00:03:47.199> to

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
left so here we go the corners off to

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.379 
left so here we go the corners off to
the<00:03:47.590> left<00:03:47.799> hand<00:03:48.040> side<00:03:48.129> the<00:03:48.940> colors<00:03:49.269> are

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
the left hand side the colors are

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.879 
the left hand side the colors are
opposite<00:03:49.930> because<00:03:50.019> red<00:03:50.290> is<00:03:50.319> opposite<00:03:50.799> of

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
opposite because red is opposite of

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.180 
opposite because red is opposite of
green<00:03:51.129> it's<00:03:51.729> above<00:03:52.060> where<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.209> needs<00:03:52.419> to<00:03:52.540> go

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
green it's above where it needs to go

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.069 
green it's above where it needs to go
pair<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.220> up<00:03:54.400> pair<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.239> lights<00:03:55.419> and<00:03:55.720> move<00:03:55.959> it

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
pair it up pair the lights and move it

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.530 
pair it up pair the lights and move it
down<00:03:57.000> all<00:03:58.000> right<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.209> might<00:03:58.389> have<00:03:58.510> noticed

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
down all right you might have noticed

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.469 
down all right you might have noticed
that<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:59.049> didn't<00:03:59.409> mention<00:03:59.560> me<00:03:59.829> algorithms<00:04:00.479> for

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
that I didn't mention me algorithms for

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.780 
that I didn't mention me algorithms for
these<00:04:02.019> cases<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.799> the<00:04:02.979> reason<00:04:03.129> for<00:04:03.310> that<00:04:03.459> is

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
these cases and the reason for that is

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.629 
these cases and the reason for that is
if<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.629> learn<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:04.870> algorithms<00:04:05.709> it's<00:04:06.010> it's<00:04:06.489> a

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
if you learn the algorithms it's it's a

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.819 
if you learn the algorithms it's it's a
good<00:04:06.849> thing<00:04:07.060> but<00:04:07.780> it'll<00:04:08.049> take<00:04:08.229> you<00:04:08.379> longer<00:04:08.650> to

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
good thing but it'll take you longer to

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.920 
good thing but it'll take you longer to
learn<00:04:09.159> the<00:04:09.370> algorithms<00:04:09.939> if<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.419> just<00:04:10.659> kind<00:04:10.870> of

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
learn the algorithms if you just kind of

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.869 
learn the algorithms if you just kind of
look<00:04:11.259> at<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.470> pieces<00:04:11.919> and<00:04:12.099> just<00:04:12.159> kind<00:04:12.819> of

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
look at the pieces and just kind of

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.899 
look at the pieces and just kind of
memorize<00:04:13.409> where<00:04:14.409> they<00:04:14.650> go<00:04:14.889> and<00:04:14.919> how<00:04:15.430> they<00:04:15.669> move

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
memorize where they go and how they move

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.300 
memorize where they go and how they move
it'll<00:04:16.299> be<00:04:16.389> a<00:04:16.419> lot<00:04:16.750> easier<00:04:16.989> for<00:04:17.349> you<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.769> perform

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
it'll be a lot easier for you to perform

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.050 
it'll be a lot easier for you to perform
these<00:04:18.729> moves<00:04:19.060> especially<00:04:20.019> when<00:04:20.139> it<00:04:20.259> comes<00:04:20.440> to

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
these moves especially when it comes to

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.610 
these moves especially when it comes to
algorithms<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.240> have<00:04:22.360> like<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:22.779> left<00:04:23.110> version

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
algorithms that have like a left version

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.830 
algorithms that have like a left version
and<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.889> right<00:04:24.610> version<00:04:24.820> because<00:04:25.510> a<00:04:25.570> lot<00:04:25.810> of

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
and a right version because a lot of

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.620 
and a right version because a lot of
them<00:04:26.050> are<00:04:26.169> really

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
them are really

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.140 
them are really
similar<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.290> really<00:04:28.280> they're<00:04:28.760> not<00:04:28.790> any

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
similar and really they're not any

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.910 
similar and really they're not any
different<00:04:29.330> it's<00:04:29.780> just<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.200> is<00:04:30.500> performed

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
different it's just that is performed

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.640 
different it's just that is performed
from<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.730> different<00:04:32.360> side<00:04:32.540> so<00:04:32.870> it's<00:04:33.410> more

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
from a different side so it's more

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.190 
from a different side so it's more
important<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.340> think<00:04:34.550> to<00:04:35.030> look<00:04:35.540> and<00:04:35.720> see<00:04:36.020> where

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
important I think to look and see where

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.350 
important I think to look and see where
the<00:04:36.320> pieces<00:04:36.710> move<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:37.130> how<00:04:37.310> they<00:04:37.580> move<00:04:37.760> rather

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
the pieces move and how they move rather

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.380 
the pieces move and how they move rather
than<00:04:38.690> just<00:04:38.960> memorizing<00:04:39.640> random<00:04:40.640> algorithms

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
than just memorizing random algorithms

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.380 
than just memorizing random algorithms
with<00:04:41.690> random<00:04:42.110> turns<00:04:42.760> okay<00:04:43.760> well<00:04:44.000> that's<00:04:44.120> it

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
with random turns okay well that's it

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.960 
with random turns okay well that's it
for<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.840> first<00:04:45.200> video<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:46.010> know<00:04:46.430> that<00:04:46.700> I<00:04:46.730> had

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
for the first video I know that I had

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.340 
for the first video I know that I had
some<00:04:47.150> really<00:04:47.270> basic<00:04:47.450> stuff<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:47.990> this<00:04:48.110> video

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
some really basic stuff in this video

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.710 
some really basic stuff in this video
but<00:04:48.560> don't<00:04:48.770> worry<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.340> more<00:04:49.910> advanced<00:04:50.450> parts

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
but don't worry the more advanced parts

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.960 
but don't worry the more advanced parts
will<00:04:50.960> come<00:04:51.260> later<00:04:51.550> like<00:04:52.550> I've<00:04:52.730> said<00:04:52.760> before

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
will come later like I've said before

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.690 
will come later like I've said before
i'm<00:04:53.570> going<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:53.990> go<00:04:54.170> over<00:04:54.200> all<00:04:54.710> of<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:55.250> PLL

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
i'm going to go over all of the PLL

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.910 
i'm going to go over all of the PLL
cases<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.300> there<00:04:56.390> are<00:04:56.570> a<00:04:56.600> lot<00:04:56.930> of<00:04:56.960> them<00:04:57.290> so<00:04:57.890> i

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
cases and there are a lot of them so i

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.040 
cases and there are a lot of them so i
just<00:04:58.190> wanted<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.550> get<00:04:58.640> some<00:04:58.850> easy<00:04:59.060> ones<00:04:59.210> out<00:04:59.990> of

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
just wanted to get some easy ones out of

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.500 
just wanted to get some easy ones out of
the<00:05:00.230> way<00:05:00.470> if<00:05:01.010> you<00:05:01.400> like<00:05:01.580> this<00:05:01.610> video<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.150> want
