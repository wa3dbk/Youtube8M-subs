 if he's fabien here that returns one more 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.240
 the question of the agricultural model 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.490
 French face the competition tonight 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.730
 we stop on a battle committed 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.429
 in the sum a giant farm a farm 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.420
 factory that can accommodate 1000 cows is 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.949
 being born 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.960
 that's 20 times more than the average of 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.160
 French operations the project 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.939
 looks like huge facilities 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.699
 German 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.119
 it arouses an outcry 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.220
 laurence of cherves wolf krikorian this 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.399
 giant shed half out of the ground 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.200
 it's a barn more than 200 meters from 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.840
 long for a thousand dairy cows 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.590
 the site will also welcome 750 young people 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.030
 cattle a first in France 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 worried this waterfront takes us into his 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.660
 plane or even from above this factory to 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.789
 cow as he calls it the biggest 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.160
 farm of the hexagon is built 600 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.309
 meters from his village 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:58.980
 it's a huge farmhouse 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.050
 each cow to the saga and each as 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.760
 him for two years most of 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.090
 inhabitants of the village of dru case in the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.489
 sum 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.890
 protests against the installation of this 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.420
 gigantic breeding thousandvaches his 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.630
 twenty-two thousand liters of milk a day 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.400
 20 times more than the average in France 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.350
 the pasture the cows will stay at 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.710
 the year in these hangars for its 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.509
 residents 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.540
 no question of accepting this breeding 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.090
 industrial we are lucky in France we have 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.390
 no intensive breeding in cattle we had 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.040
 with the pig and with the chickens we have 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.950
 having regard to the economic consequences 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.210
 sanitary and their minds we are in 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.829
 doing it today to our 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.270
 doors with cattle 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.860
 but what annoys most is 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.220
 the future installation of the biggest 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.780
 agricultural methanizer from France here the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.790
 excrement of cows but also 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.500
 other waste from elsewhere is 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.420
 fermented to produce a gas 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.490
 methane transformed into electricity 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.460
 is sold to edf at a price 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.530
 subsidized the facility will produce 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.170
 the equivalent of the consumption of 1600 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.939
 xy have an additional risk after 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.329
 the inhabitants of the toilets are 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.320
 major in terms of pollution of 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.030
 the atmosphere 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.130
 because the release of h2s from 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.900
 methanizer if it is poorly controlled under 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.080
 the altar there were deaths in germany 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.790
 him dead in Spain explosion 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 intoxication 32 accidents of the without 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.070
 gravity have also been listed in 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.560
 la France 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.440
 so for two years the demonstrations 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.040
 multiply in the face of opponents have 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.690
 not a farmer but a contractor 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.970
 michel ramery made a fortune in the btp 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.980
 is invested 11 million euros in 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.850
 this farm no reason for him to 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.280
 backtracking 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.720
 not even the degradation of material from 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.560
 site at the last 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.480
 demonstration 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.520
 I'm scared I'm on the ass what 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.430
 so to have the harm we can 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.530
 to make people by jealousy by 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.000
 incomprehension is incredible what 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.739
 I tell you this is me I am a 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.420
 entrepreneur and I will continue I 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.830
 I'll go all the way 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.239
 investor was inspired by the 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.370
 German farms 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.620
 here farms of this size are not 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.350
 not rare she shows there stores and her 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.400
 son pupil 1700 cows divided into 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.650
 five large buildings 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.390
 no outlet in the open and a 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.430
 production of 50 thousand liters of milk 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.900
 every day the milking parlor 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.630
 it's very modern, running at full speed 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.820
 like a factory his account and the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.540
 biogas, which represents 20% of the 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.880
 turnover 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.090
 an asset for these breeders that offsets 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.350
 thus milk prices are often too low 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.910
 but in the French agricultural world 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.329
 this vision of industrial farming 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.980
 divides franÃ§oise treaty is rather for 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.600
 with this giant farm it's 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.130
 insurance for her that the industry 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.230
 dairy stays in her area 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.180
 at a time when breeders put the key 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.079
 under the door the big fear is 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.739
 that the tools go settle 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.260
 elsewhere 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.760
 either in brittany or germany or 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.959
 in belgium but not at home when 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.480
 you say the tools What is ben 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.950
 it's cooperatives tools for 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.840
 transform to make yogurts and 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.930
 cheeses finally here it is all that the 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.850
 sylvain tools wacquez is against for 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.320
 industrial oil use the 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.360
 subsidies from the agricultural world for 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.640
 produce a maximum of low-end 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.320
 with only 15 room to but there are some 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.269
 families who will leave their land that 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.160
 are going to leave the small dairy producer 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.930
 will be able to live more at the price where 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.430
 Mr. Ramery will be able to produce his 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.040
 small the job of the peasants it stings 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.030
 the dreams of young farmers and especially 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.329
 I think it's described billy this 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.609
 job this agribusiness will it be it 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.650
 tomorrow's largest dairy farm 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.610
 of France she should start to 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.610
 produce in the spring
