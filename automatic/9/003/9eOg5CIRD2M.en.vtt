just going to start off with the bang if

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.770 
just going to start off with the bang if
you<00:01:23.820> take<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.740> old<00:01:25.740> laptop<00:01:26.220> battery<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
you take a old laptop battery and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
you take a old laptop battery and
dismantle<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> battery<00:01:28.380> end<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:30.979> six<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
dismantle the battery end up with six to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.630 
dismantle the battery end up with six to
nine<00:01:33.020> decent-sized<00:01:34.020> cells<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:35.250> buy<00:01:35.460> these

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
nine decent-sized cells you buy these

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.219 
nine decent-sized cells you buy these
are<00:01:35.790> feeb<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.119> buy<00:01:37.020> these<00:01:37.369> computer<00:01:38.369> shop

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
are feeb a buy these computer shop

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.749 
are feeb a buy these computer shop
these<00:01:40.229> were<00:01:40.530> secondhand<00:01:41.130> batteries<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
these were secondhand batteries and

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.389 
these were secondhand batteries and
they're<00:01:42.090> still<00:01:42.299> good<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.200> once<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.310> strip

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
they're still good so once you strip

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.490 
they're still good so once you strip
them<00:01:44.549> apart<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.360> solder<00:01:46.200> them<00:01:46.320> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
them apart you can solder them in

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.679 
them apart you can solder them in
parallel<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.939> over<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:48.899> we<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.079> eight

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
parallel and over here we have eight

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.080 
parallel and over here we have eight
laptop<00:01:51.689> battery<00:01:52.140> cells<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.680> parallel<00:01:53.340> there

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
laptop battery cells in parallel there

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.560 
laptop battery cells in parallel there
are<00:01:54.979> 2,000<00:01:55.979> million<00:01:56.369> power<00:01:56.579> each<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.180> eight

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
are 2,000 million power each so eight

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.200 
are 2,000 million power each so eight
here<00:01:57.869> makes<00:01:58.170> sixteen<00:01:58.860> thousand<00:01:59.460> milliamp

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
here makes sixteen thousand milliamp

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.539 
here makes sixteen thousand milliamp
hour<00:02:00.479> or<00:02:01.259> 16<00:02:01.950> amps<00:02:02.329> 16<00:02:03.329> amps<00:02:03.659> at<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.899> hour<00:02:04.079> so

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
hour or 16 amps 16 amps at one hour so

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.210 
hour or 16 amps 16 amps at one hour so
so<00:02:05.479> if<00:02:05.780> we<00:02:08.050> these<00:02:09.050> are<00:02:09.259> just<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.619> in<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:10.009> pack

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
so if we these are just in a in a pack

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.910 
so if we these are just in a in a pack
for<00:02:10.459> another<00:02:11.209> project<00:02:11.390> but<00:02:12.230> we<00:02:12.739> have

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
for another project but we have

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.860 
for another project but we have
basically<00:02:13.459> just<00:02:13.580> Dean<00:02:14.300> techniques<00:02:14.629> coming

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
basically just Dean techniques coming

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.660 
basically just Dean techniques coming
out<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.260> switch<00:02:16.810> but<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:18.080> order<00:02:18.379> to<00:02:18.560> be<00:02:19.519> able

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
out and a switch but in order to be able

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.280 
out and a switch but in order to be able
to<00:02:19.760> charge<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.959> sales<00:02:21.230> themselves<00:02:21.799> and<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
to charge this sales themselves and the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.080

appliance or or piece of equipment you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.339 
appliance or or piece of equipment you
want<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.299> charge<00:02:26.510> then<00:02:26.989> you're<00:02:27.110> going<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.260> have

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
want to charge then you're going to have

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.949 
want to charge then you're going to have
to<00:02:27.700> increase<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.970> voltage<00:02:29.090> from<00:02:29.450> three<00:02:29.720> point

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959

is<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:20.120> fuse<00:03:21.049> is<00:03:21.200> gone<00:03:21.380> pop<00:03:21.650> anyway<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:22.489> that

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
is the fuse is gone pop anyway so that

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.530 
is the fuse is gone pop anyway so that
one<00:03:22.850> was<00:03:23.030> no<00:03:23.420> good<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:23.930> with<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:25.540> instead

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
one was no good so with that and instead

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.949 
one was no good so with that and instead
what<00:03:26.870> I've<00:03:26.959> come<00:03:27.079> up<00:03:27.139> with<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:28.750> separate<00:03:29.750> box

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
what I've come up with is a separate box

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.170 
what I've come up with is a separate box
let's<00:03:30.769> let<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.040> camera<00:03:31.310> focus<00:03:33.819> there<00:03:34.819> we<00:03:34.910> go<00:03:35.060> a

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
let's let the camera focus there we go a

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.890 
let's let the camera focus there we go a
separate<00:03:35.900> box<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:37.489> hold<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:37.940> electronics

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
separate box and to hold the electronics

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.670 
separate box and to hold the electronics
now<00:03:39.560> it's<00:03:39.920> going<00:03:40.099> to<00:03:40.130> have<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.690> USB<00:03:41.690> in<00:03:44.019> two<00:03:45.019> USB

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
now it's going to have a USB in two USB

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.580 
now it's going to have a USB in two USB
outs<00:03:46.030> from<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.450> cheap<00:03:48.049> cable<00:03:48.440> from<00:03:48.590> Pearland<00:03:48.910> so

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
outs from a cheap cable from Pearland so

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.979 
outs from a cheap cable from Pearland so
plus<00:03:51.590> then<00:03:51.829> there<00:03:52.099> and<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:53.150> just<00:03:53.239> need<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.599> find

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
plus then there and I just need to find

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.759 
plus then there and I just need to find
a<00:03:54.169> suitable<00:03:54.769> connector<00:03:55.430> for<00:03:55.849> the<00:03:56.139> battery<00:03:57.139> so

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
a suitable connector for the battery so

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.710 
a suitable connector for the battery so
once<00:03:57.950> this<00:03:58.040> is<00:03:58.099> finished<00:03:58.370> this<00:03:59.239> is<00:03:59.419> just<00:03:59.630> going

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
once this is finished this is just going

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.819 
once this is finished this is just going
to<00:03:59.780> sit<00:03:59.959> on<00:04:00.019> top<00:04:00.169> of<00:04:00.230> that<00:04:00.410> with<00:04:00.560> a<00:04:00.590> bit<00:04:00.739> of

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
to sit on top of that with a bit of

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.890 
to sit on top of that with a bit of
velcro<00:04:00.980> aren't<00:04:01.940> too<00:04:02.060> fast<00:04:02.299> because<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:02.750> got

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
velcro aren't too fast because I got

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.460 
velcro aren't too fast because I got
plans<00:04:03.250> for<00:04:04.599> some<00:04:05.599> other<00:04:05.720> circuit<00:04:06.079> boards<00:04:06.349> to

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
plans for some other circuit boards to

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.920 
plans for some other circuit boards to
do<00:04:06.560> other<00:04:06.739> different<00:04:07.040> things<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.750> won't

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
do other different things so won't

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.379 
do other different things so won't
bother<00:04:09.079> me<00:04:09.319> too<00:04:09.440> much<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:09.889> you<00:04:10.880> can<00:04:11.030> separate

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
bother me too much that you can separate

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.080 
bother me too much that you can separate
them<00:04:11.569> or<00:04:11.829> yeah<00:04:12.829> dismantle<00:04:13.340> them<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.850> it<00:04:13.940> might

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
them or yeah dismantle them and it might

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.460 
them or yeah dismantle them and it might
even<00:04:14.209> mean<00:04:14.419> that<00:04:14.449> I<00:04:14.570> can<00:04:14.750> have<00:04:14.900> one<00:04:15.109> charge

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
even mean that I can have one charge

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.909 
even mean that I can have one charge
washing<00:04:15.919> one<00:04:16.370> eye

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
washing one eye

washing one eye
and<00:04:19.999> Wi-Fi<00:04:20.999> uncharged<00:04:21.719> I<00:04:21.959> mean<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.319> bought<00:04:22.949> two

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
and Wi-Fi uncharged I mean I bought two

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.980 
and Wi-Fi uncharged I mean I bought two
other<00:04:23.490> circuit<00:04:23.939> boards<00:04:24.180> here<00:04:24.330> which<00:04:24.539> allow<00:04:24.810> me

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
other circuit boards here which allow me

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.469 
other circuit boards here which allow me
to<00:04:25.050> charge<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.860> cells<00:04:28.860> set<00:04:29.430> up<00:04:29.610> as<00:04:30.180> they<00:04:30.449> are

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
to charge the cells set up as they are

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.869 
to charge the cells set up as they are

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
without having the USB out so I might be

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.839 
without having the USB out so I might be
able<00:04:32.999> to<00:04:33.060> do<00:04:33.210> something<00:04:33.569> with<00:04:33.689> these<00:04:33.810> later<00:04:34.529> on

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
able to do something with these later on

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.920 
able to do something with these later on
so<00:04:35.849> I'm<00:04:35.909> just<00:04:35.969> going<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.300> click<00:04:36.659> this<00:04:36.749> up
