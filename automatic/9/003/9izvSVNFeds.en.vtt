one<00:00:00.240> of<00:00:00.329> the<00:00:00.390> things<00:00:00.599> that's<00:00:00.780> important<00:00:01.199> in

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290 
one of the things that's important in

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.080 
one of the things that's important in
dentistry<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.399> ability<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.850> give<00:00:03.060> a

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
dentistry is the ability to give a

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.019 
dentistry is the ability to give a
painless<00:00:03.600> injection<00:00:04.400> recently<00:00:05.400> over<00:00:05.940> the

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
painless injection recently over the

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.730 
painless injection recently over the
last<00:00:06.210> six<00:00:06.450> months<00:00:06.839> I've<00:00:06.960> been<00:00:07.109> using<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.589> new

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
last six months I've been using a new

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.470 
last six months I've been using a new
technique<00:00:08.160> where<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.760> anesthetic<00:00:09.360> is

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
technique where the anesthetic is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.350 
technique where the anesthetic is
buffered<00:00:10.110> with<00:00:10.320> sodium<00:00:11.070> bicarbonate<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.880> tell

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
buffered with sodium bicarbonate to tell

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.910 
buffered with sodium bicarbonate to tell
you<00:00:12.480> honestly<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.960> wasn't<00:00:13.200> even<00:00:13.410> aware<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.679> it

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
you honestly I wasn't even aware that it

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.730 
you honestly I wasn't even aware that it
used<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.160> buffer<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.700> procedure<00:00:15.179> was<00:00:16.049> not<00:00:16.410> as

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
used to buffer the procedure was not as

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.730 
used to buffer the procedure was not as
uncomfortable<00:00:17.699> as<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.570> was<00:00:18.750> expecting<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
uncomfortable as I was expecting the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.130 
uncomfortable as I was expecting the
buffering<00:00:20.100> procedure<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.240> dr.<00:00:21.600> Gordon<00:00:21.900> used

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
buffering procedure that dr. Gordon used

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.560 
buffering procedure that dr. Gordon used
really<00:00:22.680> minimized<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.699> feeling<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.240> that

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
really minimized the feeling of that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.109 
really minimized the feeling of that
initial<00:00:25.050> pinprick<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.490> he<00:00:26.550> used<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.880> inject

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
initial pinprick that he used to inject

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.670 
initial pinprick that he used to inject
the<00:00:27.269> novocaine<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.019> really<00:00:28.349> didn't<00:00:28.650> even

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the novocaine so I really didn't even

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
the novocaine so I really didn't even
know<00:00:29.039> when<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:29.849> being<00:00:30.029> injected<00:00:30.390> with

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
know when I was being injected with

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.870 
know when I was being injected with
novocaine<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.349> begin<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.949> kept<00:00:32.759> going

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
novocaine to begin with I kept going

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.910 
novocaine to begin with I kept going
that<00:00:33.210> was<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.630> really<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.260> was<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.710> it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
that was it really that was it that it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.490 
that was it really that was it that it
wasn't<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.399> bad<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:37.170> weren't<00:00:37.290> especially

and we're going to be using a local

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.240 
and we're going to be using a local
anesthetic<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> buffer<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.719> have

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
anesthetic with a buffer so we have

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.779 
anesthetic with a buffer so we have
Rebecca<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.879> she's<00:00:54.379> loading<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.800> buffer

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
Rebecca here she's loading the buffer

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
Rebecca here she's loading the buffer
pen<00:00:57.120> them<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.170> Brian<00:00:58.590> today<00:00:58.800> we're<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.939 
pen them for Brian today we're going to
use<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.789> stronger<00:01:00.480> topical<00:01:01.050> gel<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.859> he

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
use the stronger topical gel so he

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.590

comfortable one of the things we do is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.999 
comfortable one of the things we do is
we<00:01:23.700> warm<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.390> local<00:01:24.689> anesthetic<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
we warm up the local anesthetic so you

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.120 
we warm up the local anesthetic so you
see<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.729> anesthetic<00:01:27.420> warmers<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.140> now<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
see the anesthetic warmers here now you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.060 
see the anesthetic warmers here now you
see<00:01:29.579> Rebecca<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.470> loading<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
see Rebecca is going to be loading the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.450 
see Rebecca is going to be loading the
sodium<00:01:32.520> bicarbonate<00:01:33.350> into<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> pen<00:01:34.710> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
sodium bicarbonate into the pen to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.510 
sodium bicarbonate into the pen to
buffer<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.479> anesthetic<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.950> does<00:01:38.220> is

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
buffer the anesthetic what this does is

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.160 
buffer the anesthetic what this does is
it<00:01:38.670> reduces<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.240> sting<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.659> anesthetic

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it reduces the sting of the anesthetic

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.889 
it reduces the sting of the anesthetic
and<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.979> makes<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.579> anesthetic<00:01:42.119> work<00:01:42.360> faster

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
and it makes the anesthetic work faster

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.990 
and it makes the anesthetic work faster
you<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.530> me<00:01:43.740> loading<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> syringe<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.729> put<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you see me loading the syringe I put the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.429 
you see me loading the syringe I put the
topical<00:01:45.479> gel<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.930> Brian

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
topical gel on Brian

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.080 
topical gel on Brian
now<00:01:47.189> we're<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> give<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> painless

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
now we're going to give a painless

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.270 
now we're going to give a painless
injection<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.530> buffered<00:01:50.070> lidocaine<00:01:52.280> now

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
injection with buffered lidocaine now

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
injection with buffered lidocaine now
what<00:01:53.430> we're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.470> we're<00:01:55.470> going<00:01:55.590> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.020 
what we're going to do is we're going to
wait<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.310> anesthetic<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.850> take<00:01:56.880> effect

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
wait for the anesthetic to take effect
