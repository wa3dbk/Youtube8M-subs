00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
like it's human hair to me this is

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.890 
like it's human hair to me this is
something<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.140> I<00:04:11.290> do<00:04:12.180> with<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.390> lot<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.780> my

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
something that I do with a lot of my

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.880 
something that I do with a lot of my
synthetic<00:04:14.380> hair

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
synthetic hair

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.479 
synthetic hair
I<00:04:14.920> have<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.790> that's<00:04:16.209> why<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:17.650> lasts<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:18.220> lot

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
I have and that's why it lasts a lot

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.690 
I have and that's why it lasts a lot
longer<00:04:18.780> than<00:04:19.780> that<00:04:20.500> most<00:04:21.100> hair<00:04:21.430> does

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
longer than that most hair does

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.910 
longer than that most hair does
sometimes<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.420> also<00:04:22.750> do<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.140> with<00:04:23.260> my<00:04:23.470> human

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
sometimes I also do it with my human

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.370 
sometimes I also do it with my human
hair<00:04:24.100> but<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.280> see<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.550> do<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:25.150> do<00:04:25.390> it<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.750> lot<00:04:26.080> more

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
hair but I see I do I do it a lot more

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.850 
hair but I see I do I do it a lot more
with<00:04:27.130> my<00:04:27.160> synthetic<00:04:28.090> hair<00:04:28.300> so<00:04:28.570> that<00:04:29.140> it<00:04:29.410> can

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
with my synthetic hair so that it can

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.190 
with my synthetic hair so that it can
last<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.670> lot<00:04:31.180> longer
