00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 I am very happy with what 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.290
 they did guys first of all because 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:13.259
 have created expectations 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:17.180
 important towards the fans towards the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.800
 society and to the whole world why 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.140
 no one could have expected the milan 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.600
 went to play the game of back to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.609
 barcelona with two goals ahead and 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.820
 with the qualification up to two minutes 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.329
 from the end still open so it is not 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.739
 been and sorry there was a lot 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.980
 displeasure when we returned for 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.050
 now the team already from Wednesday 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.129
 let's say from Thursday he's thinking about that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.739
 which is the goal of this one of this 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.910
 season than that seen above all 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.320
 how we started looking for 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.289
 play the champions league a year 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.570
 next through the preliminary all 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.370
 direct access to second place and not 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.899
 it will be absolutely easy because they are there 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.250
 six teams and it also puts us in Rome 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.590
 they will fight to the end for this 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.890
 blessed second and third place because 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.530
 I believe that now I don't want it 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.320
 juventus is with you I believe that by now the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.020
 championship is a closed speech 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.320
 and with this I want to make the best 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:30.299
 wishes to count the juventus because they are 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.619
 the only Italian team that will fight 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.700
 to try to bring in Italy a 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:41.549
 most coveted trophy at European level 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.380
 right now talk about my future 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.259
 it makes absolutely no sense because I repeat 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.229
 I have a contract with Milan and I mean 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.619
 respect it and then in the eventuality there 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.840
 was something on my part aside 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.430
 to the company if it were from me the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.259
 the first to know it would be the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.600
 company because I have relationship views that I have 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.700
 presidents that with Galliani and aside 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.290
 of society that is opposite but I believe 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.090
 which right now is the thing 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.259
 main is to be 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.160
 focus on what the goal is 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.160
 that must be achieved
