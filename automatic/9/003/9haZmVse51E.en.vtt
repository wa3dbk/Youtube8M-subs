00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.610
 19 out with my parents and to 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.849
 It was also a pleasure for her 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.889

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 a progressive lifestyle 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 that means for us that one should be just 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.550
 own life lives its own feelings 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.170

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.969
 So dividing society remains 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.579
 not demarcates if you are different 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.290
 but different and yet fine 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.329
 society remains stupid we are too 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.370
 strong against the separation of gay 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.329
 and hetero but we all see each other 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.950

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.710
 situation come 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.570

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.080
 Received because in school 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.610
 Men put on something for the market 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.979
 with the target group also sought 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.710
