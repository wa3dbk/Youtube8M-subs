display it's fairly easy to hold in a
hand<00:00:14.730> although<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.450> find<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.080> long

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
hand although I find that for long

hand although I find that for long
periods<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.160> holding<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.270> edges<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
periods of holding the edges are a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.759 
periods of holding the edges are a
little<00:00:19.109> bit<00:00:19.699> more<00:00:20.699> likely<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.090> push<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.660> here

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
little bit more likely to push in here

little bit more likely to push in here
palm<00:00:22.769> than<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.130> would<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> little

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
palm than I would like so it's a little

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.800 
palm than I would like so it's a little
bit<00:00:24.029> more<00:00:24.090> comfortable<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.539> hold<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.779> two

bit more comfortable to hold with two

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.990 
bit more comfortable to hold with two
hands<00:00:25.199> than<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.680> another<00:00:26.490> thing<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.910> I've

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
hands than one another thing that I've

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.429 
hands than one another thing that I've
noticed<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.689> power<00:00:27.900> button<00:00:28.289> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
noticed is that the power button is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.769 
noticed is that the power button is
located<00:00:28.619> here<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> way<00:00:29.429> at<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> bottom

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
located here all the way at the bottom

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.179 
located here all the way at the bottom
in<00:00:30.779> such<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> way<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.650> hold<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> like

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
in such a way that if you hold it like

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.580 
in such a way that if you hold it like
this<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.329> might<00:00:33.630> accidentally<00:00:34.320> hit<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
this you might accidentally hit the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.500 
this you might accidentally hit the
power<00:00:34.800> button<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.340> turn<00:00:35.969> off<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> screen<00:00:36.420> you

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
power button and turn off the screen you

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.180

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
have to press pretty hard so it's not

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.220 
have to press pretty hard so it's not
too<00:00:38.550> likely<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.910> happen<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.270> if<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.629> want<00:00:40.110> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.729 
avoid that problem there's a pretty
simple<00:00:42.570> solution<00:00:42.989> which<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.559> turn

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
simple solution which is just to turn

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.740 
simple solution which is just to turn
the<00:00:43.890> device<00:00:44.010> over<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.210> power<00:00:45.360> button<00:00:45.629> is

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the device over and the power button is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.139 
the device over and the power button is
suddenly<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> top<00:00:46.559> not<00:00:47.340> all<00:00:47.550> applications

suddenly at the top not all applications
will<00:00:48.300> run<00:00:48.480> properly<00:00:48.750> upside-down<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
will run properly upside-down but the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.889 
will run properly upside-down but the

experience of reading the print edition
of<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.030> magazine<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.720> text<00:04:20.440> is<00:04:20.590> really

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
of the magazine and the text is really

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.740 
of the magazine and the text is really
tiny<00:04:21.370> here<00:04:21.669> so<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:21.880> looks<00:04:22.030> very<00:04:22.210> nice<00:04:22.390> but<00:04:22.450> you

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
tiny here so it looks very nice but you

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.590 
tiny here so it looks very nice but you
can't<00:04:22.990> really<00:04:23.140> read<00:04:23.350> it<00:04:23.500> unless<00:04:23.650> you

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
can't really read it unless you

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.980 
can't really read it unless you
zoom<00:04:25.720> in<00:04:26.500> by<00:04:27.010> tapping<00:04:27.310> or<00:04:27.730> pinching<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.330> then

you<00:04:29.440> sort<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.680> have<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.830> scroll<00:04:30.280> in<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.580> kind<00:04:30.820> of

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
you sort of have to scroll in a kind of

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.820 
you sort of have to scroll in a kind of
awkward<00:04:31.300> way<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.570> get<00:04:32.140> from<00:04:32.260> one<00:04:32.440> part<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.740> the

portrait mode but you don't get quite
the<00:04:49.570> effect<00:04:50.230> that<00:04:50.320> you<00:04:50.470> should<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.950> the

the effect that you should and the

the effect that you should and the
