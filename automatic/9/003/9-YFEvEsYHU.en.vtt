00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that's normal I know there's been a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.740 
that's normal I know there's been a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
bigger push toward saying that every

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
course needs to make profit but I think

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.190 
course needs to make profit but I think
you<00:01:35.369> need<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.640> look<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> long-term<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you need to look to the long-term and I

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.929 
you need to look to the long-term and I
think<00:01:37.409> also<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.979> shouldn't<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.460> focus<00:01:38.520> this

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939

a<00:02:06.810> sense<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:07.290> could<00:02:07.469> say<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.039> led<00:02:08.700> by

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
a sense we could say that this is led by

a sense we could say that this is led by
market<00:02:09.420> forces<00:02:09.450> isn't<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.470> mean<00:02:10.500> students

really the problem and I think your

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.980 
really the problem and I think your
initial<00:02:21.700> comment<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.150> right<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.630> is<00:02:22.750> to

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
initial comment is right that it is to

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.810 
initial comment is right that it is to
an<00:02:23.080> extent<00:02:23.350> market<00:02:23.770> lead<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.640> course

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
an extent market lead and of course

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.100 
an extent market lead and of course
universities<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.600> country<00:02:25.660> are

universities in this country are
market-led<00:02:26.590> businesses<00:02:27.160> there's<00:02:27.820> also<00:02:27.970> a

market-led businesses there's also a

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.850 
market-led businesses there's also a

strong element of University politics in

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.070 
strong element of University politics in
this<00:02:29.980> every<00:02:30.760> University<00:02:31.300> course<00:02:31.540> has<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.930> pay

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
this every University course has to pay

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.260 
this every University course has to pay
its<00:02:32.200> own<00:02:32.350> way<00:02:32.590> but<00:02:33.340> every<00:02:33.580> university<00:02:34.060> course

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
its own way but every university course

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.240 
its own way but every university course
it's<00:02:34.510> with<00:02:34.630> a<00:02:34.660> department<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:36.070> each

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
it's with a department and each

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.040 
it's with a department and each
department<00:02:36.760> has<00:02:36.850> its<00:02:37.030> allocation<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.630> costs

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
department has its allocation of costs

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.990 
department has its allocation of costs
and<00:02:38.140> many<00:02:38.860> courses<00:02:39.250> find<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.820> if<00:02:39.880> they

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
and many courses find that if they

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.130 
and many courses find that if they
change<00:02:40.270> from<00:02:40.360> one<00:02:40.600> department<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:41.080> another

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
change from one department to another

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.500 
change from one department to another
their<00:02:41.980> allocation<00:02:42.490> of<00:02:42.550> costs<00:02:42.850> changes<00:02:43.300> and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
their allocation of costs changes and

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.360 
their allocation of costs changes and
that<00:02:43.930> would<00:02:44.050> certainly<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.560> case<00:02:44.740> of<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
that would certainly be the case of the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.710 
that would certainly be the case of the
textile<00:02:45.700> conservation<00:02:45.820> center<00:02:46.540> and

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
textile conservation center and

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.540 
textile conservation center and
certainly<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.470> takes<00:02:47.710> on<00:02:47.860> private<00:02:48.190> clients

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
certainly it takes on private clients

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.130 
certainly it takes on private clients
doesn't<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:48.910> one<00:02:49.060> wonders<00:02:49.420> if<00:02:49.510> it's<00:02:49.660> if<00:02:50.050> it's

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
doesn't it one wonders if it's if it's

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.110 
doesn't it one wonders if it's if it's
helping<00:02:50.560> out<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:51.130> getty<00:02:51.430> museum<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.060> the

helping out the getty museum and the
british<00:02:52.480> museum<00:02:52.530> why<00:02:53.530> isn't<00:02:53.890> there<00:02:53.980> more

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040

some<00:02:57.790> sympathy<00:02:58.030> with<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.330> University

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
some sympathy with the University

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.870 
some sympathy with the University
because<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.740> teaching<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.100> conservation<00:03:00.700> is

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
because the teaching of conservation is

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.030 
because the teaching of conservation is
very<00:03:01.120> expensive<00:03:01.330> but<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.530> return<00:03:02.740> to<00:03:02.800> what

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
very expensive but to return to what

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.740 
very expensive but to return to what
