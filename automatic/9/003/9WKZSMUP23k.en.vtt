angle<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.730> let's<00:00:21.240> get<00:00:21.359> started<00:00:21.980> alright<00:00:22.980> so

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
angle so let's get started alright so

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.200 
angle so let's get started alright so
the<00:00:23.430> first<00:00:23.640> thing<00:00:23.850> we're<00:00:24.030> going<00:00:24.120> to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the first thing we're going to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.870 
the first thing we're going to
demonstrate<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.440> flood<00:00:25.770> stroke<00:00:26.190> I'm

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
demonstrate is the flood stroke I'm

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.610 
demonstrate is the flood stroke I'm
going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> point<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.540> that<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.350> a<00:00:28.380> white

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
going to point out that we have a white

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.710 
going to point out that we have a white
shirt<00:00:28.860> on<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.250> flattened<00:00:29.610> we're<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.600> to<00:00:30.660> go

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
shirt on the flattened we're going to go

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.170 
shirt on the flattened we're going to go
ahead<00:00:30.780> and<00:00:30.930> lower<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.200> screen<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:32.059> when<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
ahead and lower the screen and when you

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.740 
ahead and lower the screen and when you
are<00:00:33.329> flooding<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> screen<00:00:34.379> you<00:00:35.219> are<00:00:35.250> just

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
are flooding the screen you are just

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.600 
are flooding the screen you are just
lightly<00:00:36.750> drawing<00:00:37.530> ink<00:00:37.739> across<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.400> screen

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
lightly drawing ink across the screen

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.450 
lightly drawing ink across the screen
just<00:00:39.000> enough<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.570> cover<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> design<00:00:40.530> but

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
just enough to cover the design but

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.130 
just enough to cover the design but
you're<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.730> actually<00:00:42.270> pushing<00:00:42.720> anything

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you're not actually pushing anything

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.520 
you're not actually pushing anything
through<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.860> there's<00:00:44.040> no<00:00:44.250> print<00:00:44.640> yet<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.690> ink

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
through see there's no print yet the ink

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.580 
through see there's no print yet the ink
is<00:00:46.739> loaded<00:00:47.489> into<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.120> mesh<00:00:48.630> sort<00:00:49.290> of<00:00:49.380> speak

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
is loaded into the mesh sort of speak

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.240 
is loaded into the mesh sort of speak
that<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.970> flood<00:00:51.180> stroke<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.070> just

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that is the flood stroke so you just

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
that is the flood stroke so you just
need<00:00:53.399> enough<00:00:53.640> pressure<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.480> draw<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
need enough pressure just to draw the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.889 
need enough pressure just to draw the
ink<00:00:55.380> and<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.399> small<00:00:56.640> bead<00:00:56.880> across<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.540> opening

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
ink and a small bead across the opening

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.180 
ink and a small bead across the opening
of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.140> design<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:59.520> good<00:00:59.940> way<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:01.010> figure<00:01:02.010> it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
of the design a good way to figure it

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.920 
of the design a good way to figure it
out<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.640> practice<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:03.719> there

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
out is just practice just go out there

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.469 
out is just practice just go out there
get<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.259> a<00:01:04.290> couple<00:01:04.589> blank<00:01:04.860> shirts<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.479> give

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
get you a couple blank shirts and give

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.639 
get you a couple blank shirts and give
it<00:01:06.540> some<00:01:06.659> practice<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> takes<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.439> little<00:01:07.530> bit

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
it some practice it takes a little bit

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.520 
it some practice it takes a little bit
of<00:01:08.509> practice<00:01:09.509> but<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.109> get<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.289> hang<00:01:10.380> of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
of practice but you can get the hang of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
of practice but you can get the hang of
it<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:11.069> all<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.759> need<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.030> enough<00:01:12.270> pressure

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
it just all you need is enough pressure

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.440 
it just all you need is enough pressure
to<00:01:13.380> fill<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.399> mesh<00:01:14.609> you're<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.270> actually

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
to fill the mesh you're not actually

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.879 
to fill the mesh you're not actually
pushing<00:01:16.109> the<00:01:16.229> ink<00:01:16.439> through<00:01:18.229> all<00:01:19.229> right<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:19.889 
pushing the ink through all right so

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:22.069 
pushing the ink through all right so
that<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.459> the<00:01:20.969> flood<00:01:21.299> stroke<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.840> screen

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
that is the flood stroke for screen

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.590 
that is the flood stroke for screen
printing<00:01:22.249> it's<00:01:23.249> not<00:01:23.459> always<00:01:23.850> required<00:01:24.359> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
printing it's not always required to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.160 
printing it's not always required to
flood<00:01:24.920> but<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.069> does<00:01:26.359> help<00:01:27.359> create<00:01:27.929> a<00:01:27.959> better

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
flood but it does help create a better

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.559 
flood but it does help create a better
print<00:01:28.469> sometimes<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.880> water<00:01:30.060> bass<00:01:30.270> you

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
print sometimes and for water bass you

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:31.929 
print sometimes and for water bass you
definitely<00:01:30.990> want<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.229> flood<00:01:31.469> the<00:01:31.560> screen

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
definitely want to flood the screen

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.370 
definitely want to flood the screen
water-based<00:01:32.939> ink<00:01:33.209> will<00:01:33.359> dry<00:01:33.719> in<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> screen

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
water-based ink will dry in the screen

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.639 
water-based ink will dry in the screen
if<00:01:34.529> there's<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.869> nothing<00:01:36.869> covering<00:01:37.139> the<00:01:37.319> design

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
if there's a nothing covering the design

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.429 
if there's a nothing covering the design
let<00:01:38.279> fly<00:01:38.459> so<00:01:38.520> solve<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.450> not<00:01:39.599> going<00:01:39.749> to<00:01:39.810> draw

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
let fly so solve it's not going to draw

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.719 
let fly so solve it's not going to draw
on<00:01:40.499> the<00:01:40.649> screen<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.579> always

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
on the screen so it's not always

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.910 
on the screen so it's not always
necessary<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> flood<00:01:42.599> the<00:01:42.689> screen<00:01:42.959> but<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.679> can

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
necessary to flood the screen but it can

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.980 
necessary to flood the screen but it can
give<00:01:44.099> you<00:01:44.219> a<00:01:44.279> better<00:01:44.429> print<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.779> kind<00:01:45.959> of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
give you a better print so just kind of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.050 
give you a better print so just kind of
a<00:01:46.079> preference<00:01:46.499> there<00:01:46.679> but<00:01:46.889> that's<00:01:47.069> that's<00:01:47.849> how

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
a preference there but that's that's how

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.889 
a preference there but that's that's how
you<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.560> just<00:01:49.560> take<00:01:49.709> your<00:01:49.859> squeegee<00:01:50.899> draw

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
you do it just take your squeegee draw

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.809 
you do it just take your squeegee draw
it<00:01:52.020> back<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.979> enough<00:01:53.159> pressure<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.549> cover

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
it back just enough pressure to cover

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.999 
it back just enough pressure to cover
the<00:01:53.999> design<00:01:54.119> there<00:01:54.740> that's<00:01:55.740> our<00:01:56.039> flood<00:01:56.429> stroke

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
the design there that's our flood stroke

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.899 
the design there that's our flood stroke
alright<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.219> now<00:01:59.340> we're<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.609> to<00:01:59.700> go<00:01:59.789> ahead

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
alright so now we're going to go ahead

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.479 
alright so now we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:00.270> move<00:02:00.419> on<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.799> demonstrating<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.159> print

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.489 
and move on to demonstrating the print

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:06.260 
and move on to demonstrating the print
stroke<00:02:03.169> you<00:02:04.169> can<00:02:04.499> either<00:02:04.919> pull<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.819> squeegee

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
stroke you can either pull the squeegee

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.820 
stroke you can either pull the squeegee
or<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:07.560> can<00:02:07.709> push<00:02:07.889> it<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.630> I<00:02:09.630> prefer<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.470> push<00:02:10.649> it

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
or you can push it I I prefer to push it

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.580 
or you can push it I I prefer to push it
just<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.580> requires<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.390> lot<00:02:12.630> less<00:02:12.870> pressure<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
just it requires a lot less pressure and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.200 
just it requires a lot less pressure and
it's<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.490> lot<00:02:14.670> less

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
it's a lot less

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.960 
it's a lot less
tension<00:02:17.210> on<00:02:17.330> my<00:02:17.360> arms<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.830> we<00:02:19.430> have<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.730> screen

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970

whole lot of pressure because you're

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
through the design for water base you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.440 
through the design for water base you
want<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.160> go<00:03:25.280> with<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.550> little<00:03:25.850> bit<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.330> know

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
want to go with a little bit you know

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.690 
want to go with a little bit you know
less<00:03:26.720> than<00:03:26.900> 45<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.620> more<00:03:27.920> pressure<00:03:28.220> because

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
less than 45 and more pressure because

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.729 
less than 45 and more pressure because
water<00:03:29.180> base<00:03:29.360> you're<00:03:29.660> actually<00:03:30.050> forcing<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
water base you're actually forcing the

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.060 
water base you're actually forcing the
ink<00:03:30.950> into<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.850> shirt<00:03:32.090> places<00:03:33.080> all<00:03:33.260> sets<00:03:33.920> on

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
ink into the shirt places all sets on

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.670 
ink into the shirt places all sets on
top<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.000> requires<00:03:35.390> less<00:03:35.720> pressure<00:03:36.050> water

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
top so it requires less pressure water

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.400 
top so it requires less pressure water
base<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.489> actually<00:03:38.360> goes<00:03:38.510> into<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.989> shirt<00:03:39.170> so

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
base it actually goes into the shirt so

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.040 
base it actually goes into the shirt so
it<00:03:39.470> requires<00:03:39.800> more<00:03:40.160> pressure<00:03:40.570> all<00:03:41.570> right<00:03:41.750> so

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
it requires more pressure all right so

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.470 
it requires more pressure all right so
that's<00:03:42.260> some<00:03:42.590> common<00:03:43.040> squeegee<00:03:43.970> angles<00:03:44.300> for

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
that's some common squeegee angles for

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.690 
that's some common squeegee angles for
