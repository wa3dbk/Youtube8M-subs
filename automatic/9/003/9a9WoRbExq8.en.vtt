it to so I decided you know what this is

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.410 
it to so I decided you know what this is
an<00:01:11.440> unlimited<00:01:11.920> resource<00:01:12.520> project<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.179> will

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
an unlimited resource project I will

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.180 
an unlimited resource project I will
spend<00:01:13.690> as<00:01:13.810> much<00:01:13.960> money<00:01:14.020> as<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.560> need<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.950> get

spend as much money as I need to get

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.340 
spend as much money as I need to get
this<00:01:15.250> have<00:01:15.550> some<00:01:15.729> be<00:01:15.880> perfect<00:01:16.300> so<00:01:16.929> what<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.170> did

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
this have some be perfect so what I did

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.630 
this have some be perfect so what I did
with<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.560> other<00:01:17.619> one<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:18.009> I<00:01:18.190> put<00:01:18.369> it<00:01:18.460> through<00:01:18.610> a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
with the other one is I put it through a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.279 
with the other one is I put it through a
stress<00:01:18.970> test<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.569> see<00:01:19.750> what<00:01:19.869> it<00:01:19.990> would<00:01:20.050> take<00:01:20.259> to

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
stress test to see what it would take to

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.570 
stress test to see what it would take to
destroy<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:21.039> and<00:01:21.159> to<00:01:21.759> see<00:01:22.830> what<00:01:23.830> withstand

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
destroy it and to see what withstand

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.969 
destroy it and to see what withstand
what<00:01:24.940> how<00:01:25.240> just<00:01:26.049> how<00:01:26.140> strong<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.619> fish<00:01:26.799> and

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
what how just how strong the fish and

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.999 
what how just how strong the fish and
glue<00:01:27.100> was<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:27.909> that's<00:01:28.090> now<00:01:28.360> in<00:01:28.390> pieces<00:01:29.110> but<00:01:29.770> I

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
glue was so that's now in pieces but I

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.430 
glue was so that's now in pieces but I
have<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.520> exact<00:01:30.909> measurement<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.959> do<00:01:32.110> it<00:01:32.259> all

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
have the exact measurement to do it all

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.649 
have the exact measurement to do it all
over<00:01:32.470> again<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.039> to<00:01:33.880> add<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.240> piece<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.450> I

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
over again and to add the piece that I

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.459 
over again and to add the piece that I
wanted<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:35.799> I<00:01:36.159> have<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.659> barrel<00:01:38.110> the

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
wanted to so I have the barrel the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.480 
wanted to so I have the barrel the
trigger<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:39.490> clip<00:01:39.759> blocks<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:41.200> catch<00:01:41.409> and<00:01:41.770> a

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
trigger the clip blocks the catch and a

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.779 
trigger the clip blocks the catch and a
couple<00:01:42.969> other<00:01:43.180> things<00:01:43.329> for<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.200> LEDs<00:01:44.799> that

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
couple other things for the LEDs that

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.779 
couple other things for the LEDs that
I'm<00:01:46.360> keeping<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.780> same<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.340> go<00:01:48.490> over<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
I'm keeping the same now to go over the

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:55.499 
I'm keeping the same now to go over the
shell<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.500> finish<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:52.859> but<00:01:53.859> I<00:01:54.359> don't<00:01:55.359> really

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509

probably end up selling the shell but
it's<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:24.670> good<00:02:24.880> show<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.870> just<00:02:26.079> not<00:02:26.230> what<00:02:26.320> I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410

intelligent

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.350 

alright<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.980> sad<00:02:35.850> part<00:02:36.210> is<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.690> spent<00:02:37.140> maybe

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
alright so the sad part is I spent maybe

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.600 
alright so the sad part is I spent maybe
at<00:02:39.360> least<00:02:39.990> 12<00:02:40.680> hours<00:02:40.890> on<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:42.150> shell<00:02:42.450> like

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
at least 12 hours on this shell like

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.210 
at least 12 hours on this shell like
pure<00:02:44.610> labor<00:02:45.030> hours<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.810> now<00:02:46.530> I'm<00:02:46.710> essentially

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
pure labor hours and now I'm essentially

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.400 
pure labor hours and now I'm essentially
getting<00:02:47.580> rid<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.570> that's<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.960> this<00:02:49.200> is

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
getting rid of it so that's that this is

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.270 
getting rid of it so that's that this is
my<00:02:49.940> headphones<00:02:50.940> case<00:02:51.320> that's<00:02:52.320> disappointing

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
my headphones case that's disappointing

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.280 
my headphones case that's disappointing
I<00:02:53.610> spend<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.210> lot<00:02:54.240> of<00:02:54.390> time<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.810> breach<00:02:55.020> but

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290

I spend a lot of time on the breach but
I'm<00:02:55.410> not<00:02:55.620> sad<00:02:55.920> about<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.730> because<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.300> broke

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.060 
I'm not sad about that because I broke
that<00:02:57.600> by<00:02:57.900> choice<00:02:58.200> because<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.680> wanted<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:58.920> see

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
that by choice because I wanted to see

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.260 
that by choice because I wanted to see
what<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.220> would<00:02:59.370> take<00:02:59.580> because<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.000> knew<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.210> was

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
what it would take because I knew it was

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.340 
what it would take because I knew it was
going<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.480> rebuild<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.900> anyway<00:03:01.170> um<00:03:01.410> as<00:03:03.260> many<00:03:04.260> of

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.060 
and remaking the shell for this super
shot<00:04:30.540> so<00:04:31.080> I'm<00:04:31.169> making<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.560> exactly<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.010> same

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
shot so I'm making it exactly the same

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.490 
shot so I'm making it exactly the same
way<00:04:32.250> as<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.669> but<00:04:32.940> I'm<00:04:33.060> going<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.270> use<00:04:33.510> a

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
way as this but I'm going to use a

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.110 
way as this but I'm going to use a
better<00:04:34.890> paints<00:04:35.310> on<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.729> you<00:04:35.790> would<00:04:35.910> spend

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
better paints on it and you would spend

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.659 
better paints on it and you would spend
more<00:04:36.390> time<00:04:36.630> sanding<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.650> washing<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.340> first

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
more time sanding and washing it first

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.100 
more time sanding and washing it first
and<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.890> I<00:04:41.330> just<00:04:42.330> don't<00:04:42.510> like<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.840> way<00:04:42.960> this

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
and I I just don't like the way this

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.810 
and I I just don't like the way this

cement<00:06:07.230> it<00:06:07.350> into<00:06:07.680> place<00:06:07.950> so<00:06:08.250> this<00:06:08.430> handle

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
cement it into place so this handle

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.250 
cement it into place so this handle
isn't<00:06:09.030> freestanding<00:06:09.480> it's<00:06:09.810> actually<00:06:10.110> got<00:06:10.230> a
