that's<00:00:04.740> out<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:05.970> was<00:00:06.330> not<00:00:06.359> expecting<00:00:06.950> I

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
that's out that I was not expecting I

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.879 
that's out that I was not expecting I
don't<00:00:08.220> even<00:00:08.370> know<00:00:08.550> what<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.679> titles<00:00:10.679> I

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
don't even know what it is the titles I

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.549 
don't even know what it is the titles I
got<00:00:11.340> my<00:00:11.490> sister<00:00:11.700> pressed<00:00:12.150> it<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.420> says<00:00:12.719> Super

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
got my sister pressed it it says Super

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.300 
got my sister pressed it it says Super
Smash<00:00:13.679> Bros<00:00:14.040> 4<00:00:14.340> Wii<00:00:14.370> U<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.730> 3ds<00:00:15.109> red<00:00:16.109> blue<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
Smash Bros 4 Wii U and 3ds red blue and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.200 
Smash Bros 4 Wii U and 3ds red blue and
yellow<00:00:18.050> so<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.740> prediction<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:20.670> what<00:00:21.029> this

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
yellow so my prediction for what this

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.380 
yellow so my prediction for what this
might<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.660> I'm<00:00:21.960> thinking<00:00:22.430> well<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.760> says<00:00:24.150> red

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
might be I'm thinking well it says red

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.700 
might be I'm thinking well it says red
and<00:00:24.539> blue<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.109> yellow

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and blue and yellow

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.279 
and blue and yellow
so<00:00:26.070> maybe<00:00:26.369> I'm<00:00:26.910> trying<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.359> think<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.720> what

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
so maybe I'm trying to think of what

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.620 
so maybe I'm trying to think of what
characters<00:00:28.830> are<00:00:28.859> those<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.880> mean

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
characters are those I mean

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.840 
characters are those I mean
Pikmin<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.619> maybe<00:00:31.890> it's<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.189> new<00:00:32.309> Pikmin

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
Pikmin so maybe it's a new Pikmin

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.580 
Pikmin so maybe it's a new Pikmin
because<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:33.510> got<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.809> red<00:00:33.989> blue<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.380> yellow

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
because they got the red blue and yellow

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.430 
because they got the red blue and yellow
Pikmin<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:35.760> thinking<00:00:36.180> maybe<00:00:36.260> then<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
Pikmin so I'm thinking maybe then it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.819 
Pikmin so I'm thinking maybe then it
might<00:00:37.620> be<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:38.270> one<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> new<00:00:39.629> Pikmin<00:00:40.200> like

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
might be like one of the new Pikmin like

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.020 
might be like one of the new Pikmin like
commanders<00:00:41.579> captains<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.450> guess<00:00:42.690> or<00:00:44.030> well

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
commanders captains I guess or well

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.229 
commanders captains I guess or well
there's<00:00:45.719> also<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.200> toads<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.030> they<00:00:48.030> did

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
there's also the toads and they did

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.750 
there's also the toads and they did
release<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.989> captain<00:00:49.469> toad<00:00:49.739> event<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.399> let's

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
release the captain toad event so let's

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.850 
release the captain toad event so let's
