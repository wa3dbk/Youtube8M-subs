00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.996
We're currently at the Ford Heritage Center.

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:28.780
This is actually not a real museam,
as you can see al the cars are wrapped in plastic.

00:00:28.781 --> 00:00:31.268
But, all these cars are ready to go on the road!

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.860
So we currently feel like children with a cookie jar,
as we can take every car that we want for a ride!

00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:43.605
We already made some choices, but one of the most
important cars ever build by Ford, is the T-Ford.

00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:49.390
And I'm gonna find out if this
is a comfortable car to drive...

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:52.708
But first things first,
I have to get some driving instructions,

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:55.421
because driving a T-Ford is nothing
like driving a modern car.

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:18.431
I'm going to try to start it myself, just like former times.
I mean, if mama wanted to do the groceries, somebody had to get it running.

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:31.201
Well, I could have never done this without his help.
It's actually pretty simple,...

00:01:31.202 --> 00:01:42.456
but you have to be careful with placing your thumb,
because if starts, your thumb could land anywhere over there.

00:01:42.457 --> 00:01:43.861
So that might hurt a little.

00:01:43.862 --> 00:01:49.141
I'm now going to drive, but it's really something special.
There are 3 pedals, and the one in the middle is for the reverse.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.359
So I think I could use some guidance.

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:53.887
Can you put your safety belt on?

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:55.709
Safety belt?

00:01:57.126 --> 00:01:58.685
Indicators?

00:01:59.286 --> 00:01:59.854
It's all not here!

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.148
This is a car, but at the same time it's not.
It's very simple, you just miss a lot of things!

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.136
But you can drive it,
which is what I'm going to try next.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:42.900
I have to say, driving this car is really strange and complicated.

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:46.116
To start with the 3 pedals: as mentioned before the
one in the middle is to put the car in the reverse,

00:03:46.117 --> 00:03:50.115
and the one on the right is for the brakes,
which is actually pretty logic.

00:03:50.116 --> 00:03:52.354
Now, the throttle is here, behind the steering wheel.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.642
This was actually the simple part..

00:03:54.643 --> 00:03:58.577
We have a lever here, which is now 
placed in neutral + parking brake.

00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:02.133
I can put the car in low gear,
by putting the lever in the middle.

00:04:13.048 --> 00:04:17.039
Now you try to figure out what you should do to drive in low gear.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.301
Wrong, it's completely the other way around!

00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:20.302
So that's the difficulty of this car, it's really complex.

00:04:20.303 --> 00:04:29.858
But the housewifes in earlier years managed to
go to (super) market with this car.

00:04:29.859 --> 00:04:33.624
So I, as a car journalist, should be able to drive this classic!

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:36.627
I got it, but I have to be honest:
I find it very difficult.

00:04:36.628 --> 00:04:43.709
The funny thing is, this car drives pretty smooth.
It has a very huge engine block with a volume of 2,9L.

00:04:43.744 --> 00:04:49.190
Only 20 HP, but relatively seen, a lot of torque.

00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:51.293
You also have to be careful not to let the engine stall.

00:04:51.328 --> 00:04:59.426
Because you've seen me starting it, and that's exactly what you have to do again:
get out, put everything in place and be careful with your thumb..

00:04:59.827 --> 00:05:01.447
Let's drive some more!

00:05:16.664 --> 00:05:23.993
The T-Ford has been build in many different editions,
as you see we've got a two-seater here.

00:05:23.994 --> 00:05:28.090
And as you can see, there's a special seat for your mother-in-law.

00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:33.029
And the funny thing is, you can put the foldable roof up,
so she's outside in the rain and you're sitting perfectly dry.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.610
You also can't see her, and whatever she says, you won't hear her.
So that's pretty good!

00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:46.187
Thus, a tip for Ford: bring back the special mother-in-law seat!
