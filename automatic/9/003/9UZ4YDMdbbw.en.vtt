Vegemite<00:03:26.280> now<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.460> one<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.700> those<00:03:29.820> things

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
Vegemite now this is one of those things

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.670 
Vegemite now this is one of those things
where<00:03:30.420> if<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.750> didn't<00:03:31.020> grow<00:03:31.170> up<00:03:31.200> with<00:03:31.530> it

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
where if you didn't grow up with it

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.590 
where if you didn't grow up with it
you'll<00:03:32.070> probably<00:03:32.250> never<00:03:32.730> like<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.270> but<00:03:33.450> then

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
you'll probably never like it but then

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.410 
you'll probably never like it but then
again<00:03:33.720> sometimes<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:35.460> do<00:03:35.670> like<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.210> it's

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
again sometimes you do like is it's

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.390 
again sometimes you do like is it's
funny<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.960> the<00:03:37.590> number<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.890> times<00:03:38.010> I've<00:03:38.370> seen

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
funny like the number of times I've seen

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.330 
funny like the number of times I've seen
Americans<00:03:39.410> trying<00:03:40.410> Vegemite<00:03:40.950> for<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.160> first

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
Americans trying Vegemite for the first

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.530 
Americans trying Vegemite for the first
time<00:03:41.550> and<00:03:41.790> they<00:03:41.880> always<00:03:42.240> make<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.450> same

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
time and they always make the same

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.000 
time and they always make the same
mistake<00:03:43.280> they<00:03:44.280> think<00:03:44.520> Vegemite<00:03:45.030> is<00:03:45.060> like

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
mistake they think Vegemite is like

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.650 
mistake they think Vegemite is like
peanut<00:03:47.010> butter<00:03:47.250> or<00:03:47.730> jam<00:03:48.030> or<00:03:48.300> something<00:03:48.330> like

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
that where they'll spread this thick

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.220 
that where they'll spread this thick
layer<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:50.850> toast<00:03:51.209> or<00:03:51.540> sandwiches<00:03:52.050> or

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
layer of it on toast or sandwiches or

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.190 
layer of it on toast or sandwiches or
whatever<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:54.150> bloody<00:03:54.570> horrible<00:03:54.870> when

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
whatever and it's bloody horrible when

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.449 
whatever and it's bloody horrible when
you<00:03:55.320> have<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> lot<00:03:55.650> you've<00:03:55.920> only<00:03:56.070> got<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.340> have

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
you have a lot you've only got to have

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
so I'm just gonna have a little bit on a

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.810 
so I'm just gonna have a little bit on a
spoon<00:04:06.290> hmm<00:04:09.920> it's<00:04:10.920> really<00:04:11.250> hard<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.550> describe

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
spoon hmm it's really hard to describe

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.420 
spoon hmm it's really hard to describe
the<00:04:12.150> flavor

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
the flavor

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.210 
the flavor
it's<00:04:14.430> definitely<00:04:15.360> savory<00:04:16.170> it's<00:04:16.680> got<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:16.980> sort

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
it's definitely savory it's got a sort

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.260 
it's definitely savory it's got a sort
of<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.340> saltiness<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:19.880> it's<00:04:20.880> actually<00:04:21.239> a

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
of a saltiness to it it's actually a

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.590 
of a saltiness to it it's actually a
concentrated<00:04:22.020> yeast<00:04:22.290> extract<00:04:22.890> made<00:04:23.520> from<00:04:23.600> the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
concentrated yeast extract made from the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.270 
concentrated yeast extract made from the
byproducts<00:04:25.140> of<00:04:25.260> beer<00:04:25.440> production

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
byproducts of beer production

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.110 
byproducts of beer production
at<00:04:26.430> least<00:04:26.580> that's<00:04:26.760> how<00:04:26.790> it<00:04:26.910> was<00:04:27.000> originally

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
at least that's how it was originally

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.700 
at least that's how it was originally
made<00:04:27.540> I'm<00:04:27.720> not<00:04:27.870> quite<00:04:28.020> sure<00:04:28.050> if<00:04:28.230> it's<00:04:28.470> still

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
made I'm not quite sure if it's still

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.900 
made I'm not quite sure if it's still
made<00:04:29.100> exactly<00:04:29.610> like<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:30.000> but<00:04:30.750> um<00:04:31.910> it's

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
made exactly like that but um it's

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.430 
made exactly like that but um it's
really<00:04:33.090> hard<00:04:33.420> to<00:04:33.540> describe<00:04:33.780> it's<00:04:34.140> a<00:04:34.230> very

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
really hard to describe it's a very

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.980 
really hard to describe it's a very
unique<00:04:34.800> flavor<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.490> don't<00:04:35.520> think<00:04:35.990> there's

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
unique flavor and I don't think there's

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.240 
unique flavor and I don't think there's
any<00:04:37.200> sort<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:39.890> don't<00:04:40.890> know<00:04:40.950> what<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:41.130> can

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
any sort of I don't know what I can

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.840 
any sort of I don't know what I can
compare<00:04:41.730> it<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.030> so<00:04:43.340> hmm<00:04:44.340> I<00:04:46.490> don't<00:04:47.490> like<00:04:47.670> it

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
compare it to so hmm I don't like it

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.210 
compare it to so hmm I don't like it
