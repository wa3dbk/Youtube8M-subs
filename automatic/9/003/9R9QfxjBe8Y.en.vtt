teaching<00:00:00.690> files<00:00:00.930> can<00:00:01.140> be<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.290> challenge

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
teaching files can be a challenge

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.160 
teaching files can be a challenge
because<00:00:02.120> they<00:00:03.120> are<00:00:03.179> actually<00:00:03.449> somewhat

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
because they are actually somewhat

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.990 
because they are actually somewhat
complicated<00:00:04.710> but<00:00:05.040> for<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.430> operation

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
complicated but for the operation

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.030 
complicated but for the operation
frontline<00:00:06.390> course<00:00:06.750> we<00:00:07.410> really<00:00:07.710> found<00:00:07.859> that

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
frontline course we really found that

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.860 
frontline course we really found that
it's<00:00:08.250> easiest<00:00:08.550> if<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.910> break<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.360> into<00:00:09.599> three

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
it's easiest if you break it into three

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.400 
it's easiest if you break it into three
broad<00:00:10.679> categories<00:00:11.719> just<00:00:12.719> like<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> nutrition

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
broad categories just like the nutrition

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.829 
broad categories just like the nutrition
facts<00:00:13.620> panel<00:00:13.880> this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.089> an<00:00:15.210> area<00:00:15.509> where<00:00:15.630> as<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
facts panel this is an area where as a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.390 
facts panel this is an area where as a
nutritionist<00:00:16.470> you're<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> lot

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
nutritionist you're going to have a lot

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.480 
nutritionist you're going to have a lot
more<00:00:17.539> information<00:00:18.539> then<00:00:19.350> you're<00:00:20.189> really

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
more information then you're really

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.099 
more information then you're really
going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.699> be<00:00:20.850> able<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.210> impart<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.990> your

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
going to be able to impart to your

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.830 
going to be able to impart to your
participants<00:00:22.730> but<00:00:23.730> if<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.150> simplify<00:00:24.630> it

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
participants but if you simplify it

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.480 
participants but if you simplify it
break<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.350> down<00:00:25.590> into<00:00:25.859> these<00:00:26.010> three<00:00:26.310> broad

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
break it down into these three broad

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.640 
break it down into these three broad
categories<00:00:26.869> we've<00:00:27.869> found<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
categories we've found that the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.220 
categories we've found that the
participants<00:00:29.630> grasp<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> knowledge<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
participants grasp the knowledge a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.569 
participants grasp the knowledge a
little<00:00:31.470> bit<00:00:31.590> better<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.070> they're<00:00:32.250> able<00:00:32.369> to

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
little bit better and they're able to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.000 
little bit better and they're able to
work<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.120> it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.980 

when<00:00:37.010> introducing<00:00:37.460> unsaturated<00:00:38.300> fats<00:00:38.690> you

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
when introducing unsaturated fats you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.680 
when introducing unsaturated fats you
can<00:00:39.170> refer<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.560> these<00:00:39.680> as<00:00:39.740> the<00:00:40.040> good<00:00:40.400> fats<00:00:40.730> the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
can refer to these as the good fats the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.740 
can refer to these as the good fats the
easiest<00:00:42.020> way<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.500> we<00:00:42.680> have<00:00:42.890> found<00:00:43.070> to

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
easiest way that we have found to

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.570 
easiest way that we have found to
communicate<00:00:44.750> this<00:00:45.110> idea<00:00:45.470> to<00:00:45.680> participants<00:00:46.280> is

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
communicate this idea to participants is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.570 
communicate this idea to participants is
to<00:00:46.940> have<00:00:47.270> them<00:00:47.480> think<00:00:47.780> of<00:00:48.190> unsaturated<00:00:49.190> or<00:00:49.490> the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
to have them think of unsaturated or the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.270 
to have them think of unsaturated or the
good<00:00:49.730> fats<00:00:50.060> as<00:00:50.330> liquid<00:00:51.290> at<00:00:51.500> room<00:00:51.530> temperature

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
good fats as liquid at room temperature

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.320 
good fats as liquid at room temperature
or<00:00:53.030> as<00:00:53.570> ones<00:00:54.380> that<00:00:54.710> come<00:00:54.920> from<00:00:55.190> plants<00:00:55.460> great

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
or as ones that come from plants great

or as ones that come from plants great
examples<00:00:56.780> are<00:00:56.930> vegetable<00:00:57.470> oils<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.700> olive

examples are vegetable oils and olive
oil<00:00:59.500> this<00:01:00.500> is<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.650> really<00:01:01.010> useful<00:01:01.160> tool<00:01:01.580> for

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
oil this is a really useful tool for

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.280 
oil this is a really useful tool for
participants<00:01:02.390> when<00:01:02.570> they're<00:01:02.690> in<00:01:02.810> the<00:01:02.900> grocery

when they're in the oil aisle which type
of<00:01:07.790> fat<00:01:08.090> they<00:01:08.240> should<00:01:08.420> buy<00:01:08.740> if<00:01:09.740> they<00:01:09.950> see<00:01:10.010> that

saturated<00:01:19.980> fats<00:01:20.190> are<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> bad<00:01:20.850> fats<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.390> we

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
saturated fats are the bad fats that we

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510 
saturated fats are the bad fats that we
refer<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.130> way<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.430> help

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
refer to and the way we help

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.790 
refer to and the way we help
participants<00:01:24.060> remember<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
participants remember these are that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.890 
participants remember these are that
they<00:01:26.040> either<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.850> come<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.240> an<00:01:27.360> animal<00:01:27.450> or

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
they either they come from an animal or

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.530 
they either they come from an animal or
they're<00:01:28.650> solid<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.160> room<00:01:29.190> temperature<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
they're solid at room temperature so the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.300 
they're solid at room temperature so the
examples<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.260> would<00:01:31.380> use<00:01:31.620> our<00:01:31.950> butter

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
examples that we would use our butter

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.570 
examples that we would use our butter
and<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.660> also<00:01:34.350> any<00:01:34.740> type<00:01:34.980> of<00:01:35.010> animal<00:01:35.400> fat

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
and then also any type of animal fat

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.390 
and then also any type of animal fat
like<00:01:35.880> bacon<00:01:36.300> or<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:37.140> skin<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:37.860> chicken

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
like bacon or is the skin on a chicken

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.420 
like bacon or is the skin on a chicken
that's<00:01:38.910> a<00:01:39.120> more<00:01:39.300> solid<00:01:39.570> fat<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.290> again<00:01:41.130> it's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
that's a more solid fat and again it's

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.290 
that's a more solid fat and again it's
something<00:01:41.820> that's<00:01:41.970> going<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.120> help

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
something that's going to help

and as a nutritionist you have a lot
more<00:01:59.150> information<00:01:59.420> on<00:02:00.020> what<00:02:00.050> actually<00:02:00.500> goes

that<00:03:53.450> in<00:03:54.019> general<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:55.130> good<00:03:55.340> fats<00:03:55.610> are<00:03:55.850> the

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
that in general the good fats are the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.450 
that in general the good fats are the
ones<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:56.209> are

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
ones that are

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.580 
ones that are
going<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.730> lower<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.450> bad<00:03:57.690> cholesterol<00:03:58.080> and

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
going to lower that bad cholesterol and

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.230 
going to lower that bad cholesterol and
raise<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.220> good<00:03:59.370> cholesterol<00:03:59.580> and<00:04:00.180> that's

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
raise the good cholesterol and that's

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.680 
raise the good cholesterol and that's
great<00:04:00.930> for<00:04:01.020> their<00:04:01.320> hearts<00:04:02.210> moving<00:04:03.210> on<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.660> the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
great for their hearts moving on to the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.280 
great for their hearts moving on to the
bad<00:04:04.260> fats<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.920> saturated<00:04:05.490> fats<00:04:06.140> along<00:04:07.140> the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
bad fats the saturated fats along the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.620 
bad fats the saturated fats along the
same<00:04:07.500> lines<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:08.280> can<00:04:08.310> think<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:08.850> those<00:04:09.060> as<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
same lines you can think of those as the

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.330 
same lines you can think of those as the
ones<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.020> are<00:04:10.110> solid<00:04:10.560> at<00:04:10.650> room<00:04:10.680> temperature

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
ones that are solid at room temperature

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.680 
ones that are solid at room temperature
and<00:04:11.610> those<00:04:11.760> are<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:11.970> ones<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.300> are<00:04:12.510> going<00:04:12.600> to

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
and those are the ones that are going to

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.690 
and those are the ones that are going to
get<00:04:12.900> stuck<00:04:13.260> in<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.470> arteries<00:04:14.010> stuck<00:04:14.460> in<00:04:14.490> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
get stuck in the arteries stuck in the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.250 
get stuck in the arteries stuck in the
veins<00:04:14.910> and<00:04:15.210> it's<00:04:15.360> going<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.600> be<00:04:15.690> bad<00:04:15.900> for<00:04:16.170> their

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
veins and it's going to be bad for their

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.729 
veins and it's going to be bad for their
heart<00:04:17.150> it's<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.300> nice<00:04:18.420> visualization<00:04:19.020> to

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
heart it's a nice visualization to

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.700 
heart it's a nice visualization to
remember<00:04:20.250> why<00:04:20.430> these<00:04:20.489> fats<00:04:20.880> or<00:04:21.090> bad

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
remember why these fats or bad

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.050 
remember why these fats or bad
additionally<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.890> can<00:04:22.920> talk<00:04:23.310> about<00:04:23.610> how<00:04:23.790> they

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
additionally you can talk about how they

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.780 
additionally you can talk about how they
actually<00:04:24.330> raise<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.260> LDLs<00:04:25.770> raise<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.640> bad

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
actually raise the LDLs raise the bad

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.760 
actually raise the LDLs raise the bad
type<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.270> cholesterol<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.050> again<00:04:28.350> that's<00:04:28.530> bad

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
type of cholesterol so again that's bad

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.040 
type of cholesterol so again that's bad
for<00:04:29.010> their<00:04:29.130> heart<00:04:29.400> and<00:04:29.610> finally<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.600> think<00:04:30.960> to

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
for their heart and finally I think to

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.050 
for their heart and finally I think to
really<00:04:31.260> hit<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.650> point<00:04:31.830> home<00:04:31.950> about<00:04:32.460> how<00:04:32.670> bad

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
really hit the point home about how bad

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.650 
really hit the point home about how bad
trans<00:04:33.510> fats<00:04:33.840> are<00:04:34.140> for<00:04:34.950> heart<00:04:35.220> health<00:04:35.660> it's

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
trans fats are for heart health it's

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.420 
trans fats are for heart health it's
important<00:04:37.200> to<00:04:37.230> refer<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.890> cholesterol

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
important to refer to the cholesterol

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.700 
important to refer to the cholesterol
balance<00:04:39.270> again<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:39.990> fact<00:04:40.230> that<00:04:40.320> trans

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
balance again and the fact that trans

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.920 
balance again and the fact that trans
fats<00:04:41.010> are<00:04:41.580> responsible<00:04:42.150> not<00:04:42.390> only<00:04:42.450> for

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
fats are responsible not only for

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.200 
fats are responsible not only for
raising<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:43.920> bad<00:04:44.160> cholesterol<00:04:44.400> that<00:04:45.060> they

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
raising the bad cholesterol that they

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.880 
raising the bad cholesterol that they
kind<00:04:45.540> of<00:04:45.660> hit<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.990> double<00:04:46.200> whammy<00:04:46.560> of

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
kind of hit the double whammy of

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.370 
kind of hit the double whammy of
lowering<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:48.030> good<00:04:48.180> cholesterol<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:49.020> I

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
lowering the good cholesterol and I

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.040 
lowering the good cholesterol and I
think<00:04:49.680> if<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.010> hit<00:04:50.310> those<00:04:50.670> key<00:04:51.180> messages<00:04:51.750> when

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
think if you hit those key messages when

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.200 
think if you hit those key messages when
talking<00:04:52.320> about<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.860> fats<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.400> participants

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
talking about the fats the participants

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.820 
talking about the fats the participants
are<00:04:54.300> going<00:04:54.570> to<00:04:54.720> take<00:04:54.930> away<00:04:55.200> some<00:04:55.440> important

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
are going to take away some important

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.320 
are going to take away some important
information<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.580> it's<00:04:56.760> information<00:04:57.030> that

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
information and it's information that

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.090 
information and it's information that
they<00:04:57.540> can<00:04:57.690> actually<00:04:57.900> use<00:04:58.410> when<00:04:58.800> they're<00:04:58.980> at

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
they can actually use when they're at

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.920 
they can actually use when they're at
the<00:04:59.250> grocery<00:04:59.610> store<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.030> they're<00:05:00.540> trying<00:05:00.810> to
