00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.200
 for this recipe three easy steps 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.240
 first step the dough 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.460
 second step cooking third 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.450
 stage tasting 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.410
 to make this recipe you will have 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:35.190
 need 360 grams of sugar brown sugar 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:39.030
 220 g softened butter 360 g flour 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.580
 4 '4 pinches of salt 4 pinches of yeast 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.630
 chemical and 160 g of chocolate chips 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.150
 black 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.280
 m 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.880
 we start by abolishing your butter or 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.540
 micron 30 seconds at medium power 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.920
 our softened butter 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:59.700
 we will put it in a salad bowl on 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.600
 add sugar brown sugar and go 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.920
 mix the two we will incorporate the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:21.710
 eggs one after another 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:21.710
 the first and the second the third 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.580
 and the fourth and last run off 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.229
 now incorporate our flour into it 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.040
 years to avoid there being 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.280
 overall, the whole of the 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.280
 family 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.620
 so at that time very important he 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:59.220
 will have to incorporate the flour with the 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:04.479
 hand we add our baking powder 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.020
 our salt and we will make a mixture 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.020
 homogeneous 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.700
 so once you have integrated your 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:22.750
 flour we will add our nuggets 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:25.300
 chocolate then at the mill to the costs that 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.040
 will take a plate that will pass 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.010
 baked with parchment paper on 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.030
 and we will train with the help of two 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.890
 spoons so if you have a 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.090
 ice cream scoop it will be even better on 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.250
 was waiting for little balls and we're going 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.230
 ask little balls like that on 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.519
 your plate then it's a technique 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.160
 which comes straight from the united states in 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.600
 France we flatten cookies and when 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.220
 they come out of the oven hills we know that at 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.620
 united states and poses balls and we're going 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.300
 let the cookies flatten in the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.730
 oven and you will see the result really 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.810
 really different bring us closer 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.890
 too much your cookies so he can 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.120
 take their place during the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:06.220
 baking our plate in an oven 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.260
 preheated to 180 Â° for six to seven 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.390
 minutes we will go out our cooking 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.310
 still and looked at results 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.150
 so to be able to unmould 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.439
 easily sail under it so our costs 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.819
 who can there be seven minutes 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.069
 the relatively white color 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.110
 do not be afraid the cake is supple 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.040
 So we will certainly not taste 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.780
 immediately we will leave it well 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.909
 cool so you'll see the result 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.340
 is really impressive you will 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.349
 a side melting inside the 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.230
 crunchy on the sides so we go 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.900
 let cool on the plate itself 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.159
 take off all by itself so leave 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.099
 to cool a cookie we end up all 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.810
 immediately for dressage our costs which 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.579
 are now ready perfect for the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.420
