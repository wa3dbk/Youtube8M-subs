feel<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:28.920> you're<00:00:29.160> short<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.429> time<00:00:29.699> or<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.390> it

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
feel like you're short of time or is it

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.139 
feel like you're short of time or is it
something<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.260> once<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.520> while<00:00:32.730> or

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
something that you do once in a while or

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.670 
something that you do once in a while or
how<00:00:33.300> long<00:00:33.480> they're<00:00:33.690> always<00:00:34.050> short<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.440> time

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
how long they're always short of time

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.860 
how long they're always short of time
but<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.010> think<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.790> find<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.239> time<00:00:36.510> to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
but I think we have to find the time to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.319 
but I think we have to find the time to
you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.350> teach<00:00:37.829> them<00:00:38.010> how<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.160> cook<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.850> make

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
pasta you will probably see they're a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.319 
pasta you will probably see they're a
little<00:00:59.039> bit<00:00:59.280> II<00:00:59.309> don't<00:00:59.550> need<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.059> seed

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
little bit II don't need all this seed

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.540 
little bit II don't need all this seed
out<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.170> kind<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.530> clean<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.340> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
out so we can kind of clean it up a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.860 
out so we can kind of clean it up a
little<00:01:02.579> bit<00:01:02.969> we're<00:01:03.300> gonna<00:01:03.390> cook<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
little bit we're gonna cook it with a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.969 
little bit we're gonna cook it with a
little<00:01:03.989> bit<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.290> olive<00:01:04.500> oil

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
little bit of olive oil

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.460 
little bit of olive oil
I<00:01:05.150> prefer<00:01:06.150> olive<00:01:06.299> oil<00:01:06.570> instead<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> butter<00:01:06.990> I

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
I prefer olive oil instead of butter I

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.760 
I prefer olive oil instead of butter I
think<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.340> way<00:01:08.460> healthier<00:01:08.909> even<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.420> kids

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
think it's way healthier even for kids

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.080 
think it's way healthier even for kids
so<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.159> case<00:01:11.369> we'll<00:01:11.580> chop<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.909> up<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
so in this case we'll chop it up a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.609 
so in this case we'll chop it up a
little<00:01:12.210> bit<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.689> we'll<00:01:12.869> saute<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.470> on

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
little bit and then we'll saute it on

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:23.270 
little bit and then we'll saute it on
the<00:01:13.740> pan<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.460> bit<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.729> onions<00:01:22.250> No

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the pan with a little bit of onions No

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.910 
the pan with a little bit of onions No
so<00:01:23.759> yeah<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.080> make<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> little

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so yeah what I do is I I make a little

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.499 
so yeah what I do is I I make a little
cross<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> tomatoes<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.210> eyeball

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
cross on the tomatoes and then eyeball

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.870 
cross on the tomatoes and then eyeball
it<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.049> few<00:01:28.290> minutes<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.460> helps

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it for just few minutes so that helps

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.789 
it for just few minutes so that helps
peel<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.360> tomatoes<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.380> don't<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.680> any

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
peel the tomatoes so you don't have any

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.800 
peel the tomatoes so you don't have any
skin<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> tomato<00:01:32.640> sauce<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.479> usually

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
skin on the tomato sauce and usually

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.910 
skin on the tomato sauce and usually
kids<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> little<00:01:34.560> picky<00:01:34.860> about

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
kids you know the little picky about

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.460 
kids you know the little picky about

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
this Keane about the green stuff so then

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:54.260 
this Keane about the green stuff so then
makes<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:52.159> that's<00:01:53.159> why<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.700> sinks<00:01:54.119> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
makes it that's why we have sinks and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.090 
makes it that's why we have sinks and
water<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.930> wash<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.170> out<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:01.320> very<00:02:01.710> watery

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
