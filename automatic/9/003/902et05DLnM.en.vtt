Hello. I'm Yukkuri.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.900
I'll sing this song

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.600
Then, everyone, listen carefully

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'll give you love, love, right away

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.000
so stay by my side, ok?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.500
I'll love, love, so satisfy me

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.300
right away, okay?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.900
Ah...

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.000
Because I'll give you love, love, right away

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.500
in 36℃

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.400
Love, love, that love, so

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.100
show me right away, okay?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.100
Shining voice blooms again far away in the ocean.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.100
Voice flies wildly about

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.400
cherry blossom colors again.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.100
Aah, mysterious disk falls.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.100
Does you tailwind pause in the night?

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.400
Love, love, everything

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.400
scatters smoke in the blooming night.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.100
Aah, mysterious disk falls in the night.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.600
Does you tailwind pause in the night?

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.100
Love, love shines far away

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.600
Words on the beach, your voice.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.100
How was it�
