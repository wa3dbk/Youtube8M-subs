00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 and that when due to this new video 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.710
 social means in the cinema 4d and 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.600
 well after quite a long time 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.940
 and a long time I am 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.490
 with many things in mind work and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.490
 more things with the study but good 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.520
 Now I come back to teach them quickly 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.190
 how to insert a mode in your animation 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.570
 in this case it will be a brother like 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.570
 I will always leave the link of the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.690
 the king's link in the description and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.300
 good sorry that opened unintentionally 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.680
 but in this case it will be internal then 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.590
 what they have to do to open is 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.240
 double click 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.400
 to minimize and in the cinema 4d they are 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.950
 will open this good just have to give it 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.840
 click here where it says in brothers a 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.970
 double click and the character will open 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.280
 totally good here there is not much that 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.870
 teach since surely they will already be 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.829
 very familiar with what they should 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.570
 make the kings 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.519
 good 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.950
 First of all, nothing that we are going to 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.330
 start with the interface here in this 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.120
 section and there it is 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.980
 here in this part it says and that serves 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.380
 to move the eyes as you see 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.440
 they move their eyes hungry serves this 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.800
 it serves to open the eyes the kisses in 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.830
 mouth while 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.170
 more increase the percentage here more open 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.820
 mouth 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.850
 in the law who this also 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.590
 find here in this part that for 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.450
 what does it do to make linderman tremble 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.729
 for example here we will run the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.710
 frames as you see it looks small 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.050
 mind that trembles but if we take it away 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.680
 here 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.250
 in this part we steel we no longer 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.250
 trembles 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.719
 so 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.789
 the last almost last to explain 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.820
 what is viver hayden for? 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.280
 disappear the enema as they see when ticking 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.719
 disappears the remove returns but good 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.820
 he was wondering how do I do 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.289
 teleport a good German by 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.050
 example let's suppose that your animation 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.050
 run to frame 20 then what 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.380
 what we do is here where teleport says 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.380
 explorer gives you a right click animation 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.030
 add keyframe and go to the 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.370
 frame if they want very fast to the 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.880
 teleportation go I recommend 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.670
 in 10 to 15 frames and if you want very 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.849
 slow you get it to be 20 pictures 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.950
 but I 'm going to give you right now 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.290
 the 10 frames good as they are 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.920
 here they went here to tele by the cloud 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.870
 they give him a 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.420
 they give him to add keyframe they give 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.660
 here where 10 frames from 20 to 30 in 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.490
 my house and totally increase this as 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.850
 see in the motto is falling apart 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.530
 and there totally teleports from 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.330
 animation add keyframe 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.180
 then what would animation 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.370
 run run run slowly and 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.790
 there starts to 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.410
 disappear and well that 's all that 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.350
 you can teach 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.760
 about the king the envelope of the german yes 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.440
 have any questions do not forget 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.060
 let me know in the comments and 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.790
 before I forget how he moves 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.690
 feet and other things well that's very 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.680
 simple 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.159
 but they have to go here where it says 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.549
 the control forgiveness and give him ryan is the 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.500
 right arm of left arm 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.300
 right leg and left leg by 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.470
 example the right arm 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.030
 and move them the way you 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.040
 Well surely they will be 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.860
 familiar and is that you know many 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.610
 tutorials how to do to move a 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.340
 arm but 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.680
 if I will not explain them quickly 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.340
 how to move for example we are here in 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.849
 one frame 20 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.040
 then frame 5 we are going to put 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.230
 here where it says to record active objects 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.490
 giving always click here to arm 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.480
 straight 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.480
 see here then 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.310
 what the brother will do 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.519
 raise the arm then in this position 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.190
 will last and give you here where it says 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.720
 that all assets recorded animation 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.720
 when rendering, it would be this way 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.030
 and there is teleported and good everything 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.879
 this is so and if you have any questions not 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.620
 forget to leave me nothing in the comments 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:36.550
 and on my facebook page that also 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.889
