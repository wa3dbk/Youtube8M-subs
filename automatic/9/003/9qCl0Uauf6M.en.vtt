00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.349
 As they say 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.799
 one day a woman will 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.799
 to change his life forever 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.050
 we had no idea 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.269
 but I did not dare 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.439
 I think 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.439
 just like him six weeks ago 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.439
 by Bernd RaffelhÃ¼schen 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.410
 Michael Seme 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.070
 presented larger 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.050
 for that she is mistaking me for somebody 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.000
 the short-term do not know what that means only a few people on 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.980
 the world have this ability 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.870
 and you are stranded 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.010
 it's crazy 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.020
 it is 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
 that the foundations lead the mission 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 determine so far 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.380
 we are a brotherhood of children 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.790
 as so sang 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.380
 The Brotherhood has been forming for thousands of years 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.440
 we have everything we need 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 almost everyone thought of doing something different that time 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.130
 always free 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130
 is normal 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.480
 the activation 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.480
 that's why we kick 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.230
 the Dutch
