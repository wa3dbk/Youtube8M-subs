00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.080
 when you lose weight was the difference between losing fat or 

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:06.240
 we will lose 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.240
 Below we explain 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.860
 when a person loses weight for example he says he lost 10 kilos of 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:24.519
 weight 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.529
 those ten kilos of weight do not necessarily correspond this 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.849
 specifically body fat 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.760
 It may also be that this person loses muscle mass and can also 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.500
 lose body water 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.870
 because these changes occur at the level of body composition in terms of 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.370
 good weight loss when a person takes for example a diet 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.570
 balanced 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.750
 and maintains an adequate level of proteins that level of proteins 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.170
 adequate diet that will protect us times baltar loss of mass 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.050
 muscular 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.610
 also when the person loses weight only by dieting it is possible that 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.140
 lose more proportion of muscle than grace and how can we avoid that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.780
 not as Pablo said nava amount of protein in the diet 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.540
 but also still in the physical activity to stimulate the production or 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.140
 the development of muscle mass 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.510
 another very important aspect that is that when the person on a diet 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.330
 balanced physical activity partner the proportion of fat that is lost can 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.230
 be up to 80% and the school passage rate of only 20% 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.720
 Whenever you lose weight you can lose muscle mass 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.950
 but we try to make the treatment in a balanced framework 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.369
 possible for the amount of muscle that is lost 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.340
 and why are you so important to protect this tissue from muscle mass 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.990
 is to say that when you lose weight you do not lose muscle mass this is 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.230
 extremely important because the muscle is the main determinant of 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.480
 past metabolism of a person 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.980
 so that if I have a bad muscle mass or metabolism is going to be more 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.970
 fast and if I lose muscle mass my metabolism thus effectively attend
