00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.510
 that a people like rehearsed I am ryder here 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.879
 back with another new map then 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.010
 good as they asked me yesterday here is 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.660
 the map that you can 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.820
 unlock most of the achievements that 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.650
 we have now as you know in this new 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.590
 update as they have added us 30 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.539
 achievements more and well this is the map that I 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.789
 have been asking in the latter 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.130
 videos that you have uploaded and I hope that 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.420
 serve them good to me they served me and they go to 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.539
 see in the video that if I am 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.629
 unlocking but there is one thing that does not 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:40.600
 I know why this happened is that as the 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.090
 I was unlocking bone when I was going 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.290
 doing every achievement does not show me in the 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.880
 screen like that our and 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.920
 unlocking or it's like it's already 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.530
 unlocked but when I went to 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.450
 achievements section and they were 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.790
 unlocked I do not know why it does not jump 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.430
 the message on the little screen and that says 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.050
 makes is unlocked achievement but good 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.030
 the important thing is that if it works they go to 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.399
 see in the video that this is how it works 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.829
 showing from time to time that the 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.390
 achievements are being unlocked because 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.000
 I recorded this video just when 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.270
 I was unlocking 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.820
 and nothing people I hope that serves them I know 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.010
 which is more exciting to do playing 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.200
 already in survival plan not this way of this 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.550
 way but there are people who asked me and 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.220
 I brought them here, I try to 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.020

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.210
