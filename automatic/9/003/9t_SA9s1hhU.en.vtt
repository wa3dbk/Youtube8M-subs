again
this<00:00:39.030> time<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.390> put<00:00:39.600> Stickles<00:00:40.140> around<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.690> just

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.270 
a very thin line as Stickles around the
bottle<00:00:45.300> cap<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.320> they

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
actually took off the other term I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.830 
actually took off the other term I
thought<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.590> really<00:00:52.620> didn't<00:00:53.219> need<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
thought it really didn't need it so I

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
thought it really didn't need it so I
did<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.680> today<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:56.610> smaller

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
did that one today it's a little smaller

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
did that one today it's a little smaller
a<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:57.660> bit<00:00:57.780> different<00:00:58.199> snowmen<00:00:58.770> but

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
a little bit different snowmen but

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.340 
a little bit different snowmen but
they're<00:00:59.550> super<00:01:00.030> cute<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.449> love<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.809> blue<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
they're super cute I love the blue and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.090 
they're super cute I love the blue and
then<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> did<00:01:02.520> another<00:01:02.870> Santa<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.890> one's

then I did another Santa and this one's

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.880 
then I did another Santa and this one's
a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.220> different<00:01:05.760> too<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.689> didn't<00:01:07.650> have

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
a little different too I I didn't have

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.580 
a little different too I I didn't have
any<00:01:08.280> big<00:01:10.549> what<00:01:11.549> are<00:01:11.580> they<00:01:11.760> called<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.270> a

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
any big what are they called like a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.950 
any big what are they called like a
spacer<00:01:13.590> bead<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> bead<00:01:14.369> cap<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:15.390> go<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.720> top

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
spacer bead or a bead cap to go on top

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.940 
spacer bead or a bead cap to go on top
so<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.950> took<00:01:17.250> my<00:01:17.310> Martha<00:01:18.240> Stewart

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
so I just took my Martha Stewart

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.620 
so I just took my Martha Stewart
snowflake<00:01:19.950> stamp<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.670> stamped<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.479> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
snowflake stamp and just stamped this is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.440 
snowflake stamp and just stamped this is
actually<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.140> cardstock<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:24.060> put<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
actually just cardstock and I put the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.800 
actually just cardstock and I put the
snowflake<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.140> top<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:26.460> end<00:01:26.880> down<00:01:27.240> bottom<00:01:27.659> so

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
snowflake up top and end down bottom so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.800 
snowflake up top and end down bottom so
I<00:01:27.840> don't<00:01:28.110> know<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.350> that's<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> hold<00:01:29.100> up

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
I don't know how that's going to hold up

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
I don't know how that's going to hold up
I<00:01:30.810> mean<00:01:31.200> it'll<00:01:31.409> probably<00:01:31.680> get<00:01:31.979> bent<00:01:32.310> at<00:01:32.549> some

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I mean it'll probably get bent at some

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.370 
I mean it'll probably get bent at some
at<00:01:33.540> some<00:01:33.810> point<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:35.549> put<00:01:36.150> some<00:01:36.600> candy<00:01:37.259> on

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
at some point but I put some candy on

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.940 
at some point but I put some candy on
the<00:01:37.530> bottom<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.400> Santa<00:01:38.850> charm

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
the bottom and this little Santa charm

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.649 
the bottom and this little Santa charm
so<00:01:40.950> basically<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.579> same<00:01:41.790> thing<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.240> yesterday

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
so basically the same thing as yesterday

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
so basically the same thing as yesterday
just<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.259> wanted<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> repeat<00:01:43.979> those<00:01:44.220> two

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
just just wanted to repeat those two

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.929 
just just wanted to repeat those two
then<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.689> something<00:01:46.140> new<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.649> had<00:01:47.689> some

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
then this is something new I had some

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.280 
then this is something new I had some
downloadables<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.180> think<00:01:51.540> they<00:01:51.810> were<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.259> think

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
downloadables I think they were I think

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.520 
downloadables I think they were I think
they<00:01:52.649> were<00:01:52.710> bottle<00:01:53.220> cap<00:01:53.430> shapes<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.350> is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
they were bottle cap shapes and this is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.920 
they were bottle cap shapes and this is
just<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> snowy<00:01:56.520> scene<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.570> blue

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
just like a snowy scene but it was blue

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.569 
just like a snowy scene but it was blue
so<00:01:58.290> again<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> blue<00:01:59.040> theme<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.460> then<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
so again with the blue theme and then I

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.569 
so again with the blue theme and then I
had<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.000> resaurant<00:02:00.920> charm<00:02:03.020> um<00:02:04.189> put<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.399> on

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
had this resaurant charm um put that on

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.330

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
Michels I got these last year and I had

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.720 
Michels I got these last year and I had
actually<00:02:18.660> already<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.590> think<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.490> like<00:02:20.670> a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
actually already I think this is like a

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.180 
actually already I think this is like a
sparkle<00:02:21.420> embossing<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.500> had<00:02:22.710> done<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:22.980> had

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
sparkle embossing that I had done I had

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.570 
sparkle embossing that I had done I had
already<00:02:23.340> done<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.760> couple<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.330> them<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:26.010> just

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
already done a couple of them so I just

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.130 
already done a couple of them so I just
grabbed<00:02:26.850> one<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.210> them<00:02:27.360> they<00:02:27.630> were<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.960> bag

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
grabbed one of them they were in the bag

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
grabbed one of them they were in the bag
and<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.500> glued<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.540> back<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
and just glued it to the back of the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.360 
and just glued it to the back of the
bottle<00:02:32.490> cap<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:33.650> again<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.800> with<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> Martha

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
bottle cap and again it with a Martha

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.390

Stewart<00:02:35.670> punch<00:02:35.910> put<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:37.160> snowflake<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
Stewart punch put the snowflake and a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.270 
Stewart punch put the snowflake and a
little<00:02:38.640> bling<00:02:38.940> blue<00:02:39.510> bling<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.110> back<00:02:40.290> and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
little bling blue bling on the back and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.010 
little bling blue bling on the back and
some<00:02:41.520> blue<00:02:41.730> ribbon<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.270> it's<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.750> little

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
some blue ribbon so it's just a little

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.920 
some blue ribbon so it's just a little
bit<00:02:43.170> different<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.370> still<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.300> still<00:02:45.600> think

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
bit different but still I still think

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.800 
bit different but still I still think
it's<00:02:46.140> kind<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:47.340> nice<00:02:47.820> size<00:02:48.090> for<00:02:48.120> an<00:02:48.510> ornament

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
it's kind of a nice size for an ornament

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.320 
it's kind of a nice size for an ornament
it's<00:02:48.990> small<00:02:49.350> it's<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.680> little<00:02:49.920> small<00:02:50.270> for<00:02:51.270> an

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
it's small it's a little small for an

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.610 
it's small it's a little small for an
ornament<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.930> then<00:02:52.850> for<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.300> have<00:02:55.230> someone<00:02:55.590> in

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
ornament and then for I have someone in

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.220 
ornament and then for I have someone in
mind<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.370> one<00:02:56.610> specifically<00:02:57.240> there<00:02:58.170> are

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
mind for this one specifically there are

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.770 
mind for this one specifically there are
a<00:02:58.260> little<00:02:58.440> more<00:02:58.680> religious<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.550> again<00:03:00.000> these

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
a little more religious so again these

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.620 
a little more religious so again these
were<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:02.270> downloadables<00:03:03.270> these<00:03:03.510> are<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.660> think

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
were the downloadables these are I think

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.570 
were the downloadables these are I think
maybe<00:03:06.630> they<00:03:06.960> were<00:03:07.970> Domino<00:03:10.070> little<00:03:11.070> Domino

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
maybe they were Domino little Domino

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.160 
maybe they were Domino little Domino
downloads<00:03:12.030> or<00:03:12.180> whatever<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.540> did<00:03:12.600> but<00:03:12.930> I<00:03:13.110> don't

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
downloads or whatever I did but I don't

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.370 
downloads or whatever I did but I don't
know<00:03:13.700> who<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.000> specifically<00:03:15.840> if<00:03:16.080> it's<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
know who that is specifically if it's a

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.479 
know who that is specifically if it's a
like<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:16.980> saint<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.730> some<00:03:17.970> type<00:03:19.130> but<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.160> just

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
like a saint of some type but I just

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.970 
like a saint of some type but I just
again<00:03:20.850> adhered<00:03:21.420> paper<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.620> cork

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
again adhered paper to the to the cork

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.610 
again adhered paper to the to the cork
and<00:03:23.160> then<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:23.940> cut<00:03:24.239> this<00:03:24.450> image<00:03:24.840> out<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.350> just

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
and then I cut this image out and just

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.100 
and then I cut this image out and just
adhered<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.580> front<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.150> put<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
adhered that to the front and put the

adhered that to the front and put the
gold<00:03:28.350> trim<00:03:28.709> around<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.100> top<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.580> bottom<00:03:29.820> I

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
gold trim around the top and bottom I

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.180 
gold trim around the top and bottom I
cut<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.270> all<00:03:30.540> gold<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.200> like<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.620> like<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.100> I

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
cut this all gold I like I like it I

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.130 
cut this all gold I like I like it I
like<00:03:32.310> how<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:32.640> turned<00:03:32.790> out

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
like how it turned out

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.770 
like how it turned out
a<00:03:34.170> gold<00:03:35.040> spacer<00:03:35.640> bead<00:03:35.850> on<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.120> bottom<00:03:36.150> and

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
a gold spacer bead on the bottom and

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.300 
a gold spacer bead on the bottom and
another<00:03:37.140> one<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.470> those<00:03:37.560> this<00:03:37.830> is<00:03:38.010> just<00:03:38.220> a

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
another one of those this is just a

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.199 
another one of those this is just a
little<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:40.100> screw<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.130> guess<00:03:41.459> it's<00:03:41.640> called<00:03:41.880> and

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
little I screw I guess it's called and

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.020 
little I screw I guess it's called and
then<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.020> image<00:03:43.350> is<00:03:43.770> kind<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.790> guess

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
then this image is kind of like I guess

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.370 
then this image is kind of like I guess
of<00:03:45.239> Mary<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.900> Jesus<00:03:46.140> but<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:48.870> know<00:03:48.989> it's<00:03:49.260> a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
of Mary and Jesus but you know it's a

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.110 
of Mary and Jesus but you know it's a
little<00:03:49.620> more<00:03:49.830> religious<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.520> I<00:03:50.550> thought<00:03:50.940> I

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
little more religious so I thought I

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.760 
little more religious so I thought I
think<00:03:51.180> they'll<00:03:51.630> appreciate<00:03:51.810> that

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
think they'll appreciate that

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.680 
think they'll appreciate that
more<00:03:53.250> than<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.580> cutesy<00:03:53.970> stuff<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.510> then

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
more than the cutesy stuff and then

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.410 
more than the cutesy stuff and then
again<00:03:55.110> I<00:03:55.350> put<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:56.160> gold<00:03:56.430> Stickles<00:03:57.060> just

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
again I put this the gold Stickles just

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.840 
again I put this the gold Stickles just
because<00:03:57.660> it's<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.870> gold<00:03:58.110> bottle<00:03:58.320> cap<00:03:58.680> but<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.489> put

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
because it's a gold bottle cap but I put

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.670 
because it's a gold bottle cap but I put
the<00:04:00.000> gold<00:04:00.239> Stickles<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:01.050> around<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.500> edges

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
the gold Stickles just around the edges

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.310 
the gold Stickles just around the edges
of<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.430> because<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:02.940> silver<00:04:03.360> inside<00:04:03.810> and

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
of that because it's silver inside and

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.390 
of that because it's silver inside and
then<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.959> gold<00:04:06.959> bead<00:04:07.350> on<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.709> bottom<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:08.250> a

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
then a gold bead on the bottom and a

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.380 
then a gold bead on the bottom and a
little<00:04:08.430> gold<00:04:09.000> angel<00:04:10.370> so<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.640> like<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.239> I<00:04:12.360> think

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
little gold angel so I like it I think

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.630 
little gold angel so I like it I think
it's<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.989> think<00:04:13.350> it's<00:04:13.500> pretty<00:04:13.739> cool<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.310> put<00:04:14.610> a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
it's I think it's pretty cool I put a

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.370 
it's I think it's pretty cool I put a
gold<00:04:14.910> bellick<00:04:15.330> or<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:15.690> I<00:04:15.750> kept<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.109> really

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
gold bellick or so I kept that really

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.830 
gold bellick or so I kept that really
gold<00:04:16.680> but<00:04:17.580> it's<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:17.970> kind<00:04:18.269> of<00:04:18.390> more<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.750> a

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
gold but it's like kind of more of a

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.010 
gold but it's like kind of more of a
religious<00:04:19.320> theme<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.830> guess<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:21.810> did<00:04:21.989> a

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
religious theme I guess and I did a

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.650 
religious theme I guess and I did a
silver<00:04:22.560> one<00:04:22.770> very<00:04:23.550> similar<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.570> a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
silver one very similar to that it's a

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.230 
silver one very similar to that it's a
different<00:04:25.080> image<00:04:25.550> but<00:04:26.550> what

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
different image but what

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.480 
different image but what
I didn't<00:04:27.569> like<00:04:27.750> about<00:04:27.780> this<00:04:28.259> one<00:04:28.440> was<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.979> ended

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
I didn't like about this one was I ended

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.390 
I didn't like about this one was I ended
up<00:04:29.639> I<00:04:30.000> like<00:04:30.569> the<00:04:30.810> snowflake<00:04:31.440> on<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.740> back<00:04:31.919> so<00:04:32.370> I

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
up I like the snowflake on the back so I

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.540 
up I like the snowflake on the back so I
wanted<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.000> keep<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:34.110> and<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.650> put<00:04:35.099> the<00:04:35.220> image

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
wanted to keep that and I put the image

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.879 
wanted to keep that and I put the image
over<00:04:36.030> where<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.449> other<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:37.050> paper<00:04:37.259> joined<00:04:37.650> on

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
over where the other the paper joined on

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.790 
over where the other the paper joined on
the<00:04:37.979> bottom<00:04:38.310> so<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.520> can<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:39.030> can<00:04:39.210> see<00:04:39.800> where

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
the bottom so you can you can see where

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.980 
the bottom so you can you can see where
I<00:04:40.830> joined<00:04:40.979> that<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:41.819> there's<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.270> lump<00:04:42.599> right<00:04:42.840> in

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
I joined that so there's a lump right in

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.260 
I joined that so there's a lump right in
the<00:04:43.080> front<00:04:43.349> so<00:04:43.650> anyway<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.490> live<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:44.819> learn<00:04:44.940> I
