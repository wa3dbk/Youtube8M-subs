00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.420
 in the twenty fifth round of the championship of Russia 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.090
 a lot of bright things happened but the most 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:18.430
 important of them is the change of leader championship com 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.560
 tell everything in order so 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.570
 locomotive capital club leaders she 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.119
 five rounds in a row scored a match with 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.949
 an outsider championship anji lineup 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.520
 whose great goalkeeper Michael played 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.340
 Kerzhakov 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.259
 just one point since the day before zenith 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.899
 Krasnodar defeated them Kuchuk it 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.000
 the team went down to line number two 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.579
 bright match play loot motif anji not 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.380
 I remember it was time to speculate about 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.450
 why does the locomotive run so little 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.190
 fans although the team is committed to 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.350
 she is only the third championship 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.450
 stories on the last game in the stands 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.489
 there were eleven half thousand people 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.500
 and this given fans of anji 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.500
 that's what loko fans think about it 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.320
 rejuvenation 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.930
 I 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.240
 An interesting detail is now five hundred times 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.280
 locomotive succession of bullets with victories 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.220
 with a score of 3 0 if this trend 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.150
 will persist the victory falls on the super 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.200
 important matches 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.200
 Zenith and CSKA 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.500
 it happened spartak won his 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.750
 first win in 2014 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.910
 downed wings of the Soviets more than that 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.130
 for the first time since November 12, curled 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.350
 Jura Movsisyan but think that red and white 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.450
 out of the crisis yet too early 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.450
 why about this next paragraph 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.620
 89 min on Kosovo so leads 1 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.070
 start denis sashes 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.940
 these situations are surplus 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.690
 Stanislav Cherchesov debuted at the post 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.420
 head coach dynamo so how with 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.819
 victory with a score of 0 5 true won 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.709
 she was on a sinking volga which is exactly 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.400
 I missed as much there in short 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.440
 Cherchesova 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.319
 it's amazing that this time all the goals 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.900
 were scored in the second half as 4 of 5 and 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.209
 altogether in the last 20 minutes after the match 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.430
 Stanislav Solonovich and asked if he knows 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.630
 he reminds me of the game against wolves 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.120
 have time and his amkara 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.400
 I still have Barcelona to beat the Volga 5 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.650
 replied to reporters cherchesov not even 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.630
 I know that it is more likely that he will head 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.370
 mars or that volga he rolled himself 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:01.910
 will ever play in one 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.620
 tournament on the basis of 25 rounds in the championship 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.269
 Russia changed leader not only in 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.400
 standings but also in the list 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.530
 scorers denis brazilian hulk 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.170
 designed a hat-trick in a game with Krasnodar from 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.790
 16 have goals came out on top 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.120
 second line seidu dumbya 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:22.730
 and Artem Dziuba on 14 heads and Movsisyan 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.799
 scored until 13 goalkeeper Kuban 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.170
 Alexander Belenov set a record 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.750
 season sowing match against ruby in 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.180
 which his team won 20 goalkeeper 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.430
 reflected all 11 strikes that Kazan 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.739
 inflicted on target while committing 8 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.190
 saves is absolutely the best result in 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.190
 this season 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.189
 and at the end of the best goals of the tour 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.000
 finally let's pay attention again 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.890
 on the table after twenty five rounds 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.860
 zenith ahead of the locomotive at one point 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.290
 cisco behind the first place by 4 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.850
 Dynamo points beating the Volga again 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.550
 returned to fourth place 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.260
 Spartak closes the top five and at the bottom of the table 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.200
 like upstairs tight fighting 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.000
 continuing truth for salvation in 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.070
 the next twenty sixth round of us 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.530
 expects opposition to the zenith Sanji 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.560
 Dynamo with Krasnodar Rubies with Spartak 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.320
 and Kuban with CSK should be interesting 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.150
 Thank you for your attention 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.740
 Karina domain Alexander Nikitin 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.740
 specifically for the championship
