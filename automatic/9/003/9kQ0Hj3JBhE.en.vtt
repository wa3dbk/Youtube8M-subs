00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
here Vicki it looks like we have two

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.690 
here Vicki it looks like we have two
kinds<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.110> chinking<00:01:15.440> going<00:01:15.649> on<00:01:15.800> we<00:01:16.190> have<00:01:16.340> pyro

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
kinds of chinking going on we have pyro

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.430 
kinds of chinking going on we have pyro
glass<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:17.360> then<00:01:17.630> we<00:01:17.720> have<00:01:17.840> some<00:01:17.960> urethane

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
glass and then we have some urethane

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.440 
glass and then we have some urethane
chinking<00:01:18.860> do<00:01:19.039> you<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:19.280> recommendation<00:01:19.970> or

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
chinking do you have a recommendation or

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.510 
chinking do you have a recommendation or
a<00:01:20.509> preference<00:01:20.929> on<00:01:21.080> would<00:01:21.800> one<00:01:21.979> be<00:01:22.130> better<00:01:22.310> than

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
a preference on would one be better than

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.870 
a preference on would one be better than
the<00:01:22.640> other

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
the other

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.550 
the other
fiberglass<00:01:23.420> one<00:01:23.810> would<00:01:23.990> probably<00:01:24.110> be<00:01:24.289> better

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
fiberglass one would probably be better

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.160 
fiberglass one would probably be better
the<00:01:25.160> urethane<00:01:25.520> chinking<00:01:26.240> it's<00:01:26.720> more<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.080> a

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
the urethane chinking it's more of a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.200 
the urethane chinking it's more of a
rigid<00:01:27.500> type<00:01:27.649> of<00:01:27.710> chinking<00:01:28.399> that<00:01:28.670> if<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.030> logs

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
rigid type of chinking that if the logs

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.330 
rigid type of chinking that if the logs
shrink<00:01:29.659> are<00:01:29.869> settled<00:01:30.200> anyway<00:01:30.530> this<00:01:31.009> will<00:01:31.159> pull

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
shrink are settled anyway this will pull

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.219 
shrink are settled anyway this will pull
apart<00:01:31.429> this<00:01:32.119> has<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.330> lot<00:01:32.539> more<00:01:32.750> forgiving

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
apart this has a lot more forgiving

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.469 
apart this has a lot more forgiving
gives<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:33.920> little<00:01:34.310> bit<00:01:34.459> more<00:01:34.520> keeps<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.209> cold

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
gives a little bit more keeps that cold
