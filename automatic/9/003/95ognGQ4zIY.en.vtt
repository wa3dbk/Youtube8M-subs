00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:12.059
 hello everyone with you channel lada granta fan 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:18.029
 no here recently in the comments as 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:21.539
 one of the videos the audience wrote that 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.410
 adapter Well, what a shame adapter here with 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.800
 than eating it 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.680
 So I decided to shoot a short video 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.599
 tell in three words 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.800
 Why do I need an adapter, which means I'll 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.600
 adapter here i'm not mistaken there still doing 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.700
 327 possible by 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.250
 by this abbreviation find it this one 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.980
 adapter it connects to 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.260
 diagnostic pads of ours with you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.969
 car frets grants specifically so 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.390
 apologizing for dirty floor mats 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.430
 very dirty do not have time to clean here 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.850
 so the diagnostic block 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.729
 located to the left of the duct 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.930
 passenger seat 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:13.430
 here I do not know Oskol that's where here 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.300
 fingers diagnostic pad is located 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.650
 here 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.900
 Here is our adapter, it connects 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.840
 turn on start the car further through 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.430
 program 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:32.310
 plug in te adapter 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.460
 the program in turn the adapter need 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.280
 before it will connect on bluetooth 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.210
 the phone usually has a four-digit code 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.460
 white 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.430
 different varieties are code here but 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.680
 that using this adapter you can 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.380
 look well first of all to me he 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.080
 recently been useful for what I have 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.400
 fired up the check here are the keys 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.920
 Well, I checked the check scan got out 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.620
 error 1302 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.840
 Here in the internet I looked it looked 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.920
 mistake 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:13.290
 shorter than the glitch to the sides in the second 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.640
 cylinder shorter here after that replaced 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.520
 the coil is all man gone here well 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.230
 with the help of bd program scanners 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.230
 it will be possible there to throw off these errors 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.700
 if they themselves are not lost also 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.020
 through the program 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.380
 track your fuel consumption rate well 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.050
 in short 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.150
 roughly speaking that your computer is on the phone with 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.190
 the program turns well as onboard 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.130
 computer 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.510
 here is but one of these useful 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.370
 more features so as you know 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.970
 lada granta no then not displayed on 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.250
 dashboard q 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.950
 we will not leave the cooling temperature 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.110
 fluid using it with this 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.910
 about adapters programs can be 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.150
 watch 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:06.900
 engine temperature here 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.920
 In principle, I do not know everything more in brief 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.099
 nothing to say here is the program specifically 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.370
 I will not disassemble any much 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.780
 different see yourself on the internet in 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.650
