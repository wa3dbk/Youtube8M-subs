00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.580 

first<00:00:42.000> fold<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.930> fold<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.590> side<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> fold

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
first fold you fold one side you fold

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:57.950 
first fold you fold one side you fold
one<00:00:46.860> side<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.520> half<00:00:54.949> look<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:57.300> get<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.690> side

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
one side in half look you get one side

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.430 
one side in half look you get one side
fold<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.890> half<00:00:59.870> then<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.020> get<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> other

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
flaps you barely pull them out

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.690 
flaps you barely pull them out
you<00:01:18.390> only<00:01:18.509> get<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.780> little<00:01:19.170> bit<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.369> this

the top side you fold these down and the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.530 
the top side you fold these down and the
last<00:02:35.230> step<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.739> just<00:02:36.300> decorate<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:39.390> pull<00:02:40.390> it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
last step you just decorate it pull it

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.650 
last step you just decorate it pull it
back<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> little<00:02:41.260> bit<00:02:42.690> there<00:02:43.690> we<00:02:43.780> go<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:46.510> you
