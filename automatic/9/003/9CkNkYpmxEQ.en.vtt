doesn't<00:01:33.540> actually<00:01:33.750> tell<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.110> how<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.290> break

doesn't actually tell you how to break
it<00:01:34.650> down<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.920> in<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> manual

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
it down and I think in the in the manual

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.870 
it down and I think in the in the manual
but<00:01:39.229> that's<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.560> don't<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.250> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
but that's you don't have to do that you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.249 
but that's you don't have to do that you
only<00:01:41.970> do<00:01:42.119> really<00:01:42.390> want<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.079> you're

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
only do really want to do that if you're

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.889 
only do really want to do that if you're
lying<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> water<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.420> mud<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.689> type

lying in the water and mud and that type

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.560 
lying in the water and mud and that type
of<00:01:45.930> stuff<00:01:46.110> getting<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.680> gunk<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.130> there<00:01:47.570> man

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.510 
for water applications with the shackles
it's<00:01:53.130> pretty<00:01:53.430> cool<00:01:53.579> was<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.240> arm<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it's pretty cool was just a arm the the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.910 
it's pretty cool was just a arm the the
screw<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:57.299> only<00:01:57.659> had<00:01:57.899> only<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.140> set<00:01:58.439> length<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
screw was only had only a set length of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.709 
screw was only had only a set length of
thread<00:01:59.189> which<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.939> pretty<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> amount

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
thread which is pretty much the amount

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.120 
thread which is pretty much the amount
that<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> bolts<00:02:01.259> holding<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> nuts

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that the bolts holding on to the nuts

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.700 
that the bolts holding on to the nuts
holding<00:02:02.280> onto<00:02:02.930> wasn't<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:03.990> entire<00:02:04.229> thing<00:02:04.259> so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
holding onto wasn't the entire thing so

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.810 
holding onto wasn't the entire thing so
that<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.009> gives<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.399> little<00:02:05.520> bit<00:02:05.729> of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
that just gives it a little bit of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.779 
that just gives it a little bit of
wobble<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.750> play<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.469> they<00:02:07.590> he's<00:02:08.429> always

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
wobble and play so that they he's always

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.170 
wobble and play so that they he's always

dampeners on and that type of thing so
yeah<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.159> video<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.519> aren't<00:02:42.730> going<00:02:42.849> to<00:02:42.909> be<00:02:43.000> as

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
yeah the video is aren't going to be as

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.789 
yeah the video is aren't going to be as
long<00:02:43.209> as<00:02:43.389> what<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.540> thought<00:02:43.780> that<00:02:43.840> would<00:02:44.109> be<00:02:44.290> I

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
long as what I thought that would be I

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.069 
long as what I thought that would be I
pulled<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:45.879> pulled<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.359> transmission

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
pulled that pulled the transmission

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.629 
pulled that pulled the transmission
apart<00:02:48.750> was<00:02:49.750> gonna<00:02:50.019> grease<00:02:50.889> it<00:02:51.099> up<00:02:51.159> with<00:02:51.370> marine

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
apart was gonna grease it up with marine

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.330 
apart was gonna grease it up with marine
grease<00:02:51.879> but<00:02:52.239> for<00:02:52.780> now<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.290> don't<00:02:54.159> really<00:02:54.250> think

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
grease but for now I don't really think

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.309 
grease but for now I don't really think
i'll<00:02:54.639> be<00:02:54.730> going<00:02:54.939> into<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.209> much<00:02:55.450> water<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.079> i

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
i'll be going into that much water and i

i'll be going into that much water and i
don't<00:02:56.500> think<00:02:56.560> we<00:02:56.739> gone<00:02:56.889> that<00:02:57.069> deep<00:02:57.340> because<00:02:57.879> I

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
be able to see that much rust alrighty

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.959 
be able to see that much rust alrighty
so<00:03:04.840> immediately<00:03:06.510> okay<00:03:07.510> cool<00:03:07.750> cool<00:03:08.969> that's

there I don't know if that's the I doubt
that<00:03:14.319> will<00:03:14.409> be<00:03:14.530> marine<00:03:14.799> grease<00:03:15.010> but<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:15.579> a

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
that will be marine grease but it is a

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.050 
that will be marine grease but it is a
red<00:03:15.849> grease<00:03:16.199> in<00:03:17.199> there<00:03:18.209> nice<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.239> smooth

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
red grease in there nice and smooth

can see it's one in there you can just

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.179 
can see it's one in there you can just
see<00:03:36.639> what<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.479> separators<00:03:38.409> a<00:03:38.439> little<00:03:38.709> gap<00:03:38.889> I

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
see what the separators a little gap I

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.659 
see what the separators a little gap I
actually<00:03:40.180> can't<00:03:40.510> get<00:03:40.720> them<00:03:40.870> out<00:03:41.019> right<00:03:41.260> now<00:03:41.669> or

actually can't get them out right now or
all<00:03:42.729> really<00:03:43.269> safely<00:03:43.810> without<00:03:44.489> might<00:03:45.489> be<00:03:45.669> able

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:45.729 
all really safely without might be able

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.759 
all really safely without might be able
to<00:03:45.879> see<00:03:46.030> something<00:03:46.449> there<00:03:46.629> and<00:03:46.900> they're<00:03:47.379> under

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
to see something there and they're under

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.009 
to see something there and they're under
the<00:03:47.889> outside<00:03:48.220> actually<00:03:48.400> yeah<00:03:49.389> I<00:03:49.419> just<00:03:49.569> cut<00:03:49.900> the

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
the outside actually yeah I just cut the

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.960 
the outside actually yeah I just cut the
top<00:03:50.199> of<00:03:50.379> it<00:03:50.530> just<00:03:51.870> about<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.079> much<00:03:53.879> maybe<00:03:54.879> a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
top of it just about that much maybe a

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.619 
top of it just about that much maybe a
bit<00:03:55.090> more<00:03:55.120> fun<00:03:56.459> if<00:03:57.459> I'm<00:03:57.669> gonna<00:03:57.879> think<00:03:58.269> if<00:03:58.449> I

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
bit more fun if I'm gonna think if I

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.759 
bit more fun if I'm gonna think if I
think<00:03:58.840> that's<00:03:59.049> going<00:03:59.199> to<00:03:59.259> be<00:03:59.379> in<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.560> water

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
think that's going to be in the water

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.999 
think that's going to be in the water
more<00:03:59.859> than<00:04:00.069> anywhere<00:04:00.909> else<00:04:00.970> but<00:04:01.870> for<00:04:02.290> now<00:04:02.470> that

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
more than anywhere else but for now that

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:07.199 
more than anywhere else but for now that
should<00:04:03.340> be<00:04:03.489> ok<00:04:04.859> so<00:04:05.859> yeah<00:04:06.549> I'm<00:04:06.759> gonna<00:04:06.879> go<00:04:06.970> ahead

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
should be ok so yeah I'm gonna go ahead

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.030 
should be ok so yeah I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:04:07.359> put<00:04:07.750> them<00:04:07.870> up<00:04:07.959> put<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.199> diff<00:04:08.379> close<00:04:08.889> the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
and put them up put the diff close the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.460 
and put them up put the diff close the
diff<00:04:09.189> up<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.699> i'll<00:04:10.449> do<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.569> front<00:04:10.900> one<00:04:11.079> don't

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
diff up and i'll do the front one don't

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.159 
diff up and i'll do the front one don't
