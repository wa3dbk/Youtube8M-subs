00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
on a calendar timeline and it does a

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.850 
on a calendar timeline and it does a
pretty<00:03:49.880> darn<00:03:50.180> good<00:03:50.299> job<00:03:50.480> for<00:03:51.200> most<00:03:51.350> things<00:03:51.590> of

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
pretty darn good job for most things of

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.009 
pretty darn good job for most things of
course<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.610> does<00:03:52.790> have<00:03:53.090> potential<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.870> get

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
course it does have potential to get

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.170 
course it does have potential to get
confused<00:03:54.230> like<00:03:55.100> when<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.310> took<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.549> snapshot<00:03:55.880> of

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
confused like when I took a snapshot of
