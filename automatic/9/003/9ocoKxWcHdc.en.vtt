00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
consistency now these won't take very

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.680 
consistency now these won't take very
long<00:01:53.150> because<00:01:53.690> they're<00:01:53.900> quite<00:01:54.080> thin<00:01:55.690> when

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
long because they're quite thin when

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.330

you're able to lift it up like that all
in<00:01:58.370> one<00:01:58.520> piece<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.000> can<00:01:59.330> flip<00:01:59.510> it<00:01:59.660> over<00:02:00.790> like<00:02:01.790> I

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
in one piece you can flip it over like I

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.820 
in one piece you can flip it over like I
have<00:02:02.150> just<00:02:02.330> going<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.690> test<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.230> see<00:02:03.470> that
