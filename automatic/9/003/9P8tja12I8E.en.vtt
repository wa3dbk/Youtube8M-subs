00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
I can fit into the bivi so I set up my

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.060 
I can fit into the bivi so I set up my
tent<00:00:42.030> my<00:00:42.269> backyard<00:00:42.510> put<00:00:43.140> my<00:00:43.290> thermal<00:00:43.890> rest

tent my backyard put my thermal rest
down<00:00:44.370> underneath<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.410> I<00:00:46.410> find<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.830> you<00:00:46.920> can

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129

fit into it pretty well as far as my
hike<00:00:50.220> goes<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:51.300> long<00:00:51.719> enough<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.260> where<00:00:52.440> when

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
hike goes it's long enough to where when

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.850 
hike goes it's long enough to where when
your<00:00:53.219> feet<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.790> bottom<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.410> can<00:00:55.410> pull

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
your feet are at the bottom I can pull

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.430 
your feet are at the bottom I can pull
the<00:00:56.040> bivi<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.460> over<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> top<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.420> my<00:00:57.690> head<00:00:57.930> not

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the bivi up over the top of my head not

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.049 
the bivi up over the top of my head not
to<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.980> point<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.340> where<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.760> use<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
to the point to where I can use the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.260 
to the point to where I can use the
velcro<00:01:00.480> straps<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.410> enclose<00:01:02.160> them<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:02.789> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
velcro straps to enclose them but you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.320 
velcro straps to enclose them but you
can<00:01:03.390> come<00:01:03.570> pretty<00:01:03.780> close<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.700> as<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.149> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
can come pretty close and as the on the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.210 
can come pretty close and as the on the
sides<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.050> just<00:01:07.530> said<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.979> does<00:01:08.190> have

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
sides like I just said it does have

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.940 
sides like I just said it does have
velcro<00:01:08.940> straps<00:01:10.039> to<00:01:11.039> close<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> bivi<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
velcro straps to close up the bivi and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.490 
velcro straps to close up the bivi and
there's<00:01:13.950> also<00:01:14.160> a<00:01:14.340> vent<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.479> bottom<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
there's also a vent on the bottom in to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.770 
there's also a vent on the bottom in to
help<00:01:17.039> ventilation<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:18.300> thing<00:01:18.479> I'll<00:01:18.600> note

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
help ventilation one thing I'll note

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.980 
help ventilation one thing I'll note
though<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> babies<00:01:19.680> pretty<00:01:20.330> thin<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.630> it

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
though is the babies pretty thin so it

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.690 
though is the babies pretty thin so it
when<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.289> open<00:01:22.649> up<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.920> vent<00:01:23.099> on<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.250> bottom

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
when you open up the vent on the bottom

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.270 
when you open up the vent on the bottom
as<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.940> can<00:01:24.149> see<00:01:24.450> right<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:25.069> you<00:01:26.069> can

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
as you can see right there you can

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.880 
as you can see right there you can
actually<00:01:26.729> tear<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.720> baby<00:01:28.020> relatively<00:01:28.709> easily

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
actually tear the baby relatively easily

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.969 
actually tear the baby relatively easily
as<00:01:29.190> I<00:01:29.250> did<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.349> that's<00:01:31.349> one<00:01:31.590> thing<00:01:31.800> to<00:01:31.950> think

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
as I did so that's one thing to think

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.559 
as I did so that's one thing to think
about<00:01:32.399> one<00:01:32.759> thing<00:01:32.940> you<00:01:33.030> want<00:01:33.179> to<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> little

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
about one thing you want to be a little

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.620 
about one thing you want to be a little
bit<00:01:33.780> careful<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.759> now<00:01:35.759> overall<00:01:36.179> I<00:01:36.300> like<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
bit careful with now overall I like the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.290 
bit careful with now overall I like the
bivi<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.800> not<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.250> complete<00:01:38.759> vivvy<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.270> a

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
bivi it's not a complete vivvy with a

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.080 
bivi it's not a complete vivvy with a
mosquito<00:01:39.750> net<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.200> top<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.940> most

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
mosquito net on top but I think for most

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.820 
mosquito net on top but I think for most
survival<00:01:42.630> situations<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.410> going<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> work

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
survival situations it's going to work

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.949 
survival situations it's going to work
pretty<00:01:44.099> well<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.599> to<00:01:45.660> keep<00:01:45.810> you

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
pretty well and it's going to keep you

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.139 
pretty well and it's going to keep you
alive<00:01:46.200> most<00:01:46.649> importantly<00:01:47.190> it<00:01:47.610> could<00:01:47.849> prevent

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
alive most importantly it could prevent

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.410 
alive most importantly it could prevent
hypothermia<00:01:49.069> it's<00:01:50.069> not<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.459> be<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.880> super

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
hypothermia it's not going to be a super

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.559 
hypothermia it's not going to be a super
super<00:01:51.630> warm<00:01:52.080> option<00:01:52.739> in<00:01:52.890> those<00:01:53.099> cold<00:01:53.610> high

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
super warm option in those cold high

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.350 
super warm option in those cold high
elevation<00:01:55.289> areas<00:01:55.440> but<00:01:56.000> it's<00:01:57.000> going<00:01:57.239> to<00:01:57.300> work

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
elevation areas but it's going to work

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.510 
elevation areas but it's going to work
well<00:01:57.690> for<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:58.319> it's<00:01:58.530> designed<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.220> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
well for what it's designed for and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.999 
well for what it's designed for and
that's<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.849> keep<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.149> alive<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:01.440> folds<00:02:01.890> up

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
that's to keep you alive it folds up

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.490 
that's to keep you alive it folds up
pretty<00:02:02.250> easily<00:02:02.489> I<00:02:02.970> just<00:02:03.660> usually<00:02:03.810> fold<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:04.410> in

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
pretty easily I just usually fold it in

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.499 
pretty easily I just usually fold it in
half<00:02:04.530> fold<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.190> in<00:02:05.250> half<00:02:05.280> again<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:06.030> then<00:02:06.479> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
half fold it in half again and then I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
half fold it in half again and then I
fold<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.929> kind<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.410> thirds<00:02:07.739> or<00:02:08.130> fourths<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
fold it kind of in thirds or fourths and
