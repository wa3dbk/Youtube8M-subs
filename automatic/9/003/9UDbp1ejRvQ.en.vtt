00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.570 
touchscreen running Android with the
obvious<00:00:13.290> advantage<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.340> can<00:00:14.460> run

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
obvious advantage is that you can run

Android applications it is Bluetooth

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.870 
Android applications it is Bluetooth
enabled<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.289> requires<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.830> USB<00:00:20.460> bluetooth

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880

codec<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.590> instead<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.009> bluetooth<00:00:32.340> dongle

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
codec so instead of the bluetooth dongle

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.060 
codec so instead of the bluetooth dongle
I<00:00:32.790> actually<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> USB<00:00:34.140> keyboard<00:00:34.500> connected

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
to the side so you can use that instead

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.709 
to the side so you can use that instead
of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> on-screen<00:00:38.399> keyboard<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.059> so
