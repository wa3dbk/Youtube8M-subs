00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hi, people in today's video I'm going to show 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.960
 For you guys, how do I make panela heaven? 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.519
 pressure is a practical recipe that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.860
 we use in our home 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.049
 mainly to do on Sundays 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.480
 Sunday a lazier day that wants 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.480
 to do something more more practical more 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.750
 Fast but also very tasty, right? 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.029
 so basically you need to 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.380
 sausage rib 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.850
 I use blinded aviary a little bit 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.280
 you really do not even have to 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.210
 temper because the sausage itself 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.360
 will release the TV that needs to attack and only 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.010
 nothing else is just ran in the direction 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.719
 wait for the cooking time 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.980
 I'll show you how I left. 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.980
 prepared material 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.270
 Good here, I 've already left her 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.399
 chopped you 're gonna cut her incubus 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.190
 of the size that is actually the bone can 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.350
 to see the joining here of the other as 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.379
 together you will use this here is the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.689
 riba ripa tÃ¡ a people to use 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.130
 around one and a half kilo or so 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.380
 will depend on how much you 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.280
 I want to do more for today, I'll use 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.909
 one and a half pounds 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.350
 half a kilo of sausage to sausage you 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.420
 just gonna leave it the way it is not 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.030
 you need to stay, you do not have to do anything 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.880
 the onion I cut already in slices is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.280
 because this is the training I'm going to 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.170
 make into the pan and I also put 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.290
 four area teeth 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.290
 I saw the pan with the onion and 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.689
 I threw the water spread now you 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.150
 will start to mount their 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.530
 pressure cooker ribs 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.810
 take the pieces that have the bone and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.329
 place the bone face down 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:56.399
 you will make a layer facing 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:02:02.780
 down with only the young man so young there was 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.780
 even given to others 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.860
 Okay, done that, you made the layer there. 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.510
 with meat 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.510
 Now you're going to put the sausage 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.200
 Let's make layers of sausage and I'll go 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:27.630
 distribute salt in the pan 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:30.840
 Are you worried if you're going to meet everything? 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.819
 but the idea will only gaucho I like 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.330
 do so make a layer of sausage 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.019
 and then I cover capital cover the dinho 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.640
 English 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:03:02.760
 now I'll put the rest of the load 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:03:04.739
 that I have it, I'll spread it out 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.269
 these layers I'll put a 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.579
 full - time bit 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.030
 I'll put some pepper 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:16.920
 kingdom and by the dock that's ok then use 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:20.670
 what 's to your liking and I'm going 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.040
 put a little jump you do not 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.620
 needs salt for science has people 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.700
 What is the problem with high blood pressure? 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.410
 and everything else 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.299
 here at home we do not have this 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.340
 problem but I do not some also me 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.630
 How do I know this recipe already and I know 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.859
 that she got a little bit hotter 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.100
 a little salt 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:41.000
 I'll put it that way I'll close 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.000
 pressure cooker 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:57.269
 only you do not need to put UN not 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:58.980
 You need to put anything in the normal fire 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.620
 pressure does not handle personal likes 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.159
 diminish a little 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.590
 on the high fire I do not raise the pressure 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.489
 you should find around 45 to 50 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.010
 minutes 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.260
 of course it will depend a lot on your 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.819
 audience side of the stove because it's who 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.340
 It was only a little bit of time. 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.979
 more in re-established is what I have 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.859
 there's a nice warmup like this 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.639
 I have to be 45 minutes old and it's already 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.380
 ready 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.270
 Then you 'll do well if you realize that 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.860
 the smell of meat and 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.229
 suddenly the thing will be that our people 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.330
 Southern alloy cinnamon leaves completed 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.020
 50 minutes kieza if the stove as best 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.770
 than mine 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.300
 ah I'll let cooking in time - 45 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.800
 minutes 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.440
 in a little while you show how 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.970
 It's good, my cooking time is good. 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.970
 already gave 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.030
 see how the oil control was left on the bottom 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.639
 is ready 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:05.690
 Good people, I'll show you how. 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:09.590
 the texture is the sausage it stays 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.900
 well where you see that she looks good 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.250
 line and the rib is also her 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.550
 it's melting 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.440
 but if you pull it it melts 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.620
 then it looks great and stays for your 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.620

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.210

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:48.720
 It turned out well and the salt is perfect. 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:48.720

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.400
