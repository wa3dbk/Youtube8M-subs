00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.250
 right 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.950
 here now there are such things done 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.070
 at the nodus 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.360
 but here the forum let's group tonight 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.360
 show you how to do 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:53.909
 now everything is created world also in this 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:03.240
 You can bandage buttons there such as 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:05.100
 ham for example so here we went to 2 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:12.000
 clearing on to show 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:19.349
 but look at the first function and firstly 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.599
 open - on n Russian here is very 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:27.739
 many functions so auto that is for example 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.739
 if now 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.940
 here as a tool 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.220
 if you turn it on , I turned it on 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.300
 he will look like a man 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.810
 hand and he switches to the shovel 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:03.860
 just then it will just be a pickaxe 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.490
 for example, but those items that can 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.310
 dig out 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:16.640
 gives say function like x-ray here 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:18.910
 look here we go and we look here he 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.680
 sees these blocks 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.430
 further what else goes 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.550
 of the mayan he will just drip by himself 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:32.290
 you don't need to do anything just 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:36.760
 point the mouse and everything on 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:40.290
 fast track it will dig very fast 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:45.840
 just at the speed of light 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:51.450
 yes very quickly so what fast place is it 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:56.670
 too will quickly drip beat now 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:04:02.900
 I will show insert and one he puts very 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:06.599
 a lot of matches to the walls immediately turned 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.230
 so what do you need it big 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.879
 number of blocks 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:17.220
 that such a wall that is disappeared two three 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:20.870
 block you then it will not work further is 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.150
 world of the fish is like you when 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:29.270
 fishing so you can say he is a fish 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:33.300
 catches to the finder is he sees the chests 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.539

 jerking what do you believe chests dig up 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:46.150
