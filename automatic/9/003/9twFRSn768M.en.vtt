00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.760
 I wanted to know, it 's a chip. 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.160
 you are asking that question over here 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:50.090
 would not know the answer 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.879
 when she had fx it 's a look if she spoke 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:59.659
 of the team did not encourage the wind and 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:01.460
 And now, look how you like. 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.909
 talk that the team is not excited that you 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.840
 I did not have the power to rest a little 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.220
 hat spin your screams and you will power 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.150
 rest now i will keep the same 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.490
 guideline then type camera has changed a lot to 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.890
 all guys 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.659
 realized this kind interact much more 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.210
 I've been talking a lot more 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.190
 also the official time now type 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.760
 It got loose much more I've talked 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.830
 much with him and over 30 the whole crew 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.240
 can you notice what kind of harmony at home? 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.930
 it's very good people are giving too much 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.670
 well kind of service after the saw and 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.590
 You call it homicide and then one more year. 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.990
 until I could think of this exchange and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.200
 more letting you play by already creating 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.399
 This is a little tricky. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.810
 so I'd rather continue in my account 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.180
 to us a little bit about how it was 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.689
 do not miss out on the clear river has no mystery 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.490
 about this is simply not lost and 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.210
 I intend to stay without losing for much 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.369
 time 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.020
 Do you think this new team will be 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.740
 with thirst for world victory 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.869
 I just think it 's an uncertainty after the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.430
 my exit from the skin of the last 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.950
 results you 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.510
 Then I realized that you have 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.180
 very hard you have been training a lot 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.489
 and kind the fal you know where really 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.080
 do not just take Brazil as it seemed 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.709
 This all makes me very old. 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.540
 lively and more committed to the world cup 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.280
 when you came out of the reach of the reasons 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.079
 that you gave was that you do not feel 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.019
 home you notice a breakthrough with regard to 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.870
 This is the same thing when I 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.090
 it was comb because it seemed like I would sleep 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.510
 in my office where the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.760
 type of work were published here 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.549
 nowadays a lot of reforms are happening 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.349
 here and separate a leisure area and 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.420
 work area, we can 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.060
 enough to separate things and 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.500
 It's very good, the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.959
 management leaves nothing to be 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.730
 we do we feel at home 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.730
 Even though it's a ball show. 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.670
 can you sustain 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.530
 I 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.530
 the health
