00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.790
 magic TV represents 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.080
 hello and again we are in nature 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.639
 today's issue will be dedicated 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.730
 our smaller brothers we will do with you 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.820
 unusual very simple toy for 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.250
 dogs cats or for anyone if u 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.980
 you like i have pets 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.410
 put your finger up many dogs and cats 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.210
 love to get new toys 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.210
 I recently had a ferret 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.170
 Give her a new toy just every 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.690
 day to please your friend and not 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.340
 spend with a fortune 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.080
 do something simple with your own hands 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.550
 surely you have old ones too 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.130
 T-shirts that you do not wear 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.840
 and sharp scissors in fact is all that to me 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.910
 need not necessarily 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.830
 You can use T-shirts 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.110
 take any item of clothing from 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.650
 knitted cotton fabric I need 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.190
 cut off 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:05.000
 4 identical rather wide strips 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:07.310
 fabric to make a toy 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.380
 more interesting I cut the tape from two 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.710
 different t-shirts i have 2 varnavas and 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.670
 and 2 beige all 4 strips tie in 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.750
 tight knot in color resembles 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.940
 more than ice cream 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.840
 the easiest way to make such a toy 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.190
 in the following way 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.720
 clamping a knot between your knees and 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.640
 unfolding cloth strips like this 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:35.119
 the way you put and the tape 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.209
 each other like this 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.369
 create a semblance of a node therefore 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:47.530
 we throw it over the first one 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:49.440
 you pushes the loop on see 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.340
 I do the same on the other side 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.780
 exchanging and sticking a loop 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780
 Now you need to carefully tighten this thing. 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.760
 4 color such small square turns out 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.220
 plump repeat these simple ones 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.369
 movement until you are satisfied with the size 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.369
 toys 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.600
 my tie knot from the second side 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.110
 you can leave the toy like this but i 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.110
 perhaps I will do more accurate tails 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.780
 It turned out simple and very well 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.989
 cute toy for all those who love 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.120
 pull on socks and any other clothes to us 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.629
 It remains to try out this toy on our 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.180
 pets 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.180
 see you very soon bye 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.590
 mother
