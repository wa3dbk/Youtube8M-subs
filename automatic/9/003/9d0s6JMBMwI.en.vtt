00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
reform and that they really need to care

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.450 
reform and that they really need to care
about<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.200> because<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.160> affect

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
about it because it's going to affect

about it because it's going to affect
their<00:00:50.610> future<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.750> don't<00:00:51.809> want<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> say

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
their future and I don't want to say

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.900 
their future and I don't want to say
that<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> fell<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.920> deaf<00:00:52.949> ears<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
that it fell on deaf ears but it

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.340 
that it fell on deaf ears but it
definitely<00:00:54.059> wasn't<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.570> priority<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.170> seemed

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
definitely wasn't a priority it seemed

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.779 
definitely wasn't a priority it seemed
that<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:55.559> didn't<00:00:55.800> care<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.219> think

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
that they didn't care I think

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
that they didn't care I think
entitlement<00:00:57.390> reform<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.960> part<00:00:58.230> of

their problem that they're gonna have to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
their problem that they're gonna have to
live<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.059> burden<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.359> Social<00:01:00.690> Security

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050

Social Security and Medicare and then

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.390 
Social Security and Medicare and then
they're<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> money<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
there and it's probably hard for them to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.730 
there and it's probably hard for them to
completely<00:01:09.659> process<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.439> there's<00:01:10.619> other

generation<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.829> think<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.129> may<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.580> most

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
selfish generation and that we haven't

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.559 
selfish generation and that we haven't
been<00:02:11.009> willing<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.370> pay<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:11.790> anything<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.239> we

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
been willing to pay for anything so we

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.229

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
big government budget deficits and part

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.580 
big government budget deficits and part
of<00:02:15.359> the<00:02:15.450> reason<00:02:15.719> and<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.989> is<00:02:16.049> part<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.469> why

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
of the reason and that is part of why

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.199 
of the reason and that is part of why
college<00:02:16.980> tuitions<00:02:17.400> have<00:02:17.489> gone<00:02:17.700> up<00:02:17.849> so<00:02:18.060> much

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
college tuitions have gone up so much

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.179 
college tuitions have gone up so much
part<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.930> why<00:02:19.079> millenials<00:02:19.560> can't<00:02:19.799> afford<00:02:20.040> to

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
part of why millenials can't afford to

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.649

buy<00:02:20.310> houses<00:02:20.760> home<00:02:20.939> ownership<00:02:21.209> has<00:02:21.450> been

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
buy houses home ownership has been

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.899 
buy houses home ownership has been
dropping<00:02:22.139> and<00:02:22.769> then<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.459> course<00:02:23.549> you<00:02:23.730> have

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
dropping and then you of course you have

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.190 
dropping and then you of course you have
the<00:02:24.030> entitlements<00:02:24.480> problem<00:02:24.780> sitting<00:02:25.079> out

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the entitlements problem sitting out

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.470 
the entitlements problem sitting out
there<00:02:25.379> we<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.799> not<00:02:25.980> funded<00:02:26.480> entitlements

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
there we have not funded entitlements

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.839 
there we have not funded entitlements
for<00:02:27.629> my<00:02:27.749> generation<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> think<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.639> can

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
for my generation so I think you can

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.390 
for my generation so I think you can
mostly<00:02:30.180> blame<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:31.469> policymakers<00:02:32.219> who've
