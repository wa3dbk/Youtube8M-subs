00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello everyone today you 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.799
 find for a new video then 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.120
 I posted a picture on instagram in 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.319
 asking you which video you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.139
 would like to see and you've been 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.099
 many to ask me the video of 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.809
 make up storage 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.549
 so here I do them and so too 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.849
 you can notice that I cut my 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.529
 hair 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.270
 so here I think it's more 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.740
 practice for the summer that will come up 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.300
 see you soon because there it is that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.640
 raining is the disaster 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.250
 but I like that much more it changes 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 so here is ah yes also do not expect 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.210
 not to the makeup collection of the world 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.250
 because I can, but I can 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.430
 do not have a lot what I saw a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.260
 video that of carl dubé beautiful this is a 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.870
 crazy thing but she has some stuff 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.890
 she has a cabinet filled with makeup 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.180
 but it's maddening it's maddening 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.440
 so that's how it looks like 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.829
 put everything on my bed for it to be a 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.160
 little bit easier to film so this 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.800
 make up storage comes from ikea and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.829
 so it divides itself into different part 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.080
 so here I have all my brushes underneath 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.380
 I have all my eyeshadow and 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.450
 then but cast a lipstick 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.740
 bluff is then named palace so 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.030
 firstly for the brushes you 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.320
 can see that the brushes for the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.840
 complexion are in the first compartment 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.780
 with the foundation brush and the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.409
 brush for the bluff then for the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.240
 browser it is there with the eyelash curler 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.520
 in the third compartment itself 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.509
 place the brushes for the eyes so 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.939
 with mascara and an eyeliner brush 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.040
 beveled and the brush is always at 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.200
 he is too good he is good 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.610
 provided and the one I used in 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.619
 my video of jean claude bard so in 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.640
 this compartment are the pencils for 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.890
 the lips 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.549
 so I have all my mac pencils 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.670
 who are paying attention to sea lipstick 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:51.899
 Then I have my Art pencils makes 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 if they are good enough 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.590
 and this one from Bourjois ah yes 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.149
 this one the super good too is the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.530
 naked from urban decay too good 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.500
 that's l'oréal 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.479
 belgium is also an orange for 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.080
 the summer is molly so then there 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.620
 are for the eyes so a mascara of 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.650
 at clinic a pencil for 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.560
 kiko's eyebrows for a little bit 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.010
 redraw his eyebrows underneath and 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.900
 then pencils to fade from home 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.959
 bourjois also violated and brown 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.300

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.430
 this is an eye liner of chamakh 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.380
 so then we will be able to move to 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.010
 eyeshadow so we remove that there 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:47.220
 so is there are small ones 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.989
