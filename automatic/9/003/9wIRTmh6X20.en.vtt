that right now so again you can either
go<00:02:48.160> straight<00:02:48.459> down<00:02:48.639> or<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:50.260> can<00:02:50.290> get<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> really

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
go straight down or you can get a really

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.590 
go straight down or you can get a really
different<00:02:51.100> effect<00:02:51.549> by<00:02:51.790> pushing<00:02:52.359> it<00:02:52.480> straight

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
different effect by pushing it straight

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.400 
different effect by pushing it straight
down<00:02:52.959> like<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:54.239> pushing<00:02:55.239> it<00:02:55.480> into<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.230> water

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
down like this pushing it into the water

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:06.120 
down like this pushing it into the water
like<00:03:00.389> that<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:03.579> then<00:03:04.120> as<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:04.480> pull<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.989> out<00:03:05.130> it

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
like that and then as you pull it out it

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.780 
like that and then as you pull it out it
will<00:03:06.340> pick<00:03:06.579> up<00:03:06.609> the<00:03:06.910> rest<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.359> it

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.410 

and<00:03:10.879> check<00:03:11.629> that<00:03:11.900> out<00:03:12.849> it<00:03:13.849> also<00:03:14.000> gets<00:03:14.269> some

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
and check that out it also gets some

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.809 
and check that out it also gets some
really<00:03:14.900> cool<00:03:15.110> texture<00:03:15.500> as<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:16.220> know<00:03:16.400> we<00:03:16.790> are

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
really cool texture as you know we are

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
to be thicker than regular paint but you

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.030 
to be thicker than regular paint but you

to<00:03:28.250> do<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.519> technique<00:03:29.079> I've<00:03:30.079> also<00:03:30.319> done<00:03:30.650> it

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
to do this technique I've also done it

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.039 
to do this technique I've also done it
these<00:03:31.310> are<00:03:31.459> still<00:03:31.700> wet<00:03:31.879> I<00:03:31.909> just<00:03:32.420> started

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
these are still wet I just started

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.140 
these are still wet I just started
playing<00:03:33.170> with<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:33.650> I've<00:03:34.459> also<00:03:34.640> done<00:03:34.879> it<00:03:35.030> on

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
playing with this I've also done it on

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.059 
playing with this I've also done it on
some<00:03:35.510> Manila<00:03:35.810> tag<00:03:36.079> so<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.290> does<00:03:36.530> not<00:03:36.709> have<00:03:36.769> to

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
some Manila tag so it does not have to

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.949 
some Manila tag so it does not have to
be<00:03:37.159> on<00:03:37.280> watercolor<00:03:37.640> paper<00:03:37.940> but<00:03:38.450> watercolor

be on watercolor paper but watercolor

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.289 
be on watercolor paper but watercolor
paper<00:03:39.200> I<00:03:39.319> think<00:03:39.500> tends<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:40.159> to<00:03:40.579> handle<00:03:40.970> it<00:03:41.150> a

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
paper I think tends to to handle it a

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.910 
paper I think tends to to handle it a
little<00:03:41.599> bit<00:03:41.689> better<00:03:41.840> because<00:03:42.049> it<00:03:42.230> gets<00:03:42.409> so<00:03:42.500> wet

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
little bit better because it gets so wet

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.210 
little bit better because it gets so wet
this<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:44.000> one<00:03:44.329> one<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.379> the<00:03:45.470> experiments<00:03:46.069> but

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
this is one one of the experiments but

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.390 
this is one one of the experiments but
this<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.760> perfect<00:03:47.150> background<00:03:48.370> then<00:03:49.370> you

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
this is a perfect background then you

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.190 
this is a perfect background then you
can<00:03:49.670> always<00:03:49.819> you<00:03:50.239> know<00:03:50.269> distressing<00:03:51.079> or

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
can always you know distressing or

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.869 
can always you know distressing or
distressing<00:03:51.349> that<00:03:52.099> the<00:03:52.310> parts<00:03:52.579> that<00:03:52.639> aren't

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
distressing that the parts that aren't

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.149 
distressing that the parts that aren't
showing<00:03:53.180> through<00:03:53.450> because<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.530> nail<00:03:54.680> polish

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
showing through because the nail polish

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.660 
showing through because the nail polish
will<00:03:55.849> beat<00:03:56.450> up<00:03:56.629> any<00:03:57.019> of<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.670> water-based

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
will beat up any of the water-based

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.690 
will beat up any of the water-based
products<00:03:59.329> so<00:04:00.010> anything<00:04:01.010> that's<00:04:01.159> not<00:04:01.280> showing

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.280 
products so anything that's not showing
should<00:04:02.090> be<00:04:02.209> able<00:04:02.299> to<00:04:02.450> be<00:04:02.569> distressing<00:04:02.989> or

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
should be able to be distressing or

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
another one kind of a mess but it was my

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.610 
another one kind of a mess but it was my
first<00:04:12.530> attempt<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:13.099> that's<00:04:13.670> okay<00:04:14.019> so<00:04:15.019> this<00:04:15.379> one

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
first attempt so that's okay so this one

first attempt so that's okay so this one
though<00:04:15.769> is<00:04:15.949> really<00:04:16.729> cool<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.000> cannot<00:04:17.419> wait<00:04:17.720> till

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
though is really cool I cannot wait till

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.180 
though is really cool I cannot wait till
this<00:04:18.079> dries<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.680> this<00:04:18.799> will<00:04:18.949> end<00:04:19.070> up

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
this dries and this will end up

down<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:31.820> stain<00:04:32.210> what<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.080> recommend<00:04:33.560> is<00:04:33.710> I

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
down the stain what I recommend is I

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.310 
down the stain what I recommend is I
just<00:04:34.099> took<00:04:34.370> an<00:04:34.490> old<00:04:34.610> piece<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.000> book<00:04:35.930> text<00:04:36.229> I

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
just took an old piece of book text I

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.050 
just took an old piece of book text I
have<00:04:36.349> so<00:04:36.710> much<00:04:36.889> of<00:04:37.099> this<00:04:37.220> and<00:04:37.280> just<00:04:37.729> kind<00:04:37.940> of

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
have so much of this and just kind of

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.540 
have so much of this and just kind of
dip<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.080> in<00:04:39.199> there<00:04:39.349> and<00:04:39.970> wipe<00:04:40.970> up<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.210> rest

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
dip it in there and wipe up the rest

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.750 
dip it in there and wipe up the rest
because<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:43.580> do<00:04:43.849> not<00:04:44.030> want<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:46.370> nail<00:04:46.550> polish

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
because you do not want that nail polish

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.820 
because you do not want that nail polish
going<00:04:47.270> down<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.570> drain<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:48.050> cool<00:04:48.560> thing<00:04:48.800> is

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
going down the drain the cool thing is

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.310 
going down the drain the cool thing is
if<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.310> see<00:04:49.340> it<00:04:50.120> kind<00:04:50.419> of<00:04:50.510> beads<00:04:50.810> up<00:04:51.020> on<00:04:51.199> the

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
if you see it kind of beads up on the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.560 
if you see it kind of beads up on the
book<00:04:51.500> text<00:04:51.979> so<00:04:52.669> you<00:04:52.729> could<00:04:52.880> actually<00:04:53.090> adhere

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
book text so you could actually adhere

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.939
