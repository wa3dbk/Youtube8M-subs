00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.400
 Hi guys 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:19.710
 here we are in this new wood test 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:24.289
 I'm here today to introduce you to the shredder 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:28.730
 john deere and 71 80 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.859
 this is a v 1 so we have to 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.989
 expect improvements in my opinion 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.920
 however we say that it is already a good one 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:48.050
 then he tricks the actress accompanied by 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.050
 460 fair game head with eight rows 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:56.730
 gets dirty at a very high dirt yes 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.079
 dirty in about three hours I for reasons of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.300
 time spent the dirt ten minutes to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.280
 being able to make the video 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.970
 anyway I have to say see how the dirt is 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 as very emphasized also on the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:19.860
 cutting bar and even dirty wheels 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.500
 I think they should have increased one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.460
 even the dirt above the car 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.700
 see also the boat 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.590
 here in my opinion the only flaw that knows that 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:39.479
 on the dinghy here when you have some 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.350
 close with the wagon with the tractor yes 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:46.770
 sees the shredded in this at the point 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.910
 where the dinghy at the joint 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.610
 I think it's something they must 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:56.830
 improve anyway already a good one 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:02.110
 shred we go inside but nothing 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.750
 special we have the odometer in 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.940
 top right then I have to say he has it 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.040
 steering that wanting in the dance button 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.230
 we turn on the steering wheel which is a little bit 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.880
 slow see in the turn if I want 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.670
 go to the other side it takes me a while 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.350
 more 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:25.470
 which I think they will have to fix 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.150
 the stain ta boys to the operation 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.820
 I use this here which is already dirty not 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.080
 I'm there to use the other one that is 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:41.020
 spotlessly clean 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:44.590
 also sees how braking is a bit 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.160
 let's take ballerina then let's take it 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.530
 four files because it is an 8 file then 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.040
 we can move loose mirrors 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.810
 nardi has nothing in particular but 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.820
 nothing animated inside the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.770
 cabin 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:06.370
 hopefully in future versions 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:10.960
 let's light up our shredder 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:17.100
 green that in mind was the vara in front is 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:21.040
 animated that starts slowly and then gets loud 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.420
 from a moment ahead you show up 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.040
 a little see how we tighten a little like this 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.880
 we throw it away 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.000
 and also 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.100
 there is also particle on the blade 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.950
 Now let's do something devil laborer 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.250
 and let's go and get our best 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.970
 wagon Giovecca Mincione we are in the middle 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.060
 to 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:52.240
 I speak I ask and give sugar as k sua 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.240
 speed because it goes to about 10 against 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.650
 today 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.650
 we close the machines 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.780
 yes it is not nothing we hope for 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:18.370
 future version that there is something in 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.370
 more is a little improved 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.800
 see if I approach you see 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.189
 practically on the boat you see here in the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.610
 point where the boat is lowered for the 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:38.189
 direction of the shredded sees if I do 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:42.490
 I see a little the shredded that I approach 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:45.430
 that comes out instead I go away there 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.400
 he sees nothing or temple, I walk away 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.300
 civil pyro 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.770
 anyway 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.960
 it means that the first version is not 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:58.020
 nothing bad wants to change does not want 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.139
 shred with 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.729
 the crone 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:06.050
 can do it safely with this one 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.349
 even if the head is slightly 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.919
 small hopefully maybe even one 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:17.289
 next version maybe create the 475 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:20.740
 tip ten raw files from the moment 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.740
 we can't complain 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:28.510
 it has a power of 380 horses 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.980
 beach 10 kilometers per hour as always 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:37.910
 at a road speed of 43 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:40.639
 very fast kilometers here 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.469
 it is not has nothing to say 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.580
 I wanted to present for the second reason 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:45.580
 deserves me 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.890
 is a first version we hope more with 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:55.409
 other publishing models also come out 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:59.569
 there are many of them in circulation and 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:02.879
 no guys after this short video 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:05.039
 I give you an appointment with the first one 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:09.239
 boys episode of my home of 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:11.070
 farming simulator 15 

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:13.160
 indeed we go down 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:19.700
 stoppiamo 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:25.790
 the medium you see how very pretty it has the 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:32.680
 I play a little bit of the akron but it doesn't do it 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:36.910
 see also the blade that bends in 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:46.010
 four segments 2 fixed and two that yes 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:47.950
 I raise the fashion vertically well 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:54.170
 satisfied 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:56.600
 I think it has a mod that deserves me well 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:07:00.550
 I greet you and give you an appointment at a 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.550
 next video bye bye
