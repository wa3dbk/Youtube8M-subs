now one other cool thing is that you can
actually<00:04:32.820> remove<00:04:33.389> the<00:04:33.539> holster<00:04:33.900> from<00:04:34.020> the

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
actually remove the holster from the

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.050 
actually remove the holster from the
belt<00:04:34.409> as<00:04:34.590> well<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:35.430> there's<00:04:35.580> actually<00:04:35.699> just<00:04:36.030> a

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
belt as well so there's actually just a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.909 
belt as well so there's actually just a
peg<00:04:36.240> on<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.479> side<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.930> can<00:04:37.050> pop<00:04:37.260> that<00:04:37.440> off<00:04:37.680> I

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
peg on the side you can pop that off I

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.200 
peg on the side you can pop that off I
guess<00:04:38.070> that<00:04:38.280> way<00:04:38.430> if<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.699> ever<00:04:38.729> want<00:04:39.120> to

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
guess that way if you ever want to

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.300 
guess that way if you ever want to
change<00:04:39.900> things<00:04:40.199> up<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.680> take<00:04:40.860> his<00:04:41.010> holster

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
change things up and take his holster

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
off you can have just the harness by

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.450 
off you can have just the harness by
itself<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.349> can<00:04:43.500> have<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.770> leg<00:04:43.919> holster<00:04:44.190> by

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
I said in the beginning this is probably
