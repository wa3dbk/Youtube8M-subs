okay<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.540> you're<00:00:10.530> here<00:00:10.769> because<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:11.130> want<00:00:11.160> to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
okay so you're here because you want to

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.610 
okay so you're here because you want to
know<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> little<00:00:11.790> bit<00:00:11.940> more<00:00:12.150> about<00:00:12.330> elo<00:00:12.870> well

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
know a little bit more about elo well

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.620 
know a little bit more about elo well
let's<00:00:14.070> find<00:00:14.250> out<00:00:14.370> where<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.849> how<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.420> come

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
let's find out where and how it come

let's find out where and how it come
about<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.139> then<00:00:16.680> move<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.160> how<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.460> works

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
about and then move on to how it works

more sound statistical basis which was

more sound statistical basis which was
then<00:00:55.469> implemented<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> 1960s<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.719> i

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
then implemented in the 1960s which i

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.900 
then implemented in the 1960s which i
think<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.350> kind<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.680> funny<00:00:58.920> because<00:00:59.129> Harkness

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
think is kind of funny because Harkness

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.459 
think is kind of funny because Harkness

1959 could there be a connection there
the<00:01:08.010> Harkness<00:01:08.369> leaving<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.119> then<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.299> year

so the player wins a game he's assumed

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.140 
so the player wins a game he's assumed
to<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.740> performed<00:02:02.280> at<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> higher<00:02:02.700> level<00:02:02.729> than

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
to have performed at a higher level than

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.810 
to have performed at a higher level than
his<00:02:03.420> opponent<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.560> game<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.610> other

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
his opponent for that game on the other

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.090 
his opponent for that game on the other
hand<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.360> he<00:02:06.420> loses<00:02:06.810> he<00:02:07.409> would<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.710> performed

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
hand if he loses he would have performed

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.190 
hand if he loses he would have performed
a<00:02:08.250> lower<00:02:08.459> level<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.330> draw<00:02:09.600> means<00:02:09.929> they

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
a lower level and the draw means they

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.220 
a lower level and the draw means they
performed<00:02:10.709> equally<00:02:11.600> now<00:02:12.600> we<00:02:12.660> got<00:02:12.930> all<00:02:13.080> that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
performed equally now we got all that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.680 
performed equally now we got all that
out<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.560> way<00:02:13.680> what<00:02:14.100> does<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:14.430> mean

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
out the way what does it all mean

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.820 
out the way what does it all mean
basically<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.810> rating<00:02:16.170> system<00:02:16.350> will<00:02:16.650> work

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
basically the rating system will work

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.500 
basically the rating system will work
out<00:02:17.069> who<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.459> thinks<00:02:17.790> should<00:02:17.910> win<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.330> lose

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
out who it thinks should win and lose

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.140 
out who it thinks should win and lose
each<00:02:18.720> game<00:02:19.110> during<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.130> placement<00:02:20.400> your<00:02:20.880> wins
