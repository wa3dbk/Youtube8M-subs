00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.950
 here you can see the installation of the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.280
 spotlights four long- range spotlights 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.680
 the top two front and the two front 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.310
 down normally dirigibles towards the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.890
 sides in this case you can see them 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.860
 forward but it 's very easy to 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.690
 direct simply by turning 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.800
 can be directed to the sides of the 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.800
 very practical road 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.800
 here you will see the installation of the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.050
 spotlights 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.750
 the positive cables come out of the battery 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.490
 negative 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.490
 they have a tiny fuse 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.500
 and here you can see the relays one and the other 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.270
 inside you can see the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.870
 very simple switches and very 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.870
 little ones 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.260
 reacts on the relay that previously 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.260
 it has been taught 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.090
 here you can see the installation of the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.750
 second battery that is below the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.210
 seat with its two turntable 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.760
 12 volt sockets with cover 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.340
 and placed here below the switch 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:47.070
 to look at the state of the battery 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.070
 as you can see 12 and a half 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.310
 on the other seat base 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.500
 there is the heating output and a 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.750
 output of 220 the converter is stuck 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.820
 below the base of the seat and also 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.640
 it goes with a switch below 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.640
 to be able to have the 220 current 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.219
 a static heating thermostat 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.219
 It's behind 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.780
 with programmer 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.530
 and thermostat 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.390
 as you see the operation of the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.400
 rotating platform is very simple 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.310
 you just have to advance a little 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.599
 seat 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.599
 at the end the lever 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.220
 and then we have the seat rotated 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.970
 that allows us to have space 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.970
 rear 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.810
 here you can see the installation of 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.940
 fluorescent in the frame behind the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.800
 door 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.320
 very practical because it gives a lot of light 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.640
 rather more than the LEDs even though 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.980
 consume more 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.819
 and on the other side other core people the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.819
 door entrance 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.790
 You can also see a thermometer with 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.560
 indoor and outdoor temperature with 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.060
 maximum and minimum very interesting for 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.990
 sleep inside and know at what temperature 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.990
 we have arrived 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.890
 the outer probe 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:41.870
 in a very interesting place below the 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.790
 of the rear-view mirror so that the sun does not 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.790
 and the temperature is not affected 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.220
 There I will teach Furniture 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.760
 own manufacture very interesting and very 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.430
 practical since it is a long van and 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.080
 we have taken advantage of the extra space to 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.990
 put this piece of furniture 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.120
 size sinks Kitchen 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.540
 From home 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.269
 or from the tap 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.019
 sliding doors with the stove inside 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.019
 to be able to take 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.560
 some very interesting drawers 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.940
 and very practical that are opened by both 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.940
 sides both inside and outside 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.469
 and on the other side you can see the deposit 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.469
 Water 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.870
 and the connections 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.870
 pertinent 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.720
 likewise this side practical drawers 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.720
 more tiny 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.320
 a drain 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:05.540
 directly 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.930
 he got out of the van I do not know if what 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.930
 you know well 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:20.010
 and very very easy to put on and take off 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.910
 with a screw each side one of this 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.969
 side 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:30.249
 and another on the other side equally 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.249
 now it would be under the furniture 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.560
 on the inside it is very easy 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.580
 access also and the same drawers are 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.580
 can open on both sides 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.860
 casseroles dishes food 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.620
 the small light inside 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.740
 you see is accessible inside and through 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:03.090
 outside 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.120
 As you can see it is an art 4x4 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:09.320
 the wheels have been modified 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.320
 for more traction 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.650
 with larger wheels 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:20.080
 that allow a lot of grip in snow of 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.080
 mud sand and so on 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:38.060
 the tires or the outer rain of 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:38.060
 goodrich measured at 225 75 16 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:46.000
 a windshield very easy to assemble 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:50.080
 and very practical 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.570
 for when it rains you can have the 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.570
 open window without entering the water 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.200
 the roof network allows us to carry 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.280
 all insulators without us dealing 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.950
 space 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.460
 in the van without them being so 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.460
 annoying
