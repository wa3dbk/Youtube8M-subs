 we want to show the method of dealing with sulfur 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.840
 rotten 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.730
 we use these drugs 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.090
 robaro is called 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:22.050

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.289
 one to one his titel is now right 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.289
 rally 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.520
 doing so what happened on 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.010
 creamy mass right now it's 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.010
 the world took add as much had 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.110
 it's because that's definitively mix 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.570
 we got such a substance see 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:53.610
 She is more or less thick. 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.610
 now let's go look for the ward shoulder 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.300
 now he has such a brush 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.719
 this tassels bum from the temple ass 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.390
 do gray rot all ragnit appeared 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.840
 due to torrential rains 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.430
 the whole week you can see here and the nation 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.909
 it is impossible to walk only in boots 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.630
 very dirty cheese and it was impossible 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:22.229
 open greenhouses for full airing 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.460
 these plates had a temperature of about 25 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.640
 degrees average and such cheese is wet 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.030
 because of this began to develop gray 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.959
 rot 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.799
 gray rot is known to be a fungus 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:39.509
 fungus is the most mushroom time mushroom weather 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.590
 here we have places now we will find 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.259
 show how it manifests itself can be seen 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.709
 place we have where ferragni 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:54.959
 amazes us well this way we 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:58.830
 coat it dries and we save 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:00.780
 taste and further death you need 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.080
 pass warm we usually do 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.300
 so what is the watershed we go through the greenhouses 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.489
 notice the places where we came 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.110
 down here we put it a little bit 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:16.290

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.159
 development 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.489

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:29.499

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.219
 this place will be dry for us then 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.939
 the crust is covered 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:39.340
 and we will not have Sergei here she can be seen 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:44.280
 after all, even a cucumber is amazed too 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.900
