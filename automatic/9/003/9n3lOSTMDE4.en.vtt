hi<00:00:11.940> guys<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.540> today's<00:00:12.809> video<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.170> just<00:00:13.230> going

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
hi guys so today's video is just going

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.169 
hi guys so today's video is just going
to<00:00:13.590> be<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> short<00:00:13.950> one<00:00:14.099> because<00:00:14.460> today<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.759> wanted

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
to be a short one because today I wanted

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.120 
to be a short one because today I wanted
to<00:00:15.240> talk<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.719> about<00:00:15.900> minimum<00:00:16.379> cage<00:00:16.590> sizes

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
to talk to you about minimum cage sizes

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.710 
to talk to you about minimum cage sizes
so<00:00:17.340> depending<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:17.760> where<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.029> come<00:00:18.060> from<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
so depending on where you come from the

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.240 
so depending on where you come from the
minimum<00:00:19.020> cage<00:00:19.230> size<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.980> vary

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
minimum cage size is going to vary

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.189 
minimum cage size is going to vary
slightly<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.359> course<00:00:21.510> there<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> lot<00:00:22.170> of

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
slightly so of course there is a lot of

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.840 
slightly so of course there is a lot of
debate<00:00:22.529> over<00:00:22.710> which<00:00:22.949> country<00:00:23.310> has<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.580> best

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
debate over which country has the best

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.609 
debate over which country has the best
minimum<00:00:24.330> size<00:00:24.539> I'm<00:00:24.840> not<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> go<00:00:25.470> into

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
minimum size I'm not going to go into

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.019 
minimum size I'm not going to go into
that<00:00:25.710> today<00:00:26.010> I'm<00:00:26.189> just<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.609> go<00:00:26.730> into

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
that today I'm just going to go into

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.970 
that today I'm just going to go into
what<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.750> minimum<00:00:28.050> sizes<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.650> because<00:00:28.920> I

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
what the minimum sizes are because I

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.140 
what the minimum sizes are because I
think<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.369> an<00:00:29.429> interesting<00:00:29.640> topic

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
think it's an interesting topic

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.450 
think it's an interesting topic
especially<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.199> how<00:00:31.410> much<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> size<00:00:31.980> is<00:00:32.189> vary

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
especially on how much the size is vary

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.979 
especially on how much the size is vary
from<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.149> side<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> world<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> other

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
from one side of the world to the other

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.900 
from one side of the world to the other
now<00:00:34.410> because<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> US<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.460> Canada<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
now because in the US and Canada you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.910 
now because in the US and Canada you
measure<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.300> cages<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.870> square<00:00:37.230> inches<00:00:37.710> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
measure your cages in square inches and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.709 
measure your cages in square inches and
in<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.399> rest<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> world<00:00:39.090> we<00:00:39.300> measure<00:00:39.510> them

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
in the rest of the world we measure them

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.510 
in the rest of the world we measure them
in<00:00:39.750> centimeters<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.559> inches<00:00:40.739> I'm<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.460> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
in centimeters and inches I'm going to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
in centimeters and inches I'm going to
be<00:00:41.610> doing<00:00:41.760> some<00:00:42.000> converting<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.840> can

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
be doing some converting so you can

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.540 
be doing some converting so you can
understand<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> no<00:00:43.739> matter<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.010> measurement

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
understand it no matter what measurement

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490 
understand it no matter what measurement
you<00:00:44.640> use<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.239> an<00:00:45.390> extra<00:00:45.719> helpful<00:00:45.930> guide<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> also

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
you use as an extra helpful guide I also

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.560 
you use as an extra helpful guide I also
use<00:00:46.739> some<00:00:46.920> string<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> set<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.820> some<00:00:48.000> example

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
use some string to set up some example

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.450 
use some string to set up some example
cages<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.559> roughly<00:00:50.070> what<00:00:50.340> you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
cages so you can see roughly what you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.770 
cages so you can see roughly what you
could<00:00:50.579> fit<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> cage<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.270> how<00:00:51.449> big<00:00:51.660> they

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
could fit in the cage and how big they

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.330 
could fit in the cage and how big they
are<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.020> comparison<00:00:52.680> don't<00:00:52.949> forget<00:00:53.219> guys

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
are in comparison don't forget guys

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.040 
are in comparison don't forget guys
every<00:00:53.730> country<00:00:54.059> believes<00:00:54.360> differently<00:00:54.539> so

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
every country believes differently so

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.600 
every country believes differently so
please<00:00:55.260> don't<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.590> arguing<00:00:55.980> or<00:00:56.100> fighting<00:00:56.129> over

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
please don't be arguing or fighting over

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
please don't be arguing or fighting over
which<00:00:56.730> cage<00:00:57.030> size<00:00:57.239> minimum<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.719> best<00:00:58.020> just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
which cage size minimum is best just

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.319 
which cage size minimum is best just
choose<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.460> believe<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.879> best<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
choose one that you believe is best and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.869 
choose one that you believe is best and
stick<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.770> minimum<00:01:02.129> cage<00:01:02.399> sizes

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
stick with that so minimum cage sizes

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.789 
stick with that so minimum cage sizes
are<00:01:03.059> measured<00:01:03.480> by<00:01:03.510> length<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.229> width<00:01:04.559> you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
are measured by length and width you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.219 
are measured by length and width you
never<00:01:05.100> include<00:01:05.489> height<00:01:05.760> levels<00:01:06.570> extensions

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
never include height levels extensions

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.330 
never include height levels extensions
anything<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.770> when<00:01:08.070> you're<00:01:08.189> measuring

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
anything like that when you're measuring

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.280 
anything like that when you're measuring
cages<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.150> reason<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
cages the reason for this is because in

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.899 
cages the reason for this is because in
the<00:01:10.380> wild<00:01:10.560> hamsters<00:01:11.159> would<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.460> free<00:01:11.700> range

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the wild hamsters would have free range

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.060 
the wild hamsters would have free range
of<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.119> very<00:01:12.299> large<00:01:12.570> open<00:01:12.869> area<00:01:13.470> which<00:01:13.860> means

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
of a very large open area which means

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.789 
of a very large open area which means
minimum<00:01:14.460> cage<00:01:14.700> sizes<00:01:15.119> apply<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.259> large

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
minimum cage sizes apply to one large

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.859 
minimum cage sizes apply to one large
area<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.400> floor<00:01:17.820> space<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.630> why

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
area of floor space and this is why

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
area of floor space and this is why
nobody<00:01:19.200> recommend<00:01:19.890> modular<00:01:20.340> cages<00:01:20.759> like

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
nobody recommend modular cages like

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.300 
nobody recommend modular cages like
rotor<00:01:21.390> stack<00:01:21.750> Habitrail<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.950> ones<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
rotor stack Habitrail and the ones that

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.980 
rotor stack Habitrail and the ones that
critter<00:01:23.490> trail<00:01:23.759> sometimes<00:01:24.180> make<00:01:24.390> modular

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
critter trail sometimes make modular

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.810 
critter trail sometimes make modular
cages<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.830> unnatural<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
cages are just really unnatural and the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.920 
cages are just really unnatural and the
only<00:01:26.939> thing<00:01:27.119> they're<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> simulate<00:01:27.630> is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
only thing they're going to simulate is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.719 
only thing they're going to simulate is
the<00:01:28.049> burrowing<00:01:28.380> area<00:01:28.890> which<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> hamster

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the burrowing area which the hamster

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.490 
the burrowing area which the hamster
isn't<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.689> day<00:01:30.720> anyway<00:01:31.200> so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
isn't going to be in all day anyway so

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.690 
isn't going to be in all day anyway so
it's<00:01:31.680> very<00:01:31.799> important<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.430> once<00:01:32.579> you've

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it's very important that once you've

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.130 
it's very important that once you've
chosen<00:01:32.939> what<00:01:33.240> minimum<00:01:33.600> size<00:01:33.780> you're<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
chosen what minimum size you're going to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.810 
chosen what minimum size you're going to
stick<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.009> make<00:01:35.189> sure<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.610> covers

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
stick with that you make sure it covers

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.120 
stick with that you make sure it covers
one<00:01:36.329> large<00:01:36.900> area<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.590> floor<00:01:37.829> space

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
one large area of floor space

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.130 
one large area of floor space
so<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> first<00:01:39.000> minimum<00:01:39.390> cage<00:01:39.630> size<00:01:39.840> ago<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
so the first minimum cage size ago to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
so the first minimum cage size ago to
show<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> one<00:01:40.920> used<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> US<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
show you is the one used in the US and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.700 
show you is the one used in the US and
Canada<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.990> from<00:01:43.170> these<00:01:43.350> countries

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
Canada so if you from these countries

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.639 
Canada so if you from these countries
your<00:01:43.890> cage<00:01:44.100> minimum<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.899> 360<00:01:45.899> square<00:01:45.960> inches

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
your cage minimum is 360 square inches

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.020 
your cage minimum is 360 square inches
now<00:01:46.890> I've<00:01:47.009> converted<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.610> into<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
now I've converted this into a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.240 
now I've converted this into a
centimeter<00:01:48.630> inch<00:01:48.899> equivalent<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.100> is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
centimeter inch equivalent and it is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.389 
centimeter inch equivalent and it is
equivalent<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.880> 24<00:01:51.630> inches<00:01:51.990> by<00:01:52.350> 15<00:01:52.979> inches

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
equivalent to 24 inches by 15 inches

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.300

which<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.700> 61<00:01:54.450> by<00:01:54.689> 38<00:01:55.259> centimeters<00:01:55.979> now

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
which is 61 by 38 centimeters now

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.920 
which is 61 by 38 centimeters now
currently<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> US<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.210> Canada<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.719> the

currently the US and Canada have the
smallest<00:01:58.229> minimum<00:01:58.740> that's<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.280> necessarily

smallest minimum that's not necessarily

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.010 
smallest minimum that's not necessarily
a<00:01:59.880> bad<00:02:00.060> thing<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.810> always<00:02:00.930> worth

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
a bad thing but it's always worth

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.719 
a bad thing but it's always worth
looking<00:02:01.530> into<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> bigger<00:02:01.920> sizes<00:02:02.189> as<00:02:02.490> well

looking into the bigger sizes as well
the<00:02:02.969> next<00:02:03.240> minimum<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:03.990> used<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.409> most
