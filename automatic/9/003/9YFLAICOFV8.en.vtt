00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 friends saying furnace we proceed to one 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.950
 videorecensione a little particular seen 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.769
 what we talk about not the iPhone 6 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.519
 obviously that will be released on September 9th 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.590
 but of a clone of this phone that there 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.390
 will be useful to understand how well or how 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.390
 will be the new apple product 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:32.690
 so here we are at the review this 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.460
 phone I want to show the first 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.250
 presale pack that could 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.530
 be useful to understand what will be there 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.080
 inside the official one anyway 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.739
 we have a booklet where inside 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:51.920
 we find the paper clip to extract the 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:57.110
 vain of sigma plus a small booklet this 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:01.159
 photocopied case then we have the cable 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.909
 data always lighting usb lighting 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:07.420
 obviously therefore less pins with a good one 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.860
 head here we have the power supply 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.520
 obviously to insert a Chinese visa 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.560
 that we took it from and then we have the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.820
 headphones of an iphone in the version 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.659
 previous one 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.170
 let's go back to the device where obviously 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.810
 indeed if the most important part like this 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.939
 should be the model with display 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.640
 4.7 inches 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.520
 let's try to compare it with a 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.350
 iphone 5 we have here this is 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.180
 original of course just to understand 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.140
 a bit of size as you can see 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.399
 the thickness increases lateral part of the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.770
 profile we have the three keys the one for 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.680
 put in silent the volume keys 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.079
 which in this case if the design was 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.380
 confirmed are narrower and longer 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.420
 compared to the classic apple heads 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.229
 top 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.200
 here we have the iPhone 5 we have the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.660
 ignition key release lock 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.810
 in the iPhone 6 should be removed and 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.090
 placed positioned here along the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.190
 just to facilitate use with 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.780
 a single hand as to get on 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.520
 upper part to proceed to 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.160
 release would be a little 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.750
 uncomfortable lower part we have the plug 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.540
 of inserting the three audio jack 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.010
 half the main microphone the entrance 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:38.349
 of the lighting cable plus the speaker there 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:43.040
 of system that in this case mono and then 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.790
 back we have the camera 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.049
 than in this 13 megapixel model 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.650
 it should be the same 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.840
 that of the second apple plus microphone 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.319
 the logo on the front instead 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.599
 we have a camera on that 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.730
 1.9 megapixel model with 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.140
 first sensor tank speaker 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.769
 of proximity brightness 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.459
 you can see the layout as it is 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.099
 different and then lower part we have 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.140
 here what should be tacelli 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.450
 in this model in this clone 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.810
 obviously the sensor is not present 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.350
 so just show this famous 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:30.190
 metal ring I want to show 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.190
 also gives her a little all 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:42.800
 angles the various differences and in 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.540
 last the thickness 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.220
 let's put aside 5 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.980
 I want to show respect to a 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:58.520
 5-inch device like xiaomi 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.520
 I mean the difference of the display 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.239
 he did a good job of me 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.790
 size distribution since 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.640
 they are more or less the same height though 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:18.230
 the display is bigger and we're talking about 5 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:21.720
 we also put inches against a 4.7 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.160
 frontal year well or badly the same 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.700
 measures 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.290
 let's also put the show aside 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.750
 we return to the device obviously a 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.580
 board there is an android version in this 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:38.750
 clone the fluidity we say is enough 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.180
 I had also done a test 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.890
 benchmark on youtube here you can see 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.720
 all the features including the 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:50.370
 android version for 4.3 the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.290
 processor is a tech media 65 m 2 la 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.070
 short screen resolution 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.289
 quite low we have 960 x 540 la 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.539
 front camera 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.119
 I apologize back 13 megapixel 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:06.270
 as I mentioned before, the GPU is 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:10.619
 a bad 400 front camera from one 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:14.749
 and nine more to note is obviously not there 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:19.080
 the nfc there is no touch is still a 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:23.520
 phone that in the result reaches 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:27.449
 this scaffolding obviously this 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.270
 similar launcher taste version 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:35.509
 has some features like the 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:38.399
 settings we also have the generals 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:42.569
 I didn't go too far back 

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:45.719
 the touch is not really comfortable but 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.869
 however quite responsive anyway 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:51.119
 here are all the various ones 

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:54.389
 settings I want to show you too 

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:58.680
 the notifications panel we have the 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:02.729
 ability to manage notifications here 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.949
 below those relating to brightness e 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:09.180
 we also have the extra music player 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:15.569
 the torch as you can see works the 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:17.879
 calculator compass tested before a 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:21.029
 in short, making two accounts is one 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:23.069
 ios version 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:26.599
 let's say the classic based launcher 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:28.910
 on the version I believe 8 of of ios 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:32.000
 in short, one 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.130
 this version only one and it works and not 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.430
 works the touch is not convincing but 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:40.880
 however the purpose of this review is 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.790
 show him how it could be 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.540
 measures of a of a new of the new 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.400
 iphone 6 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.430
 I also want to show the possibility 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.050
 to handle everything with one hand 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.070
 only the screen one hand 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.070
 I can get there 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:00.260
 we say in all of them in all corners 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.510
 of the screen a little tired maybe up 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.620
 this side last part I want to do 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:13.570
 see also the software of the 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:16.690
 camera or less similar to the original 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.040
 therefore a device that could 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.160
 to be like this I want to show also the 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.640
 display turned on the difference between 5 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.930
 and what should be the 6 with 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.670
 this review we all meet again 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.670
 to the next a greeting from luca
