today's lesson you're going to learn

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.140 
today's lesson you're going to learn
what<00:00:19.140> diatonic<00:00:19.890> harmony<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.699> how<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> use

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
what diatonic harmony is and how to use

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.480 
what diatonic harmony is and how to use
it<00:00:21.180> how<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.900> take<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.350> basic<00:00:22.769> ideas<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.220> you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
it how to take the basic ideas that you

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.670 
it how to take the basic ideas that you
composed<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.180> lesson<00:00:24.539> 1<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.080> make<00:00:25.320> them<00:00:25.470> fit

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
composed in lesson 1 and make them fit

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.160 
composed in lesson 1 and make them fit
over<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> new<00:00:26.039> harmony<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:27.300> inversions

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
over a new harmony and what inversions

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.380 
over a new harmony and what inversions
are<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.619> how<00:00:29.010> composers<00:00:29.519> use<00:00:29.550> them<00:00:30.029> you'll

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
are and how composers use them you'll

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.870 
are and how composers use them you'll
notice<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.900> outlining<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:31.650> chord<00:00:32.130> limits

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
notice that outlining one chord limits

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.400 
notice that outlining one chord limits
what<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.510> with<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.809> basic<00:00:34.260> idea

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
what you can do with that basic idea

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.290 
what you can do with that basic idea
that's<00:00:35.130> why<00:00:35.309> today<00:00:35.579> we're<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> look<00:00:36.090> at

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that's why today we're going to look at

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.240 
that's why today we're going to look at
changing<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.930> underlying<00:00:37.050> harmony<00:00:37.920> while

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
changing the underlying harmony while

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.040 
changing the underlying harmony while
still<00:00:38.640> keeping<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> character<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.780> same

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
still keeping the character the same

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
still keeping the character the same
listen<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.920> example<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.670> basic<00:00:41.879> idea

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
listen to this example of a basic idea

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.299 
listen to this example of a basic idea
the<00:00:43.050> first<00:00:43.320> two<00:00:43.500> bars<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.950> written<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the first two bars are written in the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.369 
the first two bars are written in the
home<00:00:44.489> key<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.600> learned<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.989> lesson

one but the second two bars are written
over<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.870> new<00:00:49.110> harmony

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.500 

this<00:01:01.559> specific<00:01:01.859> example<00:01:02.699> changes<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
this specific example changes the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.270 
this specific example changes the
underlying<00:01:03.870> harmony<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> second<00:01:05.129> most

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
underlying harmony to the second most

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.330 
underlying harmony to the second most

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.280 
important harmony in tonal music
dominant<00:01:08.509> so<00:01:09.509> let's<00:01:09.720> look<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.110> more

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
dominant so let's look a little more

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.310 
dominant so let's look a little more
in-depth<00:01:10.649> at<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:10.979> diatonic<00:01:11.610> harmony<00:01:11.970> is

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
in-depth at what diatonic harmony is

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.770 
in-depth at what diatonic harmony is
diatonic<00:01:13.320> harmony<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.030> chords<00:01:15.030> built<00:01:15.570> off<00:01:15.750> of

diatonic harmony is chords built off of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.469 
diatonic harmony is chords built off of
each<00:01:16.170> note<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.799> scale<00:01:17.119> using<00:01:18.119> thirds

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
each note in a scale using thirds

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.380 
each note in a scale using thirds
without<00:01:19.409> accidentals<00:01:20.250> there<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.149> one

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
without accidentals there is one

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.389 
without accidentals there is one
exception<00:01:21.690> to<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.170> rule<00:01:22.289> if<00:01:22.890> you're<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
exception to this rule if you're in a

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.179 
exception to this rule if you're in a
minor<00:01:23.700> key<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.990> raise<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.710> seventh

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
minor key you want to raise the seventh

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.700 
minor key you want to raise the seventh
note<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.939> scale<00:01:27.170> also<00:01:28.170> known<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
note in the scale also known as the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.790 
note in the scale also known as the
leading<00:01:29.130> tone<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:30.299> reason<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.439> only<00:01:31.679> a

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
leading tone the reason is it's only a

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.760 
leading tone the reason is it's only a
half<00:01:32.190> step<00:01:32.580> away<00:01:32.759> from<00:01:33.390> tonic<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.619> gives

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
half step away from tonic and it gives

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.919 
half step away from tonic and it gives
it<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> much<00:01:35.069> stronger<00:01:35.610> pull<00:01:36.060> listen<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.840> this

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
it a much stronger pull listen to this

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.410 
it a much stronger pull listen to this
example<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.649> a<00:01:37.770> dominant<00:01:38.190> chord<00:01:38.429> without<00:01:39.149> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
example of a dominant chord without the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.600 
example of a dominant chord without the
raise<00:01:39.600> leading<00:01:39.960> tone<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.440> then<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:41.039> with<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
raise leading tone and then one with the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:52.039 
raise leading tone and then one with the
raise<00:01:41.789> leading<00:01:42.210> tone

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.420 

let's<00:01:53.049> look<00:01:53.200> at<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.380> few<00:01:53.590> different<00:01:53.950> chords<00:01:54.250> in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
let's look at a few different chords in

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.960 
let's look at a few different chords in
C<00:01:55.000> major<00:01:55.180> tonic<00:01:56.140> has<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.380> third<00:01:56.860> of<00:01:57.100> E<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.670> a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
C major tonic has a third of E and a

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.080 
C major tonic has a third of E and a
fifth<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.540> G<00:01:59.310> we<00:02:00.310> do<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.580> same<00:02:00.789> for<00:02:00.970> other

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
fifth of G we do the same for other

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.620 
fifth of G we do the same for other
chords<00:02:01.509> starting<00:02:02.200> on<00:02:02.470> D<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:03.399> third<00:02:03.759> is<00:02:04.000> F<00:02:04.180> and

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
chords starting on D the third is F and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.279 
chords starting on D the third is F and
the<00:02:05.350> fifth<00:02:05.619> is<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:06.509> now<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:07.570> may<00:02:07.780> have<00:02:07.929> noticed

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
the fifth is a now you may have noticed

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.660 
the fifth is a now you may have noticed
that<00:02:08.349> they<00:02:08.500> have<00:02:08.649> a<00:02:08.679> fundamentally<00:02:09.640> different

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
that they have a fundamentally different

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.509 
that they have a fundamentally different
sound<00:02:10.599> this<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:11.440> because<00:02:11.769> of<00:02:11.920> their<00:02:12.040> tonality

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
sound this is because of their tonality

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.380 
sound this is because of their tonality
the<00:02:13.420> first<00:02:13.720> one<00:02:14.019> C<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.860> major<00:02:15.400> chord<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:15.970> the

tone<00:05:11.319> in<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.770> new<00:05:11.949> harmony

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
tone in the new harmony

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.900 
tone in the new harmony
so<00:05:14.170> if<00:05:14.290> our<00:05:14.410> original<00:05:14.530> harmony<00:05:15.280> is<00:05:15.430> C<00:05:15.700> major

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
so if our original harmony is C major

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.270 
so if our original harmony is C major
and<00:05:16.360> we<00:05:16.600> start<00:05:16.930> on<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.140> note<00:05:17.290> C<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:17.980> we're

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
and we start on the note C and we're

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.880 
and we start on the note C and we're
moving<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.640> G<00:05:18.910> major<00:05:19.150> we've<00:05:19.780> got<00:05:19.990> two<00:05:20.230> potential

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
moving a G major we've got two potential

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.870 
moving a G major we've got two potential
chord<00:05:21.130> tones<00:05:21.400> D<00:05:22.270> or<00:05:22.570> B<00:05:23.200> if<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:24.310> two<00:05:24.490> harmonies

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
chord tones D or B if the two harmonies

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.590 
chord tones D or B if the two harmonies
share<00:05:25.540> a<00:05:25.780> chord<00:05:26.110> tone<00:05:26.200> like<00:05:27.040> C<00:05:27.340> has<00:05:27.610> a<00:05:27.640> G<00:05:28.000> as<00:05:28.150> v

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
share a chord tone like C has a G as v

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.890 
share a chord tone like C has a G as v
and<00:05:28.930> G<00:05:29.530> has<00:05:29.800> a<00:05:29.830> G<00:05:30.160> as<00:05:30.400> the<00:05:30.640> root<00:05:30.910> then<00:05:31.570> you<00:05:31.720> can

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
and G has a G as the root then you can

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.990 
and G has a G as the root then you can
leave<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:32.230> as<00:05:32.350> is<00:05:32.650> now<00:05:33.100> if<00:05:33.220> you<00:05:33.340> have<00:05:33.490> passing

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
leave it as is now if you have passing

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.850 
leave it as is now if you have passing
tones<00:05:34.270> or<00:05:34.510> neighbor<00:05:34.810> tones<00:05:35.140> in<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.440> original

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
tones or neighbor tones in the original

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.490 
tones or neighbor tones in the original
you<00:05:36.490> can<00:05:36.700> add<00:05:36.910> those<00:05:37.180> in<00:05:37.450> to<00:05:37.870> keep<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.200> same

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
you can add those in to keep the same

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.380 
you can add those in to keep the same
general<00:05:38.860> rhythm<00:05:39.250> and<00:05:39.430> melodic<00:05:39.910> shape<00:05:40.180> it

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
general rhythm and melodic shape it

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:53.130 
general rhythm and melodic shape it
should<00:05:41.290> sound<00:05:41.500> something<00:05:41.650> like<00:05:42.040> this

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.960 

both<00:05:54.140> of<00:05:54.320> these<00:05:54.470> methods<00:05:55.010> are<00:05:55.160> forms<00:05:55.640> of<00:05:55.850> a

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
both of these methods are forms of a

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.170 
both of these methods are forms of a
repetition<00:05:57.040> specifically<00:05:58.040> their<00:05:58.520> forms<00:05:58.940> of

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
repetition specifically their forms of

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
statement response repetition the ways

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.420 
statement response repetition the ways
of<00:06:02.540> developing<00:06:03.200> your<00:06:03.260> basic<00:06:03.740> idea<00:06:04.100> that<00:06:04.310> you

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
of developing your basic idea that you

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.670 
of developing your basic idea that you
learned<00:06:04.700> in<00:06:04.850> the<00:06:04.970> first<00:06:05.000> lesson<00:06:05.680> inversion

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
learned in the first lesson inversion

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.340 
learned in the first lesson inversion
retrograde<00:06:07.670> and<00:06:07.850> retrograde<00:06:08.720> inversion<00:06:08.900> all

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
retrograde and retrograde inversion all

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.060 
retrograde and retrograde inversion all
still<00:06:09.950> apply<00:06:10.810> so<00:06:11.810> now<00:06:11.960> you<00:06:12.020> can<00:06:12.230> see<00:06:12.500> from<00:06:12.830> one

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
still apply so now you can see from one
