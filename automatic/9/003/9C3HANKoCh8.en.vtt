as well but I'll say yeah it's gonna be

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.150 
as well but I'll say yeah it's gonna be
quite<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.720> different<00:00:40.079> burger<00:00:40.380> experience<00:00:40.470> for

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
quite a different burger experience for

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
quite a different burger experience for
me<00:00:41.280> particularly<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.270> McDonald's<00:00:42.720> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
me particularly in McDonald's the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
me particularly in McDonald's the
patties<00:00:43.680> themselves<00:00:44.310> look<00:00:44.489> very<00:00:44.700> small<00:00:45.060> to<00:00:45.300> be

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
patties themselves look very small to be

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
patties themselves look very small to be
honest<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.870> bread<00:00:46.079> looks<00:00:46.380> nice<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.890> bun

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
honest the bread looks nice the bun

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.900 
honest the bread looks nice the bun
looks<00:00:47.309> pretty<00:00:47.550> good

looks pretty good

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.000 
looks pretty good
I<00:00:47.940> basically<00:00:48.360> view<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.470> as<00:00:49.590> being<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
I basically view this just as being a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.700 
I basically view this just as being a
glorified<00:00:50.340> double<00:00:51.329> cheeseburger<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.530> go

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
glorified double cheeseburger here we go

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.639 
glorified double cheeseburger here we go
the<00:00:53.100> gram<00:00:53.660> is<00:00:54.660> that<00:01:00.170> we<00:01:01.170> had<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.379> wait<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> very

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the gram is that we had to wait a very

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.139 
the gram is that we had to wait a very
long<00:01:01.890> time<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.460> worth<00:01:02.730> pointing<00:01:03.059> out

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
long time this is worth pointing out

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.020 
long time this is worth pointing out
about<00:01:03.989> 10<00:01:04.259> to<00:01:04.379> 12<00:01:04.559> minutes<00:01:04.789> just<00:01:05.789> because<00:01:05.999> I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
about 10 to 12 minutes just because I

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.190 
about 10 to 12 minutes just because I
asked<00:01:06.179> for<00:01:06.240> no<00:01:06.329> ketchup<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> no<00:01:06.929> one's<00:01:12.200> not

00:01:59.839 --> 00:01:59.849 
double cheeseburger obviously but the

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.399 
double cheeseburger obviously but the
addition<00:02:00.209> of<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.389> those<00:02:00.569> ingredients<00:02:01.049> the
