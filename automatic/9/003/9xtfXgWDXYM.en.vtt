00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
say and then i'm actually going to add a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
say and then i'm actually going to add a
little<00:01:30.900> something<00:01:31.350> extra<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.159> i'm<00:01:32.369> going

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
little something extra to that i'm going

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700 
little something extra to that i'm going
to<00:01:32.579> add<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.150> little<00:01:33.390> border<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.290> which<00:01:34.500> goes

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
to add a little border here which goes

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.999 
to add a little border here which goes
in<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.729> again<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.390> starts<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
in and out again it starts in out and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.520 
in and out again it starts in out and
then<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.369> again<00:01:38.790> okay<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.320> I'm<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
then in again okay and then I'm going to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.130 
then in again okay and then I'm going to
add<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:40.710> stripes<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.750> we<00:01:42.930> go

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
add some stripes in here there we go

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.670 
add some stripes in here there we go
easy<00:01:43.470> peasy<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> paint<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:45.090> glides

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
easy peasy and the paint just glides

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.950 
easy peasy and the paint just glides
right<00:01:46.680> atop<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.520> other<00:01:48.149> paints<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.750> don't

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
right atop that other paints I don't

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.090 
right atop that other paints I don't
have<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> think<00:01:49.320> about<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.680> plus<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:49.979> going

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
have to think about it plus it's going

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.670 
have to think about it plus it's going
to<00:01:50.159> be<00:01:50.250> permanent<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:52.259> going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.590> go

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to be permanent and it's going to go

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.950 
to be permanent and it's going to go
perfectly<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:53.880> art<00:01:54.149> journal<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.689> think<00:01:54.899> I

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
perfectly in my art journal I think I

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.840 
perfectly in my art journal I think I
said<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.619> evil<00:01:55.979> voice<00:01:56.159> there

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
said that in a kind of evil voice there

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.450 
said that in a kind of evil voice there
you<00:01:56.969> go<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.469> I've<00:01:58.619> added<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:59.070> little<00:01:59.250> bit<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
you go and so I've added a little bit of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.910 
you go and so I've added a little bit of
embellishment<00:01:59.909> there<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> could<00:02:00.719> also<00:02:00.990> add<00:02:01.469> in

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
embellishment there I could also add in

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.670 
embellishment there I could also add in
are<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:02.909> called<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> veins<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.140> leaves<00:02:04.350> i

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
are these called the veins and leaves i

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.140 
are these called the veins and leaves i
believe<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.180> add<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
believe you can add the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.719 
believe you can add the
in<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.930> again<00:02:08.290> there's<00:02:08.500> no<00:02:08.560> matter<00:02:09.009> about<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
in and again there's no matter about the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.520 
in and again there's no matter about the
rule<00:02:10.060> of<00:02:10.090> how<00:02:10.479> many<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:10.990> for<00:02:11.140> instance<00:02:11.200> this

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
rule of how many so for instance this

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.470 
rule of how many so for instance this
little<00:02:11.740> tiny<00:02:11.980> leaf<00:02:12.220> could<00:02:12.700> have<00:02:12.820> many<00:02:13.180> more

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
little tiny leaf could have many more

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.380 
little tiny leaf could have many more
veins<00:02:13.810> than<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.220> big<00:02:15.400> one<00:02:15.610> does<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.150> i

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
veins than like the big one does and i

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.720 
veins than like the big one does and i
find<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:17.200> echoing<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.250> one<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.700> easiest

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
find that echoing is one of the easiest

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.060 
find that echoing is one of the easiest
doodles<00:02:19.570> on<00:02:19.690> earth<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.050> do<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.380> echoing<00:02:20.830> is

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
doodles on earth to do so echoing is

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.840 
doodles on earth to do so echoing is
just<00:02:21.940> when<00:02:22.060> I'm<00:02:22.180> echoing<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.770> shape<00:02:24.040> im<00:02:24.700> just

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
just when I'm echoing the shape im just

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.050 
just when I'm echoing the shape im just
echoing<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.840> shape<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.500> I'm<00:02:26.980> echoing<00:02:27.640> that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
echoing that shape and I'm echoing that

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.570 
echoing that shape and I'm echoing that
shape<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.690> I'm<00:02:29.170> even<00:02:29.530> alternating<00:02:30.190> which

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
shape and I'm even alternating which

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.240 
shape and I'm even alternating which
side<00:02:30.970> I'm<00:02:31.330> doing<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:31.990> now<00:02:32.800> I'm<00:02:33.010> actually

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
side I'm doing it in now I'm actually

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.490 
side I'm doing it in now I'm actually
going<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.610> switch<00:02:33.820> over<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.660> smaller<00:02:35.110> tip

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
going to switch over to the smaller tip

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.260 
going to switch over to the smaller tip
size<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:36.280> paint<00:02:36.520> pen<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:36.940> think<00:02:37.150> I've

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
size of this paint pen and I think I've

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.330 
size of this paint pen and I think I've
already<00:02:37.480> shook<00:02:37.930> ship<00:02:38.350> I've<00:02:38.530> already<00:02:38.740> shaken

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
already shook ship I've already shaken

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.970 
already shook ship I've already shaken
this<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.820> yet<00:02:40.540> it's<00:02:40.870> working<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.500> no<00:02:41.620> problem

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
this and yet it's working so no problem

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.710 
this and yet it's working so no problem
because<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:42.400> want<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.700> fill<00:02:42.910> this<00:02:43.090> with<00:02:43.240> circles

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
because I want to fill this with circles

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.290 
because I want to fill this with circles
and<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.320> larger<00:02:44.950> tip<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.340> just<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.580> little<00:02:46.209> bit

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
and that larger tip is just a little bit

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.780 
and that larger tip is just a little bit
too<00:02:46.390> large<00:02:46.540> for<00:02:46.959> me<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.260> get<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.680> but<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.610> can

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
too large for me to get that but you can

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.370 
too large for me to get that but you can
see<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.330> color<00:02:49.570> coordinates<00:02:50.170> perfectly

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
see that the color coordinates perfectly

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.020 
see that the color coordinates perfectly
so<00:02:50.980> if<00:02:51.100> someone<00:02:51.280> were<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.550> look<00:02:51.730> at<00:02:51.880> this

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
so if someone were to look at this

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.120 
so if someone were to look at this
they'd<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:52.540> no<00:02:52.959> idea<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.650> i<00:02:53.680> actually<00:02:53.800> used

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
they'd have no idea that i actually used

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.310 
they'd have no idea that i actually used
two<00:02:54.520> different<00:02:54.940> markers<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.810> make<00:02:56.020> this

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
two different markers to make this

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.890 
two different markers to make this
glorious<00:02:57.070> page<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.360> i<00:02:58.390> would<00:02:58.600> just<00:02:58.630> continue

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
glorious page so i would just continue

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.520 
glorious page so i would just continue
to<00:02:59.500> fill<00:02:59.860> with<00:03:00.550> some<00:03:01.180> circles<00:03:01.870> all<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.200> way

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
to fill with some circles all the way

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.310 
to fill with some circles all the way
down<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.160> i<00:03:03.640> can<00:03:03.820> even<00:03:04.060> fill<00:03:04.330> in<00:03:04.570> some<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:04.900> the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
down and i can even fill in some of the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.730 
down and i can even fill in some of the
leaves<00:03:06.100> overheal<00:03:07.030> again<00:03:07.900> using<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.350> smaller

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
leaves overheal again using that smaller

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.550 
leaves overheal again using that smaller
size<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.970> get<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.209> done<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.600> i<00:03:10.720> have<00:03:10.930> one<00:03:11.230> here

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
size to get it done and i have one here

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.710 
size to get it done and i have one here
in<00:03:11.650> which<00:03:11.800> I've<00:03:11.950> already<00:03:12.100> finished<00:03:12.489> all<00:03:12.910> of<00:03:12.970> my

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
in which I've already finished all of my

sometimes<00:05:00.760> I<00:05:00.970> have<00:05:01.090> secret<00:05:01.510> thoughts<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:02.080> I

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
sometimes I have secret thoughts that I

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.770 
sometimes I have secret thoughts that I
don't<00:05:02.380> want<00:05:02.530> to<00:05:02.620> share<00:05:02.860> and<00:05:03.820> so<00:05:04.030> what<00:05:04.210> I<00:05:04.240> do<00:05:04.360> is

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
don't want to share and so what I do is

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.890 
don't want to share and so what I do is
I'm<00:05:05.530> actually<00:05:05.710> writing<00:05:06.310> things<00:05:06.820> but<00:05:07.570> I'm<00:05:07.660> just

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
I'm actually writing things but I'm just

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.160 
I'm actually writing things but I'm just
really<00:05:08.380> really<00:05:09.360> abstracting<00:05:10.360> it<00:05:10.510> so<00:05:10.840> let<00:05:11.080> me

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
really really abstracting it so let me

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.170 
really really abstracting it so let me
show<00:05:11.410> you<00:05:11.440> this<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:12.010> little<00:05:12.400> bit<00:05:12.580> here<00:05:12.820> on<00:05:13.000> this

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
show you this a little bit here on this

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.580 
show you this a little bit here on this
white<00:05:13.420> paper<00:05:13.600> so<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:13.900> can<00:05:13.960> see<00:05:14.230> a<00:05:14.260> little<00:05:14.440> more

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
white paper so you can see a little more

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.740 
white paper so you can see a little more
clearly<00:05:14.950> if<00:05:15.250> I<00:05:15.730> right<00:05:16.000> hello<00:05:17.130> I'm<00:05:18.130> Julie

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
clearly if I right hello I'm Julie

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.730 
clearly if I right hello I'm Julie
that's<00:05:19.750> how<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:19.990> would<00:05:20.200> write<00:05:20.350> it<00:05:20.470> in<00:05:20.590> my<00:05:20.680> normal

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
that's how I would write it in my normal

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.370 
that's how I would write it in my normal
messy<00:05:21.370> handwriting<00:05:21.490> so<00:05:22.150> too<00:05:22.210> abstract<00:05:22.960> it<00:05:23.230> all

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
messy handwriting so too abstract it all

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.190 
messy handwriting so too abstract it all
i'm<00:05:23.560> going<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:23.740> do<00:05:23.950> is<00:05:24.600> I'm<00:05:25.600> going<00:05:25.720> to<00:05:25.780> squish

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
i'm going to do is I'm going to squish

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.230 
i'm going to do is I'm going to squish
it<00:05:26.380> up<00:05:26.590> so<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:26.980> writing<00:05:27.520> on<00:05:27.730> top<00:05:27.970> of<00:05:28.150> each

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
it up so it's writing on top of each

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.520 
it up so it's writing on top of each
other<00:05:28.390> and<00:05:28.600> you<00:05:28.690> can't<00:05:28.930> really<00:05:29.050> read<00:05:29.260> it<00:05:29.380> and<00:05:29.500> I

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
other and you can't really read it and I

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.920 
other and you can't really read it and I
can<00:05:29.710> keep<00:05:29.890> going<00:05:30.190> to<00:05:30.790> abstract<00:05:31.270> it<00:05:31.390> even<00:05:31.690> more

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
can keep going to abstract it even more

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.780 
can keep going to abstract it even more
so<00:05:32.440> that<00:05:32.560> it<00:05:32.650> all<00:05:32.770> squishes<00:05:33.160> up<00:05:33.280> on<00:05:33.430> each<00:05:33.580> other

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
so that it all squishes up on each other

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.690 
so that it all squishes up on each other
and<00:05:33.880> if<00:05:34.180> you<00:05:34.270> look<00:05:34.570> at<00:05:34.810> my<00:05:35.020> final<00:05:35.620> project<00:05:35.860> what

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
and if you look at my final project what

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.880 
and if you look at my final project what
you'll<00:05:36.850> see<00:05:37.150> here<00:05:37.180> is<00:05:37.630> that<00:05:37.660> it<00:05:38.320> is<00:05:38.470> actual

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
you'll see here is that it is actual

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:39.930 
you'll see here is that it is actual
writing<00:05:39.040> of<00:05:39.220> things<00:05:39.460> I'm<00:05:39.580> really<00:05:39.610> thinking

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
writing of things I'm really thinking

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.520 
writing of things I'm really thinking
it's<00:05:40.210> just<00:05:40.330> all<00:05:40.510> squished<00:05:40.840> up<00:05:41.020> so<00:05:41.140> I<00:05:41.170> can<00:05:41.320> have

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
it's just all squished up so I can have

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.590 
it's just all squished up so I can have
my<00:05:41.710> private<00:05:42.100> thoughts<00:05:42.250> and<00:05:42.610> still<00:05:43.060> share<00:05:43.360> this
