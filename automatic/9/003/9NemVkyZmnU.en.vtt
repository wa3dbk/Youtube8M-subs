one<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.620> don't<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:44.129> too<00:00:44.160> much<00:00:44.460> I

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
one you don't really see too much I

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.340 
one you don't really see too much I
guess<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> let<00:00:45.210> some<00:00:45.450> light<00:00:45.660> shine<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
guess I let some light shine in on the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.420 
guess I let some light shine in on the
base<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.289> bottom<00:00:49.739> has<00:00:49.950> some<00:00:50.160> information

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
base so the bottom has some information

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.840 
base so the bottom has some information
and<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.840> top<00:00:52.110> has<00:00:52.739> another<00:00:53.160> nice<00:00:53.489> viewing

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and the top has another nice viewing

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.869 
and the top has another nice viewing
window<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> let<00:00:54.420> light<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.520> figure<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
window to let light in so this figure is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.330

what drew me to her in the first place I

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.679

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
was really really attracted to this base

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.399 
was really really attracted to this base
it's<00:01:46.350> got<00:01:46.799> all<00:01:46.979> these<00:01:47.540> clear<00:01:48.540> plastic<00:01:48.869> star

and<00:01:51.060> green<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.689> think<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.350> amazing<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.520> really

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and green I think it's amazing a really

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.050 
and green I think it's amazing a really
nice<00:01:54.540> detail<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.250> often<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.670> base<00:01:56.820> is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
nice detail to have so often the base is

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.240 
nice detail to have so often the base is
overlooked<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.530> seeing<00:01:58.829> stuff<00:01:59.070> like

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
overlooked so I like seeing stuff like

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.090 
overlooked so I like seeing stuff like
that<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.759> does<00:02:00.060> come<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.420> two<00:02:00.600> parts<00:02:00.899> but<00:02:01.829> I

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
that it does come in two parts but I

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.660 
that it does come in two parts but I
find<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:03.229> with<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> white<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.189> looks<00:02:05.579> a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
find just with just the white it looks a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.130 
find just with just the white it looks a
little<00:02:05.790> less<00:02:06.000> finished<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.689> not<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.899> polished

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
little less finished and not as polished

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.619 
little less finished and not as polished
so<00:02:07.560> I'll<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.890> displaying<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.879> as<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:12.030> came<00:02:12.300> in

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
so I'll be displaying it as it came in

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.559 
so I'll be displaying it as it came in
