00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:28.000
 Suddenly by accident or without beginning noticing 

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:40.100
 According to the forecast, it is not possible to see a smile like that 

00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:52.000
 The color of the town and the city change, and if you change the umbrella you will sing in the rain 

00:00:52.001 --> 00:01:04.600
 Raise your face with whatever you are The light shines 

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:21.600
 The rivers of tears and the hearts of anyone who returns to the sea also rains and then fines 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:44.900
 The shoes I flew to the sky The whereabouts of tomorrow I forgot 

00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:59.100
 It's not a future I have drawn, but every day you can not be replaced It is a miracle 

00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:12.000
 You will reach this heart in the wind that I told you in a row. 

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:24.000
 Whatever you have, I'll be with you I want to wait with you Rise the rising sun 

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:40.500
 Farewell, let's shake hands, time flows to hate and we can smile 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:27.000
 Raise your face with whatever you are The light shines 

00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:39.000
 Whatever you have, I'll be with you I want to wait with you Rise the rising sun 

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:54.800
 The river of tears, the heart of anyone who returns to the sea is also raining and later Hallelujah 

00:03:54.801 --> 00:04:02.000
 Hallelujah after the rain
