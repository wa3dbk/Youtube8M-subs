before scheduled launch while they are

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.170 
before scheduled launch while they are
leaving<00:05:03.509> to<00:05:03.750> evacuate<00:05:04.349> Mars<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:05.610> crew<00:05:05.880> mates

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
leaving to evacuate Mars the crew mates

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.749 
leaving to evacuate Mars the crew mates
do<00:05:06.630> it<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.810> series<00:05:07.050> of<00:05:07.139> events<00:05:07.409> believe<00:05:08.009> mark<00:05:08.550> is

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
do it a series of events believe mark is

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.409 
do it a series of events believe mark is
actually<00:05:08.969> dead<00:05:09.509> so<00:05:10.289> they<00:05:11.099> leave<00:05:11.370> him<00:05:11.699> on<00:05:11.880> Mars

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
actually dead so they leave him on Mars

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.510 
actually dead so they leave him on Mars
so<00:05:13.259> that's<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.590> opening<00:05:13.919> of<00:05:14.039> the<00:05:14.129> book<00:05:14.280> and

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
so that's the opening of the book and

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.879 
so that's the opening of the book and
Mark<00:05:14.849> basically<00:05:15.419> starts<00:05:15.659> a<00:05:15.719> journal<00:05:16.139> and<00:05:16.379> he's

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
like trying to survive on Mars until the

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.010 
like trying to survive on Mars until the
next<00:05:20.340> man<00:05:20.520> mission<00:05:20.940> can<00:05:21.090> come<00:05:21.240> and<00:05:21.419> save<00:05:21.750> him

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
next man mission can come and save him

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.959 
next man mission can come and save him
so<00:05:22.319> yeah<00:05:22.530> this<00:05:22.740> book<00:05:22.949> is<00:05:23.130> amazing<00:05:23.400> there's<00:05:23.909> a

fun read for such a kind of but

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.010 
fun read for such a kind of but
technically<00:05:40.650> a<00:05:40.860> heavy<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:42.210> know<00:05:42.330> survival

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020

so great but second thing I loved about
this<00:05:49.680> was<00:05:49.889> the<00:05:50.069> science<00:05:50.520> I<00:05:50.759> am<00:05:51.120> by<00:05:51.509> no<00:05:51.569> means<00:05:51.750> an

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
this was the science I am by no means an

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.559 
this was the science I am by no means an
aerospace<00:05:52.880> physicist<00:05:53.880> I<00:05:54.210> don't<00:05:54.449> know

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
aerospace physicist I don't know

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.200 
aerospace physicist I don't know
anything<00:05:54.870> about<00:05:55.039> space<00:05:56.039> or<00:05:56.520> how<00:05:56.789> to<00:05:56.849> get<00:05:57.150> there

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
anything about space or how to get there

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.990 
anything about space or how to get there
or<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:57.930> math<00:05:58.169> and<00:05:58.469> the<00:05:58.590> science<00:05:58.699> but<00:05:59.699> this

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
or the math and the science but this

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.689 
or the math and the science but this
book<00:06:00.180> is<00:06:00.330> a<00:06:00.360> fantastic<00:06:01.050> job<00:06:01.469> of<00:06:01.800> doing<00:06:02.279> really

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
book is a fantastic job of doing really

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.279 
book is a fantastic job of doing really
complex<00:06:03.240> science<00:06:03.569> and<00:06:03.690> explaining

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
complex science and explaining

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.600 
complex science and explaining
everything<00:06:04.500> which<00:06:05.069> i<00:06:05.219> think<00:06:05.279> is<00:06:05.490> really

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
everything which i think is really

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.640 
everything which i think is really
interesting<00:06:05.729> but<00:06:06.719> in<00:06:06.840> a<00:06:06.930> way<00:06:07.110> that<00:06:07.409> it's

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
interesting but in a way that it's

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.670 
interesting but in a way that it's
attainable<00:06:08.430> for<00:06:08.490> you<00:06:09.090> know<00:06:09.180> varying<00:06:10.080> degrees

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
attainable for you know varying degrees

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.409 
attainable for you know varying degrees
of<00:06:10.710> knowledge<00:06:11.219> of<00:06:11.430> science<00:06:12.180> and<00:06:12.360> engineering

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
of knowledge of science and engineering

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.719 
of knowledge of science and engineering
and<00:06:13.020> space<00:06:13.380> and<00:06:13.620> physics<00:06:14.009> and<00:06:14.190> stuff<00:06:14.370> so<00:06:14.580> it's

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
and space and physics and stuff so it's

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.640 
and space and physics and stuff so it's
just<00:06:14.909> super<00:06:15.360> fascinating<00:06:16.050> to<00:06:16.169> read<00:06:16.349> all<00:06:16.620> of

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
this like real science you know space

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.769 
this like real science you know space
science<00:06:20.039> as<00:06:20.310> well<00:06:20.580> that's<00:06:21.180> a<00:06:21.300> technical<00:06:21.719> term

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:21.779 
science as well that's a technical term

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:23.390 
science as well that's a technical term
real<00:06:22.409> space<00:06:22.830> science
