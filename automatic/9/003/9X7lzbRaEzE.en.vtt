a ruler or a piece of wood something
like<00:02:02.960> this<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.280> lean<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.640> on<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.940> wall<00:02:05.180> to

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
like this and you lean it on the wall to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.510 
like this and you lean it on the wall to
where<00:02:05.630> it's<00:02:05.750> nice<00:02:05.899> and<00:02:05.960> sturdy<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.860> you<00:02:07.340> lean

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
your arm on it and you take that and you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.180 
your arm on it and you take that and you
can<00:02:11.600> make<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.780> nice<00:02:12.080> even<00:02:12.410> stroke<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.010> higher

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
can make a nice even stroke the higher

you go on your hand the more steady your

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.650 
you go on your hand the more steady your
stroke<00:02:15.620> will<00:02:15.800> be<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.520> it<00:02:16.640> evens<00:02:17.000> your<00:02:17.209> line<00:02:17.420> out

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660
