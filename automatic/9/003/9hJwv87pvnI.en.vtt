that when the atari default the two
lights<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:50.189> ready<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> pedestrian<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
lights for ready for the pedestrian and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.160 
lights for ready for the pedestrian and
the<00:01:52.500> ready<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> car<00:01:54.360> should<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.610> red

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
the ready for the car should be red

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.819 
the ready for the car should be red
should<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.380> high<00:01:59.149> so<00:02:00.149> depending<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.259> who<00:02:01.560> comes

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
should be high so depending on who comes

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.030 
should be high so depending on who comes
if<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.030> position<00:02:03.390> comes<00:02:03.659> should<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.710> reached

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
if the position comes should be reached

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.990 
if the position comes should be reached
and<00:02:05.659> then<00:02:06.659> when<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.229> car<00:02:07.770> comes<00:02:08.039> resort<00:02:08.729> where

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
and then when the car comes resort where

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.710 
and then when the car comes resort where
to<00:02:09.179> go<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.660> after<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:11.640> pedestrians

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
to go so after the pedestrians

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.470 
to go so after the pedestrians
m2<00:02:13.020> closes<00:02:13.890> over<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.880> system<00:02:15.240> should<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
m2 closes over the system should you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.400 
m2 closes over the system should you
come<00:02:15.780> back<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.320> default<00:02:17.840> now<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.200> has

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
come back to this default now it has

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.510 
come back to this default now it has
also<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.660> audio<00:02:21.660> signal<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:23.010> help<00:02:23.130> those<00:02:23.460> that

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
also the audio signal to help those that

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.700 
also the audio signal to help those that
not<00:02:24.060> here<00:02:25.940> we<00:02:26.940> have<00:02:27.210> for<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.080> supporter<00:02:28.470> type

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
not here we have for the supporter type

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.640 
not here we have for the supporter type
I<00:02:29.120> have<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.920> implement<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.220> using<00:02:33.180> buttons<00:02:33.960> for

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
I have to implement it using buttons for

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.290 
I have to implement it using buttons for
the<00:02:34.770> sense<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.160> because<00:02:35.430> we<00:02:35.670> know<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:35.880> this

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
the sense that because we know that this

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.150 
the sense that because we know that this
strength<00:02:36.690> also<00:02:36.870> will<00:02:37.110> generate<00:02:37.410> some<00:02:37.470> signal

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
strength also will generate some signal

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.000 
strength also will generate some signal
which<00:02:38.460> is<00:02:38.640> maybe<00:02:39.000> voltage<00:02:39.600> for<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.620> voltage

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
which is maybe voltage for the voltage

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.090 
which is maybe voltage for the voltage
and<00:02:41.220> also<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.960> button<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.770> should<00:02:43.890> generate

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
and also the button it should generate

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.230 
and also the button it should generate
the<00:02:44.400> same<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:46.370> generally<00:02:47.370> designed<00:02:47.970> this

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
the same so I generally designed this

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.530 
the same so I generally designed this
using<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> buttons<00:02:49.670> excuse<00:02:50.670> me<00:02:50.910> now<00:02:51.150> for

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
using the buttons excuse me now for

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.370 
using the buttons excuse me now for
demonstration<00:02:52.410> let<00:02:53.250> me<00:02:53.459> switch<00:02:53.730> on<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
demonstration let me switch on the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.330 
demonstration let me switch on the
system<00:02:55.380> see<00:02:56.070> how<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.430> works

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
system see how it works

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.180 
system see how it works
so<00:02:59.340> initial<00:03:00.090> stage<00:03:00.380> we<00:03:01.380> have<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.709> signal

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
so initial stage we have that signal

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.340 
so initial stage we have that signal
which<00:03:02.459> prohibits<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.600> position<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.470> close<00:03:05.180> so

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
which prohibits the position to close so

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.910 
which prohibits the position to close so
this<00:03:07.350> button<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:07.860> for<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.340> car<00:03:09.650> sensor<00:03:10.650> and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
this button is for the car sensor and

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.880 
this button is for the car sensor and
this<00:03:11.430> one<00:03:11.580> for<00:03:11.790> depression<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:12.720> let<00:03:13.320> us<00:03:13.350> let<00:03:13.830> me

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
this one for depression so let us let me

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.620 
this one for depression so let us let me
stage<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.820> situation<00:03:15.240> where<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:16.790> car<00:03:17.790> comes

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
stage the situation where the car comes

pedestrian presence which we can see now
the<00:03:42.739> position<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:43.860> allowed<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.130> go<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:46.250> also

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
the position is allowed to go and also

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.780 
the position is allowed to go and also
the<00:03:47.310> sound<00:03:47.640> changes<00:03:50.030> so<00:03:51.030> now<00:03:51.110> if<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.980> master

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the sound changes so now if the master

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.890 
the sound changes so now if the master
button<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.390> pressed<00:03:54.750> another<00:03:55.560> button<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:56.900> the

button is pressed another button is the
button<00:03:57.930> which<00:03:58.380> allows<00:03:59.870> which<00:04:00.870> disconnects

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
button which allows which disconnects

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.440 
button which allows which disconnects
the<00:04:02.810> sensor<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.140> switch<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:06.209> just

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
the sensor on the switch so it just

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.740 
the sensor on the switch so it just
flashes<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.230> yellow<00:04:07.530> light<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:09.030> happens

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
flashes the yellow light this happens

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.070 
flashes the yellow light this happens
possibly<00:04:10.380> midnight<00:04:10.980> or<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.670> time<00:04:11.880> when<00:04:12.090> bed<00:04:12.360> or

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
possibly midnight or a time when bed or

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.199 
possibly midnight or a time when bed or
is<00:04:13.500> Road<00:04:14.090> diversion<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:16.350> let<00:04:16.530> me<00:04:16.680> select<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:18.060> as

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
is Road diversion so let me select it as

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.430 
is Road diversion so let me select it as
a<00:04:18.239> check<00:04:18.600> how<00:04:18.810> it<00:04:18.959> works

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
a check how it works

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.940 
a check how it works
so<00:04:20.040> any<00:04:20.729> Plus<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.270> reg<00:04:22.020> will<00:04:22.229> go<00:04:22.380> off<00:04:22.620> and

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
so any Plus this reg will go off and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.680 
so any Plus this reg will go off and
then<00:04:23.130> we<00:04:23.700> should<00:04:23.849> do

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
then we should do

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.940 
then we should do
the<00:04:24.950> yellow<00:04:25.950> for<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.640> car<00:04:27.380> flashing<00:04:28.380> so<00:04:28.890> you
