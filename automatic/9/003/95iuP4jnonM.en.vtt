00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.370 
I'm not sure a fighter but at this point
knows<00:03:37.430> whether<00:03:37.820> or<00:03:38.030> not<00:03:38.180> he's<00:03:38.450> won<00:03:38.690> it's<00:03:39.170> his

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
knows whether or not he's won it's his

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.590 
knows whether or not he's won it's his
birthday<00:03:39.680> he<00:03:40.280> could<00:03:40.580> not<00:03:40.820> have<00:03:41.030> had<00:03:41.240> a<00:03:41.540> better

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
birthday he could not have had a better

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.210 
birthday he could not have had a better
present<00:03:42.470> than<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.710> bronze

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
present than a bronze

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.600 
present than a bronze
but<00:03:44.000> from<00:03:44.210> my<00:03:44.420> vantage<00:03:44.720> point<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:46.130> appeared

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
but from my vantage point it appeared

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.010 
but from my vantage point it appeared
that<00:03:46.700> he<00:03:46.940> was<00:03:46.970> inches<00:03:47.510> short

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
that he was inches short

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.560 
that he was inches short
I<00:03:48.050> think<00:03:48.380> Salah<00:03:48.710> of<00:03:48.980> East<00:03:49.220> Germany<00:03:49.670> just<00:03:50.240> edged

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
I think Salah of East Germany just edged

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.410 
I think Salah of East Germany just edged
him<00:03:50.900> out<00:03:51.050> in<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.410> last<00:03:51.680> couple<00:03:51.950> meters<00:03:52.460> but

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
him out in the last couple meters but

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.650 
him out in the last couple meters but
still<00:03:53.690> a<00:03:53.830> fantastic<00:03:54.830> performance<00:03:55.510> here's<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
still a fantastic performance here's the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.630 
still a fantastic performance here's the
