00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:11.970
 Omsk 135 we have questions for 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.090
 television is interested in which 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.500
 impressions you have from 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.020
 engage someone on the bottom chic with him 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.289
 that gateway 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.119
 about the decline 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:30.599
 dunking can not see me then 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.879
 ritual repair and comments 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.129
 unnecessarily the vessels of our dreams disagree with each other 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.149
 a friend just a few meters here like 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.170
 in traffic on the central city 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.449
 highway pitch right pitch left 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.940
 have to agree in advance 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.180
 now more 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.489
 Radio communication is carefully conducted from 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.890
 Observation of the channel on the Volga Balt 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.039
 80 meter fixed 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.500
 however, today 6040 notes from strength 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.019
 riverman and in some parts of the courts 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.269
 you have to tack along a narrow lane 50 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.339
 meters but it's half the trouble as they say 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.440
 we can hope for Captain skill and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.149
 Here are the losses of the enterprise using 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.520
 river transport skill not 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.070
 justify shipping this year 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.009
 declined significantly last year was 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.640
 about 100 units daily in the alignment 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.800
 Cherepovets held somewhere today about 60 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.979
 65 units when that's unfavorable 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.060
 shallow water conditions are very difficult to work 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.289
 and chip personnel to pass ships and 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.690
 here only those vessels are passed whose 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.110
 draft does not exceed three meters 35 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.700
 centimeters meanwhile a rate of 360 a 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.310
 mean all river transport 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.130
 Ned comes with a cargo's loss on the face 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.490
 but landscapes overboard one institution 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.869
 every day is a new island or two 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.670
 islands almost in the middle of the river 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.310
 Sheksny near the October Bridge 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.649
 a truly unique phenomenon 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.080
 cherepovchane i can hardly remember 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.069
 last critical fall 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.050
 water level was observed in our lands in 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.729
 1972 then the water level by 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.899
 the Baltic frame of reference was on 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:13.140
 Mark 98 meters 10 centimeters now 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.510
 98 88 and the rate is ninety nine and three 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.670
 it would seem a small difference however 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.540
 the effects of such shallow water can be 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.300
 lamentable 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.459
 environmentalists sound the alarm itself is dangerous 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.640
 only with this water level which is 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.610
 today is if will be low 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.569
 temperatures up to minus 30 under 40 degrees 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.050
 It will be a large freezing but does not like it 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:42.540
 gamor fish small rivers at low 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:45.060
 levels at lunch when I was young and fish on 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.920
 not rhythmics and all of course you need 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.780
 keep under control for that in 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.020
 modern 1 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.400
 and created a large number of different 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.740
 regulatory authorities with long 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.720
 serious names management 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.220
 exploitation of Rybinsk and Sheksninsky 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.440
 reservoirs federal agency 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.600
 water resources and that's not counting 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.150
 various regional departments and 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.520
 other departmental structures only here 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.470
 understand which of them actually gives the order 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:17.450
 for the maximum discharge of water Volga 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:19.310
 river basin is very difficult after 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.110
 long telephone conversations of ours 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.750
 the crew seemed to be able to find 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.370
 the final link is eat departmental 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.660
 working group that is going to 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.940
 regularly in Moscow 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.700
 true to get through to the representatives of this 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.069
 mighty handful does not work between 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.470
 those projected to riverman winter again 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.630
 there will be little snow and specialists 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.040
 seriously fear that from next year 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.040
 will be extremely tense
