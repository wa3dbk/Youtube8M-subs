00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.870
 PSV took the lead in the international period 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.299
 in the competition with the 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.109
 Starting home game against AZ and PSV 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.639
 sheet 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.830
 gets the boys out of here 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.220
 no pole but the chance to make and so 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.990
 psv so good now pawn back after 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.090
 Locadia further to hit at PSV Jeffrey 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.560
 Bruma and Joshua Brenet are warious fare 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.050

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.579

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.399
 started the cloud the last five 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:42.680
 home duels from az that are attacking here 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.680
 with a lot of room for captain gudelj 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.230
 that was a dangerous shot in soup 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.230
 the right corner but didn't save much 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.719
 coucou in the stands together with mark 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.719
 van bommel 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.629
 and then PSV speed can come with 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.089
 corrado on the site of the wine estuary 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:10.460
 Jozefzoon Willem with a fantastic 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:13.549

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.320
 split the defense from azz here 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 narsingh only for goalkeeper rochette 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.520

 wrists less pressure 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.720
 grabbing my office setting while the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.030
 chances on the right and on the left low 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.020
 your son went for his own chance 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.020
 what is always a dick 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.470
 willems 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.239

 service team time and space for the 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:18.040
 cross 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:20.760
 crochet gets alwin from psv on a 2 0 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.760
 prevents from putting 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.390
 sends nice movement from neto willems 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:33.650
 hupperts into the forest and it is intervention 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.650
 from Roosje insufficient 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.430

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.920
 Joseph son 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:51.810
 now then maybe 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.739
 how you do one of this school 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:00.540
 the attacker simply had bad luck this 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.660
 of course the 300 pacer should be but 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.660

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.200

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.030
 [Applause] 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.300
 psv you are right in front of a 3 0 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.300
 head Start 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.830
 [Music] 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.299
 people he is sitting close because 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.790

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.599
 come take action from me you appreciate then 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.599
 nasty black ado 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.890
 willems mention the file for says want 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.270
 it someone 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.390
 again 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.580
 renting the van die-cut flower pots 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.740
 so there is always three noble psv and place 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.200
 for Jozef son 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.100
 the good cross from willems mars in all 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.100
 near the fourth goal 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.150
 and here three times Jozef son but so 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.150
 no hit 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.360
 but worse 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.490
 more space at willems 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.950
 psv is present here at that stage 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.970
 and nothing else came out of it 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.970
 choose someone who replaced Bruma well 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.700
 rikki 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.700
 ritzmaier the teams come in order ado 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.760
 the opening on the march in them more 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.630
 for psv narsingh with food is like this 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.630
 along the chicken zucchini 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.600
 willems and psv had nothing to do with the crowds 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.600
 from az and this phase 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:10.300
 Joseph son but always Joseph son 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.990
 the basic income is something but he can also 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.790
 at a promotion then had this chance 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:21.090
 lost and the are always three zero but 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.070
 might have been more involved 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.140
 then Torah from Jozef's son 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.730
 running ritzmaier another 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.020
 chance for narsingh 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.080
 then the ball may close just a little too 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.990
 far away but psv wins with 3 0 we booked 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.220
 fifth home win in a row and keep for the 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.240
 fourth time zero 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.530
 but more importantly it increases 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.530
 leading position in the premier league
