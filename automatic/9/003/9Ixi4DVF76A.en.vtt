today<00:00:04.220> we're<00:00:04.370> going<00:00:04.400> to<00:00:04.520> be<00:00:04.610> creating<00:00:04.880> a<00:00:05.180> yeast

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
today we're going to be creating a yeast

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.659 
today we're going to be creating a yeast
starter<00:00:06.049> I<00:00:06.259> highly<00:00:06.919> recommend<00:00:07.040> making<00:00:07.490> a

00:00:07.659 --> 00:00:07.669 
starter I highly recommend making a

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:08.950 
starter I highly recommend making a
yeast<00:00:07.879> starter<00:00:08.180> whenever<00:00:08.480> you<00:00:08.660> brew

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
yeast starter whenever you brew

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.450 
yeast starter whenever you brew
especially<00:00:09.889> if<00:00:09.950> you're<00:00:10.070> going<00:00:10.160> to<00:00:10.250> do<00:00:10.309> any

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
especially if you're going to do any

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.690 
especially if you're going to do any

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
high gravity bears ye starters give you

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.789 
high gravity bears ye starters give you
increased<00:00:14.150> cell<00:00:14.450> count<00:00:14.750> give<00:00:15.530> you<00:00:15.650> a<00:00:15.679> nice

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
increased cell count give you a nice

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.220 
increased cell count give you a nice
high<00:00:16.070> pitching<00:00:16.550> rate<00:00:16.960> gives<00:00:17.960> you<00:00:18.080> nice

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
high pitching rate gives you nice

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.349 
high pitching rate gives you nice
healthy<00:00:18.470> yeast<00:00:18.949> cells<00:00:19.430> that<00:00:19.910> reach<00:00:20.119> full

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
healthy yeast cells that reach full

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.390 
healthy yeast cells that reach full
attenuation<00:00:21.170> and<00:00:21.470> short<00:00:21.859> than<00:00:22.010> the<00:00:22.130> lag<00:00:22.369> time

before they take off so good habit to
get<00:00:26.689> into<00:00:26.750> doesn't<00:00:27.529> take<00:00:27.650> a<00:00:27.679> lot<00:00:27.890> of<00:00:27.949> time<00:00:28.250> and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
get into doesn't take a lot of time and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.580 
get into doesn't take a lot of time and
it<00:00:28.760> gives<00:00:28.910> you<00:00:29.029> a<00:00:29.090> little<00:00:29.410> guarantee<00:00:30.410> and

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
it gives you a little guarantee and

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.170 
it gives you a little guarantee and
insurance<00:00:31.070> to<00:00:31.250> know<00:00:31.400> that<00:00:31.580> your<00:00:31.730> yeast<00:00:31.910> is

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
insurance to know that your yeast is

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.980 
insurance to know that your yeast is
good<00:00:32.930> before<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:33.500> bro<00:00:33.740> so<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:34.940> use<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.300> 2,000

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
good before you bro so I use a 2,000

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.020 
good before you bro so I use a 2,000
milliliter<00:00:36.350> flask<00:00:36.950> now<00:00:37.610> you<00:00:37.760> can<00:00:37.880> see<00:00:38.000> I

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
milliliter flask now you can see I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.520 
milliliter flask now you can see I
already<00:00:38.120> have<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:38.510> filled<00:00:38.690> up<00:00:38.840> to<00:00:39.020> thirteen

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
already have it filled up to thirteen

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.400 
already have it filled up to thirteen
hundred<00:00:39.830> milliliters<00:00:40.400> of<00:00:40.430> water<00:00:40.580> I<00:00:41.200> have<00:00:42.200> my

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
hundred milliliters of water I have my

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.290 
hundred milliliters of water I have my
yeast<00:00:42.680> it's<00:00:42.950> a<00:00:43.040> good<00:00:43.190> idea<00:00:43.280> to<00:00:43.520> if<00:00:44.150> you're

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
yeast it's a good idea to if you're

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.060 
yeast it's a good idea to if you're
going<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.480> use<00:00:44.630> a<00:00:44.660> smack<00:00:45.050> pack<00:00:45.350> like<00:00:45.620> this<00:00:45.860> to

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
going to use a smack pack like this to

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.770 
going to use a smack pack like this to
smack<00:00:46.370> it<00:00:46.400> six<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.030> eight<00:00:47.150> hours<00:00:47.180> ahead<00:00:47.600> of

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
smack it six to eight hours ahead of

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.080 
smack it six to eight hours ahead of
time<00:00:48.110> I'm<00:00:48.770> going<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.010> let<00:00:49.160> mine<00:00:49.370> get<00:00:49.820> a<00:00:49.850> little

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
time I'm going to let mine get a little

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.420 
time I'm going to let mine get a little
more<00:00:50.990> fermented<00:00:51.530> here<00:00:51.710> before<00:00:52.070> I<00:00:52.100> actually

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
more fermented here before I actually

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.090 
more fermented here before I actually
pitch<00:00:52.910> this<00:00:53.240> but<00:00:54.140> we<00:00:54.230> have<00:00:54.350> some<00:00:54.530> time<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:54.890> boil

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
pitch this but we have some time to boil

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.910 
pitch this but we have some time to boil
this<00:00:55.660> water<00:00:56.660> in<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.020> flask<00:00:57.230> here<00:00:57.650> and<00:00:57.770> let<00:00:57.890> it

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
this water in the flask here and let it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.300 
this water in the flask here and let it
cool<00:00:58.190> I<00:00:58.540> have<00:00:59.540> my<00:00:59.810> dry<00:01:00.050> malt<00:01:00.230> extract<00:01:00.350> which

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
cool I have my dry malt extract which

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.580 
cool I have my dry malt extract which
I'll<00:01:01.490> be<00:01:01.610> using<00:01:01.850> for<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.870> yeast<00:01:03.020> starter<00:01:03.350> and

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
I'll be using for the yeast starter and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.590 
I'll be using for the yeast starter and
then<00:01:03.890> just<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.129> container<00:01:04.549> of<00:01:04.670> some<00:01:05.030> sanitizer

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
then just a container of some sanitizer

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.720 
then just a container of some sanitizer
which<00:01:06.110> I'm<00:01:06.260> going<00:01:06.380> to<00:01:06.440> use<00:01:06.620> for<00:01:07.250> my<00:01:07.400> flask

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:07.730 
which I'm going to use for my flask

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.930 
which I'm going to use for my flask
topper<00:01:08.680> so<00:01:09.680> that's<00:01:09.860> really<00:01:10.010> all<00:01:10.160> you<00:01:10.280> need<00:01:10.430> to

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
topper so that's really all you need to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.340 
topper so that's really all you need to
get<00:01:11.060> started<00:01:11.300> so<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.750> first<00:01:12.020> thing<00:01:12.110> we're

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
get started so the first thing we're

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.430 
get started so the first thing we're
going<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:12.500> do<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:13.040> boil<00:01:13.400> our<00:01:13.550> flasks<00:01:14.440> before

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
going to do is boil our flasks before

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.530 
going to do is boil our flasks before
you<00:01:15.770> boil<00:01:16.070> in<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.460> flask<00:01:16.730> you<00:01:17.060> do<00:01:17.240> need<00:01:17.420> to

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
you boil in a flask you do need to

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.410 
you boil in a flask you do need to
ensure<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.350> your<00:01:18.890> flask<00:01:19.190> does<00:01:19.730> support

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
ensure that your flask does support

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.140 
ensure that your flask does support
direct<00:01:21.080> heating<00:01:21.550> okay<00:01:22.550> there<00:01:22.790> are<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:22.940> lot<00:01:23.120> of

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
direct heating okay there are a lot of

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.120 
direct heating okay there are a lot of
flasks<00:01:23.660> out<00:01:23.810> there<00:01:24.080> that<00:01:24.260> are<00:01:24.290> not<00:01:24.530> meant<00:01:24.860> to

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
flasks out there that are not meant to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.550 
flasks out there that are not meant to
be<00:01:25.160> put<00:01:25.490> directly<00:01:25.640> on<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.300> stovetop<00:01:26.600> so

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
be put directly on the stovetop so

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.320 
be put directly on the stovetop so
please<00:01:27.830> be<00:01:28.040> sure<00:01:28.070> that<00:01:28.490> if<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.700> are<00:01:28.730> going<00:01:29.030> to

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
please be sure that if you are going to

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.040 
please be sure that if you are going to
direct<00:01:30.200> boil<00:01:30.950> your<00:01:31.220> water<00:01:31.630> in<00:01:32.630> your<00:01:32.750> flask

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
direct boil your water in your flask

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.220 
direct boil your water in your flask
that<00:01:33.260> your<00:01:33.470> flask<00:01:33.740> does<00:01:34.370> support<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.240> okay

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
that your flask does support that okay

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.649 
that your flask does support that okay
so<00:01:36.290> here<00:01:36.620> I<00:01:36.650> am<00:01:36.740> starting<00:01:37.400> to<00:01:37.520> boil<00:01:37.760> my<00:01:38.060> water

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
so here I am starting to boil my water

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.750 
so here I am starting to boil my water
in<00:01:38.870> my<00:01:38.990> flask<00:01:39.320> I'm<00:01:40.010> going<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.250> stop<00:01:40.460> just

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
in my flask I'm going to stop just

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.280 
in my flask I'm going to stop just
before<00:01:40.880> it<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.390> Boyles<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:41.750> just<00:01:41.930> want<00:01:42.080> it<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.200> be

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
before it to Boyles I just want it to be

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.649 
before it to Boyles I just want it to be
hot<00:01:42.650> when<00:01:42.830> I<00:01:42.890> add<00:01:43.100> my<00:01:43.130> DME<00:01:43.790> because<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.210> don't

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
hot when I add my DME because I don't

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.750 
hot when I add my DME because I don't
want<00:01:44.690> any<00:01:44.900> boil<00:01:45.350> overs<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.460> make<00:01:46.610> sure<00:01:46.640> you're

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
want any boil overs so make sure you're

to move my flask off the heat so that I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:41.660 
to move my flask off the heat so that I
can<00:02:32.760> put<00:02:33.120> my<00:02:33.180> DME<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.750> there<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:41.220> be<00:02:41.400> very

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
can put my DME in there it's be very

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
can put my DME in there it's be very

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
careful with Boyle overs if you if your

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.890 
careful with Boyle overs if you if your
water<00:02:44.520> is<00:02:44.640> already<00:02:44.880> boiling<00:02:45.330> you'd<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:45.870> a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
water is already boiling you'd have a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.160 
water is already boiling you'd have a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
high chance of having a boil over so not

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.490 
high chance of having a boil over so not
quite<00:02:49.410> boiling<00:02:50.160> just<00:02:50.880> have<00:02:51.090> hot<00:02:51.360> water<00:02:51.500> slowly

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
quite boiling just have hot water slowly

add<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.950> DME<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.820> make<00:02:54.000> sure<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.360> you're<00:02:54.480> not

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
add the DME to make sure that you're not

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.040 
add the DME to make sure that you're not
about<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.710> boil<00:02:56.040> over<00:02:56.250> after<00:02:59.750> that<00:03:00.750> you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
about to have a boil over after that you

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.010 
about to have a boil over after that you
want<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.290> swirl<00:03:01.530> your<00:03:01.770> flask<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:03.540> mix<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.900> all

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
want to swirl your flask to mix it all

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.810 
want to swirl your flask to mix it all
up<00:03:04.050> again<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.830> want<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.040> be<00:03:05.130> careful<00:03:05.340> don't<00:03:05.610> do

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
up again you want to be careful don't do

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.640 
up again you want to be careful don't do
too<00:03:06.000> much<00:03:06.150> at<00:03:06.330> once<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:07.050> kind<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.410> few

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
too much at once it's kind of a few

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:35.330 
too much at once it's kind of a few
gentle<00:03:08.720> shakes<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.960> first<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.440> get<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.650> mixed

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.590 

then<00:03:36.340> after<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.730> you<00:03:36.910> can<00:03:37.030> return<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.510> to

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
then after that you can return it to

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.449 
then after that you can return it to
your<00:03:37.720> heat<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:41.260> then<00:03:41.470> gradually<00:03:41.709> bring<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.340> to

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
your heat and then gradually bring it to

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.660 
your heat and then gradually bring it to
a<00:03:42.490> slow<00:03:43.000> roll<00:03:43.630> rolling<00:03:44.440> boil<00:03:44.680> for<00:03:45.069> about<00:03:45.160> 15

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
a slow roll rolling boil for about 15

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.790 
a slow roll rolling boil for about 15
minutes<00:03:48.900> okay<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:49.959> can<00:03:50.170> see<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:50.350> have<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.560> nice

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
minutes okay you can see I have a nice

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.449 
minutes okay you can see I have a nice
rolling<00:03:51.190> boil<00:03:51.550> going<00:03:51.700> on<00:03:52.030> right<00:03:52.240> now<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:54.310> got

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
rolling boil going on right now you got

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.280 
rolling boil going on right now you got
to<00:03:54.580> be<00:03:54.670> very<00:03:54.700> careful<00:03:54.970> again<00:03:55.600> about<00:03:55.840> boil<00:03:56.110> over

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
to be very careful again about boil over

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.710 
to be very careful again about boil over
it's<00:03:56.739> really<00:03:57.190> easy<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.610> boil<00:03:57.880> over<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.330> a<00:03:58.420> flask

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
it's really easy to boil over in a flask

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.820 
it's really easy to boil over in a flask
so<00:04:00.420> I'm<00:04:01.420> just<00:04:01.570> going<00:04:01.720> to<00:04:01.810> let<00:04:01.989> this<00:04:02.170> boil<00:04:02.470> for

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
so I'm just going to let this boil for

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.600 
so I'm just going to let this boil for
15<00:04:03.100> minutes<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:05.380> after<00:04:05.560> 15<00:04:06.130> minutes<00:04:06.340> we're

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
15 minutes and after 15 minutes we're

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.390 
15 minutes and after 15 minutes we're
going<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.820> cool<00:04:07.090> this<00:04:07.269> off<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:07.980> bath<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.250> ice

okay<00:04:24.039> my<00:04:24.220> 15<00:04:24.580> minute<00:04:24.789> boil<00:04:24.940> is<00:04:25.120> complete<00:04:25.509> I<00:04:25.860> put

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
okay my 15 minute boil is complete I put

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.270 
okay my 15 minute boil is complete I put
a<00:04:26.889> foil<00:04:27.190> top<00:04:27.580> on<00:04:28.389> top<00:04:28.449> of<00:04:28.750> my<00:04:28.840> flask<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:29.530> I

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
prepared an ice water bath now you're

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.379 
prepared an ice water bath now you're
going<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.180> take<00:04:34.330> your<00:04:34.360> flask<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.610> cool<00:04:37.240> it

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
going to take your flask and cool it

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:48.779

down<00:04:37.419> I<00:04:46.830> usually<00:04:47.830> put<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.099> flask<00:04:48.340> in<00:04:48.610> nice

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789

spin it for a while and that's that let

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.930 
spin it for a while and that's that let
your<00:05:01.690> work<00:05:01.900> cool<00:05:02.530> so<00:05:03.430> my<00:05:03.550> word<00:05:03.759> is<00:05:03.909> still

just a little swirl it's a good way of
seeing<00:06:44.930> that<00:06:45.080> activity<00:06:45.350> you<00:06:45.650> can<00:06:45.800> see<00:06:45.980> that
