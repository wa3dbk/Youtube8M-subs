00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.760 

but<00:03:28.510> amounts<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.020> front<00:03:30.230> rank<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.709> is

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
but amounts to the front rank that is

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.560 
but amounts to the front rank that is
actually<00:03:31.250> mounted<00:03:31.400> up<00:03:31.700> real<00:03:31.940> solid<00:03:32.270> to<00:03:32.510> the

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
actually mounted up real solid to the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.030 
actually mounted up real solid to the
frame<00:03:32.870> so<00:03:32.900> think<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.440> gotta<00:03:33.590> make<00:03:33.680> sure<00:03:33.860> that

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
frame so think you gotta make sure that

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.620 
frame so think you gotta make sure that
saw<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.430> onto<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.790> frame<00:03:34.970> if<00:03:35.150> not<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:35.480> will

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
saw it onto the frame if not you will

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.300 
saw it onto the frame if not you will
have<00:03:35.690> something<00:03:36.640> opportunity<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:38.980> boom<00:03:39.980> I

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
have something opportunity and boom I

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.250 
have something opportunity and boom I
wrapped<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.910> up<00:03:41.090> duct<00:03:41.299> tape<00:03:41.540> manner<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.019> any

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
wrapped it up duct tape manner so any

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.060 
wrapped it up duct tape manner so any
mud<00:03:42.500> holes<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:43.670> will<00:03:44.380> semi<00:03:45.380> keep<00:03:45.709> most<00:03:45.920> of

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
mud holes it will semi keep most of

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.900 
mud holes it will semi keep most of
water<00:03:46.310> out

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
water out

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.400 
water out
I<00:03:46.940> don't<00:03:47.480> know<00:03:47.540> how<00:03:47.630> waterproof<00:03:47.930> good<00:03:48.230> thing

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
I don't know how waterproof good thing

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.130 
I don't know how waterproof good thing
is<00:03:48.590> but<00:03:49.120> that's<00:03:50.120> pretty<00:03:50.360> much<00:03:50.450> suggest<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:51.049> it

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
is but that's pretty much suggest of it

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.620 
is but that's pretty much suggest of it
so<00:03:52.130> there<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:53.060> can<00:03:53.150> have<00:03:53.239> your<00:03:53.269> entire

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
so there it is you can have your entire

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.229 
so there it is you can have your entire
winch<00:03:53.959> set<00:03:54.830> up<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.220> bought<00:03:55.549> this<00:03:55.730> stringer<00:03:56.090> here

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
winch set up I bought this stringer here

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.479 
winch set up I bought this stringer here
also<00:03:56.360> Walmart<00:03:56.900> for<00:03:57.049> like<00:03:57.170> I<00:03:57.440> think<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.190> was<00:03:58.250> ten

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
also Walmart for like I think it was ten

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.680 
also Walmart for like I think it was ten
dollars<00:03:58.640> but<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:59.030> definitely<00:03:59.209> comes<00:03:59.480> in<00:03:59.630> handy

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
dollars but it definitely comes in handy

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.720 
dollars but it definitely comes in handy
but<00:04:00.410> sometimes<00:04:00.830> it's<00:04:01.010> wires<00:04:01.370> only<00:04:01.580> but<00:04:01.700> I

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
but sometimes it's wires only but I

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.430 
but sometimes it's wires only but I
think<00:04:01.940> that's<00:04:02.060> worried<00:04:02.209> about<00:04:02.360> 30<00:04:02.630> feet<00:04:02.840> so

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
think that's worried about 30 feet so

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.620 
think that's worried about 30 feet so
this<00:04:03.620> year<00:04:03.920> pretty<00:04:04.549> much<00:04:04.610> dajin<00:04:05.000> capability

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
this year pretty much dajin capability

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.050 
this year pretty much dajin capability
and<00:04:05.720> also<00:04:06.019> cuts<00:04:06.620> down<00:04:06.769> on<00:04:06.829> wine<00:04:07.100> time<00:04:07.400> but<00:04:07.970> that

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
per minute so there it is simple easy

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.340 
per minute so there it is simple easy
