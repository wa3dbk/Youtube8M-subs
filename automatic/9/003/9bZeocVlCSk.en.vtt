00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.450
 today we are going to present a product of the brand n compete company to the leader in the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.450
 Possession of office made strong for desktop virtualization what in 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.090
 few words allow users to pay to use a single computer 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.250
 Simultaneously, the product model we have today is helene 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.680
 competent which is 550 which consists of a preceded plate 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.300
 that has been installed inside the computer and five terminals for 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.790
 the user who connect directly to the board is a very 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.300
 important especially useful for schools computer labs 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.490
 libraries and even offices where multiple computers are used to form 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.610
 simultaneous since it has many qualities that will help you save 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.040
 a lot of money in operational and maintenance investment costs such as 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.290
 we will explain later before explaining how it works and what are 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.320
 its most important characteristics 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.650
 let's show them how the product is externally everything is presented in 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.729
 a single box of good quality and where we can see a photo of the product 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.580
 and an explanation of its main functions on the outside 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.240
 inside it we find the plate 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.870
 weigh and model x 550 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.160
 together with its five terminals an installation manual I decided against rivas and 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.630
 a small bag with screws needed to fix the terminals in 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.860
 If the thick plate is necessary and 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.440
 that should not be confused with the slot that express idea in the connector sector 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.670
 we give five ports rj45 that although they own the same card that a cable 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.390
 external this network we must clarify that they are not external short that is to say can not be 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.870
 connect to a switch or barral plate 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.990
 these are exclusive high-speed cogs that can only be 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.270
 use to connect the terminal to the beach n change that impute you are 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.390
 remarkable 5m cat little thing is stp the connection terminals are very simple 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.640
 but of an excellent quality of construction in the front we can see 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.259
 The brand n compete 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.170
 together with a functioning indicator light 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.260
 at the top we see the logo of the company and in the back we have 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.290
 all connectors on it that are from left to right a club connector 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.150
 of tacoma 5 millimeters for headphones or talk before 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.409
 a psm connector for keyboard 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.019
 another psd collector for mahou-san a gea output for monitor and port 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.619
 rj 45 to connect the terminal to the board nk where the end x 550 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:42.249
 in this sector we can see five holes for the installation of 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.989
 screws to be able to fix the seaga terminal on a horizontal surface 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.370
 hoover tikal or conveniently mind behind the monitor in st 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.200
 7 has the holes for weight support now let's talk briefly about the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.729
 Equipment functionality 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:57.349
 efecom 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.750
 the yen is based on the principle that today's desktop computers in 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:04.749
 day has no spare processing capacity for tasks 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:10.720
 basic office and even not as basic as sharp use worth texas 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:15.349
 online and listen to music the idea is to use the ability to 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.439
 leftover processing to create virtual desktops that allows 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.389
 practically transform a computer into these six terminals 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.340
 work that can work simultaneously and independently 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.520
 even if we install a second plate in the plot between 15 550 we can 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.859
 use a single pc to operate 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.180
 eleven work stations or study 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.439
 this of course has its limitations foot requirements while more 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.189
 terminals are working 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.970
 more processing capacity I was dying ramp 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.300
 must have the main computer but with a dual processor 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.109
 core greater alcoca 5 towards caracas and cuatro of ram memory key is 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.859
 more than enough the advantages of installing this system in a cybercafé 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.699
 the school library polgár similar office are more than obvious first it 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.769
 deals enormously in initial investment costs since only 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.719
 you need to buy a single computer and you do not know second to have only one 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:16.060
 computer which does the technical service if now also in rooms and 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.459
 maintenance time 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.569
 third you also save energy costs each terminal uses a quad 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:22.449
 of energy 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.529
 while a computer uses about 200 watts approximately so 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:32.040
 energy costs denounce considerably and finally also 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.140
 Update costs are saved 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.010
 since when we must update a software or program we should only use it 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.140
 one time in the main computer saving costs in the acquisition and 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.790
 software installation as well as update times the 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.840
 installation is very simple you just need to place the plate on them the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.860
 corresponding to connect the terminals of the board 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.099
 and their respective devices and then install the software included in the 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.979
 package following the instructions on the screen in conclusion the kit 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.360
 desktop virtualization has competent that is going 50 is that a 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.020
 ideal solution for a company ohl institution that needs to install 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.599
 several similar computers 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:14.790
 for example 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.240
 a cybercafé, a computer lab or an office and that also 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.059
 wants to lower its operational investment and maintenance costs 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:25.069
 considerably
