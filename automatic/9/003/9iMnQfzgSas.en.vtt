00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.939
 it was a chore that they know to buy adobe networks 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:07.680
 and aquaculture or time are common things 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.550
 but if you see something strange that you 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.529
 searched google eighth accusing with virus 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:14.949
 for example exequial 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:15.979
 W 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.729

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.590
 the staff thinks it's a wonderful god and I 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.369
 a normal export file 

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:27.529
 the site targeted to the world is a normal file 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:29.270
 just so you 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.900
 he is straightforward this information 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.009
 already let the prison be more secure 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:36.509
 and always leaves the antivirus updated 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.400
 on malicious websites 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.610
 and always when you go to use the chat was very strong heat the alfaro tastes 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.199
 port 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.589
 everything is that until now I was with a smile 

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:49.990
 and piripiri privacy you 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.220
 left prison 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.689
 clean history with firefox passthrough 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:55.389
 and no flower information 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:57.119
 when you click the button 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:58.839
 I did it before firefox. 

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:01.790
 will be recorded on the website you entered 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.020
 so you left it so that it does not pass from formations to the package 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:10.520
 so, anyway, I hope you liked the videotape 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.700
 and have a nice day
