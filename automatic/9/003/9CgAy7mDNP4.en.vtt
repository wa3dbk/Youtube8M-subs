00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 how good today are we going to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.810
 make a video of a new tweet so 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.810
 let's start 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.990
 well um I also wanted to tell you something 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.280
 before continuing with the video before 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.900
 they start saying that I copy him 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.250
 other people or that other people 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.020
 copy to me and so on 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.240
 remember that those people like me 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.250
 we devote to this of apel to make videos of 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.710
 iphone ipod ipad from jailbreak 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.150
 applications tweets and so on and so 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.160
 it does not mean that we are copying 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.560
 simply everyone does it to their 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.420
 style and then you choose what 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.130
 style see it then please stop 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.280
 say that we're copying 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.410
 because it really is a bit this fool 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.450
 not let them say yes now anyway because 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.250
 It is already clear that well now 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.960
 we continue with the good video I already 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.870
 before I've recommended tweets for the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.030
 lock screen and before I had them 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.220
 recommended one that showed them the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.050
 application an application is favorite 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.750
 here on the right when they unlocked 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.910
 he appeared here or another one that was 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.009
 type this android guy not that 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.409
 four options appeared here 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.600
 up and you had to drop it on those 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.820
 applications here as you can see is very 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.070
 similar the concept we have this little ball 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.990
 and we can drop it on any of 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.690
 the applications and that's going to unlock 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.320
 the ipod iphone the ipad the iphone 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.790
 in that application that we have here not or 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.560
 we can also unlock it on the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.420
 center that that's just going to 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.310
 unlock the ipod normally good 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.200
 because this tweet is called the truth 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.000
 it's very nice right now 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.070
 I teach how to download it but good 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.380
 It took me a while to make this video because 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.000
 came out a few days ago someone 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.160
 asked to make the video but still 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.040
 did not come out in the repo of excel live for 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.050
 poderles make the video for how 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.580
 download it for free to all of you but 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.770
 Now it's out and that's why water 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.020
 video in order for this we are going to go to 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.030
 cydia and once in cydia we're going to go 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.550
 to drive then here in driving us 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.960
 let's go to the sources edit add 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.720
 and here we are going to add the repo of 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.640
 always from cydia dot exe live.com it 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.350
 I leave them in the description and well 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.940
 they add it and since they have it ready 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.720
 they are simply going to look for and here 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.790
 in search are going to look for this atm atom so 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.530
 from simple that simple and good here 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.720
 instead of where it says modify is going to 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.280
 say install then confirm what 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.160
 They confirm and ask them will wince 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.250
 eye this only is compatible with ios 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.110
 6 onwards and can only be used 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.820
 on the iphone or on the ipod touch 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.380
 the ipad version is still to come 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.630
 as you can see here then and have a 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.480
 ipad do not install it because I may 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.240
 fuck your ipad and well you can simply 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.710
 that does not let them install it then 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.570
 those are the requirements that it has 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.760
 this tweet and since they have it then 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.460
 simply when you unlock on your ipod 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.320
 or iphone and they will appear this way 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.390
 new unlocking that looks the truth 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.920
 very beautiful not then here I am going to 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.680
 unblock for example in 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.020
 in facetime and open us directly face 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.740
 time and here I will also unlock it 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.560
 directly in 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.480
 in the camera and it opens us directly the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.390
 camera then how they look very nice 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.550
 tweet and very useful how you configure those 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.830
 six applications the six options 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.780
 that we have here so very simple 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.820
 we're just going to go to the settings 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.250
 we are going to go down to the part of 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.170
 the tweets we're going to go to atom and here 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.750

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.180
 Once we select it simply 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.100

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.280
