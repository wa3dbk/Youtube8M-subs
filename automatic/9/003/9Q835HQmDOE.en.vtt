Wow so what's new about this version of
the<00:01:15.330> huntsmen<00:01:15.780> well<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:16.560> until<00:01:16.649> now<00:01:16.890> all<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
the huntsmen well up until now all the

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.279 
the huntsmen well up until now all the
workings<00:01:18.179> have<00:01:18.390> been<00:01:18.539> contained<00:01:18.899> within<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
workings have been contained within the

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.139 
workings have been contained within the
air<00:01:19.409> cylinder<00:01:19.679> not<00:01:20.640> anymore

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
air cylinder not anymore

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.570 
air cylinder not anymore
that<00:01:21.869> has<00:01:22.049> been<00:01:22.229> split<00:01:22.500> down<00:01:22.799> into<00:01:23.250> three

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
that has been split down into three

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.969 
that has been split down into three
separate<00:01:24.000> components<00:01:24.170> which<00:01:25.170> makes<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.770> even

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
separate components which makes it even

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.800 
separate components which makes it even
more<00:01:26.369> serviceable<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.600> future<00:01:28.289> compliant

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
more serviceable and future compliant

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.779 
more serviceable and future compliant
and<00:01:30.810> within<00:01:31.440> one<00:01:31.679> of<00:01:31.799> those<00:01:31.920> new<00:01:32.159> components

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
and within one of those new components

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.809 
and within one of those new components
is<00:01:33.209> a<00:01:33.270> titanium<00:01:33.929> valve<00:01:34.500> which<00:01:35.250> makes<00:01:35.580> the

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
is a titanium valve which makes the

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.539 
is a titanium valve which makes the
Regal<00:01:36.209> even<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:37.080> efficient<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
Regal even more efficient and because of

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.910 
Regal even more efficient and because of
those<00:01:38.759> new<00:01:39.000> workings<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.020> stock<00:01:40.409> has<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
those new workings the stock has a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.309 
those new workings the stock has a
slightly<00:01:41.340> different<00:01:41.610> look<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.630> been<00:01:42.869> taken

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
slightly different look it's been taken

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.529 
slightly different look it's been taken

so<00:01:46.709> the<00:01:46.799> checkering<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.429> rifle<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:48.030> truly

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:48.569 
so the checkering on the rifle is truly

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.480 
so the checkering on the rifle is truly
three-dimensional<00:01:49.470> because<00:01:50.069> it<00:01:50.189> wraps

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
three-dimensional because it wraps

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.210 
three-dimensional because it wraps
around<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.179> four<00:01:51.420> end<00:01:51.630> grip<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.860> also<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.189> a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
around the four end grip you also get a

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.979 
around the four end grip you also get a
large<00:01:53.490> air<00:01:53.850> cylinder<00:01:54.360> which<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:54.929> to

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:54.989 
large air cylinder which is going to

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.190 
large air cylinder which is going to
give<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.289> more<00:01:55.530> shots<00:01:55.920> per<00:01:56.129> charge<00:01:56.399> around<00:01:57.209> 95

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
give you more shots per charge around 95

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.059 
give you more shots per charge around 95
into<00:01:58.649> two<00:01:58.830> caliber<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.640> around<00:02:00.179> 82<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.170> 177

into two caliber or around 82 in 177
caliber<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:03.300> that<00:02:03.479> larger<00:02:03.840> air<00:02:04.080> cylinder

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
caliber with that larger air cylinder

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.919

and<00:02:04.860> new<00:02:05.160> technology<00:02:05.819> you<00:02:06.330> don't<00:02:06.599> end<00:02:06.810> up

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
and new technology you don't end up

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.499

carrying<00:02:07.259> much<00:02:07.530> more<00:02:07.769> weight<00:02:08.009> around<00:02:08.509> 2.7

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
