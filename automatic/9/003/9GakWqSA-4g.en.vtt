00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
fill up empty spaces on your board and

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.200 
fill up empty spaces on your board and
the<00:01:34.979> better<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> more

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the better you get at that the more

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.819 
the better you get at that the more
likely<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.750> are<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.869> start<00:01:37.259> scoring<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
likely you are to start scoring in the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.440 
likely you are to start scoring in the
positives<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> getting<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.180> know<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.329> I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
positives and getting you know like I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.319 
positives and getting you know like I
said<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.630> mean<00:01:39.720> Jen<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.439> me<00:01:40.950> oh<00:01:41.250> gosh<00:01:42.150> we've

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
said I mean Jen and me oh gosh we've

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.060 
said I mean Jen and me oh gosh we've
played<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.840> few<00:01:43.320> times<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.009> think

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
played this a few times now and I think

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.910 
played this a few times now and I think
our<00:01:44.579> best<00:01:44.970> score<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.780> us<00:01:45.899> got<00:01:46.229> somewhere

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
our best score one of us got somewhere

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.310 
our best score one of us got somewhere
in<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.040> mid<00:01:47.189> 20s<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> most<00:01:49.140> part

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in the mid 20s and for the most part

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
in the mid 20s and for the most part
we're<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.770> anywhere<00:01:50.100> from<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:51.030> know

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
we're you know anywhere from you know

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.870 
we're you know anywhere from you know
averaging<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> teens<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.280> where<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.579> tend

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
averaging in the teens is where we tend

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
averaging in the teens is where we tend
to<00:01:54.000> land<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.720> know<00:01:54.810> generally<00:01:55.619> fairly<00:01:55.829> close

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
to land you know generally fairly close

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.069 
to land you know generally fairly close
to<00:01:56.310> each<00:01:56.369> other<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:56.790> Jen<00:01:57.360> did<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.810> up<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.020> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
to each other but Jen did get up in the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.929 
to each other but Jen did get up in the
mid<00:01:58.229> 20s<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:58.770> time<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.310> point<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.880> think

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
mid 20s one time at one point I think

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.780 
mid 20s one time at one point I think
one<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.299> us<00:02:00.450> probably<00:02:00.719> me<00:02:01.020> was<00:02:01.920> down<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.700> know

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
one of us probably me was down you know

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.580 
one of us probably me was down you know
close<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.270> zero<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.509> not<00:02:03.659> quite<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:04.049> zero<00:02:04.350> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
close to zero but not quite at zero I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.260 
close to zero but not quite at zero I
mean<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.130> was<00:02:05.280> really<00:02:05.430> surprised<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.090> mean<00:02:06.180> I

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
mean I was really surprised I mean I

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570 
mean I was really surprised I mean I
played<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.810> poorly<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:08.039> ended<00:02:08.220> up<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.399> one

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
played so poorly and I ended up with one

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.979 
played so poorly and I ended up with one
in<00:02:08.700> negative<00:02:09.000> 12<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.330> run<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.660> did<00:02:09.840> but

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
in negative 12 in this run so I did but

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.630 
in negative 12 in this run so I did but
you<00:02:10.140> know<00:02:10.200> even<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.340> guess<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you know even so that's I guess you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.160 
you know even so that's I guess you
could<00:02:11.760> say<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.060> would<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.239> kind<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.599> beginner

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
could say it would be kind of a beginner

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.660 
could say it would be kind of a beginner
where<00:02:13.440> you're<00:02:13.560> really<00:02:13.830> only<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.340> thinking

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
where you're really only just thinking

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.030 
where you're really only just thinking
three<00:02:15.569> tiles<00:02:15.810> ahead<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.709> need<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.950> be

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
three tiles ahead you need to be

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.620 
three tiles ahead you need to be
thinking<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.430> lot<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.940> net<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.300> not<00:02:18.390> only

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
thinking a lot for the net and not only

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.850 
thinking a lot for the net and not only
think<00:02:18.780> about<00:02:18.840> what<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.500> want<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.739> grab

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
think about what it is you want to grab

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.680 
think about what it is you want to grab
but<00:02:20.459> trying<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.819> anticipate<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.540> your

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
but trying to anticipate what your

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.240 
but trying to anticipate what your
opponent<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.200> gonna<00:02:22.380> grab<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:22.770> if<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.010> grab

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
opponent is gonna grab because if I grab

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.760 
opponent is gonna grab because if I grab
this<00:02:23.670> let's<00:02:24.510> see<00:02:24.630> okay<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.290> Jen<00:02:25.530> grabs

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
this let's see okay so if Jen grabs

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.440 
this let's see okay so if Jen grabs
eastery<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.880> thing<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.150> really

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
eastery and this is the thing I really

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.630 
eastery and this is the thing I really
want<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.560> Jen<00:02:28.860> likely<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.400> take

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
want I have to is Jen likely to take

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.100 
want I have to is Jen likely to take
this<00:02:29.819> one<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.420> I'll<00:02:30.540> be<00:02:30.569> able<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.930> get<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
this one so that I'll be able to get the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.600 
this one so that I'll be able to get the
thing<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.470> need<00:02:31.530> or<00:02:31.800> she's<00:02:31.980> gonna<00:02:32.040> go<00:02:32.250> forward

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
thing I need or she's gonna go forward

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.309 
thing I need or she's gonna go forward
like<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.030> which<00:02:33.540> means<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:33.870> won't<00:02:34.110> have

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
like this which means I won't have

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.050 
like this which means I won't have
access<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:35.670> course<00:02:35.700> there's

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
access to it and then of course there's

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.850 
access to it and then of course there's
also<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.780> know<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.319> can<00:02:37.590> hold<00:02:37.800> back

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
also the you know if I can hold back

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.199 
also the you know if I can hold back
long<00:02:38.220> enough<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.550> somebody<00:02:38.819> makes<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.030> really

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
long enough and somebody makes a really

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.610 
long enough and somebody makes a really
big<00:02:39.360> point<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.959> just<00:02:40.080> make<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.200> lot<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.470> money

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
big point I can just make a lot of money

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.800 
big point I can just make a lot of money
this<00:02:40.830> way<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.430> that's<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.790> lot<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.090> time<00:02:42.480> loss

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
this way but that's a lot of time loss

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.750 
this way but that's a lot of time loss
that<00:02:43.110> could<00:02:43.349> have<00:02:43.500> been<00:02:43.650> spent<00:02:43.800> getting<00:02:44.580> more

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
that could have been spent getting more

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.090 
that could have been spent getting more
you<00:02:45.239> know<00:02:45.330> empty<00:02:45.630> spaces<00:02:45.989> filled<00:02:46.350> on<00:02:46.590> my<00:02:46.769> quilt

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
you know empty spaces filled on my quilt

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.840 
you know empty spaces filled on my quilt
so<00:02:48.090> like<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.170> said<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.380> mean<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.850> surprising

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
so like I said I mean it's surprising

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.330 
so like I said I mean it's surprising
just<00:02:51.060> how<00:02:51.540> much<00:02:52.019> there<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.560> think<00:02:52.799> about<00:02:52.920> in

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
just how much there is to think about in

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.970 
just how much there is to think about in
this<00:02:53.640> game<00:02:54.000> if<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.019> want<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.739> succeed

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
this game if you want to really succeed

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.160 
this game if you want to really succeed
but<00:02:56.489> even<00:02:56.850> still<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.569> could<00:02:57.720> play<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.019> with

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
but even still you could play it with

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.600 
but even still you could play it with
just<00:02:58.380> about<00:02:58.500> anybody<00:02:58.950> because<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.430> just

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
just about anybody because it's just

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.660 
just about anybody because it's just
very<00:02:59.880> simple<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.780> fun<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.530> fast<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.370> play<00:03:02.519> and

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
very simple and fun and fast to play and

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.460 
very simple and fun and fast to play and
I<00:03:02.700> think<00:03:02.880> anybody<00:03:03.180> would<00:03:03.480> enjoy<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.930> on<00:03:04.080> the

able to afford something that's pretty

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.620 
able to afford something that's pretty
much<00:03:09.060> how<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.209> was<00:03:09.299> playing<00:03:09.480> in<00:03:09.540> this

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
much how I was playing in this

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.180 
much how I was playing in this
run-through<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.319> think<00:03:10.709> it's<00:03:10.799> really

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
run-through so I think it's really

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.759 
run-through so I think it's really
something<00:03:11.730> for<00:03:11.940> everybody<00:03:12.510> but<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.319> mean<00:03:13.739> I

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
something for everybody but I mean I

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.250 
something for everybody but I mean I

guess it is fair warning if you have an

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.560 
guess it is fair warning if you have an
expert<00:03:16.890> playing<00:03:17.100> at<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.489> new<00:03:17.700> beat<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.480> know

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
expert playing at in a new beat you know

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.449 
expert playing at in a new beat you know
the<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.109> newbie<00:03:19.350> will<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.680> get<00:03:19.769> completely

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
decimated like thirty two negative ten

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.440 
decimated like thirty two negative ten
or<00:03:23.100> something<00:03:23.250> like<00:03:23.609> that<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:23.850> mean<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:24.209> just

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
or something like that I mean so just

fair warning you really do need there's

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.210 
fair warning you really do need there's
no<00:03:26.640> real<00:03:26.850> balancing<00:03:27.450> or<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.079> know<00:03:28.220> not

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
no real balancing or you know not

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.800 
no real balancing or you know not
catch-up<00:03:29.489> mechanism<00:03:29.970> but<00:03:30.030> there's<00:03:30.540> no<00:03:30.660> like

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
catch-up mechanism but there's no like

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.599 
catch-up mechanism but there's no like
handicap<00:03:31.380> built<00:03:31.859> into<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.280> rules<00:03:32.459> which

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
handicap built into the rules which

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:33.800 
handicap built into the rules which
might<00:03:32.820> have<00:03:32.910> been<00:03:33.000> kind<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.299> nice<00:03:33.420> addition

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
might have been kind of a nice addition

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.840 
might have been kind of a nice addition
now<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.079> think<00:03:34.109> about<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.640> so<00:03:35.640> far<00:03:35.790> it

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
now that I think about it so far it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.009 
now that I think about it so far it
hasn't<00:03:35.970> prom<00:03:36.209> for<00:03:36.329> us<00:03:36.420> cuz<00:03:36.570> Jay<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.870> were

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
hasn't prom for us cuz Jay and I were

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.990 
hasn't prom for us cuz Jay and I were
fairly<00:03:37.560> evenly<00:03:37.890> matched<00:03:38.130> she<00:03:38.579> always<00:03:38.730> wins

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
fairly evenly matched she always wins

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.840 
fairly evenly matched she always wins
but<00:03:39.480> usually<00:03:40.290> it's<00:03:40.380> pretty<00:03:40.470> close<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.950> see<00:03:41.340> well

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
but usually it's pretty close I see well

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.360 
but usually it's pretty close I see well
I<00:03:41.880> guess<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.329> should<00:03:42.480> also<00:03:42.570> talk<00:03:42.930> about

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
I guess I should also talk about

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.080 
I guess I should also talk about
closed-shell<00:03:44.370> which<00:03:44.519> is<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.700> run<00:03:44.880> through<00:03:45.000> I

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
closed-shell which is a run through I

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.180 
closed-shell which is a run through I
had<00:03:45.329> done<00:03:45.480> previously<00:03:45.930> which<00:03:46.140> is<00:03:46.320> also<00:03:46.590> themed

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
had done previously which is also themed

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.819 
had done previously which is also themed
after<00:03:47.790> making<00:03:48.329> quilts<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.049> if<00:03:49.410> you're<00:03:49.620> trying

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
after making quilts and if you're trying

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.319 
after making quilts and if you're trying
to<00:03:49.920> think<00:03:50.130> about<00:03:50.310> way<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:50.579> have<00:03:50.850> somebody<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.239> my

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
to think about way I have somebody in my

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.970 
to think about way I have somebody in my
life<00:03:51.359> who<00:03:51.540> likes<00:03:51.900> quilts<00:03:52.350> which<00:03:52.560> one<00:03:52.739> should<00:03:52.890> I

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
life who likes quilts which one should I

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.210 
life who likes quilts which one should I
get

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
get

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.569 
get
patchwork<00:03:53.700> or<00:03:54.150> quilt<00:03:54.420> show<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.400> well<00:03:56.400> really

patchwork or quilt show and well really

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.190 
patchwork or quilt show and well really
I<00:03:56.670> mean<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:57.269> shouldn't<00:03:57.450> be<00:03:57.569> too<00:03:57.780> hard<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:58.140> a

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
I mean that shouldn't be too hard of a

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.199 
I mean that shouldn't be too hard of a
tough<00:03:58.709> choice<00:03:59.190> because<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.850> mean<00:04:00.090> they're

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
tough choice because I mean they're

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.789 
tough choice because I mean they're
they're<00:04:00.450> very<00:04:00.480> very<00:04:01.140> different<00:04:01.319> other<00:04:01.650> than

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
they're very very different other than

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.160 
they're very very different other than
just<00:04:01.920> having<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.250> same<00:04:02.459> theme<00:04:02.819> they're<00:04:03.660> there

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
just having the same theme they're there

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.130 
just having the same theme they're there
they<00:04:04.380> couldn't<00:04:04.769> do<00:04:05.010> there<00:04:05.250> night<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.670> day<00:04:06.140> one

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
they couldn't do there night and day one

they couldn't do there night and day one
patch<00:04:07.859> work<00:04:08.160> isn't<00:04:08.430> really<00:04:08.880> about<00:04:08.970> making

patch work isn't really about making

where you really do feel like you're

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.540 
where you really do feel like you're
actually<00:04:25.200> going<00:04:25.530> out<00:04:25.710> shopping<00:04:26.250> trying<00:04:26.490> to

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
actually going out shopping trying to

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.900 
actually going out shopping trying to
find<00:04:26.700> there

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
find there

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.280 
find there
fabrics<00:04:27.390> mixing<00:04:27.690> together<00:04:27.840> in<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.140> right<00:04:28.230> way

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
fabrics mixing together in the right way

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.230 
fabrics mixing together in the right way
and<00:04:28.590> then<00:04:28.890> entering<00:04:29.280> them<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:29.610> competitions

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
and then entering them in competitions

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.120 
and then entering them in competitions
and<00:04:30.390> getting<00:04:30.630> ribbons<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.590> stuff<00:04:31.770> like<00:04:31.920> that

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
and getting ribbons and stuff like that

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.760 
and getting ribbons and stuff like that
so<00:04:32.310> quilt<00:04:33.300> show<00:04:33.480> definitely<00:04:34.110> captures<00:04:34.590> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
so quilt show definitely captures the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.830 
so quilt show definitely captures the
feel<00:04:35.100> around<00:04:35.610> making<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.120> quilt<00:04:36.390> much<00:04:36.600> better

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
feel around making a quilt much better

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.020 
feel around making a quilt much better
whereas<00:04:37.050> this<00:04:37.140> is<00:04:37.200> a<00:04:37.290> pure<00:04:37.740> abstract<00:04:38.310> quilt

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
whereas this is a pure abstract quilt

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.570 
whereas this is a pure abstract quilt
show<00:04:39.180> off<00:04:39.510> so<00:04:39.900> obviously<00:04:40.650> goes<00:04:41.160> with<00:04:41.370> more

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
show off so obviously goes with more

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.400 
show off so obviously goes with more
than<00:04:41.700> two<00:04:41.850> players<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.810> in<00:04:42.930> fact<00:04:43.110> actually

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
than two players and in fact actually

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.380 
than two players and in fact actually
quilt<00:04:43.650> shows<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.830> little<00:04:44.070> bit<00:04:44.280> weaker<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:45.210> more

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
quilt shows a little bit weaker the more

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.850 
quilt shows a little bit weaker the more
players<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.810> have<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.260> better<00:04:46.500> with<00:04:46.710> that

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
players you have the better with that

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.650 
players you have the better with that
game<00:04:47.100> because<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.460> way<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:48.300> actual

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
game because of the way the the actual

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.600 
game because of the way the the actual
quilt<00:04:48.960> shows<00:04:49.170> themselves<00:04:49.800> work<00:04:49.980> whereas<00:04:50.490> this

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
quilt shows themselves work whereas this

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.760 
quilt shows themselves work whereas this
can<00:04:50.820> only<00:04:51.150> be<00:04:51.480> played<00:04:51.720> for<00:04:51.900> two<00:04:52.020> players<00:04:52.230> so<00:04:52.500> I

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
can only be played for two players so I

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.080 
can only be played for two players so I
think<00:04:52.890> it<00:04:53.130> probably<00:04:53.640> more<00:04:53.790> than<00:04:53.880> anything

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
think it probably more than anything

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.210 
think it probably more than anything
else<00:04:54.300> comes<00:04:54.570> down<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:54.960> if<00:04:55.230> you're<00:04:55.890> trying

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
else comes down to that if you're trying

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.090 
else comes down to that if you're trying
to<00:04:56.250> pick<00:04:56.460> between<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.820> two<00:04:56.850> if<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.660> want<00:04:58.100> well

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
to pick between the two if you want well

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.800 
to pick between the two if you want well
although<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.460> should<00:04:59.640> say<00:04:59.790> also<00:04:59.940> patchwork<00:05:00.630> is

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
although I should say also patchwork is

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.260 
although I should say also patchwork is
definitely<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.860> deeper<00:05:02.400> game<00:05:02.670> there's<00:05:02.970> more

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
definitely a deeper game there's more

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.520 
definitely a deeper game there's more
going<00:05:03.480> on<00:05:03.660> there's<00:05:03.930> more<00:05:03.990> to<00:05:04.260> think<00:05:04.380> about

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
going on there's more to think about

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.440 
going on there's more to think about
there's<00:05:04.830> more<00:05:05.010> to<00:05:05.130> plan<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:05.610> up<00:05:05.820> whereas

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
there's more to plan and up whereas

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.080 
there's more to plan and up whereas
quilt<00:05:06.960> show<00:05:07.380> is<00:05:07.620> definitely<00:05:07.890> on<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.850> lighter

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
quilt show is definitely on the lighter

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.180 
quilt show is definitely on the lighter
side<00:05:09.240> but<00:05:09.750> really<00:05:10.350> I<00:05:10.620> think<00:05:10.770> it<00:05:10.830> comes<00:05:10.980> down<00:05:11.130> to

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
side but really I think it comes down to

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.740 
side but really I think it comes down to
if<00:05:11.460> you<00:05:11.580> if<00:05:11.790> you<00:05:12.000> want<00:05:12.180> to<00:05:12.270> play<00:05:12.360> with<00:05:12.480> more

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
if you if you want to play with more

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.940 
if you if you want to play with more
than<00:05:12.930> two<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.260> probably<00:05:13.470> wanna<00:05:13.620> quilt<00:05:13.800> show

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
than two you probably wanna quilt show

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.470 
than two you probably wanna quilt show
if<00:05:14.070> you're<00:05:14.190> only<00:05:14.280> playing<00:05:14.610> with<00:05:14.730> two<00:05:14.940> you

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
if you're only playing with two you

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.300 
if you're only playing with two you
might<00:05:15.720> want<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.140> go<00:05:16.290> with<00:05:16.320> patchwork<00:05:16.920> instead

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
might want to go with patchwork instead

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.550 
might want to go with patchwork instead
and<00:05:17.550> that's<00:05:18.000> it<00:05:18.150> folks<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.900> Hat<00:05:19.050> I<00:05:19.260> think

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
and that's it folks the Hat I think

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.120 
and that's it folks the Hat I think
