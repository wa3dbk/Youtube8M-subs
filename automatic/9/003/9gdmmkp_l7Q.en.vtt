in<00:00:00.390> this<00:00:01.290> clip<00:00:01.620> we're<00:00:01.920> going<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.070> talk<00:00:02.250> about

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
in this clip we're going to talk about

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.460 
in this clip we're going to talk about
the<00:00:02.669> proper<00:00:03.090> service<00:00:03.120> procedure<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:04.140> remove

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
the proper service procedure to remove

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.740 
the proper service procedure to remove
inspect<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.700> overhaul<00:00:05.910> your<00:00:06.480> vehicle's

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
inspect and overhaul your vehicle's

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.089 
inspect and overhaul your vehicle's
alternator<00:00:07.490> in<00:00:09.440> this<00:00:10.440> step<00:00:10.710> we're<00:00:10.950> going<00:00:11.040> to

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
alternator in this step we're going to

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.530 
alternator in this step we're going to
talk<00:00:11.309> about<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.730> proper<00:00:12.150> service<00:00:12.179> procedure

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
talk about the proper service procedure

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.890 
talk about the proper service procedure
for<00:00:13.519> inspecting<00:00:14.519> our<00:00:14.759> voltage<00:00:15.240> regulator<00:00:15.719> and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
for inspecting our voltage regulator and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.130 
for inspecting our voltage regulator and
brushes<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.859> our<00:00:17.609> commutator<00:00:18.180> inside<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
brushes and our commutator inside the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.019 
brushes and our commutator inside the
alternator<00:00:19.590> now<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.400> alternator<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:20.880> going

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
alternator now the alternator is going

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
alternator now the alternator is going
to<00:00:21.090> have<00:00:21.210> several<00:00:21.539> more<00:00:21.900> components<00:00:22.619> inside

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
to have several more components inside

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.359 
to have several more components inside
of<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.490> diyos<00:00:23.939> diodes<00:00:24.810> um<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.830> consist

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
of it some diyos diodes um that consist

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.640 
of it some diyos diodes um that consist
that<00:00:26.880> make<00:00:27.090> up<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.330> rectifier<00:00:27.810> bridge<00:00:28.019> it

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
that make up the rectifier bridge it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.009 
that make up the rectifier bridge it
also<00:00:28.800> has<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> bunch<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.550> windings<00:00:30.119> inside<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
large electromagnet which is generated

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.750 
large electromagnet which is generated

manufacturers<00:00:54.629> buy<00:00:54.809> them<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.110> large<00:00:55.320> volume

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
manufacturers buy them in large volume

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.430 
manufacturers buy them in large volume
and<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:57.000> difficult<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:57.809> them<00:00:58.050> from

and it's very difficult to get them from

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.290 
and it's very difficult to get them from

a parts store the parts that are
available<00:01:00.719> though<00:01:00.840> are<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.199> wearing<00:01:01.440> items

available though are the wearing items
which<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:02.670> brushes<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.809> can

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
which will be your brushes as you can

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.460 
which will be your brushes as you can
see<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:05.659> have<00:01:06.659> my<00:01:06.689> brushes<00:01:07.290> they're

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
see here I have my brushes they're

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.660 
see here I have my brushes they're
actually<00:01:07.770> still<00:01:08.010> connected<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
actually still connected to the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.929 
actually still connected to the
regulator<00:01:09.090> here<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
regulator here and here you can see the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.490 
regulator here and here you can see the
wear<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.420> has<00:01:12.750> occurred<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> brush

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
wear that has occurred on the brush

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.640 
wear that has occurred on the brush
compared<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> new<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:15.200> line<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.409> for

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
compared to the new one line that up for

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.890 
compared to the new one line that up for
you<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.299> as<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you just like so as you can see the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.810 
you just like so as you can see the
difference<00:01:19.259> these<00:01:19.770> brushes<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.369> worn<00:01:20.700> out

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
difference these brushes are worn out

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390 
difference these brushes are worn out
and<00:01:21.000> should<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.780> replaced<00:01:22.049> what<00:01:22.860> will<00:01:22.950> happen

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and should be replaced what will happen

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.539 
and should be replaced what will happen
is<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.270> graphite<00:01:24.720> wears<00:01:25.080> down<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.189> copper

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
is as the graphite wears down the copper

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.219 
is as the graphite wears down the copper
wiring<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.509> exposed

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
wiring will be exposed

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.100 
wiring will be exposed
now<00:01:28.439> copper<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.250> pretty<00:01:29.909> soft<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.900> still

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
now copper is pretty soft but it's still

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560 
now copper is pretty soft but it's still
harder<00:01:31.650> than<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.369> graphite<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.420> will

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
harder than the graphite and it will

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.590 
harder than the graphite and it will
tear<00:01:33.840> into<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.409> damaged<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.130> commutator<00:01:36.000> if

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
tear into and damaged or commutator if

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.870 
tear into and damaged or commutator if
your<00:01:36.750> commutator<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.439> damaged<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.400> cannot

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
your commutator is damaged you cannot

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
your commutator is damaged you cannot
replace<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:39.990> you're<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> want<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
replace it so you're going to want to

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.440 
replace it so you're going to want to
catch<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.920> before<00:01:41.189> those<00:01:41.670> brushes<00:01:41.939> wear<00:01:42.270> all

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
catch this before those brushes wear all

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.749 
catch this before those brushes wear all
the<00:01:42.570> way<00:01:42.659> down<00:01:42.869> as<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.100> even<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.490> mine

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the way down as you can see even on mine

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.230 
the way down as you can see even on mine
just<00:01:45.210> due<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.390> age<00:01:46.579> that<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> wiring<00:01:47.939> is

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
just due to age that the wiring is

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.950 
just due to age that the wiring is
