00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 welcome to the review of the zte blade l 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.240
 2 try to position yourself in the 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.849
 Mexican market with smartphones 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.650
 accessible and good features 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.900
 the blade l 12 is a clear example of a 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.519
 good value for money this 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.080
 team not only surprised by its great 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.240
 screen but for your specifications 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.039
 elegant design and a really price 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.990
 adjusted approximately two thousand 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.360
 weights with 3rd 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.980
 the equipment is large you can manipulate 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.840
 with one hand although sometimes it is 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.119
 It is necessary to use both to reach 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.040
 some menu options this may result 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.390
 uncomfortable for some users but in 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.940
 most get used quickly your 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.949
 size since it is also very light 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.320
 The main attraction of this team is 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.699
 the screen with 5-inch size one 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.260
 resolution of 480 x 854 and 195 pixels 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.829
 per inch offers us a good 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.899
 multimedia experience 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.789
 even though the resolution is not hd 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.589
 I assure you that it looks very good with 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.629
 acceptable brightness viewing angles 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.629
 also protection against scratches 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.650
 inside the zte blade l 12 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.890
 we found a four processor 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.830
 mediatek cores to 1.3 giga hertz a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.960
 arrives in ram a gpu malÃ­ 400 and a 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.250
 battery of 2000 well estates this we 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.170
 ensures good system performance 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.590
 in general as well as games and networks 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590
 social 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.819
 the customization layer is typical of 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.250
 zte is fast and with few modifications 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.320
 what is pure android 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.210
 although I personally prefer to install 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.070
 a launcher the use that I give a 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.440
 smartphone is mainly in networks 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.080
 social as facebook twitter instagram 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.240
 youtube and foursquare and the zte blade l2 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.590
 perfectly fulfills my demand due 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.869
 to the big screen you can visualize 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.700
 very well the content certainly this 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.440
 team is ideal to consume content 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.420
 and thanks to the benefits it will offer you 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.190
 a very good experience in the part 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.720
 posterior is the lid which we remove 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.390
 and we found a battery is not 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.490
 removable 2000 - camera speaker 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.730
 and the sim slot as well as the micro sd 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.350
 which is expandable up to 32 gigabytes 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.280
 then we will quickly approve 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.280
 the speaker 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.980
 as for cameras it has two one 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.810
 frontal vga and the main one of 8 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.670
 megapixels with flash and the ability to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.620
 record video in hd the interface is 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.630
 simple full of options like hdr 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.580
 panoramic photography detection 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.140
 face among others to get the most 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.460
 profit although the best result 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.460
 it always depends on the user 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.640
 another interesting aspect of this team 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.410
 is the inclusion of open tv though 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.230
 unfortunately you can not tune 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.580
 no channel is a very good extra a 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.900
 aspect that to my taste can be 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.959
 Improved is that the capacitive buttons 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.430
 they are not backlit making it difficult 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.019
 little its use in low light conditions 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.660
 although you can not demand too much 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.209
 for the low cost in conclusion the zte 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.069
 blade l 12 are very good team exceeded 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.780
 my expectations in several aspects like 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.930
 performance camera battery life 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.549
 among others has several aspects that 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.620
 they can improve but in general it's a 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.209
 smartphone that I recommend if you think about 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.019
 buy a new phone this can be 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.019
 your first choice 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.130
 this was all from the review of the 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.020
