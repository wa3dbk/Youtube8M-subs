i'll be using the new google plug-ins

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
i'll be using the new google plug-ins
for<00:00:42.260> hurricane<00:00:43.260> tracking<00:00:43.590> systems<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:44.840> be

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
for hurricane tracking systems which be

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.170 
for hurricane tracking systems which be
getting<00:00:46.410> help<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.680> google<00:00:47.160> from<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.550> so

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
getting help with google from that so

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.709 
getting help with google from that so
again<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.309> reason<00:00:50.309> why<00:00:50.700> we<00:00:51.270> were<00:00:51.360> talking

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
again the reason why we were talking

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.740 
again the reason why we were talking
about<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.610> 2009<00:00:53.610> hurricane<00:00:54.239> season<00:00:54.629> was

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
about the 2009 hurricane season was

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.920 
about the 2009 hurricane season was
because<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.379> very<00:00:56.180> below<00:00:57.180> average<00:00:57.390> which

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
because it was very below average which

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.689 
because it was very below average which
there<00:00:58.289> was<00:00:58.379> hardly<00:00:58.649> anything<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.460> talk<00:00:59.640> about

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
there was hardly anything to talk about

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.439 
there was hardly anything to talk about
and<00:01:00.180> reason<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:02.129> El<00:01:02.699> Nino<00:01:03.059> which

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and reason was because was El Nino which

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.469 
and reason was because was El Nino which
was<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.920> reason<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> inactivity<00:01:05.820> which

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
was the reason for the inactivity which

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.020 
was the reason for the inactivity which
was<00:01:06.750> linked<00:01:07.350> by<00:01:07.530> ill<00:01:08.010> ninu<00:01:08.369> again<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:09.000> of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
was linked by ill ninu again because of

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.800 
was linked by ill ninu again because of
the<00:01:09.210> wind<00:01:09.420> shear<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.979> did<00:01:11.729> get<00:01:11.880> more

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the wind shear so I did get more

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
the wind shear so I did get more
information<00:01:12.960> regarding<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.010> first<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
