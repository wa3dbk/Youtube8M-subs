type of Internet - technology called

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.760 
type of Internet - technology called
Lola<00:00:21.369> which<00:00:22.000> stands<00:00:22.210> for<00:00:22.300> low<00:00:22.539> latency<00:00:22.720> it's<00:00:23.650> a

Lola which stands for low latency it's a
video<00:00:24.039> conferencing<00:00:24.430> technology<00:00:25.000> that<00:00:25.480> is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:25.600 
video conferencing technology that is

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.870 
video conferencing technology that is
groundbreaking<00:00:25.960> in<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.500> sense<00:00:26.740> that<00:00:26.859> it<00:00:27.730> is

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
groundbreaking in the sense that it is

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.759 
groundbreaking in the sense that it is

they're interacting with each other it

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.530 
they're interacting with each other it
was<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:06.130> rewarding<00:01:06.760> experience<00:01:06.880> for<00:01:07.450> them

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
was a rewarding experience for them

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.380 
was a rewarding experience for them
musically<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.860> in<00:01:09.130> turn<00:01:09.430> then<00:01:09.760> prompts

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
advance of guest appearances we might

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.410 
advance of guest appearances we might
have<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.620> guest<00:01:17.800> artists<00:01:18.220> come<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.730> normally

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
have the guest artists come and normally

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.330 
have the guest artists come and normally
they<00:01:19.570> would<00:01:19.720> come<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.320> day<00:01:20.470> before<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:21.190> you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
they would come the day before and you

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.650 
they would come the day before and you
would<00:01:21.430> have<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.580> very<00:01:21.610> compressed<00:01:22.090> schedule

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
would have a very compressed schedule

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.020 
would have a very compressed schedule
and<00:01:22.870> maybe<00:01:23.050> not<00:01:23.290> really<00:01:23.830> enough<00:01:24.010> time<00:01:24.280> to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
and maybe not really enough time to

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.600 
and maybe not really enough time to
practice<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.050> prepare<00:01:26.200> as<00:01:26.560> you<00:01:26.650> would<00:01:26.770> like

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
practice and prepare as you would like

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.720 
practice and prepare as you would like
now<00:01:28.180> we<00:01:28.870> could<00:01:29.080> rehearse<00:01:29.230> weeks<00:01:30.130> or<00:01:30.370> months<00:01:30.640> in

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
now we could rehearse weeks or months in

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.360 
now we could rehearse weeks or months in
advance<00:01:30.850> together<00:01:31.840> before<00:01:32.800> they<00:01:33.130> come

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
advance together before they come

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.550 
advance together before they come
on-site<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:34.420> it<00:01:34.630> would<00:01:34.870> produce<00:01:35.080> so<00:01:35.440> much

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
on-site and it would produce so much

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.500 
on-site and it would produce so much
more<00:01:35.770> comfortable<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.430> more<00:01:36.970> artistic

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
more comfortable and more artistic

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.420 
more comfortable and more artistic
performance<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.620> listening<00:01:38.920> experience

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
performance and listening experience

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.149 
performance and listening experience
this<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.090> very<00:01:41.020> important<00:01:41.320> for<00:01:41.380> NIU<00:01:41.620> because

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
this is very important for NIU because

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.280 
this is very important for NIU because
this<00:01:42.850> is<00:01:42.970> not<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.210> first<00:01:43.360> time<00:01:43.720> this<00:01:44.080> is

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
this is not the first time this is

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.899 
this is not the first time this is
probably<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.920> third<00:01:45.040> or<00:01:45.190> fourth<00:01:45.460> time<00:01:45.700> the
