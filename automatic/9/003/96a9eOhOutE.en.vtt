00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
approaches now the reason that I damaged

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.139 
approaches now the reason that I damaged
little<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.119> because<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.020> Roar<00:01:49.920> whirlwind<00:01:50.640> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
little is because the Roar whirlwind it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.410 
little is because the Roar whirlwind it
will<00:01:51.299> target<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.990> weakest<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> ones

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
will target the weakest and and the ones

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.590 
will target the weakest and and the ones
with<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.670> with<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> rare<00:01:56.939> candy<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.450> how

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
with the with the rare candy that's how

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.410 
with the with the rare candy that's how
it's<00:01:57.750> programmed<00:01:58.670> so<00:01:59.670> I'm<00:01:59.969> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.240> wait

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
it's programmed so I'm going to wait

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.249 
it's programmed so I'm going to wait
until<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.170> get<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> wave<00:02:01.590> 40<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.310> 40<00:02:02.820> and

that will attack multiple targets and it

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.150 
that will attack multiple targets and it
will<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:11.280> able<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.520> take<00:02:11.760> out<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
will be able to take out the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.530 
will be able to take out the
extra<00:02:13.370> pokemon<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:13.880> are<00:02:14.000> just<00:02:14.180> going<00:02:14.360> back

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
extra pokemon that are just going back

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.990 
extra pokemon that are just going back
and<00:02:14.600> forth<00:02:14.990> here<00:02:15.080> much<00:02:15.680> faster<00:02:16.130> now<00:02:16.310> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
and forth here much faster now the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.670 
and forth here much faster now the
reason<00:02:17.180> i<00:02:17.330> put<00:02:17.480> my<00:02:17.600> pokemon<00:02:17.990> up<00:02:18.110> here<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.500> not

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
reason i put my pokemon up here is not

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.670 
reason i put my pokemon up here is not
only<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.070> protect<00:02:19.220> them<00:02:19.670> or<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.930> protect<00:02:21.500> this

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
only to protect them or to protect this

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.010 
only to protect them or to protect this
Geodude<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.340> they<00:02:22.430> don't<00:02:22.610> attack<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.020> because

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
Geodude so they don't attack it because

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.930 
Geodude so they don't attack it because
i<00:02:24.080> could<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:24.320> take<00:02:24.470> that<00:02:24.620> out<00:02:24.770> anyway<00:02:25.130> them

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
i could just take that out anyway them

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.300 
i could just take that out anyway them
all<00:02:26.090> out<00:02:26.270> anyway<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:27.560> reason<00:02:27.710> I<00:02:27.920> do<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.100> is

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
all out anyway the reason I do that is

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.310 
all out anyway the reason I do that is
because<00:02:28.730> they<00:02:29.120> will<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.390> now<00:02:29.480> take<00:02:29.540> out<00:02:29.900> any<00:02:30.110> of

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
because they will to now take out any of

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.790 
because they will to now take out any of
the<00:02:30.500> Pokemon<00:02:31.400> following<00:02:31.850> this<00:02:31.940> path<00:02:32.800> pause

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
the Pokemon following this path pause

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.310 
the Pokemon following this path pause
there<00:02:34.490> we<00:02:34.610> go<00:02:34.970> okay<00:02:35.240> throw<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.870> back<00:02:36.050> down

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
there we go okay throw it back down

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.100 
there we go okay throw it back down
there<00:02:36.620> it'll<00:02:36.980> bounce<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.400> back<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.900> said

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
there it'll bounce it back and like said

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.020 
there it'll bounce it back and like said
you<00:02:39.290> kind<00:02:39.770> of<00:02:39.860> rinse<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.250> repeat<00:02:40.340> keep<00:02:40.880> on

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
you kind of rinse and repeat keep on

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.030 
you kind of rinse and repeat keep on
going<00:02:41.390> back<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.110> forth<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.680> thing<00:02:42.860> will

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
going back and forth and the thing will

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.970 
going back and forth and the thing will
keep<00:02:43.280> bouncing<00:02:43.640> back<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.000> forth<00:02:44.800> once<00:02:45.800> you

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
keep bouncing back and forth once you

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.980 
keep bouncing back and forth once you
get<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:46.130> weigh<00:02:46.340> 40<00:02:46.850> throw<00:02:47.330> in<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.600> charizard
