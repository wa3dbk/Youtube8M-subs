00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
definitely assume that this product

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.759 
definitely assume that this product
since<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.640> has<00:03:39.790> panthenol<00:03:40.420> in<00:03:40.570> it<00:03:40.720> that's<00:03:41.410> what

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
since it has panthenol in it that's what

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.560 
since it has panthenol in it that's what

creates the slippery consistency that
I'm<00:03:43.720> talking<00:03:44.110> about<00:03:44.170> because<00:03:44.500> panthenol<00:03:45.220> is<00:03:45.430> a

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
I'm talking about because panthenol is a

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.880 
I'm talking about because panthenol is a
an<00:03:46.450> ingredient<00:03:47.050> that's<00:03:47.200> used<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.709> lot<00:03:47.860> of

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
some hold because this actually does

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.430 
some hold because this actually does
give<00:04:04.069> hold<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.760> it<00:04:05.270> defines<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.870> curls<00:04:06.200> very
