00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
wind is an amazing force remember the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.480 
wind is an amazing force remember the
windmills<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:19.859> saw<00:00:20.039> him<00:00:20.130> without<00:00:20.250> going

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
windmills we saw him without going

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.829 
windmills we saw him without going
through<00:00:20.699> Minnesota<00:00:20.910> they<00:00:21.269> were<00:00:21.330> really<00:00:21.630> cool

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
through Minnesota they were really cool

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.349 
through Minnesota they were really cool
well<00:00:22.380> March<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.189> one<00:00:23.339> of<00:00:23.429> the<00:00:23.519> windiest<00:00:23.910> months

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
well March is one of the windiest months

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.909 
well March is one of the windiest months
of<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> year<00:00:24.839> and<00:00:25.019> when<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.500> were<00:00:25.619> thinking

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
of the year and when we were thinking

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.529 
of the year and when we were thinking
about<00:00:26.130> ways<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:26.550> could<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.119> some<00:00:27.300> fun<00:00:27.480> with

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
about ways we could have some fun with

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.569 
about ways we could have some fun with
the<00:00:27.779> wind<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.619> looked<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:28.919> a<00:00:28.949> really<00:00:29.220> simple

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
the wind we looked at a really simple

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.310 
the wind we looked at a really simple
pinwheel<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.089> from<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.449> simple<00:00:30.900> pinwheel

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
pinwheel and from that simple pinwheel

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.720 
pinwheel and from that simple pinwheel
we<00:00:31.499> came<00:00:31.740> up<00:00:31.769> with<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> really<00:00:32.369> creative

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
we came up with a really creative

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.200 
we came up with a really creative
project<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.750> using<00:00:34.200> are<00:00:34.380> really<00:00:34.980> cool<00:00:35.370> color

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
project for using are really cool color

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.730 
project for using are really cool color
explosion<00:00:36.600> designs<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.290> want<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> blow<00:00:37.620> on

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
explosion designs you want to blow on

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.970 
explosion designs you want to blow on
this<00:00:37.830> one<00:00:39.380> we<00:00:40.380> thought<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.710> would<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
this one we thought this would be a

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.530 
this one we thought this would be a
great<00:00:41.160> thing<00:00:41.400> to<00:00:41.460> hang<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:41.850> room<00:00:41.970> you<00:00:42.390> can

great thing to hang in your room you can

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.690 
great thing to hang in your room you can
hold<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.810> to<00:00:43.470> hang<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.740> room<00:00:43.860> or<00:00:44.400> to<00:00:44.520> hang

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
by a window or maybe out on a covered

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.180 
by a window or maybe out on a covered
porch<00:00:46.890> or<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:48.030> tree<00:00:48.500> house<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.680> long<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:49.980> you

bring<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.490> in<00:00:50.580> if<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.000> going<00:00:51.150> to<00:00:51.210> rain

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
bring it in if it's going to rain

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.090 
bring it in if it's going to rain
because<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.140> won't<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:52.470> it<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.740> all<00:00:52.800> wet

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
because you won't want it to get all wet

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
because you won't want it to get all wet

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
we're going to show you how you can make

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.320 
we're going to show you how you can make
a<00:00:55.410> win<00:00:55.650> wheel<00:00:55.830> just<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.400> one<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.820> could

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
a win wheel just like this one you could

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.760 
a win wheel just like this one you could
use<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.660> own<00:00:57.750> ideas<00:00:58.080> if<00:00:58.200> you<00:00:58.290> want<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.650> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
use your own ideas if you want to to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.110 
use your own ideas if you want to to
figure<00:00:59.040> out<00:00:59.160> your<00:00:59.310> own<00:00:59.340> way<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.670> make<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.880> win

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
figure out your own way to make a win

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.490 
figure out your own way to make a win
wheel<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.420> we'll<00:01:00.570> show<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.810> our<00:01:01.080> simple

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
wheel but we'll show you our simple

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.070 
wheel but we'll show you our simple
design<00:01:01.860> it<00:01:02.150> starts<00:01:03.150> with<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.330> piece<00:01:03.630> of<00:01:03.660> color

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
design it starts with a piece of color

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.290 
design it starts with a piece of color
explosion<00:01:04.410> paper<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.610> cut<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.030> color

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
explosion paper and we cut this color

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.210 
explosion paper and we cut this color
explosion<00:01:06.540> paper<00:01:06.990> into<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> perfect<00:01:07.710> square<00:01:07.770> we

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
explosion paper into a perfect square we

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.740 
explosion paper into a perfect square we
used<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.580> ruler<00:01:08.730> to<00:01:08.880> make<00:01:09.120> sure<00:01:09.300> that<00:01:09.480> all<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
used a ruler to make sure that all the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.020 
used a ruler to make sure that all the
sides<00:01:09.990> were<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> same<00:01:10.500> length<00:01:10.800> then<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.850> took

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
sides were the same length then we took

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.600 
sides were the same length then we took
a<00:01:12.090> ruler<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:13.350> drew<00:01:13.560> lines<00:01:13.830> connecting<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
a ruler and we drew lines connecting the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
a ruler and we drew lines connecting the
opposite<00:01:15.030> corners<00:01:15.480> and<00:01:15.690> that<00:01:16.140> helps<00:01:16.530> us<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
opposite corners and that helps us to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.600 
opposite corners and that helps us to
find<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.460> exact<00:01:17.909> center<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.290> square<00:01:19.610> next

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
find the exact center of the square next

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.490 
find the exact center of the square next
we<00:01:20.730> took<00:01:20.909> our<00:01:21.120> Crayola<00:01:21.570> cutter<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.290> cut<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
we took our Crayola cutter and we cut a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.440 
we took our Crayola cutter and we cut a
circle<00:01:22.830> right<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.670> middle<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.270> square

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
circle right in the middle of the square

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
circle right in the middle of the square
I<00:01:24.690> have<00:01:24.900> one<00:01:25.080> that's<00:01:25.230> already<00:01:25.440> done<00:01:25.860> right

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
I have one that's already done right

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.120 
I have one that's already done right
here<00:01:26.870> and<00:01:27.870> this<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.680> looks<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:28.979> at

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
here and this is what it looks like at

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.980 
here and this is what it looks like at
the<00:01:29.250> end<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.760> we<00:01:29.790> love<00:01:30.090> about<00:01:30.120> the<00:01:30.510> cutter<00:01:30.720> is

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the end what we love about the cutter is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.960 
the end what we love about the cutter is
its<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.620> think<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> best<00:01:32.220> way<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.520> cut<00:01:32.729> into

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
its we think the best way to cut into

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.310 
its we think the best way to cut into
the<00:01:33.060> middle<00:01:33.240> because<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.659> safe<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.140> it's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the middle because it's safe and it's

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.480 
the middle because it's safe and it's
really<00:01:34.530> easy<00:01:34.620> and<00:01:35.010> it<00:01:35.070> makes<00:01:35.250> an<00:01:35.340> awesome

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
really easy and it makes an awesome

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.600 
really easy and it makes an awesome
noise<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.690> this<00:01:37.080> is<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> center<00:01:37.590> circle<00:01:37.800> next

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
noise so this is the center circle next

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.330 
noise so this is the center circle next
we<00:01:38.909> cut<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.540> flaps<00:01:39.840> apart<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.950> cut<00:01:41.130> right

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
we cut the flaps apart and we cut right

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.190 
we cut the flaps apart and we cut right
along<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.760> lines<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.840> way<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
along the lines not all the way to the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
along the lines not all the way to the
circle<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.770> pretty<00:01:44.040> close<00:01:44.280> probably<00:01:44.880> about

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
circle but pretty close probably about

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
circle but pretty close probably about
maybe<00:01:45.420> an<00:01:45.750> inch<00:01:46.140> an<00:01:46.560> inch<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> half<00:01:47.190> away<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
maybe an inch an inch and a half away it

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.130 
maybe an inch an inch and a half away it
doesn't<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.120> be<00:01:48.150> exactly<00:01:48.570> precise<00:01:48.960> but

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
doesn't have to be exactly precise but

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.840 
doesn't have to be exactly precise but
pretty<00:01:49.440> close<00:01:49.620> in<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:50.490> how<00:01:50.610> close

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
pretty close in so you can see how close

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.210 
pretty close in so you can see how close
we<00:01:50.909> cut<00:01:51.270> them<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.530> next<00:01:52.740> step<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.100> add

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
we cut them and the next step is to add

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.940 
we cut them and the next step is to add
four<00:01:53.700> more<00:01:53.729> circles<00:01:54.630> when<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.470> used<00:01:55.650> a<00:01:55.799> hole

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
four more circles when we used a hole

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.740 
four more circles when we used a hole
punch<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.400> do<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.670> we've<00:01:56.820> got<00:01:57.000> one<00:01:57.360> here

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
punch to do that we've got one here

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.780 
punch to do that we've got one here
decided<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.500> flaps<00:01:58.799> at<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.190> right<00:01:59.400> side<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
decided this flaps at the right side of

the other ones and the colors just pop
out<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.580> when<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:41.940> put<00:02:42.120> them<00:02:42.270> together<00:02:42.360> to

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
out and when you put them together to

is designing I'll show you how we got
our<00:02:48.660> string<00:02:48.930> ready<00:02:49.110> we<00:02:49.830> just<00:02:50.040> cut<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.220> nice<00:02:50.430> long

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
our string ready we just cut a nice long

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.390 
our string ready we just cut a nice long
piece<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.970> string<00:02:51.560> we<00:02:52.560> tied<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.830> knot<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
piece of string we tied a knot in the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.510 
piece of string we tied a knot in the
end<00:02:53.600> we<00:02:54.600> strung<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.050> bead<00:02:55.320> on<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.530> any<00:02:56.100> kind<00:02:56.430> of

end we strung a bead on it any kind of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.220 
end we strung a bead on it any kind of
bead<00:02:56.700> will<00:02:56.880> work<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.390> as<00:02:57.540> long<00:02:57.750> as<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.020> bead

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
bead will work just as long as the bead

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.020 
bead will work just as long as the bead
is<00:02:58.440> larger<00:02:58.920> than<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.070> hole<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.700> center<00:03:00.000> of

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
is larger than the hole in the center of

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.470 
is larger than the hole in the center of
your<00:03:00.270> paper<00:03:01.850> how<00:03:02.850> about<00:03:02.970> if<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:03.120> show<00:03:03.270> them<00:03:03.390> how

to put it all together right now that
was<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> really<00:03:05.100> amazing<00:03:05.640> designs<00:03:06.300> can<00:03:06.420> look

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
was a really amazing designs can look

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.810 
was a really amazing designs can look
great<00:03:06.660> on<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.020> win<00:03:07.230> wheel<00:03:07.460> when<00:03:08.460> it's<00:03:08.580> time<00:03:08.790> to

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
great on a win wheel when it's time to

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.950 
great on a win wheel when it's time to
string<00:03:09.240> it<00:03:09.300> when<00:03:09.420> you're<00:03:09.540> all<00:03:09.630> done<00:03:09.780> with<00:03:09.840> your

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
string it when you're all done with your

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.110 
string it when you're all done with your
design<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.710> start<00:03:11.040> by<00:03:11.250> stringing<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.820> string

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
design you start by stringing the string

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.820 
design you start by stringing the string
through<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.480> middle<00:03:12.870> of<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.230> bottom<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.770> your

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
through the middle of the bottom of your

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.040 
through the middle of the bottom of your
design<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.390> bead<00:03:15.570> holds<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.020> place

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
design so that the bead holds in place

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.370 
design so that the bead holds in place
and<00:03:16.620> then<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.490> put<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.940> cord<00:03:18.270> through<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
and then you put the cord through the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.160 
and then you put the cord through the
white<00:03:19.820> side<00:03:20.820> through<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.660> hole<00:03:21.810> on<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.990> white

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
white side through the hole on the white

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.190 
white side through the hole on the white
side<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.709> each<00:03:23.130> flap<00:03:23.580> when<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.630> pull<00:03:24.840> them<00:03:24.990> all

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
side of each flap when you pull them all

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.070 
side of each flap when you pull them all
the<00:03:25.530> way<00:03:25.620> through<00:03:25.920> together<00:03:26.300> they'll<00:03:27.300> form<00:03:27.780> a

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
the way through together they'll form a

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.400 
the way through together they'll form a
pinwheel<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:29.280> like<00:03:29.430> this<00:03:29.640> one<00:03:29.880> cool<00:03:30.810> isn't

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
pinwheel just like this one cool isn't

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.080 
pinwheel just like this one cool isn't
it<00:03:31.470> cool<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.890> then<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.370> way<00:03:32.490> that<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.760> anchor

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
it cool and then the way that you anchor

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.730 
it cool and then the way that you anchor
it<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:33.450> tie<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> knot<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.410> string

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
it is you just tie a knot and string

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.930 
it is you just tie a knot and string
another<00:03:34.980> bead<00:03:35.220> on<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.400> why<00:03:35.580> don't<00:03:35.640> we<00:03:35.760> show

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
another bead on it why don't we show

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.010 
another bead on it why don't we show
them<00:03:36.090> with<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.330> one<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.600> we<00:03:36.690> finished

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
them with the one that we finished

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.630 
them with the one that we finished
already<00:03:38.959> all<00:03:39.959> we<00:03:40.140> did<00:03:40.290> was<00:03:40.350> tie<00:03:40.740> knots<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.250> put

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
already all we did was tie knots and put

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.300 
already all we did was tie knots and put
beads<00:03:42.000> at<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.630> top<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:42.990> bottom<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.500> each<00:03:43.860> we

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
beads at the top and bottom of each we

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.100 
beads at the top and bottom of each we
all<00:03:44.459> so<00:03:45.000> they<00:03:45.120> could<00:03:45.240> spin<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.750> then<00:03:46.020> you

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
all so they could spin and then you

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.570 
all so they could spin and then you
might<00:03:46.290> notice<00:03:46.500> we<00:03:46.740> took<00:03:46.860> an<00:03:47.010> extra<00:03:47.250> strip

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
might notice we took an extra strip

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.150 
might notice we took an extra strip
right<00:03:47.790> here<00:03:47.820> we<00:03:48.570> designed<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.440> we<00:03:49.860> punched

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
right here we designed it and we punched

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.350 
right here we designed it and we punched
some<00:03:50.280> holes<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:50.910> kind<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.150> stuck

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
some holes in it and just kind of stuck

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.420 
some holes in it and just kind of stuck
it<00:03:51.510> on<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.750> for<00:03:51.900> something<00:03:52.200> fun<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.680> spins<00:03:53.130> to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
it on it for something fun it spins to

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.770 
it on it for something fun it spins to
in<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.850> just<00:03:53.910> looks<00:03:54.209> kind<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.450> cool<00:03:54.630> in
