00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
has to it has to come it was like an

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.660 
has to it has to come it was like an
actual<00:00:38.990> like<00:00:39.290> it<00:00:39.380> was<00:00:39.470> proof<00:00:39.710> or<00:00:39.920> evidence<00:00:40.190> at

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
actual like it was proof or evidence at

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.660 
actual like it was proof or evidence at
least<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:42.350> I<00:00:42.470> think<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:42.950> was<00:00:43.070> something<00:00:43.310> in

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
and we're finally getting them the only

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.410 
and we're finally getting them the only
thing<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.250> say<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.270> hell

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420

we're getting like 4,000 classes all at

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.760 
we're getting like 4,000 classes all at
once<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.300> it's<00:02:36.630> kind<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.930> like<00:02:37.110> overwhelming

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
once and it's kind of like overwhelming

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.100 
once and it's kind of like overwhelming
at<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.250> same<00:02:38.430> time<00:02:38.640> as<00:02:38.700> being<00:02:39.600> awesome

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
at the same time as being awesome

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.560 
at the same time as being awesome
because<00:02:40.500> who<00:02:41.310> doesn't<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.610> in<00:02:41.760> new<00:02:42.120> classes
