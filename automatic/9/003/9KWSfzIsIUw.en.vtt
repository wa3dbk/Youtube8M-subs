00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.230
 first is the title that says one day 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.820
 exciting if you do not want 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.800
 writing what would happen would not matter 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.470
 how do you want to translate it if it is 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.109
 written with photos with something with a tag 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.120

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.280
 requirements that was washi times the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.440
 third requirements is to use pennants 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.900

 once the fourth requirement is to use flower 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.960
 and the fifth requirement is to use something 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.240
 of wood 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.060
 and then here as you see I used both the 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.860
 flower in little wood as the decoration of 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.900
