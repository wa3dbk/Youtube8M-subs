00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:07.099
 On August 30, 2009, we visited the 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.040
 jesus-marÃ­a river the river with a grass 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.280
 400 meters from the bridge on the route of the 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.980
 Mr. number 9 already showed a change 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.560
 of travel product of a 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.620
 indiscriminate extraction of aggregates like 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.960
 we observed the depth was just of 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.210
 one and a half meters to two meters in some 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.340
 sectors but the margins had 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.270
 changed course because of this 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.270
 daily extraction 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.770
 after the bridge fell on 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.870
 route 9 we went back to the place and we observed 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.800
 like all defenses placed by 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.350
 the neighbors of the level were just 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.330
 extracted and had been demolished by 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.920
 the waters 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.870
 remember in 2009 was denounced the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.210
 lack of control over the extraction of 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.270
 arid the lack of maintenance of the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.239
 River defenses in the area at 400 meters 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.780
 passing the bridge that collapsed on Sunday 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.660
 January 31, 2010, the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.000
 lack of defenses this is another sector 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.540
 of the river that I would add we are also in 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.180
 the coast 400 meters from the bridge over 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.240
 the national route not us 9 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:25.130
 Here we came to see how the water in 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.820
 last floods has eaten the river it 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.830
 has eaten the margins all the land and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.920
 has undermined in a way that today has 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.660
 a depth of approximately 8 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.610
 meters in 2014 a new growing 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.850
 causes new diversions of the river and 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.720
 waters eat the land hectares and 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.020
 hectares of land are flooded and 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.560
 the waters practically stick with the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.649
 margins of the homes located in the 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.810
 same sector where in 2009 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.810
 denounced this illegal action daily
