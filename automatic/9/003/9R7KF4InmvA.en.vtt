00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960 

so<00:00:00.299> I'm<00:00:01.079> see<00:00:01.350> now<00:00:01.469> you<00:00:01.530> never<00:00:01.709> be<00:00:01.979> too<00:00:02.190> so<00:00:02.879> when

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
so I'm see now you never be too so when

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.120 
so I'm see now you never be too so when
we<00:00:03.149> do<00:00:03.300> this<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.750> take<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.500> big<00:00:04.770> bulky<00:00:05.130> base

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.150 

yeah<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.639> would<00:00:11.730> be<00:00:11.849> very<00:00:11.969> good<00:00:12.150> practice

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
yeah that would be very good practice

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.049 
yeah that would be very good practice
one<00:00:14.160> thing<00:00:14.280> that's<00:00:14.340> very<00:00:14.429> helpful<00:00:14.759> is<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
one thing that's very helpful is to

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.859 
one thing that's very helpful is to
label<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.509> alpha<00:00:15.809> carbon<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:17.570> then<00:00:18.570> one

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
label the alpha carbon and then one

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.330 
label the alpha carbon and then one
thing<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.140> we've<00:00:19.230> seen<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.590> very<00:00:19.830> helpful

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
thing that we've seen is very helpful

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.330 
thing that we've seen is very helpful
for<00:00:20.520> e2<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.570> also<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.080> label<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> beta<00:00:22.890> carbon

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
for e2 is also to label the beta carbon

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.670 
for e2 is also to label the beta carbon
we<00:00:24.269> should<00:00:24.449> ought<00:00:24.689> for<00:00:24.960> elimination<00:00:25.560> we

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
we should ought for elimination we

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.109 
we should ought for elimination we
should<00:00:25.800> always<00:00:25.949> label<00:00:26.340> both<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> Alpha<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
should always label both the Alpha and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.240 
should always label both the Alpha and
the<00:00:27.180> beta<00:00:27.240> carbon<00:00:27.840> remember<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> alpha

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the beta carbon remember the alpha

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.529 
the beta carbon remember the alpha
carbon<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> leaving<00:00:30.510> group

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
carbon is the one with the leaving group

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.709 
carbon is the one with the leaving group
and<00:00:31.199> then<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.740> beta<00:00:31.949> carbon<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.430> adjacent<00:00:32.719> now

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and then the beta carbon is adjacent now

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.150 
and then the beta carbon is adjacent now
this<00:00:33.899> molecule<00:00:34.110> actually<00:00:34.620> has<00:00:34.739> two<00:00:34.950> beta

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
this molecule actually has two beta

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.650 
this molecule actually has two beta
carbons<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.820> they're<00:00:35.969> symmetric<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
carbons but they're symmetric and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.880 
carbons but they're symmetric and
equivalents<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.500> pick<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> one

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
equivalents we can just pick the one

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.520 
equivalents we can just pick the one
that's<00:00:37.920> convenient<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:39.090> right<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:39.420> who<00:00:40.410> does

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
that's convenient all right now who does

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.260 
that's convenient all right now who does
it<00:00:40.559> make<00:00:40.800> sense<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.370> put<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> tail<00:00:42.030> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it make sense here to put at the tail of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.060 
it make sense here to put at the tail of
an<00:00:42.390> error<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.870> these<00:00:43.140> reagents<00:00:43.379> who<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:43.950> we

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
an error and these reagents who do we

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.200 
an error and these reagents who do we
really<00:00:44.370> know<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> be<00:00:44.910> at<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> tail

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
really know is going to be at the tail

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
really know is going to be at the tail
of<00:00:45.239> narrow<00:00:47.420> yeah<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> think<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> head<00:00:49.230> good

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
of narrow yeah I think if the head good

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
of narrow yeah I think if the head good
now<00:00:50.930> there's<00:00:51.930> something<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.320> should<00:00:52.350> really

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
now there's something you should really

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.810 
now there's something you should really
check<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.340> who's<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> most

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
check out at you here who's the most

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.779 
check out at you here who's the most
reactive<00:00:54.030> Adam<00:00:54.890> among<00:00:55.890> these<00:00:56.070> reagents<00:00:56.340> whose

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
reactive Adam among these reagents whose

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.930 
reactive Adam among these reagents whose
are<00:00:56.940> reactive<00:00:57.420> Adam<00:00:58.219> yeah<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.550> let's<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.789> more

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
are reactive Adam yeah but let's be more

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.150 
are reactive Adam yeah but let's be more
specific<00:01:00.000> which<00:01:00.539> ad<00:01:00.750> announcer<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.649> oxygen

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
specific which ad announcer the oxygen

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.740 
specific which ad announcer the oxygen
and<00:01:02.550> wouldn't<00:01:02.760> want<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.030> at<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.180> hen<00:01:03.359> retail

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and wouldn't want to be at a hen retail

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.560 
and wouldn't want to be at a hen retail
because<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.920> wants<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> donate<00:01:05.460> electrons<00:01:06.150> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
because I wants to donate electrons so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.940 
because I wants to donate electrons so
the<00:01:06.659> very<00:01:06.900> first<00:01:07.020> thing<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.500> should<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.770> here

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the very first thing we should do here

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.710 
the very first thing we should do here
with<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> mechanism<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:09.360> we've<00:01:09.510> talked

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
with the mechanism I think we've talked

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330 
with the mechanism I think we've talked
about<00:01:09.840> even<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.380> don't<00:01:10.560> know<00:01:10.740> where<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
about even if you don't know where to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.370 
about even if you don't know where to
put<00:01:11.460> both<00:01:11.729> halves<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.420> narrow<00:01:12.630> put<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> half

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
put both halves of a narrow put the half

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.810 
put both halves of a narrow put the half
that<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:13.950> well<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.430> know<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.700> is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that you do know well we know this is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.940 
that you do know well we know this is
going<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> detail<00:01:15.530> okay<00:01:18.799> let's<00:01:19.799> work

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
going to be a detail okay let's work

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
going to be a detail okay let's work
through<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.220> step<00:01:20.430> by<00:01:20.610> step<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:21.509> remember

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
through that step by step now remember

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.359 
through that step by step now remember
this<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.409> an<00:01:22.500> elimination<00:01:22.710> right

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
this is going to be an elimination right

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.179 
this is going to be an elimination right
now<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.869> act<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.170> either<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.590> nucleophile

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
now this can act as either a nucleophile

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.399 
now this can act as either a nucleophile
or<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> base<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.290> act

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
or as a base but what is it going to act

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.920 
or as a base but what is it going to act
like<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:29.009> elimination<00:01:29.329> nucleophile<00:01:30.329> base

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
like in an elimination nucleophile base

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.140 
like in an elimination nucleophile base
what<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.560> basis<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.130> what's<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
what do basis do what's the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.149 
what do basis do what's the
bronsted-lowry<00:01:33.810> definition<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> base

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.249 

first<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:40.969> said<00:01:41.179> that's<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.600> bronsted-lowry

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
first I said that's the bronsted-lowry

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.590 
first I said that's the bronsted-lowry
definition<00:01:42.439> of<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.009> base<00:01:43.219> they<00:01:43.759> take<00:01:44.090> protons

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
definition of a base they take protons

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.179 
definition of a base they take protons
so<00:01:46.630> we<00:01:47.630> know<00:01:47.749> that<00:01:47.780> we're<00:01:48.020> not<00:01:48.100> going<00:01:49.100> to

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
so we know that we're not going to

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:50.740 
so we know that we're not going to
simply<00:01:49.520> attack<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.939> alpha<00:01:50.179> carbon<00:01:50.329> because

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
simply attack the alpha carbon because

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.209 
simply attack the alpha carbon because
that<00:01:50.899> wouldn't<00:01:51.109> take<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.289> proton<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:52.069> would

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
that wouldn't take a proton that would

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.620 
that wouldn't take a proton that would
be<00:01:52.340> what<00:01:52.520> this<00:01:52.640> would<00:01:52.789> do<00:01:52.909> if<00:01:53.090> was<00:01:53.240> acting<00:01:53.539> like

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
be what this would do if was acting like

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.300 
be what this would do if was acting like
a<00:01:53.780> nucleophile<00:01:54.289> if<00:01:54.709> it<00:01:54.829> were<00:01:54.920> acting<00:01:55.189> like<00:01:55.280> a

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
a nucleophile if it were acting like a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.219 
a nucleophile if it were acting like a
nucleophile<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.149> nucleophile<00:01:56.780> will<00:01:56.990> try<00:01:57.170> to

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
nucleophile and nucleophile will try to

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.949 
nucleophile and nucleophile will try to
join<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.679> Alpha<00:01:57.950> curtain<00:01:58.219> but<00:01:59.119> we<00:01:59.840> expect

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
join the Alpha curtain but we expect

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:01.719 
join the Alpha curtain but we expect
this<00:02:00.349> because<00:02:00.679> this<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.069> bulky<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.549> be<00:02:01.640> an

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
this because this is so bulky to be an

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.330 
this because this is so bulky to be an
e2<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:03.170> where's<00:02:03.439> it<00:02:03.590> going<00:02:03.709> to<00:02:03.740> get<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.950> proton

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
e2 so where's it going to get the proton

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.099 
e2 so where's it going to get the proton
from<00:02:04.549> well<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.090> lot<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:05.299> people<00:02:05.390> would<00:02:05.659> think<00:02:05.810> it

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
from well a lot of people would think it

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.699 
from well a lot of people would think it
would<00:02:06.200> take<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:07.239> think<00:02:08.239> should<00:02:09.170> be<00:02:09.289> on<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.560> via

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
would take I think should be on the via

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.070 
would take I think should be on the via
cargo<00:02:10.039> there's<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.459> hydrogen<00:02:10.970> yeah<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:11.900> gonna

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
cargo there's a hydrogen yeah it's gonna

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.530 
cargo there's a hydrogen yeah it's gonna
take<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.099> hydrogen<00:02:13.579> that<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:14.030> was<00:02:14.360> going<00:02:14.480> to

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
take that hydrogen that I was going to

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.890 
take that hydrogen that I was going to
give<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.810> out<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.560> double<00:02:15.739> bond<00:02:16.069> and<00:02:16.900> then

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
give it out of the double bond and then

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.670 
give it out of the double bond and then
the<00:02:18.620> VR<00:02:19.390> all<00:02:20.390> right<00:02:20.569> I<00:02:20.599> think<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:20.930> got<00:02:21.049> it<00:02:21.110> okay

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
the VR all right I think you got it okay

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:38.550 
the VR all right I think you got it okay
good<00:02:21.950> let's<00:02:22.099> try

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.170 

that<00:02:39.190> looks<00:02:39.370> good<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.640> me<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:40.000> need<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.780> draw<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
that looks good to me I need to draw the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.900 
that looks good to me I need to draw the
product<00:02:43.480> they<00:02:43.690> look<00:02:43.810> like<00:02:43.959> from<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.910> or

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
product they look like from that or

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.370 
product they look like from that or
innocence<00:02:46.239> don't<00:02:46.540> need<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.750> draw<00:02:46.959> it<00:02:47.080> because

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
innocence don't need to draw it because

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.370 
innocence don't need to draw it because
this<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:48.010> what<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.220> would<00:02:48.250> look<00:02:48.340> like<00:02:52.319> as<00:02:53.319> a

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
this is what it would look like as a

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.229 
this is what it would look like as a
thought<00:02:53.680> process<00:02:53.890> at<00:02:54.250> myself<00:02:56.370> okay<00:02:57.370> all<00:02:58.000> right

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
thought process at myself okay all right

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.630 
thought process at myself okay all right
so<00:02:58.480> clearly<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.080> oxygen<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.620> at<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.830> tail<00:03:00.040> now

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
so clearly the oxygen is at the tail now

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.699 
so clearly the oxygen is at the tail now
because<00:03:01.390> this<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.569> bulky<00:03:02.080> it's<00:03:02.349> going<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.560> act

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
because this is bulky it's going to act

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.589 
because this is bulky it's going to act
like<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.860> base<00:03:03.130> not<00:03:03.550> like<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.730> nucleophile<00:03:04.300> so

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
like a base not like a nucleophile so

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.970 
like a base not like a nucleophile so
it's<00:03:04.720> going<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.900> steal<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.140> proton<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.860> we

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
it's going to steal a proton and we

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.680 
it's going to steal a proton and we
should<00:03:06.130> simply<00:03:06.430> have<00:03:06.580> memorized<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.360> in

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
should simply have memorized that in

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.050 
should simply have memorized that in
illumination<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.860> don't<00:03:09.160> steal<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.700> Alpha

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
illumination you don't steal the Alpha

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.309 
illumination you don't steal the Alpha
proton<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.780> steal<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.230> beta<00:03:11.470> proton<00:03:13.319> all

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
proton you steal the beta proton all

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.380 
proton you steal the beta proton all
right<00:03:14.470> that's<00:03:14.709> gonna<00:03:14.860> free<00:03:15.190> up<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.880> electrons

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
right that's gonna free up the electrons

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.380 
right that's gonna free up the electrons
that<00:03:17.080> are<00:03:17.140> in<00:03:17.410> this<00:03:17.530> bond<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.910> they<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.180> form

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
that are in this bond so they can form

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.640 
that are in this bond so they can form
the<00:03:19.510> pipeline<00:03:19.870> that's<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.230> whole<00:03:20.260> point<00:03:20.500> of

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
the pipeline that's the whole point of

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.229 
the pipeline that's the whole point of
elimination<00:03:21.190> those<00:03:21.610> are<00:03:21.670> going<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:21.940> be<00:03:22.030> these

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
elimination those are going to be these

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.839 
elimination those are going to be these
electrons<00:03:22.780> over<00:03:23.049> here<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:24.310> forces<00:03:24.730> the

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
electrons over here and that forces the

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.850 
electrons over here and that forces the
leaving<00:03:25.120> group<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.900> lead<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:26.769> the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
leaving group to lead and so that the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.300 
leaving group to lead and so that the
products<00:03:27.310> would<00:03:27.459> be<00:03:28.440> BR<00:03:29.440> minus<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:30.130> we're

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
products would be BR minus and we're

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.270 
products would be BR minus and we're
going<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.489> be<00:03:30.610> complete<00:03:34.620> we<00:03:35.620> could<00:03:35.769> also<00:03:35.920> draw

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
going to be complete we could also draw

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.130 
going to be complete we could also draw
that<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.819> trigger<00:03:37.060> lock<00:03:37.360> side<00:03:37.569> now<00:03:37.810> has<00:03:38.019> this

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
that the trigger lock side now has this

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.539 
that the trigger lock side now has this
new<00:03:38.349> hydrogen<00:03:38.620> on<00:03:38.860> it<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.220> now<00:03:39.340> it's

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
new hydrogen on it so now it's

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.759 
new hydrogen on it so now it's
tert-butyl<00:03:40.980> alcohol<00:03:42.000> okay<00:03:43.230> yes<00:03:44.230> that's<00:03:44.500> still

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
tert-butyl alcohol okay yes that's still

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.259 
tert-butyl alcohol okay yes that's still
a<00:03:44.829> very<00:03:44.980> important<00:03:45.400> reaction<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:45.910> know<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
a very important reaction to know the

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.300 
a very important reaction to know the
mechanism<00:03:46.590> for<00:03:47.590> there<00:03:47.799> so<00:03:47.950> it's<00:03:48.070> a<00:03:48.100> good<00:03:48.190> that

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
mechanism for there so it's a good that

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.090 
mechanism for there so it's a good that
we<00:03:48.370> had<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.549> chance<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:49.269> review<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.980> can

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
we had a chance to review that you can

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.530 
we had a chance to review that you can
see<00:03:51.280> why<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.459> have<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:51.700> take<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:51.940> hydrogen

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
see why you have to take the hydrogen

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.970 
see why you have to take the hydrogen
for<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.750> beta<00:03:52.930> carbon<00:03:53.380> because<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.829> whole

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
for the beta carbon because the whole

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.490 
for the beta carbon because the whole
point<00:03:54.010> here<00:03:54.280> is<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:54.640> make<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.239> PI<00:03:55.630> bond<00:03:55.870> between

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
point here is to make a PI bond between

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.920 
point here is to make a PI bond between
the<00:03:56.739> Alpha<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.400> beta<00:03:57.489> carbon<00:03:58.030> so<00:03:58.569> we<00:03:58.780> need

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
the Alpha and the beta carbon so we need

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.530 
the Alpha and the beta carbon so we need
to<00:03:59.049> involve<00:03:59.590> both<00:03:59.829> of<00:03:59.980> those<00:04:00.130> okay<00:04:00.760> now<00:04:01.480> of

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
mechanisms however you should still

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.370 
mechanisms however you should still
probably<00:04:06.940> show<00:04:07.329> the<00:04:07.480> mechanisms<00:04:07.989> just<00:04:08.230> as<00:04:08.350> a

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
probably show the mechanisms just as a

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.599 
probably show the mechanisms just as a
thought<00:04:08.440> process<00:04:08.829> because<00:04:09.370> if<00:04:09.459> you're<00:04:09.579> not

thought process because if you're not

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:10.890 
thought process because if you're not
showing<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.910> mechanism<00:04:10.420> you<00:04:10.510> won't<00:04:10.660> be<00:04:10.750> sure

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
showing the mechanism you won't be sure

whether<00:04:11.139> you're<00:04:11.260> really<00:04:11.440> going<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.620> get<00:04:11.739> the

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
whether you're really going to get the

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:12.780 
whether you're really going to get the
product<00:04:12.190> that<00:04:12.220> you<00:04:12.310> think<00:04:12.519> you're<00:04:12.609> going<00:04:12.760> to

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.190 
product that you think you're going to
get<00:04:12.940> so<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.180> really<00:04:13.359> was<00:04:13.540> important<00:04:13.989> for<00:04:14.019> us<00:04:14.109> to

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
get so it really was important for us to

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.319 
get so it really was important for us to
go<00:04:14.380> over<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.709> mechanism<00:04:15.040> over<00:04:15.459> here<00:04:15.700> even

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
go over that mechanism over here even

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.180 
go over that mechanism over here even
though<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.630> answer<00:04:16.959> just<00:04:17.470> involves<00:04:17.859> listing

though the answer just involves listing

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
a drive of this mechanism so you can

a drive of this mechanism so you can
review<00:04:58.980> that<00:04:59.040> there<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.700> then<00:04:59.850> that<00:04:59.940> would

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
review that there and then that would

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.660 
review that there and then that would

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
give us this product over a year and so

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.210

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.400 
first come and help well good way to get
an<00:05:30.390> alkene<00:05:30.720> distributor<00:05:31.350> website<00:05:33.080> ok<00:05:34.080> so

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
an alkene distributor website ok so

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.140 
an alkene distributor website ok so
again<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.710> thought<00:05:34.860> processes<00:05:35.370> we<00:05:35.850> looked<00:05:36.060> at

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
again the thought processes we looked at

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.760 
again the thought processes we looked at
the<00:05:36.240> final<00:05:36.570> product<00:05:36.930> we<00:05:37.140> saw<00:05:37.350> had<00:05:37.590> no

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
the final product we saw had no

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.560 
the final product we saw had no
functional<00:05:38.190> groups<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:38.730> we<00:05:38.760> guessed<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.360> last

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
functional groups so we guessed the last

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.750 
functional groups so we guessed the last
night<00:05:39.780> was<00:05:39.900> hydrogenation<00:05:40.500> but<00:05:41.280> then<00:05:41.400> we<00:05:41.550> said

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
night was hydrogenation but then we said

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.090 
night was hydrogenation but then we said
gee<00:05:42.000> doesn't<00:05:42.420> work<00:05:42.570> without<00:05:42.780> a<00:05:43.320> double<00:05:43.919> bond

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
gee doesn't work without a double bond

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.680 
gee doesn't work without a double bond
and<00:05:44.430> then<00:05:44.669> we<00:05:44.760> decided<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.240> put<00:05:45.360> in<00:05:45.390> a<00:05:45.510> strong

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
and then we decided to put in a strong

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.300 
and then we decided to put in a strong
bulky<00:05:46.140> base<00:05:46.350> that's<00:05:46.950> a<00:05:47.040> kind<00:05:47.220> of

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
bulky base that's a kind of

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.600 
bulky base that's a kind of
retrosynthesis<00:05:48.169> approach<00:05:49.169> over<00:05:50.040> here<00:05:50.280> you

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
retrosynthesis approach over here you

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.010 
retrosynthesis approach over here you
can't<00:05:50.850> just<00:05:50.910> hydrogenate<00:05:51.630> this<00:05:51.780> at<00:05:51.930> the

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
can't just hydrogenate this at the

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.340 
can't just hydrogenate this at the
beginning<00:05:52.110> because<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:52.620> has<00:05:52.740> no<00:05:52.890> double<00:05:53.190> bond

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
beginning because it has no double bond

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.480 
beginning because it has no double bond
you<00:05:55.350> might<00:05:55.500> have<00:05:55.650> learned<00:05:55.800> one<00:05:56.130> or<00:05:56.220> two<00:05:56.310> other

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
you might have learned one or two other

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.470 
you might have learned one or two other
ways<00:05:56.730> that<00:05:56.760> you<00:05:56.970> could<00:05:57.090> have<00:05:57.210> done<00:05:57.300> the<00:05:57.450> same

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
ways that you could have done the same

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.480 
ways that you could have done the same
synthesis<00:05:58.169> that<00:05:58.410> won't<00:05:58.950> go<00:05:59.070> through<00:05:59.310> right

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
synthesis that won't go through right

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.790 
synthesis that won't go through right
now<00:05:59.520> I<00:06:00.000> think<00:06:00.750> lithium<00:06:01.440> aluminum<00:06:01.770> hydride

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
now I think lithium aluminum hydride

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.320 
now I think lithium aluminum hydride
would<00:06:02.280> do<00:06:02.400> it<00:06:02.490> too<00:06:02.669> but<00:06:02.820> I<00:06:02.880> don't<00:06:03.000> know<00:06:03.150> if<00:06:03.240> you

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
would do it too but I don't know if you

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.790 
would do it too but I don't know if you
guys

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
guys

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.890 
guys
to<00:06:03.889> cover<00:06:04.069> that<00:06:04.370> after<00:06:04.879> this<00:06:05.000> course<00:06:05.270> there's

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
to cover that after this course there's

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.029 
to cover that after this course there's
a<00:06:05.990> couple<00:06:06.110> of<00:06:06.289> the<00:06:06.379> ways<00:06:06.500> you<00:06:06.650> could<00:06:06.800> do<00:06:06.889> this

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
a couple of the ways you could do this

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:08.980 
a couple of the ways you could do this
but<00:06:07.729> this<00:06:07.879> is<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.120> interesting<00:06:08.360> way<00:06:08.690> for

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
but this is the interesting way for

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.719 
but this is the interesting way for
addition<00:06:09.560> reactions<00:06:10.009> all<00:06:10.280> right<00:06:10.400> so<00:06:10.520> this<00:06:10.580> is

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
addition reactions all right so this is

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.840 
addition reactions all right so this is
a<00:06:10.789> good<00:06:10.909> reaction<00:06:11.090> to<00:06:11.479> know<00:06:11.599> here
