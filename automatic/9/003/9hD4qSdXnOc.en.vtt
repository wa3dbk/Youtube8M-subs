00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.150 
be a 2003 model and what we're doing
today<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:18.420> are<00:00:18.630> removing<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.529> throttle

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
today is we are removing the throttle

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.060 
today is we are removing the throttle
position<00:00:20.660> sensor<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:22.350> know<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.680> one<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
position sensor you know the one the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.089 
position sensor you know the one the
fly-by-wire<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.930> accelerator<00:00:25.500> pedal<00:00:25.710> you

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
fly-by-wire on the accelerator pedal you

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.710 
fly-by-wire on the accelerator pedal you
know<00:00:26.279> them<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.490> love<00:00:26.759> them<00:00:26.939> unless<00:00:27.360> you<00:00:27.419> have

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
know them you love them unless you have

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.409 
know them you love them unless you have
a<00:00:27.750> Toyota<00:00:28.290> Camry<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.880> we're<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.150> get<00:00:30.300> in

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
a Toyota Camry so we're going to get in

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.000 
a Toyota Camry so we're going to get in
there<00:00:30.570> remove<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.110> today<00:00:33.710> here<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
there remove that today here is the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130 
there remove that today here is the
throttle<00:00:35.430> position<00:00:35.700> assembly<00:00:36.600> underneath

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
throttle position assembly underneath

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.170 
throttle position assembly underneath
here<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.370> first<00:00:38.610> thing<00:00:38.790> we're<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.060> to

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
here so the first thing we're going to

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
here so the first thing we're going to
do<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.810> to<00:00:40.050> remove<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.530> negative<00:00:41.100> battery

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
do is to remove the negative battery

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:51.680 
do is to remove the negative battery
cable<00:00:41.489> from<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> battery<00:00:48.829> now<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.690> assembly

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
cable from the battery now the assembly

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.689 
cable from the battery now the assembly
is<00:00:52.050> held<00:00:52.109> on<00:00:52.680> by<00:00:53.000> three<00:00:54.109> ten<00:00:55.280> millimeter<00:00:56.280> bolts

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
is held on by three ten millimeter bolts

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.840 
is held on by three ten millimeter bolts
now<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.629> can't<00:00:58.160> take<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.280> all<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.519> way<00:00:59.670> out

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
now we can't take them all the way out

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.290 
now we can't take them all the way out
so<00:01:00.149> we're<00:01:00.300> going<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:01.429> unscrew<00:01:02.429> them<00:01:04.880> far<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.120> we

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
so we're going to unscrew them far as we

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:19.999 
so we're going to unscrew them far as we
can<00:01:11.750> like<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:17.329> but<00:01:18.380> see<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> can't<00:01:19.710> take<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
can like that but see you can't take the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.219 
can like that but see you can't take the
bolts<00:01:20.280> out<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.530> wiggle<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:24.229> from

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
bolts out but if you wiggle the it from

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.899 
bolts out but if you wiggle the it from
side<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> side<00:01:25.829> a<00:01:25.860> little<00:01:26.009> bit<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.700> see

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
side to side a little bit you can see

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.149 
side to side a little bit you can see
that<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:28.369> remove<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.579> assembly<00:01:31.070> see<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
that you can remove the assembly see the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.749 
that you can remove the assembly see the
bolts<00:01:32.490> can't<00:01:33.090> come<00:01:33.329> all<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.630> way<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:34.579> but<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
bolts can't come all the way out but you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.380 
bolts can't come all the way out but you
just<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.360> unscrew<00:01:37.200> them

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
just I unscrew them

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
just I unscrew them
so<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.140> were<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.830> mount<00:01:41.280> right<00:01:41.580> here

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
so they were out of the mount right here

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.210 
so they were out of the mount right here
and<00:01:43.410> then<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.000> get<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.840> assembly<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and then you can get the assembly to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.460 
and then you can get the assembly to
this<00:01:47.370> point<00:01:47.670> right<00:01:47.940> here<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:50.600> make<00:01:51.600> sure<00:01:51.630> when

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
this point right here so make sure when

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.890 
this point right here so make sure when
you<00:01:52.970> put<00:01:53.970> your<00:01:54.120> other<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.510> in<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.750> make<00:01:54.870> sure

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
you put your other one in and make sure

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.710 
you put your other one in and make sure
the<00:01:55.170> bolts<00:01:55.380> are<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.770> place<00:01:55.830> like<00:01:56.580> you<00:01:57.330> just<00:01:57.570> saw

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
the bolts are in place like you just saw

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.100 
the bolts are in place like you just saw
we<00:01:57.930> remove<00:01:58.440> that

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.630 

all<00:02:03.110> right<00:02:03.260> let's<00:02:03.470> get<00:02:03.620> a<00:02:03.650> close-up<00:02:04.040> look<00:02:04.520> at

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
all right let's get a close-up look at

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.750 
all right let's get a close-up look at
that<00:02:04.850> connector<00:02:05.390> we'll<00:02:05.720> take<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.140> off<00:02:06.320> next

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
that connector we'll take that off next

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.260 
that connector we'll take that off next
now<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.820> remove<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.479> electrical<00:02:08.960> connector

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
now to remove the electrical connector

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.460 
now to remove the electrical connector
first<00:02:11.270> thing<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.480> need<00:02:11.630> to<00:02:11.780> do<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.170> remove

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
first thing you need to do is to remove

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.870 
first thing you need to do is to remove
this<00:02:12.680> gray<00:02:13.130> lock<00:02:13.520> here<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.650> we<00:02:15.860> need<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.250> pry

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
this gray lock here so we need to pry

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:27.580 
this gray lock here so we need to pry
that<00:02:16.910> up

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.580 

there<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.370> is

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.610 

once<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:34.489> get<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.849> out<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:35.270> way<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:36.230> we<00:02:36.410> have

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
once we get that out of way and we have

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.790 
once we get that out of way and we have
the<00:02:36.800> conventional<00:02:37.810> locking<00:02:38.810> mechanism<00:02:39.410> where

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
the conventional locking mechanism where

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.640 
the conventional locking mechanism where
you'll<00:02:40.040> push<00:02:40.520> in<00:02:40.790> on<00:02:41.599> this<00:02:41.900> little<00:02:42.080> tab<00:02:42.349> right

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
you'll push in on this little tab right

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.339 
you'll push in on this little tab right
here<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:48.370> there<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.459> is

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
here and there it is

00:02:50.349 --> 00:03:01.020 
here and there it is
she's<00:02:51.349> all<00:02:51.560> off

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.610 

so<00:03:02.030> that's<00:03:02.269> all<00:03:02.450> there<00:03:02.689> is<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:03.019> removing<00:03:03.470> the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
so that's all there is to removing the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.880 
so that's all there is to removing the
throttle<00:03:04.220> position<00:03:04.340> sensor<00:03:05.030> on<00:03:05.239> your<00:03:05.890> saturn

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
throttle position sensor on your saturn

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:14.920 
throttle position sensor on your saturn
vue

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.989
