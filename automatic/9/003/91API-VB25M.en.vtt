again I've been up to something always
up<00:00:08.740> to<00:00:08.769> something<00:00:09.160> but<00:00:10.000> I<00:00:13.110> made<00:00:14.110> a<00:00:15.390> Midori<00:00:16.390> like

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
up to something but I made a Midori like

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.760 
up to something but I made a Midori like
notebook<00:00:17.859> and<00:00:18.660> at<00:00:19.660> first<00:00:19.930> I<00:00:20.109> wasn't<00:00:20.289> sure<00:00:20.439> if<00:00:20.650> I

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
notebook and at first I wasn't sure if I

notebook and at first I wasn't sure if I
was<00:00:20.859> gonna<00:00:21.010> like<00:00:21.310> it<00:00:21.520> because<00:00:21.820> the<00:00:21.970> size<00:00:22.180> is

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
was gonna like it because the size is

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.349 
was gonna like it because the size is
kind<00:00:22.570> of<00:00:22.689> weird<00:00:22.869> but<00:00:23.230> I<00:00:23.500> do<00:00:24.279> like<00:00:25.000> it<00:00:25.210> actually

husband and my daughter's wanting one so

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.889 
husband and my daughter's wanting one so

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
it looks like I'll be making some gifts

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.450 
it looks like I'll be making some gifts
for<00:00:38.530> people<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.850> this<00:00:40.239> is<00:00:40.300> my<00:00:40.629> personal<00:00:40.690> one

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
for people but this is my personal one

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.389 
for people but this is my personal one
and<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:43.480> made<00:00:43.719> it<00:00:43.950> thick<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:47.739> it<00:00:48.250> would

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
and I made it thick so that it would

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.240 
and I made it thick so that it would
hold<00:00:48.550> all<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.879> notebooks<00:00:49.090> inside<00:00:49.719> and<00:00:50.200> I<00:00:51.039> used

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
hold all the notebooks inside and I used

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.580 
hold all the notebooks inside and I used
white<00:00:51.610> elastic<00:00:52.270> because<00:00:52.480> I'll<00:00:53.020> show<00:00:53.289> you<00:00:53.350> once

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
white elastic because I'll show you once

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.430 
white elastic because I'll show you once
I<00:00:53.710> open<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.100> up<00:00:54.250> inside<00:00:54.579> why<00:00:54.879> I<00:00:54.910> used<00:00:55.300> white<00:00:55.539> but

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
I open it up inside why I used white but

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.400 
I open it up inside why I used white but
I<00:00:56.860> just<00:00:57.660> conditioned<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:58.899> leather<00:01:00.300> with

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
I just conditioned the leather with

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.070 
I just conditioned the leather with
neat's-foot<00:01:02.410> oil<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:04.269> did<00:01:04.540> change<00:01:04.900> the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
neat's-foot oil and it did change the

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.440 
neat's-foot oil and it did change the
color<00:01:05.290> of<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.530> leather<00:01:05.790> here's<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:07.000> original

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
color of the leather here's the original

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.219 
color of the leather here's the original
color<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.790> you<00:01:09.880> can<00:01:10.090> see<00:01:10.240> that<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.720> darkened<00:01:11.110> it

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
color so you can see that it darkened it

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.399 
color so you can see that it darkened it
up<00:01:11.380> quite<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.770> bit<00:01:12.070> but<00:01:12.970> it<00:01:13.330> was<00:01:13.659> it's<00:01:13.869> necessary

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
up quite a bit but it was it's necessary

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:15.840 
up quite a bit but it was it's necessary
because<00:01:14.500> when<00:01:14.710> you're<00:01:14.860> working<00:01:15.189> with<00:01:15.220> tooling

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
because when you're working with tooling

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.830 
because when you're working with tooling
leather<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.950> needs<00:01:18.189> to<00:01:18.400> be<00:01:18.580> oiled<00:01:19.420> and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
leather it really needs to be oiled and

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.550 
leather it really needs to be oiled and
and<00:01:20.229> everything<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.479> I'm<00:01:23.140> gonna<00:01:23.290> go<00:01:23.500> ahead

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
and everything but I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.310 
and everything but I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:23.680> open<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:25.150> does<00:01:25.720> measure<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:29.020> five

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
and open it it does measure about five

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.149 
and open it it does measure about five
inches<00:01:29.710> this<00:01:30.460> way<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:31.380> nine<00:01:32.380> inches<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:32.950> way

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
inches this way and nine inches this way

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.340 
inches this way and nine inches this way
so<00:01:33.729> it's<00:01:34.540> kind<00:01:35.049> of<00:01:35.200> an<00:01:35.380> odd<00:01:35.700> size<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.990> let's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
so it's kind of an odd size but let's

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.289 
so it's kind of an odd size but let's
see<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.479> made<00:01:41.079> I<00:01:41.439> just<00:01:41.799> started<00:01:42.189> a<00:01:42.430> bullet

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
see so I made I just started a bullet

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.200 
see so I made I just started a bullet

rather than just being busy kind of like

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.550 

graph<00:02:22.010> paper<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.879> I<00:02:23.330> wasn't<00:02:23.870> using<00:02:24.049> so<00:02:24.530> I

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
graph paper that I wasn't using so I

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.240 
graph paper that I wasn't using so I
decided<00:02:25.099> to<00:02:25.250> make<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:26.090> little<00:02:26.799> bullet<00:02:27.799> journal

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
decided to make a little bullet journal

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.250 
decided to make a little bullet journal
out<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.879> next<00:02:29.810> time<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.230> will<00:02:30.440> use<00:02:31.000> much

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
out of it and next time I will use much

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.009 
out of it and next time I will use much
longer<00:02:33.260> paper<00:02:33.470> so<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.459> can<00:02:34.760> get<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.000> full<00:02:35.450> 30

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
longer paper so that I can get a full 30
