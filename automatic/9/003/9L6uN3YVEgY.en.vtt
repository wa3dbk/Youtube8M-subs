00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.559
 initially worried even if they did not 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.890
 an exposition of the institution and the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.440
 research work by the school

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.710
 in the area of ​​psychiatry that juquery is 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.260
 they laid the foundation for the 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.210
 we could develop this theme in the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.250
 providing numerous 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.540
 research opening the doors of the complex 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.050
 for us 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.530
 the unit currently has 154 inmates 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.659
 their average age is 65 years in 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.940
 their social integration 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.070
 the unit has a core of activities 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.180
 such as sewing craft workshops and 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.370
 woodwork 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.040
 last year, x-9 organized with the 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.110
 juqueri a feijoada to approach the 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.409
 patients and the components of the school of 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.880
 samba and we invited the school of 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.180
 samba if some of its members 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.950
 to come here and give a demonstration 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.290
 so that our interns of ours 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.229
 patients might know a little 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.330
 carnival world and it was very 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.610
 interesting integration not the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.260
 patients in this space that we did 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.180
 this event where patients ask 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.000
 when there will not be another 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.680
 partnerships like this one of x-9 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.409
 for the social integration of these 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.930
 patients and collaborate to end the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.330
 stigma when x-9 addresses a subject 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.310
 delicate how crazy is 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.810
 However, in the context of the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.209
 Mardi Gras there too. 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.430
 a much broader sense than the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.380
 madness while a diagnosis while 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.599
 health and 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.510
 but it's important when we think 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:23.380
 that maybe people need to start 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.239
 enlarge more the concept of right acceptance 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.190
 and reduce stigma and 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.430
 prejudice is on everybody's head 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.000
 there we saw that it is through 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.080
 idol that is madness is treated is 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.940
 confused even in truth as 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.580
 genius then we want to show 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.420
 what a carnivalesque and crazy 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.420
 everybody has a little 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.840
 today I think the dollar is in place and 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.070
 hour 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.070
