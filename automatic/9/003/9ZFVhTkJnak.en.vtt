00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.310
 minute kaiserslautern rewards for 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.439
 the effort and balances out 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.570
 karim matmour is it was created in a long time 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.520
 tee of super body extension 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.090
 from lakic directly into the run and matmour 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.099
 and then from an acute angle by 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.200
 the pass in the middle hand at least with 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.239
 But then you do it yourself 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.690
 dry off with the bills preloaded 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.109
 and it pops in flat below left 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.780
 Lapwing stretches but gets excited 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.390
 He comes against this bund this ray 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.690
 the algerier is not and so is after 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.239
 eleven minutes all compensated because 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.379
 Karim matmour from everything 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.050
 set to zero again 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.690
 really good football match two goals 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.809
 football heart what list during the fck 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.330
 In between is Karim Matmour on the left 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.190
 Chris Lion is one of his many excursions 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.420
 the opposing half good eye folk 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.420
 equipped by 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.539
 many of the fc kaiserslautern karim 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:22.030
 matmour from braunschweig too passive in 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.310
 bought the bats infected by 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.689
 matmour who passes the ball 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.909
 and then there's the long leg and that 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.819
 is an absolutely correct decision 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.310
 they do not need to complain 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.490
 i mean it was matthias henn 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.549
 who leaves his leg there 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.240
 against karim matmour and so there is the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:51.810
 eleven meters the duel against djokovic 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.810
 the kroate against poland 53 minute lay 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.960
 the entry 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.380
 turns for the other corner and 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.920
 after this legitimate punishment 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.910
 there's the 2 1 guide for the fck and 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.910
 Lakic
