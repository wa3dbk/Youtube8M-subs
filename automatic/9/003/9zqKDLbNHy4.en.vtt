after one of my many head injuries that
build-up<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.400> my<00:00:08.550> TBI<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.300> lost<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.320> ability<00:00:10.410> to

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
about this all the time so I just

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.450 
about this all the time so I just
thought<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.269> would<00:00:15.389> sort<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.960> explain<00:00:16.770> my

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
thought I would sort of explain my

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.700 
thought I would sort of explain my
situation<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.449> now<00:00:18.630> bear<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:18.990> me<00:00:19.380> because

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
situation and now bear with me because

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890 
situation and now bear with me because
it<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.160> little<00:00:20.550> bit<00:00:20.730> complicated<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.840> is

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
it is a little bit complicated this is

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.980 
it is a little bit complicated this is
really<00:00:22.350> hard<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.680> explain<00:00:23.750> okay<00:00:24.750> so

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
really hard to explain okay so

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.939 
really hard to explain okay so
essentially<00:00:25.529> what<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.920> first<00:00:26.160> happened<00:00:26.609> I

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
essentially what it first happened I

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.679 
essentially what it first happened I
could<00:00:28.949> recognize<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:30.029> letter<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> alphabet

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
could recognize a letter of the alphabet

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.110 
could recognize a letter of the alphabet
like<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.710> showed<00:00:32.070> me<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> letter<00:00:32.520> A<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
like if you showed me the letter A I

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.240 
like if you showed me the letter A I
could<00:00:33.420> tell<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> letter<00:00:34.829> A<00:00:34.890> if

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.459 
could tell you that was a letter A if
you<00:00:35.399> showed<00:00:35.760> me<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.059> letter<00:00:36.390> Y<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.989> could<00:00:37.230> tell

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
process what sounds the letters were

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.090 
process what sounds the letters were
supposed<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> make<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.469> very<00:00:43.680> time

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
supposed to make it would be very time

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.190 
supposed to make it would be very time
consuming<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.820> painful<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.390> tedious<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:45.989> I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
consuming and painful and tedious but I

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
consuming and painful and tedious but I
could<00:00:46.440> tell<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> every<00:00:47.070> single<00:00:47.430> letter<00:00:47.610> okay

so<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> first<00:00:48.750> point<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.440> wanted<00:00:49.710> me<00:00:49.829> in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so that's the first point I wanted me in

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.160 
so that's the first point I wanted me in
my<00:00:50.250> situation<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.969> was<00:00:51.120> more<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> processing

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
books I often have to combine it with

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
books audiobooks are wonderful I mean

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.300 
books audiobooks are wonderful I mean
the<00:05:15.990> hardest<00:05:16.290> thing<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.500> explain<00:05:17.010> about<00:05:17.160> my

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
the hardest thing to explain about my

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.520 
the hardest thing to explain about my
real<00:05:17.970> learning<00:05:18.090> to<00:05:18.450> read<00:05:18.630> and<00:05:18.660> write<00:05:18.780> was<00:05:19.260> that

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
real learning to read and write was that

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.150 
real learning to read and write was that
yes<00:05:20.040> I<00:05:20.190> did<00:05:20.310> relearn<00:05:20.910> but<00:05:21.480> I<00:05:21.510> didn't<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.980> was

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
yes I did relearn but I didn't it was

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.820 
yes I did relearn but I didn't it was
just<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.970> physical<00:05:24.780> act<00:05:25.050> of<00:05:25.320> reading<00:05:25.530> and

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
just the physical act of reading and

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.680 
just the physical act of reading and
right<00:05:26.010> it<00:05:26.250> wasn't<00:05:26.610> my<00:05:26.730> understanding<00:05:27.480> of<00:05:27.600> the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
right it wasn't my understanding of the

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.510 
right it wasn't my understanding of the
English<00:05:28.050> language<00:05:28.260> as<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.710> whole<00:05:29.100> and<00:05:29.430> I<00:05:29.490> think

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
English language as a whole and I think

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.950 
English language as a whole and I think
that's<00:05:29.970> what<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.180> lot<00:05:30.360> of<00:05:30.420> people<00:05:30.600> don't

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
that's what a lot of people don't

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.900 
that's what a lot of people don't
understand<00:05:31.500> is<00:05:31.740> they<00:05:31.950> hear<00:05:32.160> like<00:05:32.370> oh<00:05:32.520> I<00:05:32.550> can't

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
understand is they hear like oh I can't

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.090 
understand is they hear like oh I can't
read<00:05:33.090> or<00:05:33.210> write<00:05:33.240> and<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:34.440> know<00:05:34.530> they<00:05:34.710> assume

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
read or write and you know they assume

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.160 
read or write and you know they assume
that<00:05:35.130> you<00:05:35.730> don't<00:05:35.970> know<00:05:36.060> how<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.240> speak<00:05:36.510> or<00:05:36.900> you

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
that you don't know how to speak or you

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.690 
that you don't know how to speak or you
know<00:05:37.350> things<00:05:37.560> like<00:05:37.710> that<00:05:37.770> that's<00:05:38.340> not<00:05:38.580> the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
know things like that that's not the

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.640 
know things like that that's not the
case<00:05:38.820> so<00:05:39.150> I<00:05:39.840> have<00:05:40.020> gotten<00:05:40.320> an<00:05:41.100> abundance<00:05:41.940> of

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
case so I have gotten an abundance of

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.090 
case so I have gotten an abundance of
accusations<00:05:43.650> for<00:05:44.580> faking<00:05:45.510> that<00:05:45.780> not<00:05:46.170> not<00:05:46.950> that

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
accusations for faking that not not that

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.760 
accusations for faking that not not that
I<00:05:47.190> would<00:05:47.370> I<00:05:47.700> mean<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:48.330> mean<00:05:48.720> like<00:05:48.870> oh<00:05:48.990> how<00:05:49.170> how

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
would you possibly benefit from

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.470 
would you possibly benefit from
pretending<00:05:53.010> to<00:05:53.220> not<00:05:53.400> be<00:05:53.580> able<00:05:53.790> to<00:05:53.910> read<00:05:54.330> and

pretending to not be able to read and
write<00:05:54.540> I<00:05:54.750> really<00:05:55.200> don't<00:05:55.470> know<00:05:55.980> how<00:05:56.280> you<00:05:56.310> would

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
possibly gain anything from that but

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.700 
possibly gain anything from that but
anyway<00:05:59.850> hopefully<00:06:00.390> this<00:06:00.750> sort<00:06:01.020> of<00:06:01.080> explains

everything<00:06:02.220> I<00:06:02.730> do<00:06:02.940> try<00:06:03.330> to<00:06:03.660> keep<00:06:03.780> out<00:06:04.020> it's

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
everything I do try to keep out it's

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.320 
everything I do try to keep out it's
really<00:06:04.470> hard<00:06:04.680> to<00:06:04.740> keep<00:06:04.860> up<00:06:05.070> on<00:06:05.280> social<00:06:06.030> media

maintained all of my vocabulary my
understanding<00:06:57.010> of<00:06:57.100> grammar<00:06:57.370> and<00:06:57.790> everything

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
understanding of grammar and everything

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.730 
understanding of grammar and everything
like<00:06:58.570> that<00:06:58.630> I<00:06:58.810> understood<00:06:59.500> you<00:06:59.680> know

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
like that I understood you know

like that I understood you know
punctuation<00:07:00.340> I<00:07:00.670> didn't<00:07:00.910> lose<00:07:01.060> any<00:07:01.300> of<00:07:01.480> that<00:07:01.660> I

punctuation I didn't lose any of that I

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.370 
punctuation I didn't lose any of that I
just<00:07:02.260> lost<00:07:02.890> the<00:07:03.160> ability<00:07:03.310> to<00:07:03.700> process<00:07:04.380> what

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
just lost the ability to process what

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.440 
just lost the ability to process what
sounds<00:07:06.160> the<00:07:06.280> letters<00:07:06.550> make<00:07:06.790> so<00:07:07.060> it<00:07:07.150> wasn't

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
sounds the letters make so it wasn't

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.450 
sounds the letters make so it wasn't
able<00:07:07.570> to<00:07:07.720> put<00:07:07.990> the<00:07:08.110> letters<00:07:08.380> together<00:07:08.560> to<00:07:08.950> form

a<00:07:09.580> word<00:07:09.760> if<00:07:10.030> that<00:07:10.240> makes<00:07:10.450> any<00:07:10.570> sense<00:07:10.860> you<00:07:11.860> know

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:11.950 
a word if that makes any sense you know

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.740 
a word if that makes any sense you know
my<00:07:12.100> understanding<00:07:12.970> of<00:07:13.180> everything<00:07:13.480> has

my understanding of everything has

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.750 
my understanding of everything has
gotten<00:07:14.050> much<00:07:14.230> better<00:07:14.530> the<00:07:15.040> reason<00:07:15.430> I<00:07:15.520> still

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
gotten much better the reason I still

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.670 
gotten much better the reason I still
use<00:07:16.000> audio<00:07:16.420> books<00:07:16.690> and<00:07:16.870> the<00:07:17.290> dictation

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 
use audio books and the dictation

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.340 
use audio books and the dictation
software<00:07:18.070> and<00:07:18.670> text-to-speech<00:07:19.510> software<00:07:19.870> is

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.350 
software and text-to-speech software is

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.790 
software and text-to-speech software is
mainly<00:07:20.890> because<00:07:21.190> it's<00:07:21.880> still<00:07:22.590> even<00:07:23.590> though

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
mainly because it's still even though

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.400 
mainly because it's still even though
I'm<00:07:24.520> understand<00:07:25.060> it's<00:07:25.240> still<00:07:25.480> very<00:07:25.720> hard<00:07:26.200> for

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410 
I'm understand it's still very hard for

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.920 
I'm understand it's still very hard for
me<00:07:26.560> I'm<00:07:27.040> still<00:07:27.340> very<00:07:27.490> slow<00:07:27.970> to<00:07:28.030> process<00:07:28.690> it

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
me I'm still very slow to process it

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.960 
me I'm still very slow to process it
even<00:07:29.200> though<00:07:29.290> I<00:07:29.320> can<00:07:29.680> process<00:07:29.980> it<00:07:30.490> it's<00:07:30.730> just

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:30.970 
even though I can process it it's just

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.650 
even though I can process it it's just
not<00:07:31.120> easy<00:07:31.450> and<00:07:31.920> focusing<00:07:32.920> on<00:07:33.190> you<00:07:34.120> know<00:07:34.270> all
