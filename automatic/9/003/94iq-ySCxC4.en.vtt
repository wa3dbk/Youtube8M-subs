ball<00:00:14.219> joint<00:00:14.519> which<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:16.410> drop<00:00:16.770> arm<00:00:17.010> of

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
ball joint which is on the drop arm of

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.460 
ball joint which is on the drop arm of
the<00:00:17.760> defender<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.109> slightly<00:00:19.320> different

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
the defender this is slightly different

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.040 
the defender this is slightly different
from<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.039> discovery<00:00:20.550> because<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.150> stays<00:00:21.779> in

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
from the discovery because this stays in

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.029 
from the discovery because this stays in
the<00:00:22.619> drop<00:00:22.890> arm<00:00:23.689> it's<00:00:24.689> quite<00:00:25.050> job<00:00:25.410> actually<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the drop arm it's quite job actually to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.279 
the drop arm it's quite job actually to
get<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.519> drop<00:00:26.760> arm<00:00:27.060> off<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.660> steering<00:00:27.930> box

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
get the drop arm off the steering box

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.839 
get the drop arm off the steering box
but<00:00:28.560> we've<00:00:28.710> pulled<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.160> off<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.609> make<00:00:29.820> it

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
but we've pulled this off to make it

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.049 
but we've pulled this off to make it
easy<00:00:30.269> enough<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.990> understand<00:00:31.800> by<00:00:32.399> doing<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> on

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
easy enough to understand by doing it on

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.830 
easy enough to understand by doing it on
the<00:00:33.270> bench<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> vehicle

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
the bench you can do this on the vehicle

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.380 
the bench you can do this on the vehicle
right<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.230> we<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> drop<00:00:38.190> arm<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
right so we have the drop arm in the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.810 
right so we have the drop arm in the
vise<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.989> first<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:40.829> we're<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
vise and first of all we're going to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.869 
vise and first of all we're going to
remove<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.960> clip<00:00:43.469> now<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> little<00:00:44.280> tip<00:00:44.520> here

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
remove this clip now a little tip here

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.810 
remove this clip now a little tip here
is<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.149> use<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> pin<00:00:45.899> punch<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.620> knock<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
is to use a pin punch and just knock the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.600 
is to use a pin punch and just knock the
clip<00:00:48.090> around<00:00:48.480> once<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.559> starts<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.100> move<00:00:50.280> then

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
clip around once it starts to move then

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.910 
clip around once it starts to move then
you<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.239> free<00:00:51.600> enough<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.710> able

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
you know it's a free enough to be able

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.910 
you know it's a free enough to be able
to<00:00:53.039> take<00:00:53.280> out<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.059> different<00:00:54.690> tool<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
to take out with a different tool you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
to take out with a different tool you
could<00:00:56.100> use<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> pin<00:00:56.699> punch<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.180> remove<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
could use a pin punch to remove it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.689 
could use a pin punch to remove it
completely<00:00:58.039> however<00:00:59.039> we're<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.399> use<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
completely however we're going to use a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.240 
completely however we're going to use a
pair<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.000> circlip<00:01:00.480> pliers<00:01:00.829> however<00:01:01.829> badly

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
pair of circlip pliers however badly

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.619 
pair of circlip pliers however badly
they<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:02.850> fitting<00:01:03.300> because<00:01:03.449> they're<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
they are fitting because they're a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.010 
they are fitting because they're a
little<00:01:03.960> bit<00:01:04.320> too<00:01:04.559> small<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> needles<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
little bit too small on the needles to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.950 
little bit too small on the needles to
to<00:01:07.020> remove<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.680> it'll<00:01:08.189> still<00:01:08.460> come<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.960> okay

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
to remove but it'll still come out okay

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
to remove but it'll still come out okay
so<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.229> needs<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.470> little<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:10.979> persuasion

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
so it needs a little bit more persuasion

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.210 
so it needs a little bit more persuasion
and<00:01:12.060> there<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.080> circlip<00:01:13.680> has<00:01:13.950> been

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and there you go the circlip has been

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.820 
and there you go the circlip has been
removed<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.049> push<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.590> near

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
removed and then you can push it near

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.800 
removed and then you can push it near
enough<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.130> hole<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.729> assembly<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
enough the hole of the assembly out and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.719 
enough the hole of the assembly out and
give<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.560> little<00:01:19.650> tap<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.159> hammer<00:01:20.220> first

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
give it a little tap with a hammer first

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.140 
give it a little tap with a hammer first

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
kit it's quite a complex joint this one

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.550 
kit it's quite a complex joint this one
however<00:02:42.390> once<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.720> know<00:02:42.840> how<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.050> do<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.470> is

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
however once you know how to do it is

very easy so first top cap fits in like
so<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:49.410> needs<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.740> be<00:02:49.830> pushed<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.290 
so and it needs to be pushed in to a
seat<00:02:51.570> correctly<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.130> could<00:02:53.370> use<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> punch

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
seat correctly you could use it a punch

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.420 
seat correctly you could use it a punch
if<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.870> want<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.380> however<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:56.100> tool

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
if you want it to however this tool

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.780 
if you want it to however this tool
makes<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.270> really<00:02:57.690> easy

makes it really easy

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.150 
makes it really easy
okay<00:02:59.790> so<00:02:59.850> we're<00:03:00.240> using<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.170> wider<00:03:01.440> boss<00:03:01.800> this

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
okay so we're using the wider boss this

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.050 
okay so we're using the wider boss this
time<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.240> push<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:04.680> won't<00:03:04.980> get<00:03:05.370> stuck<00:03:05.760> in

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
time to a push this won't get stuck in

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.540 
time to a push this won't get stuck in
the<00:03:06.360> housing<00:03:06.750> at<00:03:06.870> all<00:03:07.110> right<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:07.920> using<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
the housing at all right so using the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.970 
the housing at all right so using the
large<00:03:08.790> washer<00:03:09.420> on<00:03:09.630> the<00:03:10.110> other<00:03:10.230> side<00:03:10.590> and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
large washer on the other side and

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.190 
large washer on the other side and
basically<00:03:11.550> it's<00:03:11.970> just<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.540> same<00:03:12.780> thing<00:03:13.080> again

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
basically it's just the same thing again

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.860 
basically it's just the same thing again
not<00:03:14.160> in<00:03:14.280> bulk

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
not in bulk

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.979 
not in bulk
19<00:03:15.870> mil<00:03:16.290> I<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:16.830> that's<00:03:17.010> 19<00:03:17.489> mil<00:03:17.700> or<00:03:17.880> 17<00:03:18.780> mil

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
19 mil I think that's 19 mil or 17 mil

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.740 
19 mil I think that's 19 mil or 17 mil
that's<00:03:19.260> 19<00:03:19.860> there<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.580> it's<00:03:21.209> just<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.570> matter

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
that's 19 there and it's just a matter

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.190 
that's 19 there and it's just a matter
of<00:03:21.840> winding<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.830> in<00:03:23.540> until<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.690> comes<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.170> a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
of winding it in until it comes to a

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.740 
of winding it in until it comes to a
stop<00:03:25.650> right<00:03:25.980> when<00:03:26.850> I'm<00:03:26.940> speeding<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:27.570> up

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
stop right when I'm speeding this up

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.210 
stop right when I'm speeding this up
just<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:28.140> little<00:03:28.170> bit<00:03:28.380> because<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.830> does<00:03:28.980> take<00:03:29.190> a

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
just a little bit because it does take a

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.340 
just a little bit because it does take a
little<00:03:29.430> while<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.750> when<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:30.989> gets<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.260> a

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
little while and then when it gets to a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.000 
little while and then when it gets to a
stop

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
stop

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.550 
stop

and make sure you get it to sit on the
shoulder<00:04:01.890> where<00:04:02.670> it's<00:04:02.850> supposed<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.180> live<00:04:03.420> and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
shoulder where it's supposed to live and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.630 
shoulder where it's supposed to live and
don't<00:04:03.720> have<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.080> king<00:04:04.320> -<00:04:04.470> like<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.190> right

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
don't have it king - like that is right

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.509 
don't have it king - like that is right
now<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:07.140> then<00:04:07.320> need<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.680> put<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.070> spring<00:04:08.489> in

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
now you then need to put the spring in

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.150 
now you then need to put the spring in
like<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.540> now<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.140> keeps<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.590> tension<00:04:11.040> on

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
like so now this keeps the tension on

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.820 
like so now this keeps the tension on
the<00:04:11.280> bottom<00:04:11.549> cup<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:13.410> ball<00:04:13.620> joint

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
the bottom cup and the ball joint

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.219 
the bottom cup and the ball joint
working<00:04:14.340> correctly<00:04:14.640> without<00:04:15.150> any<00:04:15.299> lift<00:04:15.630> and

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
working correctly without any lift and

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.199 
working correctly without any lift and
then<00:04:16.410> you<00:04:16.830> put<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.160> bottom<00:04:17.519> cap<00:04:17.760> on<00:04:18.000> and

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
then you put the bottom cap on and

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.710 
then you put the bottom cap on and
you'll<00:04:18.810> need<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.260> be<00:04:19.620> able<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.859> retain<00:04:20.310> this

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
you'll need to be able to retain this

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.120 
you'll need to be able to retain this
because<00:04:21.720> there's<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.049> spring<00:04:22.289> there<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.919> need

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
because there's a spring there you need

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.279 
because there's a spring there you need
to<00:04:23.250> put<00:04:23.400> some<00:04:23.580> pressure<00:04:23.820> on<00:04:24.060> this<00:04:24.360> cap<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.930> be

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
to put some pressure on this cap to be

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.560 
to put some pressure on this cap to be
able<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.650> get<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.950> clip

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
able to get the clip

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.410 
able to get the clip
to<00:04:26.690> place<00:04:27.040> best<00:04:28.040> way<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.280> do<00:04:28.640> this<00:04:28.850> is<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.390> have

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
to place best way to do this is to have

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.840 
to place best way to do this is to have
a<00:04:29.660> large<00:04:29.960> socket<00:04:30.560> which<00:04:30.830> is<00:04:31.040> long<00:04:31.370> enough<00:04:31.640> to

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
a large socket which is long enough to

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.780 
a large socket which is long enough to
cover<00:04:32.240> over<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:33.470> one<00:04:33.710> part<00:04:34.010> and<00:04:34.250> then<00:04:34.490> use<00:04:34.760> a

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
cover over the one part and then use a

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.330 
cover over the one part and then use a
socket<00:04:35.360> on<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.780> other<00:04:35.990> end<00:04:36.260> with<00:04:36.980> a<00:04:37.010> cheek

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
socket on the other end with a cheek

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.200 
socket on the other end with a cheek
ramp<00:04:37.670> like<00:04:38.030> so<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:39.680> push<00:04:40.010> it<00:04:40.250> until<00:04:40.430> it's<00:04:40.850> past

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
ramp like so you push it until it's past

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.780 
ramp like so you push it until it's past
a<00:04:41.540> groove<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.380> then<00:04:42.800> you<00:04:42.920> can<00:04:43.130> get<00:04:43.340> your<00:04:43.490> clip

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
a groove and then you can get your clip

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.950 
a groove and then you can get your clip
on<00:04:44.000> clip<00:04:44.900> fits<00:04:45.200> on<00:04:45.440> like<00:04:45.920> so<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:46.850> then<00:04:47.840> if

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
on clip fits on like so and then if

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.750 
on clip fits on like so and then if
you're<00:04:48.110> lucky<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.800> will<00:04:49.010> fit<00:04:49.280> into<00:04:49.430> place

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
you're lucky it will fit into place

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.280 
you're lucky it will fit into place
almost<00:04:50.180> straight<00:04:50.690> away

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
almost straight away

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.310 
almost straight away
however<00:04:52.220> using<00:04:52.820> these<00:04:53.120> again<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:53.960> needles

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
however using these again the needles

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.550 
however using these again the needles
are<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.590> little<00:04:55.010> bit<00:04:55.190> small<00:04:55.670> and<00:04:56.510> to<00:04:57.230> be<00:04:57.320> honest

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
are a little bit small and to be honest

at work so what we're going to do is

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.940 
at work so what we're going to do is
struggle<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.870> little<00:05:03.140> bit<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.650> I'll<00:05:03.740> show<00:05:03.920> you

struggle a little bit and I'll show you

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.820 
struggle a little bit and I'll show you
a<00:05:04.070> problem<00:05:04.370> sometimes<00:05:04.760> that<00:05:05.180> happens

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
a problem sometimes that happens

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.490 
a problem sometimes that happens
okay<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:07.040> clip<00:05:07.310> won't<00:05:07.580> go<00:05:07.880> in<00:05:08.080> try<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:09.230> push

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
okay the clip won't go in try and push

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.270 
okay the clip won't go in try and push
it<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:11.030> it's<00:05:11.510> still<00:05:11.720> not<00:05:11.990> going<00:05:12.290> a<00:05:12.530> reason<00:05:13.130> for

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
it and it's still not going a reason for

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.520 
it and it's still not going a reason for
that<00:05:13.460> is<00:05:13.670> the<00:05:13.850> socket<00:05:14.300> is<00:05:14.420> actually<00:05:14.840> in<00:05:15.020> the

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
that is the socket is actually in the

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.860 
that is the socket is actually in the
way<00:05:15.830> and<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.640> didn't<00:05:16.910> take<00:05:17.120> long<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.720> realize

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
way and it didn't take long to realize

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.230 
way and it didn't take long to realize
that<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:18.620> socket<00:05:19.010> needed<00:05:19.370> to<00:05:19.520> be<00:05:19.670> moved<00:05:19.910> just

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
that the socket needed to be moved just

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.660 
that the socket needed to be moved just
slightly<00:05:20.510> use<00:05:21.170> a<00:05:21.200> small<00:05:21.710> enough<00:05:21.980> socket<00:05:22.460> so

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
slightly use a small enough socket so

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.590 
slightly use a small enough socket so
you<00:05:22.730> can<00:05:23.120> actually<00:05:23.300> get<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.810> clip<00:05:24.050> into<00:05:24.500> place

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
you can actually get the clip into place

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.180 
you can actually get the clip into place
okay<00:05:26.600> so<00:05:26.660> what<00:05:27.140> we've<00:05:27.290> realized<00:05:27.560> that<00:05:27.860> we<00:05:28.010> have

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
okay so what we've realized that we have

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.700 
okay so what we've realized that we have
to<00:05:28.310> move<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.640> socket<00:05:29.000> just<00:05:29.210> a<00:05:29.360> little<00:05:29.870> bit<00:05:30.050> so

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
to move the socket just a little bit so

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.310 
to move the socket just a little bit so
we<00:05:31.370> can<00:05:31.550> get<00:05:31.730> the<00:05:31.880> head<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.630> surf<00:05:32.870> lip<00:05:33.140> in

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
we can get the head of the surf lip in

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.230 
we can get the head of the surf lip in
like<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:33.950> and<00:05:34.100> it's<00:05:34.220> just<00:05:34.430> dropped<00:05:34.670> into<00:05:34.970> place

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
like so and it's just dropped into place

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.200 
like so and it's just dropped into place
and<00:05:35.480> naturally<00:05:36.520> alright<00:05:37.520> so<00:05:37.700> the<00:05:37.820> other<00:05:37.850> end

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
and naturally alright so the other end

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.510 
and naturally alright so the other end
we<00:05:38.540> have<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:38.840> rubber<00:05:39.320> boot<00:05:39.620> and<00:05:39.890> this

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
we have a rubber boot and this

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.700 
we have a rubber boot and this
mysterious<00:05:40.790> piece<00:05:41.540> of<00:05:41.720> metal<00:05:42.140> which<00:05:42.320> took<00:05:42.680> a

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
mysterious piece of metal which took a

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.230 
mysterious piece of metal which took a
little<00:05:42.950> bit<00:05:43.160> of<00:05:43.280> working<00:05:43.490> out<00:05:43.730> what<00:05:43.760> to<00:05:44.060> do

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
little bit of working out what to do

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.440 
little bit of working out what to do
with<00:05:44.450> it<00:05:44.600> okay<00:05:44.780> so<00:05:45.770> you<00:05:46.070> turn<00:05:46.340> the<00:05:46.490> cap<00:05:46.760> inside

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
with it okay so you turn the cap inside

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.170 
with it okay so you turn the cap inside
out<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:48.110> then<00:05:48.980> pull<00:05:49.220> it<00:05:49.340> round<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.700> right<00:05:49.910> way

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
out and then pull it round the right way

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.420 
out and then pull it round the right way
and<00:05:50.510> that's<00:05:51.200> a<00:05:51.350> strength<00:05:51.740> enough<00:05:52.070> for<00:05:52.310> the

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
and that's a strength enough for the

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.560 
and that's a strength enough for the
boot<00:05:53.020> couldn't<00:05:54.020> find<00:05:54.230> another<00:05:54.500> reason<00:05:54.800> for<00:05:55.310> it

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
boot couldn't find another reason for it

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.540 
boot couldn't find another reason for it
right<00:05:56.570> so<00:05:57.140> put<00:05:57.680> another<00:05:57.770> little<00:05:58.310> bit<00:05:58.430> of

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
right so put another little bit of

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.480 
right so put another little bit of
grease<00:05:58.850> in<00:05:59.150> here<00:05:59.470> you<00:06:00.470> don't<00:06:00.650> have<00:06:00.770> to<00:06:01.010> over

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
grease in here you don't have to over

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.570 
grease in here you don't have to over
pack<00:06:01.700> this<00:06:01.940> and<00:06:02.620> multi-purpose<00:06:03.620> lithium

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
pack this and multi-purpose lithium

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.170 
pack this and multi-purpose lithium
grease<00:06:04.610> is<00:06:05.270> a<00:06:05.330> fine<00:06:05.930> for<00:06:06.380> ball<00:06:06.680> joints<00:06:07.190> but

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
grease is a fine for ball joints but

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.350 
grease is a fine for ball joints but
we'll<00:06:08.810> slap<00:06:09.230> that<00:06:09.470> in<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:10.190> boot<00:06:10.580> as<00:06:10.850> well<00:06:11.120> or

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
we'll slap that in the boot as well or

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.090 
we'll slap that in the boot as well or
the<00:06:11.450> gator<00:06:11.720> whichever<00:06:12.260> you<00:06:12.380> like<00:06:12.560> to<00:06:12.710> call<00:06:12.950> it

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
the gator whichever you like to call it

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.880 
the gator whichever you like to call it
and<00:06:13.480> this<00:06:14.480> will<00:06:14.780> keep<00:06:15.020> some<00:06:15.290> of<00:06:15.320> the<00:06:15.470> water<00:06:15.710> out

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
and this will keep some of the water out

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.520 
and this will keep some of the water out
and<00:06:16.070> keep<00:06:16.520> it<00:06:16.670> lubricated<00:06:17.350> alright<00:06:18.350> the<00:06:18.500> next

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
and keep it lubricated alright the next

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.860 
and keep it lubricated alright the next
thing<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:19.100> do<00:06:19.310> is<00:06:19.580> put<00:06:19.820> the<00:06:19.910> metal<00:06:20.330> clip<00:06:20.600> on<00:06:20.750> the

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
thing to do is put the metal clip on the

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.470 
thing to do is put the metal clip on the
top<00:06:21.260> first<00:06:21.770> of<00:06:22.070> all<00:06:22.250> before<00:06:22.490> you<00:06:23.090> fit<00:06:23.360> the

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
top first of all before you fit the

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.140 
top first of all before you fit the
Gator<00:06:23.720> into<00:06:24.080> place<00:06:24.580> right<00:06:25.580> then<00:06:25.880> it's<00:06:26.060> a

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
Gator into place right then it's a

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.070 
Gator into place right then it's a
matter<00:06:26.390> of<00:06:26.510> slipping<00:06:26.780> it<00:06:27.080> in<00:06:27.290> like<00:06:27.890> so<00:06:28.220> and

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
matter of slipping it in like so and

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.130 
matter of slipping it in like so and
then<00:06:30.080> getting<00:06:30.500> your<00:06:30.530> Gator<00:06:31.070> over<00:06:32.000> the<00:06:32.660> grooves

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
then getting your Gator over the grooves

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.400 
then getting your Gator over the grooves
okay<00:06:34.100> so<00:06:34.160> at<00:06:34.490> the<00:06:34.580> top<00:06:34.940> once<00:06:35.419> that<00:06:35.690> slipped<00:06:36.140> in

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
okay so at the top once that slipped in

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.740 
okay so at the top once that slipped in
and<00:06:36.650> it's<00:06:37.280> sitting<00:06:37.490> there<00:06:37.640> nicely<00:06:38.419> you<00:06:38.570> can

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
and it's sitting there nicely you can

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.660 
and it's sitting there nicely you can
then<00:06:38.930> put<00:06:39.260> a

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
then put a

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.720 
then put a
garter<00:06:40.240> on<00:06:40.270> which<00:06:40.600> is<00:06:40.750> supplied<00:06:41.110> in<00:06:41.290> the<00:06:41.320> kit

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
garter on which is supplied in the kit

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.070 
garter on which is supplied in the kit
this<00:06:42.730> is<00:06:43.000> almost<00:06:43.450> the<00:06:43.720> last<00:06:43.960> piece<00:06:44.500> to<00:06:44.980> fit

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
this is almost the last piece to fit

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.840 
this is almost the last piece to fit
basically<00:06:47.080> all<00:06:47.350> you<00:06:47.500> do<00:06:47.680> is<00:06:47.920> just<00:06:48.190> roll<00:06:48.640> it

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
basically all you do is just roll it

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.420 
basically all you do is just roll it
over<00:06:49.030> and<00:06:49.420> don't<00:06:50.350> forget<00:06:50.650> my<00:06:51.010> hands<00:06:51.310> are<00:06:51.400> very

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
over and don't forget my hands are very

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.490 
over and don't forget my hands are very
greasy<00:06:51.970> here<00:06:52.390> so<00:06:52.570> it's<00:06:52.720> taking<00:06:53.020> a<00:06:53.110> little<00:06:53.320> bit

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
greasy here so it's taking a little bit

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.910 
greasy here so it's taking a little bit
of<00:06:53.740> time<00:06:53.920> but<00:06:54.640> once<00:06:54.880> that's<00:06:55.150> in<00:06:55.360> place<00:06:55.600> like<00:06:55.870> so

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
of time but once that's in place like so

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.580 
of time but once that's in place like so
the<00:06:56.920> ball<00:06:57.250> joint<00:06:57.640> is<00:06:57.850> ready<00:06:58.330> you<00:06:58.960> can<00:06:58.990> fit<00:06:59.440> it

00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.590 
the ball joint is ready you can fit it

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.530 
the ball joint is ready you can fit it
to<00:06:59.710> the<00:06:59.740> vehicle<00:07:00.340> put<00:07:00.520> your<00:07:00.640> washer<00:07:00.880> on<00:07:01.300> it

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
to the vehicle put your washer on it

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.400 
to the vehicle put your washer on it
Castle<00:07:02.410> ated<00:07:02.800> nut<00:07:03.420> which<00:07:04.420> it<00:07:04.630> should<00:07:04.840> fit<00:07:05.140> and

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
Castle ated nut which it should fit and

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.580 
Castle ated nut which it should fit and
wind<00:07:06.160> down<00:07:06.490> easily<00:07:06.850> if<00:07:07.630> it<00:07:07.780> doesn't<00:07:08.230> check<00:07:08.410> the
