00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
windows and when you're making the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.770 
windows and when you're making the
windows<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.630> sort

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
windows you really want to make it sort

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.210

of<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:15.930> nice<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.470> concise<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> doesn't

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
of like nice and concise so it doesn't

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.100

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
look too sloppy and does really give you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.950 
look too sloppy and does really give you
a<00:01:19.140> clear<00:01:19.740> okay<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.119> important<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:21.689> I

that that's a see when you look at it

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.390 
that that's a see when you look at it
you<00:04:27.229> wouldn't<00:04:27.530> have<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.740> wouldn't<00:04:27.949> know

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
you wouldn't have you wouldn't know
