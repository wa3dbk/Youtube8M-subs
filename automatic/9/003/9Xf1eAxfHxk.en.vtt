life um I'm gonna see if I can show you

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.630 
life um I'm gonna see if I can show you
what<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.080> looks<00:03:29.320> like<00:03:29.560> so<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.190> see<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:30.489> has<00:03:30.550> the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
what it looks like so you see it has the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.910 
what it looks like so you see it has the
two<00:03:30.790> combs<00:03:31.239> on<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.630> side<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.260> then<00:03:32.739> in<00:03:32.830> the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
two combs on the side and then in the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.220 
two combs on the side and then in the
middle<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:33.520> the<00:03:33.730> ceramic<00:03:34.120> bar<00:03:34.600> that<00:03:34.870> gives<00:03:35.050> the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
middle is the ceramic bar that gives the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.060 
middle is the ceramic bar that gives the
heat<00:03:35.470> right

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
heat right

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.910 
heat right
so<00:03:36.340> these<00:03:36.520> combs<00:03:37.000> see<00:03:37.420> how<00:03:37.570> high<00:03:37.840> they<00:03:38.110> go<00:03:38.320> it

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
so these combs see how high they go it

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.250 
so these combs see how high they go it
completely<00:03:39.610> protects<00:03:40.150> your<00:03:40.300> scalp<00:03:40.630> but<00:03:41.200> it

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
completely protects your scalp but it

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.590 
completely protects your scalp but it
allows<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.800> heat<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.070> get<00:03:42.489> as<00:03:42.640> close<00:03:43.090> as<00:03:43.480> it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
allows the heat to get as close as it

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.040 
allows the heat to get as close as it
needs<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.110> in<00:03:44.350> here<00:03:44.770> so<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.280> just<00:03:45.550> take<00:03:46.390> this

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
needs to in here so you just take this

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.990 
needs to in here so you just take this
obviously<00:03:47.560> it's<00:03:47.680> not<00:03:47.800> on<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:48.550> you<00:03:48.670> would<00:03:48.790> take

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
obviously it's not on but you would take

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.390 
obviously it's not on but you would take
this<00:03:49.270> and<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.900> just<00:03:50.050> run<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.410> comb<00:03:50.830> on<00:03:51.130> your
