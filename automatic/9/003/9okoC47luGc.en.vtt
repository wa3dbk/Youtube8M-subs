00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:06.180
 welcome to this instructional video for connecting the wireless headset to 

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:09.209
 left is high speed fall 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.219
 we see here a left save nine 62 with the sugar 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.719
 and then plantronics c'est 70 km wireless dect headset 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.059
 because there is already an outlet in the spotlight 

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:25.359
 paid future must be connected at the bottom of the base 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.329
 Wireless headsets should not become the headset port of a device 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.910
 plugged in 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970
 connection of the order 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.920
 blame the train crash device unknowns on the underside ceremony 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.010
 the offshore connection and replaced that by the nasa sports chef others 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 primary school of the wireless headset 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.840
 get to the order on the basis of the wireless headsets being connected 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 as shown here 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.240
 Place the base whose headset is not closest to the telephone 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.860
 If you are connected by just this can just be used as if it were 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 not at all in between 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.120
 this device is equipped with an information star 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.730
 explain i will assembled 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.330
 And so you must explain it must be connected to the basis of the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.920
 wireless headset on the bottom as shown here 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.380
 the headset is equipped with a switch that can be used properly 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.320
 Operate the tanker busier to take a lift up and if you go back one more time 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 goes directly down 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.970
 and down 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.070
 I sat on it again before a twin horn is on it and every printer comes for one 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.950
 high 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.950
 and once again printer is thundered 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.930
 it is important to experiment a little with the exact placement 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.990
 of the order, however 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.990
 in combination with increasing the performance 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.739
 don't forget the switches on the side 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.269
 and bottom of the base 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.250
