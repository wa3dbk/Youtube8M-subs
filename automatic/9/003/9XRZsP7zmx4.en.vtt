00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
it's going to be a standard oh you game

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.870 
it's going to be a standard oh you game
against<00:00:18.480> red<00:00:18.780> latias<00:00:19.260> 07<00:00:20.039> who<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.550> had<00:00:20.699> two

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
against red latias 07 who have had two

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.609 
against red latias 07 who have had two
matches<00:00:21.210> before<00:00:21.360> against<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.080> won<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.440> first

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
matches before against I won the first

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.079 
matches before against I won the first
one<00:00:22.800> he<00:00:22.980> won<00:00:23.099> the<00:00:23.189> second<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.849> sort<00:00:24.029> of

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:24.089 
one he won the second so this is sort of

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.790 
one he won the second so this is sort of
tie<00:00:24.300> breaker<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.289> future<00:00:25.560> I'm<00:00:25.650> probably

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
tie breaker in the future I'm probably

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.380 
tie breaker in the future I'm probably
going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> bring<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.460> more<00:00:26.550> fun<00:00:26.849> matches<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.529 
this channel but for now we're going to
start<00:00:29.249> with<00:00:29.339> an<00:00:29.460> o<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.609> standard<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.300> here<00:00:30.449> we

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
start with an o you standard so here we

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.510 
start with an o you standard so here we
go<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.900> lead<00:00:31.380> off<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:31.619> my<00:00:31.740> Metagross<00:00:32.130> which<00:00:32.369> is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
go I lead off with my Metagross which is

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.690 
go I lead off with my Metagross which is
a<00:00:32.550> very<00:00:33.210> defensive<00:00:33.840> set<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:35.130> not<00:00:35.430> want

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
a very defensive set and I do not want

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.370 
a very defensive set and I do not want
to<00:00:35.880> take<00:00:36.060> any<00:00:36.270> sort<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.720> fire<00:00:36.930> move<00:00:37.140> from<00:00:37.260> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
to take any sort of fire move from the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.290 
to take any sort of fire move from the
typhlosion<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.070> presuming<00:00:38.670> he's<00:00:38.969> scarf

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
typhlosion I'm presuming he's scarf

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.850 
typhlosion I'm presuming he's scarf
because<00:00:39.449> most<00:00:39.780> high<00:00:39.960> flow<00:00:40.170> shins<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.559> Scott

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
because most high flow shins are Scott

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.319 
because most high flow shins are Scott
when<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.190> leadoff<00:00:41.399> which<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.149> why<00:00:42.300> I'm

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
when the leadoff which is why I'm

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.000 
when the leadoff which is why I'm
thinking<00:00:42.570> go<00:00:42.870> straight<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.379> heat<00:00:43.559> Tran<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
thinking go straight to heat Tran and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.709 
thinking go straight to heat Tran and
get<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> flat<00:00:44.550> fire<00:00:44.789> boost<00:00:45.059> goes<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
get the flat fire boost goes for the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.029 
get the flat fire boost goes for the
eruption<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.350> knew<00:00:46.500> he<00:00:46.649> was<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.859> to<00:00:46.920> be

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
eruption I knew he was going to be

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.979 
eruption I knew he was going to be
scarfed<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> take<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> safely<00:00:48.210> he<00:00:48.750> could

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
scarfed and I take it safely he could

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.540 
scarfed and I take it safely he could
have<00:00:49.050> potentially<00:00:49.230> gone<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> earthquake

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
have potentially gone for the earthquake

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.799 
have potentially gone for the earthquake
they're<00:00:50.760> predicting<00:00:51.210> my<00:00:51.359> switch<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
they're predicting my switch with a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.450 
they're predicting my switch with a
blind<00:00:52.079> prediction<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:52.980> didn't<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.340> he

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
blind prediction but I didn't think he

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.860 
blind prediction but I didn't think he
was<00:00:53.519> going<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.730> take<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> risk<00:00:54.180> early<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
was going to take the risk early on and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.299 
was going to take the risk early on and
most<00:00:55.140> players<00:00:55.350> don't<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.859> over<00:00:56.039> predict

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
most players don't really over predict

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
most players don't really over predict
to<00:00:56.460> start<00:00:56.699> with<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.359> now<00:00:57.840> I've<00:00:57.989> got<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
to start with so now I've got the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
to start with so now I've got the
situation<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.010> Pikachu<00:00:59.519> whether<00:00:59.699> I

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
situation here with Pikachu whether I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.360 
situation here with Pikachu whether I
want<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.480> for<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> earth<00:01:01.679> power<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
want to go for just the earth power and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.310 
want to go for just the earth power and
be<00:01:02.489> safe<00:01:02.789> or<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> over<00:01:04.019> predict

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
be safe or what I want to over predict

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.600 
be safe or what I want to over predict
and<00:01:04.470> use<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> fire<00:01:04.860> move<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.309> something<00:01:05.519> like

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and use a fire move or something like

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.370 
and use a fire move or something like
that<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.360> safe<00:01:06.540> earth<00:01:06.690> power<00:01:06.930> he

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that I go for the safe earth power he

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.290 
that I go for the safe earth power he
brings<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> suicune<00:01:08.160> and<00:01:08.370> he<00:01:08.550> gets<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.000> get

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
brings in a suicune and he gets a I get

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.880 
brings in a suicune and he gets a I get
a<00:01:09.330> crit<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.780> him<00:01:09.960> which<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.170> pretty<00:01:10.470> bad<00:01:10.680> for

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
a crit on him which is pretty bad for

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
a crit on him which is pretty bad for
him<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.670> still<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.180> some<00:01:12.330> later<00:01:12.660> on<00:01:12.870> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
him but I still see some later on the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.690 
him but I still see some later on the
hacks<00:01:13.200> kind<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.620> evens<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.040> quite<00:01:14.400> nicely

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
hacks kind of evens out quite nicely

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.630 
hacks kind of evens out quite nicely
well<00:01:15.690> not<00:01:15.810> nicely<00:01:16.410> a<00:01:16.620> hash<00:01:16.980> evens<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.400> pretty

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
well not nicely a hash evens out pretty

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.010 
well not nicely a hash evens out pretty
horribly<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.270> you'll<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.720> goes<00:01:18.870> on

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
horribly but you'll see what goes on

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
horribly but you'll see what goes on
anyway<00:01:19.380> he<00:01:19.530> combines<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.550> i<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> metagross

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
anyway he combines as i go to metagross

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.290 
anyway he combines as i go to metagross
and<00:01:21.710> now<00:01:22.710> i<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:23.010> that<00:01:23.580> he<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.820> probably<00:01:24.120> going

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
and now i know that he is probably going

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.550 
and now i know that he is probably going
to<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.510> to<00:01:24.570> hit<00:01:24.840> me<00:01:24.870> with<00:01:25.110> some<00:01:25.320> sort<00:01:25.500> of

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
to want to hit me with some sort of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
know because I'm defensive i can take

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.790 
know because I'm defensive i can take
any<00:01:28.950> hit<00:01:29.370> even<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.760> it<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> +1<00:01:30.360> surf<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.740> do

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
any hit even if it is a +1 surf and I do

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.680 
any hit even if it is a +1 surf and I do
take<00:01:32.010> it<00:01:32.160> very<00:01:32.310> nicely<00:01:32.580> so<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.390> just<00:01:33.570> go

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
take it very nicely so here I just go

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.990 
take it very nicely so here I just go
boom<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.140> his<00:01:34.230> face<00:01:34.440> I<00:01:34.680> hate<00:01:35.280> suicune<00:01:35.760> and<00:01:35.940> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
boom in his face I hate suicune and it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
boom in his face I hate suicune and it
really<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> pain<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.840> take<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.170> otherwise

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
really is a pain to take out otherwise

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.620 
really is a pain to take out otherwise
so<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.670> boom<00:01:38.850> right<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.090> was<00:01:39.330> probably

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
so going boom right there was probably

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.510 
so going boom right there was probably
the<00:01:39.750> best<00:01:39.930> decision<00:01:40.050> I<00:01:40.350> could<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.620> made<00:01:40.770> so

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the best decision I could have made so

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.190 
the best decision I could have made so
now<00:01:41.760> we<00:01:41.820> both<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.390> switch<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.780> poke<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
now we both have to switch in a poke and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.660 
now we both have to switch in a poke and
I<00:01:43.410> decide<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.800> go<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.070> something<00:01:44.400> Wally

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
I decide to go to something Wally

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.400 
I decide to go to something Wally
something<00:01:45.150> safe<00:01:45.450> which<00:01:45.690> is<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:45.930> duster<00:01:46.290> why's

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
something safe which is my duster why's

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.440 
something safe which is my duster why's
he<00:01:46.620> goes<00:01:46.770> out<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.010> heracross<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.970> count

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
he goes out to heracross now I count

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.030 
he goes out to heracross now I count
will-o-wisp<00:01:48.900> him<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.230> he<00:01:49.350> has<00:01:49.440> the<00:01:49.590> guts<00:01:49.800> and

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
will-o-wisp him as he has the guts and

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.890 
will-o-wisp him as he has the guts and
so<00:01:50.820> I'm<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.120> to<00:01:51.150> just<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.660> try<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
so I'm going to just have to try and

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.150 
so I'm going to just have to try and
wear<00:01:52.050> them<00:01:52.140> down<00:01:52.320> with<00:01:52.560> my<00:01:52.680> Thunder<00:01:53.010> punch

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
wear them down with my Thunder punch

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.710 
wear them down with my Thunder punch
which<00:01:53.400> is<00:01:53.520> my<00:01:53.670> only<00:01:53.820> main<00:01:54.150> sort<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.450> physical

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
which is my only main sort of physical

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600 
which is my only main sort of physical
move<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.380> carry<00:01:55.770> shallow<00:01:56.040> sneak<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.520> know

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
move I do carry shallow sneak but I know

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.920 
move I do carry shallow sneak but I know
the<00:01:56.790> Thunder<00:01:57.030> punch<00:01:57.120> would<00:01:57.270> probably<00:01:57.750> do<00:01:57.900> more

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the Thunder punch would probably do more

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.960 
the Thunder punch would probably do more
even<00:01:58.770> though<00:01:58.830> I<00:01:58.860> carry<00:01:59.310> stabbed<00:01:59.700> with

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
even though I carry stabbed with

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.550 
even though I carry stabbed with
challenge<00:02:00.270> sneak<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.930> I'm<00:02:01.110> now<00:02:01.380> I'm<00:02:01.470> just

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
challenge sneak but I'm now I'm just

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050

going<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.800> go<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.100> Thunder<00:02:02.550> punch<00:02:02.670> again

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
going to go for the Thunder punch again

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.880

and<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.480> Fire<00:02:46.690> Blast<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.260> did<00:02:47.470> hit<00:02:47.709> would

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
and the Fire Blast if it did hit would

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.080 
and the Fire Blast if it did hit would
have<00:02:48.069> taken<00:02:48.190> out<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.400> set<00:02:48.670> pile<00:02:48.849> which<00:02:49.000> have

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
have taken out a set pile which have

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.520 
have taken out a set pile which have
made<00:02:49.209> my<00:02:49.360> life<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:49.569> much<00:02:49.810> easier<00:02:49.930> i<00:02:50.290> would<00:02:50.440> have

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
made my life so much easier i would have

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.530 
made my life so much easier i would have
kept<00:02:50.830> keep<00:02:51.010> trying<00:02:51.250> at<00:02:51.340> full<00:02:51.519> health<00:02:51.700> he<00:02:52.360> gets

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
kept keep trying at full health he gets

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.180 
kept keep trying at full health he gets
a<00:02:52.660> crit<00:02:52.989> on<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.200> earthquake<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.860> spite

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
a crit on the earthquake just to spite

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.920 
a crit on the earthquake just to spite
me<00:02:54.370> I'm<00:02:54.790> gonna<00:02:55.030> have<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.269> revenge<00:02:55.540> kill<00:02:55.810> with

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
me I'm gonna have to revenge kill with

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.600 
me I'm gonna have to revenge kill with
my<00:02:56.049> medicham<00:02:56.709> which<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.010> exactly<00:02:57.160> what<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.489> go

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
my medicham which is exactly what I go

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.400 
my medicham which is exactly what I go
to<00:02:57.670> now<00:02:57.910> now<00:02:58.750> what<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.200> should<00:02:59.350> have

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
to now now what a really should have

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.600 
to now now what a really should have
done<00:02:59.560> here<00:02:59.769> is<00:02:59.799> go<00:02:59.950> for<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.130> high<00:03:00.280> jump<00:03:00.310> kick

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
done here is go for the high jump kick

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.130 
done here is go for the high jump kick
it<00:03:01.090> probably<00:03:01.450> would<00:03:01.660> have<00:03:01.720> taken<00:03:01.930> out

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
it probably would have taken out

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.410 
it probably would have taken out
sceptile<00:03:02.530> regardless<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.310> if<00:03:04.000> you<00:03:04.150> switch<00:03:04.390> to

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
sceptile regardless and if you switch to

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.699 
sceptile regardless and if you switch to
something<00:03:04.750> like<00:03:04.959> this<00:03:05.019> it<00:03:05.440> would<00:03:05.530> have<00:03:05.620> been

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
something like this it would have been

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.320 
something like this it would have been
so<00:03:05.890> much<00:03:05.920> more<00:03:06.069> easy<00:03:06.519> to<00:03:06.849> take<00:03:07.150> out

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
so much more easy to take out

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.240 
so much more easy to take out
unfortunately<00:03:08.319> he<00:03:08.440> does<00:03:08.590> go<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.739> register

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
unfortunately he does go to register

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.070 
unfortunately he does go to register
like<00:03:09.519> ice<00:03:09.700> punch<00:03:10.060> because<00:03:10.299> I<00:03:10.480> was<00:03:10.810> just<00:03:10.930> going

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
like ice punch because I was just going

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.080 
like ice punch because I was just going
for<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.260> safe<00:03:11.500> move<00:03:11.830> after<00:03:12.130> he<00:03:12.580> try<00:03:12.819> and<00:03:12.849> I'd<00:03:13.060> I

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
for the safe move after he try and I'd I

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.729 
for the safe move after he try and I'd I
didn't<00:03:13.420> want<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.660> risk<00:03:13.810> anything<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.560> just

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
didn't want to risk anything so I just

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.410 
didn't want to risk anything so I just
went<00:03:14.860> for<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.099> safe<00:03:15.280> eyes<00:03:15.459> punch<00:03:15.760> he<00:03:16.150> goes<00:03:16.299> to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
went for the safe eyes punch he goes to

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.720 
went for the safe eyes punch he goes to
registeel<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.080> now<00:03:17.799> I<00:03:17.830> switch<00:03:18.069> to<00:03:18.130> gliscor<00:03:18.640> as

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
registeel and now I switch to gliscor as

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.430 
registeel and now I switch to gliscor as
he<00:03:18.819> sets<00:03:19.000> up<00:03:19.090> his<00:03:19.150> rocks<00:03:19.480> now<00:03:20.049> there's<00:03:20.290> not

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
he sets up his rocks now there's not

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.930 
he sets up his rocks now there's not
much<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.680> he<00:03:21.010> can<00:03:21.160> hit<00:03:21.370> me<00:03:21.489> with<00:03:21.640> unless<00:03:21.819> he

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
much that he can hit me with unless he

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.910 
much that he can hit me with unless he
carries<00:03:22.239> ice<00:03:22.420> punch<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.500> even<00:03:23.739> if<00:03:23.829> he

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
carries ice punch and that even if he

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.710 
carries ice punch and that even if he
does<00:03:24.100> carry<00:03:24.430> it<00:03:24.579> i<00:03:24.670> doubt<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:24.970> doubt<00:03:25.269> it<00:03:25.510> will<00:03:25.600> do

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
does carry it i doubt a doubt it will do

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.000 
does carry it i doubt a doubt it will do
that<00:03:25.870> much<00:03:26.019> damage<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.410> me<00:03:26.620> which<00:03:26.739> is<00:03:26.769> why<00:03:26.980> I

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
that much damage to me which is why I

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.370 
that much damage to me which is why I
stay<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.700> go<00:03:27.790> for<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:28.000> earthquake<00:03:28.540> now<00:03:29.350> I

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
stay in and go for the earthquake now I

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.990 
stay in and go for the earthquake now I
know<00:03:29.500> registeel<00:03:30.010> very<00:03:30.310> defensive<00:03:30.880> so

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
know registeel very defensive so

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.220 
know registeel very defensive so
earthquake<00:03:31.390> isn't<00:03:31.720> going<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:31.900> be<00:03:32.019> like<00:03:32.170> a

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
earthquake isn't going to be like a

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.809 
earthquake isn't going to be like a
two-hit<00:03:32.620> care<00:03:32.829> or<00:03:32.950> anything<00:03:33.040> it's<00:03:33.519> going<00:03:33.760> to

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
two-hit care or anything it's going to

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.979 
two-hit care or anything it's going to
be<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.090> three<00:03:34.510> kick<00:03:34.780> yer<00:03:35.049> most<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:36.329> now<00:03:37.329> I<00:03:37.390> go<00:03:37.750> and

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
be a three kick yer most so now I go and

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.470 
be a three kick yer most so now I go and
I<00:03:38.350> get<00:03:38.530> hit<00:03:38.709> by<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.890> ice<00:03:39.130> punch<00:03:39.489> which<00:03:39.880> really

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
I get hit by the ice punch which really

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.030 
I get hit by the ice punch which really
doesn't<00:03:40.780> do<00:03:41.049> as<00:03:41.200> much<00:03:41.230> as<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.709> thought<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:42.010> would

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
doesn't do as much as I thought it would

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.400 
doesn't do as much as I thought it would
which<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.549> great<00:03:42.790> for<00:03:42.819> me<00:03:43.120> because<00:03:43.299> I<00:03:43.870> am<00:03:44.049> four

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
which is great for me because I am four

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.990 
which is great for me because I am four
times<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.709> week<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:45.069> it<00:03:45.190> but<00:03:45.430> I'm<00:03:45.609> it<00:03:45.790> really

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
times a week to it but I'm it really

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.129 
times a week to it but I'm it really
didn't<00:03:46.209> do<00:03:46.329> too<00:03:46.510> much<00:03:46.540> so<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:46.900> give<00:03:47.019> the

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
didn't do too much so I give the

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.990 
didn't do too much so I give the
earthquake<00:03:47.560> as<00:03:47.739> he<00:03:47.889> stays<00:03:48.130> in<00:03:48.370> some<00:03:48.670> reason

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
earthquake as he stays in some reason

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.330 
earthquake as he stays in some reason
and<00:03:49.780> hits<00:03:50.170> me<00:03:50.290> with<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.470> ice<00:03:50.590> punch<00:03:50.889> now<00:03:51.130> I

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
and hits me with the ice punch now I

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.340 
and hits me with the ice punch now I
probably<00:03:52.150> should<00:03:52.450> have<00:03:52.660> just<00:03:52.720> finished<00:03:53.049> him

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
probably should have just finished him

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.960 
probably should have just finished him
off<00:03:53.410> with<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.650> earthquake<00:03:54.040> here<00:03:54.280> because<00:03:54.940> I

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
off with the earthquake here because I

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.599 
off with the earthquake here because I
knew<00:03:55.359> that<00:03:55.389> he<00:03:55.660> might<00:03:56.170> explode<00:03:56.859> so<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.160> go<00:03:57.459> for

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
knew that he might explode so I go for

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.449 
knew that he might explode so I go for
the<00:03:57.700> ruse<00:03:57.910> just<00:03:58.299> in<00:03:58.450> case<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.950> know<00:04:00.069> he<00:04:00.310> does

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
the ruse just in case you know he does

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.680 
the ruse just in case you know he does
not<00:04:00.639> carry<00:04:00.880> explosion<00:04:01.269> but<00:04:01.359> he<00:04:01.389> does

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
not carry explosion but he does

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.599 
not carry explosion but he does
unfortunately<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.920> doesn't<00:04:03.340> take<00:04:03.370> me<00:04:03.579> out

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
unfortunately and it doesn't take me out

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
he's going to have to make a decision

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.750 
he's going to have to make a decision
here<00:04:14.260> as<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.680> what<00:04:14.859> to<00:04:14.980> go<00:04:15.100> out<00:04:15.220> do<00:04:15.400> to<00:04:15.519> get<00:04:15.670> rid

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
here as to what to go out do to get rid

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.400 
here as to what to go out do to get rid
of<00:04:15.850> my<00:04:15.970> Gliscor<00:04:16.269> because<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:17.109> know<00:04:17.229> it's<00:04:17.380> a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
of my Gliscor because you know it's a

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.810 
of my Gliscor because you know it's a
physical<00:04:17.739> threat<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.100> if<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.280> gets<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.579> roost

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
physical threat and if it gets the roost

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.879 
physical threat and if it gets the roost
back<00:04:19.060> up<00:04:19.299> then<00:04:19.900> he's<00:04:20.289> going<00:04:20.410> to<00:04:20.500> have<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.650> hard

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
back up then he's going to have a hard

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.650 
back up then he's going to have a hard
time<00:04:21.100> going<00:04:21.639> up<00:04:21.850> against<00:04:22.210> it<00:04:22.330> so<00:04:22.419> he<00:04:22.479> goes<00:04:22.600> to

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
time going up against it so he goes to

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.659 
time going up against it so he goes to
rake<00:04:22.960> you<00:04:23.169> who<00:04:23.680> carries<00:04:24.039> hidden<00:04:24.250> power<00:04:24.430> ice

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
rake you who carries hidden power ice

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.640 
rake you who carries hidden power ice
and<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.300> know<00:04:25.419> that<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.960> don't<00:04:26.200> really<00:04:26.380> want<00:04:26.620> to

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
and I know that I don't really want to

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.380 
and I know that I don't really want to
switch<00:04:26.919> to<00:04:27.070> anything<00:04:27.250> heatran<00:04:27.789> is<00:04:27.909> gone<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:28.360> I

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
switch to anything heatran is gone so I

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.230 
switch to anything heatran is gone so I
can't<00:04:28.750> go<00:04:28.960> to

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
can't go to

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.460 
can't go to
for<00:04:29.509> the<00:04:29.569> earth<00:04:29.690> power<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.259> safe

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
for the earth power and the safe

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.040 
for the earth power and the safe
switchin<00:04:31.099> so<00:04:31.699> I<00:04:32.060> just<00:04:32.300> take<00:04:32.509> the<00:04:32.660> hidden<00:04:32.870> power

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
switchin so I just take the hidden power

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.020 
switchin so I just take the hidden power
and<00:04:33.319> die<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.830> that's<00:04:34.340> not<00:04:34.580> too<00:04:34.759> much<00:04:34.849> of<00:04:34.970> a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
and die and that's not too much of a

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.730 
and die and that's not too much of a
problem<00:04:35.240> gliscor<00:04:35.780> was<00:04:35.930> at<00:04:36.020> low<00:04:36.139> health<00:04:36.289> anyway

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
problem gliscor was at low health anyway

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.890 
problem gliscor was at low health anyway
and<00:04:36.979> unless<00:04:37.970> I<00:04:38.090> got<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.240> ruched<00:04:38.509> off<00:04:38.720> it

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
and unless I got a ruched off it

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.300 
and unless I got a ruched off it
wouldn't<00:04:39.110> really<00:04:39.169> help<00:04:39.500> he<00:04:39.979> did<00:04:40.130> have<00:04:40.280> a

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
wouldn't really help he did have a

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.550 
wouldn't really help he did have a
physical<00:04:40.819> sceptile<00:04:41.360> but<00:04:41.630> then<00:04:41.840> again<00:04:41.990> you

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
physical sceptile but then again you

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.260 
physical sceptile but then again you
know<00:04:42.710> if<00:04:43.009> I<00:04:43.220> got<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.370> sauce<00:04:43.580> on<00:04:43.759> top<00:04:43.940> it<00:04:44.090> still

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
know if I got a sauce on top it still

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.339 
know if I got a sauce on top it still
would<00:04:44.360> have<00:04:44.389> done<00:04:44.569> a<00:04:44.599> lot<00:04:44.720> of<00:04:44.780> damage<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.169> the

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
would have done a lot of damage to the

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:47.469 
would have done a lot of damage to the
school<00:04:45.530> so<00:04:45.560> now<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:46.849> have<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.210> think<00:04:47.389> of

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
school so now I have to think of

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.029 
school so now I have to think of
something<00:04:47.630> to<00:04:47.720> go<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:47.960> rake<00:04:48.259> you<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.560> counter

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
something to go to rake you to counter

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.010 
something to go to rake you to counter
it<00:04:49.069> and<00:04:49.250> try<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.520> get<00:04:49.910> rid<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.090> it<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.419> decide<00:04:50.870> my

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
it and try and get rid of it I decide my

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.050 
it and try and get rid of it I decide my
best<00:04:51.259> option<00:04:51.530> with<00:04:52.099> the<00:04:52.190> guys<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.370> have<00:04:52.610> left<00:04:52.849> is

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
best option with the guys I have left is

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.939 
best option with the guys I have left is
medicham<00:04:53.509> because<00:04:53.870> high<00:04:54.050> jump<00:04:54.289> kick<00:04:54.349> is<00:04:54.680> very

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
medicham because high jump kick is very

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.430 
medicham because high jump kick is very
powerful<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.639> it<00:04:56.210> probably<00:04:56.539> will<00:04:57.020> do<00:04:57.410> a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
powerful and it probably will do a

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.140 
powerful and it probably will do a
decent<00:04:57.710> amount<00:04:57.889> of<00:04:58.099> damage<00:04:58.460> if<00:04:58.610> not<00:04:58.639> one<00:04:59.000> hit

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
decent amount of damage if not one hit

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.960 
decent amount of damage if not one hit
KO<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.599> so<00:04:59.930> I<00:05:00.139> decide<00:05:01.069> exactly<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.699> go<00:05:01.789> for<00:05:01.909> the

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
KO it so I decide exactly to go for the

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.700 
KO it so I decide exactly to go for the
high<00:05:02.060> jump<00:05:02.090> kick<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.690> would<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.169> believe<00:05:03.199> it

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
high jump kick and would you believe it

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.529 
high jump kick and would you believe it
at<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:03.979> most<00:05:04.130> crucial<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.699> times<00:05:04.940> when<00:05:05.180> I<00:05:05.210> need

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
at the most crucial of times when I need

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.350 
at the most crucial of times when I need
it<00:05:05.569> to<00:05:05.720> hit<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.289> take<00:05:06.830> out<00:05:07.039> the<00:05:07.069> rake<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:07.580> hi

to<00:05:25.039> go<00:05:25.190> for<00:05:25.220> it<00:05:25.550> simply<00:05:25.970> because<00:05:26.090> he<00:05:26.539> might

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
to go for it simply because he might

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.570 
to go for it simply because he might
substitute<00:05:27.139> on<00:05:27.500> me<00:05:27.680> and<00:05:27.919> then<00:05:28.099> get<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.310> calm
