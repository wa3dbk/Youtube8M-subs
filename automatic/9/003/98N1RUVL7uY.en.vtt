 jlca elevates me to a very rich texture already 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.070
 he knows that it is almost pure water and carries 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.740
 excellent then we already have all the 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.020
 ingredients of our rich salad and 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.470
 the beetle what it does then is to paint 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.290
 All the product that we have added and 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.470
 It gives a very good Christmas tone 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.840
 you can also use cream 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.209
 and a little condensed milk if 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.550
 you want it if you want it creamy there 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.340
 several options then you can put 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.709
 little bit of cinnamon cloves powder too 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.830
 it would be very rich then we will 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.970
 our vinaigrette we will put here 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.100
 a little bit of vinegar 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.850
 a little lemon juice 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.740
 sugar 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.710
 and orange zest 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.010
 This is a vinaigrette that will give you a 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:16.730
 very special flavor to our salad 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.730
 Christmas because the orange has 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.310
 that citric tone the sugar is going to 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:27.110
 sweeten our rich fruit and the 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.790
 vinegar apart that the vinegar is very very 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.560
 rich knows why to wake up the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.290
 appetite when one smells lemon when 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.930
 smells vinegar and starts to salivate and 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.990
 start to imagine the flavors 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.960
 then it is that you dissolve the sugar 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.080
 let's put it on our rich
