 [Music] 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.240
 hi youtubers today i'm going to prepare the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.710
 both in the easier and faster cheese 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.230
 of knowing how to sit doing nothing 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.330
 ten minutes more good than what is 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.480
 it takes where you alve a little more but 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.849
 it's super fast so let's go 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.500
 to help the first thing first of all I'm going to 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.780
 get us reheating 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.460
 about 150 degrees 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.290
 [Music] 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.790
 so it's hot when we have 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.790
 the ready mix that is not treated 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.500
 well then to make this cake 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.020
 cheese what we are going to need are going to be 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:50.760
 eggs 250 grams of cheese spread 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:54.210
 sugar cornstarch a mold that I advise 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.300
 put albal paper in the background and a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.770
 mixer 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.770
 so what are we going to do 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930
 the two eggs 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.030
 Y 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 [Music] 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.440
 Lets put 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.190
 with a tablespoon and a half of dessert 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.190
 cornstarch 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.819
 [Music] 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.149
 that 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.599
 [Music] 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.599
 Y 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.599
 [Music] 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.710
 [Music] 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.730
 and about 4 tablespoons of sugar 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.250
 I'm going to put him I think 45 but good 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:34.940
 4 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:40.570
 [Music] 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.570
 and then if he needs a little more 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.500
 we put our hands 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.360
 Well, I think you're seeing that 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.360
 of sugar 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.240
 and you're done 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.100
 we throw it in the mold 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:32.900
 [Applause] 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.900
 [Music] 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.520
 one 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.150
 i 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.990
 and baked 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:04:03.370
 ready we had the oven to 150 now that 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.370
 I'm going to put it in 180 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.700
 and it will take about 15 minutes 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.790
 Well, fifteen minutes have passed 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.370
 what I had told you 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:19.620
 and that's what it looks like 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.720
 but at the moment it is not done yet 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.479
 it is very little golden above and 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.280
 it always browns a little more so I 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.110
 I think it's not ready yet 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.510
 wait five more minutes and then the 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.910
 I spike to see how it is 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.910
 Well and leave another 5 minutes 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.300
 I've turned it over so it's over 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.879
 to brown a little bit also for the other 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.660
 side that you see that we give you we give you the 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.889
 heat on the right side 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.660
 and well, here it is 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.809
 I'm going to click 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.809
 [Music] 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.620
 the stick comes out clean so it's 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.620
 sighting 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.250
 well, here it is 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.600
 in the oven goes up a lot but then when 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.569
 it's going to cool it down again 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.520
 more or less 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.830
 for the volume that I had when I was 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.529
 without baking so do not panic if 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.770
 you are under a lot is normal and you have to 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:22.770
 be like that 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.890
 Well, it's been a little chilling 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.110
 You can see how it ended up 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.140
 I was comfortable before 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.670
 around here and so round it has lowered a 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.980
 little bit but still very good 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.490
 look like golden brown above follows 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.120
 being hot is still that he was 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.319
 blandita 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.319
 [Music] 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.530
 it's a pretty wet cake as good 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.530
 cheesecake 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.439
 [Music] 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.220
 and then you can put it over 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:02.620
 marmalade 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.250
 or some kind of fruit sauce what 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:16.769
 you want 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:16.769
