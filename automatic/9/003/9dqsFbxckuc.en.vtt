kind<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.870> pushed<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.650> brush<00:02:30.860> into<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
kind of pushed the brush into the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.880 
kind of pushed the brush into the
compact<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.150> then<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> swirl<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.500> she<00:02:33.590> didn't

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
compact and then a swirl so she didn't

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.339 
compact and then a swirl so she didn't
do<00:02:33.980> like<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.340> buff<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.819> tap<00:02:35.120> but<00:02:35.750> she<00:02:35.959> pressed

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
do like the buff and tap but she pressed

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.520 
do like the buff and tap but she pressed
and<00:02:36.709> swirled<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.550> this<00:02:38.269> stuff<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:39.019> me<00:02:39.230> anyways

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
and swirled and this stuff to me anyways

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.110 
and swirled and this stuff to me anyways
definitely<00:02:40.010> feels<00:02:40.250> like<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.519> heavier<00:02:40.880> coverage

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
definitely feels like a heavier coverage

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.759 
definitely feels like a heavier coverage
and<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.569> feel<00:02:41.720> like<00:02:41.750> on<00:02:41.930> this<00:02:42.080> side<00:02:42.350> is<00:02:42.620> where

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
and I feel like on this side is where

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.210 
and I feel like on this side is where
you're<00:02:42.950> really<00:02:43.190> gonna<00:02:43.310> see<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.700> blend<00:02:44.510> in<00:02:44.780> and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
you're really gonna see it blend in and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.949 
you're really gonna see it blend in and
really<00:02:46.220> see<00:02:46.549> it<00:02:46.730> different<00:02:47.269> they<00:02:47.540> blend<00:02:47.780> in

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
really see it different they blend in

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.080 
really see it different they blend in
now<00:02:48.200> their<00:02:48.860> makeup<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.489> only<00:02:49.730> thing<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:49.940> will

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
now their makeup the only thing I will

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.930 
now their makeup the only thing I will
say<00:02:50.120> is<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:51.440> light<00:02:51.680> shades<00:02:52.069> one<00:02:52.610> tends

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
say is that the light shades one tends

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.789 
say is that the light shades one tends
to<00:02:53.060> be<00:02:53.180> more<00:02:53.390> on<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.690> pink<00:02:53.989> side<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.620> ones

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
to be more on the pink side and ones

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.830 
to be more on the pink side and ones
heads<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.160> be<00:02:55.220> more<00:02:55.489> yellow<00:02:55.940> side<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:56.720> if

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
heads to be more yellow side so if

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.660 
heads to be more yellow side so if
you're<00:02:56.959> more<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.290> neutral<00:02:57.530> undertone<00:02:58.459> like

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
you're more of a neutral undertone like

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.210 
you're more of a neutral undertone like
I<00:02:58.790> am<00:02:59.120> it's<00:02:59.540> not<00:03:00.019> gonna<00:03:00.260> be<00:03:00.410> an<00:03:00.530> exact<00:03:01.010> match

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
I am it's not gonna be an exact match

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.470 
I am it's not gonna be an exact match
like<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:01.549> would<00:03:01.730> say<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.299> not<00:03:02.420> a

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
like I would say that this is not a

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.990 
like I would say that this is not a
perfect<00:03:02.780> match<00:03:03.170> but<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:04.430> being<00:03:04.670> said<00:03:04.790> I

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
perfect match but that being said I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.120 
perfect match but that being said I
think<00:03:05.150> it's<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.540> really<00:03:05.840> good<00:03:05.959> match<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.769> when

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
think it's a really good match and when

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.800 
think it's a really good match and when
I<00:03:07.160> went<00:03:07.370> out<00:03:07.610> into<00:03:07.880> natural<00:03:08.180> lighting<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.780> I

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
I went out into natural lighting and I

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.509 
I went out into natural lighting and I
was<00:03:08.930> showing<00:03:09.109> man<00:03:09.350> he<00:03:09.590> was<00:03:09.739> like<00:03:09.890> oh<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.130> love<00:03:10.489> it

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
it looks great and yeah but that's my

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.890 
it looks great and yeah but that's my
honest<00:03:13.609> review<00:03:13.760> really<00:03:14.269> great<00:03:14.450> coverage

honest review really great coverage

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.500 
honest review really great coverage
feels<00:03:15.440> great<00:03:15.829> not<00:03:16.459> necessarily<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.090> perfect

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
feels great not necessarily the perfect

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.590
