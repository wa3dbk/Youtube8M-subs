by 39th edition Lego puzzle box it is

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.080 
by 39th edition Lego puzzle box it is
also<00:00:06.690> my<00:00:06.930> ninth<00:00:07.290> world<00:00:08.040> smallest<00:00:08.490> puzzle<00:00:08.940> box

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
also my ninth world smallest puzzle box

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.950 
also my ninth world smallest puzzle box
of<00:00:09.630> course<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.769> not<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.219> world's<00:00:11.670> smallest

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
of course it is not the world's smallest

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.720 
of course it is not the world's smallest
but<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.710> know<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:14.070> really<00:00:14.340> tiny<00:00:14.750> so<00:00:16.430> here<00:00:17.430> is

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
but you know it's really tiny so here is

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.630 
but you know it's really tiny so here is
the<00:00:18.060> base<00:00:18.320> it<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.890> 2<00:00:20.130> by<00:00:20.310> 3<00:00:20.430> plate<00:00:21.800> with<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.039> 1

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the base it is a 2 by 3 plate with a 1

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.849 
the base it is a 2 by 3 plate with a 1
by<00:00:23.760> 2<00:00:23.820> tile<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> middle<00:00:25.019> unless<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.619> plate

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
by 2 tile in the middle unless you plate

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.859 
by 2 tile in the middle unless you plate
on<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> side<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.550> 1<00:00:26.640> by<00:00:26.760> 2<00:00:26.820> brick<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> side

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
on the side and 1 by 2 brick on the side

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.990 
on the side and 1 by 2 brick on the side
and<00:00:28.460> then<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.939> build<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.949> 1<00:00:31.949> by<00:00:32.099> 1<00:00:32.130> plate<00:00:32.550> right

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
and then you build a 1 by 1 plate right

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510 
and then you build a 1 by 1 plate right
there<00:00:33.559> then<00:00:34.559> you're<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> want<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.309> a

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
puzzle you just stick it on right there

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.090 
puzzle you just stick it on right there
you<00:00:44.160> also<00:00:44.280> need<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.850> 1<00:00:45.629> by<00:00:45.780> 1<00:00:45.809> tile<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.500> just

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
you also need a 1 by 1 tile and just

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
you also need a 1 by 1 tile and just
place<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.550> right<00:00:47.820> there<00:00:49.520> then<00:00:50.520> you're<00:00:51.030> going

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
place it right there then you're going

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.110 
place it right there then you're going
to<00:00:51.180> want<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.809> 1<00:00:52.680> by<00:00:52.829> 2<00:00:52.890> grille<00:00:53.399> make<00:00:53.940> sure

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
to want to get a 1 by 2 grille make sure

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.410 
to want to get a 1 by 2 grille make sure
this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> tile<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.969> can't<00:00:56.969> need

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
this is not a tile because it can't need

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.299 
this is not a tile because it can't need
to<00:00:57.600> slide<00:00:57.840> back<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.230> forth<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.010> little

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to slide back and forth as this little

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.779 
to slide back and forth as this little
thing<00:00:59.520> right<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:01.489> little<00:01:02.489> thing<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
thing right here a little thing in the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.119 
thing right here a little thing in the
middle<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> doesn't<00:01:03.719> slide<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.439> then

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
middle so that it doesn't slide and then

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.560 
middle so that it doesn't slide and then
you<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.460> need<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> build<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> onto<00:01:06.420> there

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you just need to build it onto there

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.789 
you just need to build it onto there
like<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.220> then<00:01:08.220> get<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> 1<00:01:08.610> by<00:01:08.760> 2<00:01:08.820> plate<00:01:09.799> and

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
like that then get a 1 by 2 plate and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.219 
like that then get a 1 by 2 plate and
then<00:01:11.159> put<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> middle<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.720> has<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.110> 1

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
then put it in the middle it has to be 1

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.800 
then put it in the middle it has to be 1
by<00:01:13.350> 2<00:01:13.409> plate<00:01:13.710> can't<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.460> 1<00:01:14.729> 2<00:01:15.150> 1<00:01:15.299> by<00:01:15.450> 1<00:01:15.600> plates

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
by 2 plate can't be 1 2 1 by 1 plates

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.929 
by 2 plate can't be 1 2 1 by 1 plates
well<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.290> guess<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> could<00:01:16.920> be<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.610> wouldn't

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
well I guess it could be but it wouldn't

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.719 
well I guess it could be but it wouldn't
turn<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.780> well

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
turn out very well

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.749 
turn out very well
next<00:01:20.729> you're<00:01:20.880> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.450> 2<00:01:22.140> by<00:01:22.259> 3<00:01:22.290> base

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
next you're going to get a 2 by 3 base

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.280 
next you're going to get a 2 by 3 base
that<00:01:23.759> will<00:01:23.939> fit<00:01:24.180> over<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.540> top<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.960> then

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
that will fit over the top and then

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.859 
that will fit over the top and then
build<00:01:25.729> plates<00:01:26.729> along<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
build plates along it like that and a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.719 
build plates along it like that and a
tile<00:01:28.110> right<00:01:28.350> there<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:29.159> doesn't<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.640> be

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
tile right there it doesn't have to be

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.219 
tile right there it doesn't have to be
grill<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.090> stick<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.540> top<00:01:33.810> nice

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
grill it and just stick it on top nice

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.840 
grill it and just stick it on top nice
and<00:01:34.290> tight<00:01:36.740> then<00:01:37.740> you're<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.610> want<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and tight then you're going to want to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.800 
and tight then you're going to want to
build<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.750> plate<00:01:40.590> layer<00:01:41.090> all<00:01:42.090> across<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> top

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
build a plate layer all across the top

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.550 
build a plate layer all across the top
like<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.159> area<00:01:44.509> put<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.659> 1<00:01:46.380> by<00:01:46.409> 2

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
like that not on that area put a 1 by 2

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.639 
like that not on that area put a 1 by 2
tile<00:01:46.890> right<00:01:47.159> there<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:48.360> grill<00:01:48.810> whatever<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
tile right there or grill whatever and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.840 
tile right there or grill whatever and
then<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.820> build<00:01:51.060> plates<00:01:52.340> across<00:01:53.340> that's<00:01:53.670> up

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
then just build plates across that's up

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.520 
then just build plates across that's up
and<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:55.880> this<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.540> very<00:01:58.200> tiny

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
and that is it this is a very tiny

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.429 
and that is it this is a very tiny
puzzle<00:01:58.950> box<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.719> zoom<00:02:00.719> out<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.899> little<00:02:00.990> bit

puzzle box now zoom out a little bit
IFS<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.520> little<00:02:02.729> too<00:02:02.820> far<00:02:02.969> there<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:03.780> go

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
IFS it's a little too far there we go

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.469 
IFS it's a little too far there we go
now<00:02:05.219> I'm<00:02:05.430> going<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> show<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.939> how<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> solve

now I'm going to show you how to solve

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.270 
now I'm going to show you how to solve
it<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.170> don't<00:02:07.350> know<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.920> don't<00:02:08.129> want

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
it if you don't know if you don't want

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.970 
it if you don't know if you don't want
to<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.429> how<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> solve<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.060> then

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
to know how to solve it then

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.950 
to know how to solve it then
stop<00:02:11.980> right<00:02:12.460> now<00:02:12.490> also<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.480> forgot<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.840> mention

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
stop right now also I forgot to mention

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.680 
stop right now also I forgot to mention
earlier<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:15.220> 1<00:02:15.820> by<00:02:15.940> 2<00:02:15.970> tile<00:02:16.300> that's<00:02:16.450> going<00:02:16.630> to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
earlier the 1 by 2 tile that's going to

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.590 
earlier the 1 by 2 tile that's going to
be<00:02:16.780> your<00:02:16.840> treasure<00:02:17.340> cannot<00:02:18.340> be<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.700> grill<00:02:19.090> piece

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
be your treasure cannot be a grill piece

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.510 
be your treasure cannot be a grill piece
like<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.960> because<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:21.070> has<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.370> little

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
like this because it has that little

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.890 
like this because it has that little
thing<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.940> middle<00:02:22.090> like<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.420> said<00:02:22.600> earlier

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
thing in the middle like I said earlier

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.100 
thing in the middle like I said earlier
and<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:24.460> just<00:02:24.670> won't<00:02:24.760> work<00:02:24.880> you'll<00:02:25.690> see<00:02:25.870> when<00:02:26.020> I

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
and it just won't work you'll see when I

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.240 
and it just won't work you'll see when I
show<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.260> how<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.410> solve<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:26.920> anyways

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
show you how to solve it so anyways

want to try figure it out yourself you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.760 
want to try figure it out yourself you
go<00:02:35.200> ahead<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.500> do<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:38.170> beginning

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
happens to be a letter you can do a gold

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.229 
happens to be a letter you can do a gold
bar<00:03:43.150> $100<00:03:44.080> bill<00:03:44.380> I<00:03:44.709> couldn't<00:03:45.340> find<00:03:45.489> my<00:03:45.700> $100

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
bar $100 bill I couldn't find my $100

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.660 
bar $100 bill I couldn't find my $100
bill<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.720> we<00:03:46.900> have<00:03:47.019> one<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.200> those<00:03:47.350> pieces<00:03:47.670> but

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
bill and we have one of those pieces but

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.800 
bill and we have one of those pieces but
yeah<00:03:49.660> so<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.470> put<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:50.799> back<00:03:50.920> together<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:52.390> just

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
yeah so to put it back together is just

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.100 
yeah so to put it back together is just
the<00:03:53.709> inverse<00:03:54.130> of<00:03:54.459> what<00:03:55.030> you<00:03:55.600> did<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.959> can

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
the inverse of what you did you can

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.220 
the inverse of what you did you can
swivel<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.650> slide<00:03:57.160> that<00:03:57.690> or<00:03:58.690> actually<00:03:58.810> don't

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
swivel that slide that or actually don't

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.120 
swivel that slide that or actually don't
slide<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.739> yet

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
slide it yet

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.130 
slide it yet
slide<00:04:00.580> that<00:04:00.760> back<00:04:00.820> out<00:04:01.090> because<00:04:01.870> you're<00:04:02.049> going

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
slide that back out because you're going

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
slide that back out because you're going
to<00:04:02.200> need<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.470> build<00:04:03.459> this<00:04:03.700> into<00:04:04.510> here<00:04:05.160> stick

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
to need to build this into here stick

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.000 
to need to build this into here stick
that<00:04:06.340> into<00:04:06.549> there<00:04:07.000> slide<00:04:07.750> that<00:04:07.989> it's<00:04:08.799> some

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
that into there slide that it's some
