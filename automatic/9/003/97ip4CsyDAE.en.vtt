00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.120
 2 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.530
 and 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.940
 anyway 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
 and 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.750
 who is already more than a decade old 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.290
 we made the choice to create a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.030
 rugby section with sir munos and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.440
 since this year it's pascal 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.310
 to provide who is in charge 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.500
 helped by julien delval to take care of the 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.540
 section that we separated in two a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.370
 elite section and a detection section 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.309
 which we will see the very precise follow-up to 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.180
 level of studies and especially for the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.860
 continue their studies 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.930
 we have already got in touch with the 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.220
 hope pole of carcassonne for the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.330
 further studies of these young people and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.940
 especially that they can continue 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.690
 rugby pulling them to the highest 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.600
 level it's a section where we allow 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:19.649
 to high school students so I leave 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.060
 to discover rugby at xiii his sister 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.970
 time but also for those who are already 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.710
 in club to refine their aspects 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.899
 techniques then we seek to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.509
 develop expand this section for 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.950
 power only deals with rugby at xiii is 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.810
 much more much more important 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.810
 about the region 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.590
 and 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.600
 sÃ©bastien munoz so he had called me 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.729
 to come an aspirant because they 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.250
 opened a rugby section at xiii 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.350
 so for me I was young it was a 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.750
 opportunity for more even more 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.790
 to train I found the concept bing 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.780
 I went to espira I like and I 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.020
 spent three years 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.399
 breathable where there was the rugby section to 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.400
 xiii so we had two workouts 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.920
 per week it was Tuesday and Thursday I 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.319
 believe or something like that so who 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.360
 was really really good and we got 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.800
 looked for you take it with one 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.450
 learned a lot and more 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.550
 of that we were losing and even 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.800
 tournaments means little everywhere so in 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.320
 more rugby in club so it was 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.489
 always opus what to perfect I 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.080
 think when you're young account 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.060
 still 14 15 years old I think that's 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.739
 important of it's important to have 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.420
 always a little hard or more next 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.160
 so studies I think that's okay 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.230
 a little better studies what my physio me 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.230
 did not do that much and I knew that 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.120
 I had urbi two hours twice 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.440
 week and more so it's true that it 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.180
 give you a little extra boost 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.860
 it's good after the studies next there 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.850
 do not forget them either so I 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.850
 think it's a very good concept 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.230
 Yes 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.230
 well 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.360
 m 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.360
 Why 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.140
 we pay you
