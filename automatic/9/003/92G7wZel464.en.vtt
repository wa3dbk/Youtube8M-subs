00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
pretty bad if this was a Macintosh or a

PC moving around these full-color images

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.629 
PC moving around these full-color images
would<00:01:48.749> take<00:01:48.990> until<00:01:49.409> next<00:01:49.560> week<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.429> them<00:01:50.549> to

it's got an IR sensor you know keyboard
and<00:02:05.639> mouse<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.789> mean<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:06.659> have

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and mouse I mean this is what you have

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.440 
and mouse I mean this is what you have
on<00:02:06.959> your<00:02:07.079> desk<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.619> real<00:02:07.889> and<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:09.149> think

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
on your desk this is real and we think

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.969 
on your desk this is real and we think
there's<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.690> much<00:02:09.929> better<00:02:10.170> way<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.770> think

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
there's a much better way and we think

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.449 
there's a much better way and we think
the<00:02:11.069> much<00:02:11.250> better<00:02:11.490> way<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:14.280> want

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
the much better way is that you want

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.560 
the much better way is that you want
