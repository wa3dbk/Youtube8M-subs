should be the one to make the first move
and<00:00:30.449> start<00:00:30.990> up<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> honesty<00:00:31.650> conversation<00:00:32.189> so

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and start up the honesty conversation so

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.459 
and start up the honesty conversation so
if<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> really<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> guy<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.899> think<00:00:34.260> that

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
if you really like a guy and think that

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.080

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.449 
relationship is if he's super shy and if
you<00:02:16.930> know<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.379> you<00:02:17.530> have<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> really<00:02:18.250> good

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
you know that you have a really good

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.550 
you know that you have a really good
understanding<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.540> body<00:02:19.780> language<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.319> stuff

understanding of body language and stuff

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.920

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
and if that's your situation then I

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.830 
and if that's your situation then I
think<00:02:23.409> it'd<00:02:23.469> be<00:02:23.620> appropriate<00:02:23.829> to<00:02:24.609> go<00:02:25.540> up<00:02:25.689> to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
think it'd be appropriate to go up to

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.990 
think it'd be appropriate to go up to
him<00:02:26.019> and<00:02:26.500> tell<00:02:26.560> him<00:02:26.799> that<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.069> like<00:02:27.250> him<00:02:27.280> but
