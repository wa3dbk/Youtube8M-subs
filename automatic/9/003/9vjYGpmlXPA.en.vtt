00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.040
 role that could happen all this not 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:17.850
 because we make novels in Brazil 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:22.280
 I could think that we are always going to take 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.280
 Welcome to Argentina 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.240
 well you were here many years ago 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.720
 doing chiquititas if he lived here 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.329
 ten years ago my characters but the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.399
 paper in little Brazil but it 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.110
 recorded on telefe and was your first 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.789
 work begins until here two continue 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.680
 first jobs on a television 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:54.929
 Argentina 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:56.729
 how well you speak Spanish for me and 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.250
 now you have a little daughter 24 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.930
 write if you are five years old five years old 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.580
 that is called nina is located 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.820
 but it is coincidence also because it brought 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.070
 Luckily it called life before 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.920
 the novel will come I do not know what chance or 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.020
 the author sought a chance one 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.610
 chance and good and the truth is that it is 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.100
 impressive what people have gone through 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.340
 shout the name of Deborah and look all 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.720
 time 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.450
 potato says for the poster is what has 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.420
 happened the truth is does not happen many 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.730
 times in life not so furor 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.160
 a novel in so many countries 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.620
 they did not know what was happening in the script 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.840
 or you found out because I imagine that your 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.110
 friends wanted to know what will happen to 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.720
 Carmine already asked you if we 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.810
 we also did not know it was not all secret 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.959
 if it was all secret we knew very close 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.790
 of recording then we did not know change 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.040
 There was a way to know why all of Brazil 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.329
 it was paralyzed and the day of the last chapter 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.310
 like the one you are going to see now 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.840
 minutes until they were afraid that they 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.489
 cut the light directly from the 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.700
 number of people who were watching 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.099
 Now it was like a global 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.520
 of glass that had made more real 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.530
 thanks all evasion 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.990
 Brazil was doing more rating than the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.150
 own soccer is brazil and that happens to us 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.240
 many times that a novel exceeds the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.370
 football still and with carmen and how is it 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:33.100
 they were 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.430
 Adriana sent many kisses for you 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.430
 as well 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.519
 because he can not come but he was we are very 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.180
 friends then everything becomes easier 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.390
 to make the fight scenes 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.790
 everything is easier when you have privacy 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.980
 because the truth that hatred that looked 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.870
 among you was huge one really 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.030
 good pours are very good actresses 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.219
 two but I looked at it and I say how it 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.109
 they hate is terrible and actually they 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:06.060
 she wants very much they are very friends we have 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:08.319
 a lot and she is not so bad no not enough 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.760
 because everyone I think that the 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:17.190
 I cross to Carmina on the street and she gives me 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:19.870
 afraid but it is not how your career began 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.789
 in the performance they are all shouting here 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.060
 in a park it's crazy we're in 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.060
 alive 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.150
 you always knew that I wanted to be an actress 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:41.260
 I start to do theater 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:45.100

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.010
 singer clear then I already knew a 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:52.330
 little that I wanted, of course, there was no other 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:56.220
 way and in turn good we are just 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.220
 watching murilo benicio tattoo 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.220
 good with murilo benicio vos habías 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.860
 made the clone also that was a great 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.720
 success but the relationship with him in life 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.940
 Real began recently in the brazil avenue 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:25.390
 or yes and I admired him a lot as an actor was 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:29.730
 a friend but then I start the 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:33.310
 relationship him too 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:37.350
 He sent his command many kisses for all 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.350
 these better to taste 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.510

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.710

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.190
 it cost to see your kisses with conca 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.960
 wild looked on the other side happens to you 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.700
 also why he touched her place in April 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:59.910
 villa looked for another side very friends 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.100
 we did not have much then it will happen 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.870

 like to see them all together 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.569
 I imagined everyone wants to see them again 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:27.210
 there are possibilities or each one is in its 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:31.009
 way yes because we all work in a 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:36.030
