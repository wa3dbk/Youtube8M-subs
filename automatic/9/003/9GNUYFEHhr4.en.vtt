want to go so one of the cool features

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.039 
want to go so one of the cool features
that<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.850> Ford<00:03:52.150> Focus<00:03:52.510> Electric<00:03:52.600> has

that the Ford Focus Electric has
built-in<00:03:53.470> is<00:03:54.010> regenerative<00:03:54.790> braking

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
built-in is regenerative braking

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.060 
built-in is regenerative braking
essentially<00:03:56.019> what<00:03:56.140> that<00:03:56.200> does<00:03:56.590> is<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:56.829> takes

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
essentially what that does is it takes

the kinetic energy is usually

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.910 
the kinetic energy is usually
law-breaking<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.110> it<00:03:59.170> puts<00:03:59.380> it<00:03:59.470> back<00:03:59.680> into

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
law-breaking and it puts it back into
