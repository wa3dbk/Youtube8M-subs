00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.889 

okay<00:00:01.979> how<00:00:02.100> do<00:00:02.159> we<00:00:02.220> sketch<00:00:02.520> velocity<00:00:03.419> time<00:00:03.600> and

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
okay how do we sketch velocity time and

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.079 
okay how do we sketch velocity time and
acceleration<00:00:04.380> time<00:00:04.560> graphs<00:00:04.890> when<00:00:05.700> all<00:00:05.879> we're

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
acceleration time graphs when all we're

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.419 
acceleration time graphs when all we're
given<00:00:06.359> at<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.540> beginning<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.710> displacement

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
given at the beginning is a displacement

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.390 
given at the beginning is a displacement
time<00:00:09.269> graph<00:00:09.300> such<00:00:09.690> as<00:00:09.870> one<00:00:09.990> up<00:00:10.139> here<00:00:10.320> okay<00:00:11.219> well

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
time graph such as one up here okay well

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.070 
time graph such as one up here okay well
to<00:00:11.940> do<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.240> what<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.480> need<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.780> always

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
to do this what we need to always

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.860 
to do this what we need to always
remember<00:00:13.340> is<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.480> relation<00:00:15.809> between

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
remember is that the relation between

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.480 
remember is that the relation between
velocity<00:00:16.199> acceleration<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.070> displacement

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
velocity acceleration and displacement

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.400 
velocity acceleration and displacement
we<00:00:18.060> know<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> velocity<00:00:19.279> is<00:00:20.279> equal<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.730> x<00:00:21.410> over

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
we know the velocity is equal to x over

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.700 
we know the velocity is equal to x over
T<00:00:22.560> distance<00:00:23.250> divided<00:00:23.550> by<00:00:23.670> time<00:00:24.320> we<00:00:25.320> also<00:00:25.470> know

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
T distance divided by time we also know

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.529 
T distance divided by time we also know
that<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.760> well<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.180> x<00:00:27.420> over

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that it really that well that is x over

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.070 
that it really that well that is x over
T<00:00:27.840> if<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.590> had<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.830> small<00:00:29.160> amount<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.609> X<00:00:29.760> DX<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
T if I had a small amount of X DX and a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.590 
T if I had a small amount of X DX and a
small<00:00:31.380> amount<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.769> T<00:00:32.300> okay<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.329> could<00:00:33.450> write

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
small amount of T okay I could write

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.810 
small amount of T okay I could write
about<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.140> D<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.950> deeds<00:00:35.130> me<00:00:35.340> small

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
about that little D the deeds me small

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.540 
about that little D the deeds me small
difference<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.210> well<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.410> equals<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
difference in well that equals the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.959 
difference in well that equals the
gradient<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:42.390> xt<00:00:42.719> graph<00:00:43.760> okay<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
gradient of the xt graph okay so the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
gradient of the xt graph okay so the
velocity<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.870> gradient<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> xt<00:00:46.920> graph

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
velocity is the gradient of the xt graph

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.060 
velocity is the gradient of the xt graph
well<00:00:47.879> let's<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> look<00:00:49.020> at<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.230> xt<00:00:49.860> graph

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
well let's have a look at this xt graph

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.189 
well let's have a look at this xt graph
first<00:00:51.000> thing<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.239> do<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.570> spot<00:00:52.050> some

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
first thing you do is you spot some

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.450 
first thing you do is you spot some
points<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.559> interest<00:00:52.890> well<00:00:53.070> points<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
points of interest well points of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
points of interest well points of
interest<00:00:53.820> are<00:00:54.030> points<00:00:54.300> where<00:00:54.420> things<00:00:54.690> happen

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
interest are points where things happen

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.290 
interest are points where things happen
things<00:00:55.469> change<00:00:55.860> there's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> point<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:56.940> with

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
things change there's a point here with

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
things change there's a point here with
something<00:00:57.570> changes<00:00:58.010> so<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.160> point<00:00:59.430> here<00:00:59.609> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
something changes so this point here I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.639 
something changes so this point here I
wanting<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.870> much<00:01:01.050> easier<00:01:01.379> always

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
wanting to do is it's much easier always

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.349 
wanting to do is it's much easier always
if<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.800> draw<00:01:01.949> these<00:01:02.100> underneath<00:01:02.850> each<00:01:03.000> other

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
if you draw these underneath each other

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.299 
if you draw these underneath each other
I<00:01:03.420> draw<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> dotted<00:01:04.199> line<00:01:04.470> there<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> time

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
I draw a dotted line there so the time

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.440 
I draw a dotted line there so the time
scale<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> same<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.150> all<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> them

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
scale is the same for all of them

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.160 
scale is the same for all of them
something<00:01:07.290> happens<00:01:07.650> here<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.010> well<00:01:09.170> something

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
something happens here as well something

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.630 
something happens here as well something
interesting<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.680> changes<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.159> graph<00:01:11.340> changes

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
interesting it changes the graph changes

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.070 
interesting it changes the graph changes
could<00:01:14.640> also<00:01:14.760> put<00:01:15.030> zero<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.509> wanted<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> but

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
could also put zero if you wanted to but

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.679 
could also put zero if you wanted to but
really<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:17.009> don't<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:18.210> not<00:01:18.360> anything

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
really we don't know it's not anything

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.920 
really we don't know it's not anything
changes<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.409> appears<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.920> moment

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
changes it just appears at that moment

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.450 
changes it just appears at that moment
right<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.799> what<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.040> we<00:01:23.070> know

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
right so what do we know

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.969 
right so what do we know
well<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.270> consider<00:01:24.570> graded<00:01:24.990> grade<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.680> here

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
well it's consider graded grade in here

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.600 
well it's consider graded grade in here
what<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:27.450> positive<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.610> it's

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
what is it it's positive and it's

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.030 
what is it it's positive and it's
constant<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> I've<00:01:31.380> said<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> velocity

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
constant so the I've said the velocity

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.380 
constant so the I've said the velocity
is<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.460> gradient<00:01:32.670> well<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.970> gradient<00:01:33.299> is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
is the gradient well the gradient is

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.670 
is the gradient well the gradient is
positive<00:01:33.479> in<00:01:33.720> constant<00:01:34.140> velocity<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
positive in constant velocity is

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.030 
positive in constant velocity is
positive<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.640> above<00:01:35.850> zero<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.360> constant<00:01:37.140> in

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
positive it's above zero and constant in

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.890 
positive it's above zero and constant in
that<00:01:38.159> period<00:01:38.369> there<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:39.479> happens<00:01:39.750> here

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
that period there then what happens here

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
that period there then what happens here
the<00:01:39.990> grade<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.650> zero<00:01:41.070> well<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the grade in here is zero well if the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.660 
the grade in here is zero well if the
gradient<00:01:42.119> 0<00:01:42.299> velocity<00:01:42.750> must<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.960> zero<00:01:43.670> you'll

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
gradient 0 velocity must be zero you'll

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.620 
gradient 0 velocity must be zero you'll
notice<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.970> moment<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.270> not<00:01:45.299> trying<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
notice at the moment I'm not trying to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.030 
notice at the moment I'm not trying to
connect<00:01:45.869> these<00:01:45.990> lines<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.409> at<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.680> I'm<00:01:46.860> just

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
connect these lines up at all I'm just

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.410 
connect these lines up at all I'm just
drawing<00:01:47.189> them<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.579> they<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.030> zero

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
drawing them on as they are so zero

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.359 
drawing them on as they are so zero
there<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.600> go<00:01:48.750> what's<00:01:49.710> happening<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.220> well

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
there we go what's happening here well

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.560 
there we go what's happening here well
first<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> gradient<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.270> sloping

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
first of all the gradient it's sloping

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.800 
first of all the gradient it's sloping
downwards<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:52.920> negative<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:54.270> starts<00:01:54.659> off

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
downwards so it's negative it starts off

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.490 
downwards so it's negative it starts off
very<00:01:55.049> low<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.860> gets<00:01:56.009> higher<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.939> negative

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
very low and it gets higher so negative

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.899 
very low and it gets higher so negative
and<00:01:58.820> becoming<00:01:59.820> increasingly<00:02:00.540> negative<00:02:01.909> okay

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and becoming increasingly negative okay

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.249 
and becoming increasingly negative okay
so<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.090> starts<00:02:03.360> off<00:02:03.450> very<00:02:03.479> low<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> gets

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so it starts off very low and it gets

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.820 
so it starts off very low and it gets
increasing<00:02:04.829> negative<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.930> there<00:02:06.930> we<00:02:07.020> go

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
increasing negative so there we go

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.250 
increasing negative so there we go
does<00:02:08.830> that<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:10.690> going<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.869> join<00:02:10.959> these<00:02:11.140> up

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
does that just going to join these up

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.440 
does that just going to join these up
now<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:12.550> they<00:02:12.670> get<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.849> with<00:02:13.150> that's<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
now so they get that with that's the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.199 
now so they get that with that's the
velocity<00:02:13.800> profile<00:02:14.800> for<00:02:15.099> this<00:02:15.580> distance<00:02:15.970> time

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
velocity profile for this distance time

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.080 
velocity profile for this distance time
graph<00:02:16.440> right<00:02:17.440> how<00:02:17.590> do<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.769> now<00:02:17.980> convert<00:02:18.580> this

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
graph right how do I now convert this

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.270 
graph right how do I now convert this
velocity<00:02:19.540> time<00:02:19.720> profile<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.069> velocity

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
velocity time profile so this velocity

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.339 
velocity time profile so this velocity
time<00:02:21.610> graph<00:02:21.879> into<00:02:22.360> acceleration<00:02:22.810> time<00:02:22.959> well<00:02:23.170> I

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
time graph into acceleration time well I

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.979 
time graph into acceleration time well I
know<00:02:23.709> now<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.519> acceleration<00:02:25.269> is<00:02:25.660> actually

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
know now that acceleration is actually

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.130 
know now that acceleration is actually
equal<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.319> velocity<00:02:27.130> divided<00:02:27.670> by<00:02:27.700> time<00:02:28.000> or<00:02:28.870> if

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
equal to velocity divided by time or if

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.839 
equal to velocity divided by time or if
I<00:02:29.260> was<00:02:29.650> right<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:30.010> little<00:02:30.370> change<00:02:30.580> in<00:02:30.730> velocity

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
I was right it little change in velocity

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.020 
I was right it little change in velocity
divided<00:02:31.780> by<00:02:31.810> little<00:02:31.989> change<00:02:32.349> in<00:02:32.470> time<00:02:33.030> looks

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
divided by little change in time looks

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.190 
divided by little change in time looks
very<00:02:34.239> very<00:02:34.360> similar<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.780> one<00:02:34.870> above<00:02:35.019> us

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
very very similar the one above us

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.630 
very very similar the one above us
because<00:02:35.410> it's<00:02:35.560> identical<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.610> only

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
because it's identical the only

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.809 
because it's identical the only
difference<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:38.010> rather<00:02:39.010> than<00:02:39.160> til<00:02:39.280> met<00:02:39.430> next<00:02:39.700> T

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
difference is rather than til met next T

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.190 
difference is rather than til met next T
graph<00:02:40.060> it's<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.330> gradient<00:02:40.599> of<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.380> VT<00:02:41.860> graph<00:02:43.200> so

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
graph it's a gradient of the VT graph so

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.420 
graph it's a gradient of the VT graph so
I'm<00:02:44.290> looking<00:02:44.530> at<00:02:44.620> its<00:02:44.739> gradient<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.190> well

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
I'm looking at its gradient this well

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.640 
I'm looking at its gradient this well
gradient<00:02:45.849> there<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.090> zero<00:02:46.440> gradient<00:02:47.440> here<00:02:47.560> is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
gradient there is zero gradient here is

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.880 
gradient there is zero gradient here is
zero<00:02:47.860> gradient<00:02:48.670> here<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.239> negative<00:02:49.890> and

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
zero gradient here is negative and

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.780 
zero gradient here is negative and
constant<00:02:52.349> okay<00:02:53.349> so<00:02:53.410> between<00:02:54.370> arrow

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
constant okay so between arrow

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.839 
constant okay so between arrow
Darren<00:02:55.329> L<00:02:55.450> should<00:02:55.959> be<00:02:56.049> zero<00:02:56.610> between<00:02:57.610> here<00:02:57.819> and

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
Darren L should be zero between here and

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.330 
Darren L should be zero between here and
here<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.599> zero<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.319> now<00:02:59.560> it's<00:02:59.709> negative<00:02:59.920> and

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
here is zero and now it's negative and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.000 
here is zero and now it's negative and
constant<00:03:00.760> about<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:01.660> so<00:03:02.200> join<00:03:02.410> out<00:03:02.530> there<00:03:02.739> if

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
constant about that so join out there if

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.069 
constant about that so join out there if
you<00:03:03.700> really<00:03:04.000> if<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.420> really<00:03:04.510> want<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.930> you

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
you really if you really want to you

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.330 
you really if you really want to you
could<00:03:05.230> say<00:03:05.380> right<00:03:05.410> what's<00:03:05.739> this<00:03:05.950> gradient

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
could say right what's this gradient

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.160 
could say right what's this gradient
here<00:03:06.670> well<00:03:06.940> it's<00:03:07.420> negative<00:03:07.660> because<00:03:07.930> it

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
here well it's negative because it

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.750 
here well it's negative because it
slopes<00:03:08.410> down<00:03:08.500> it's<00:03:08.890> incredibly<00:03:09.579> high

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
slopes down it's incredibly high

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.530 
slopes down it's incredibly high
actually<00:03:10.450> negative<00:03:11.280> infinity<00:03:12.280> okay<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.329> if

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
actually negative infinity okay so if

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.910 
actually negative infinity okay so if
you<00:03:13.600> want<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.989> could<00:03:14.109> just<00:03:14.170> write<00:03:14.410> put

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
you want to you could just write put

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.870 
you want to you could just write put
spike<00:03:15.220> up<00:03:15.940> there<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:17.170> down<00:03:17.889> this<00:03:18.100> one<00:03:18.250> suppose

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
spike up there and down this one suppose

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.460 
spike up there and down this one suppose
would<00:03:19.000> go<00:03:19.750> straight<00:03:20.019> up<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.139> bottom<00:03:20.350> of<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
would go straight up the bottom of the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.289 
would go straight up the bottom of the
graph<00:03:20.620> there<00:03:20.889> should<00:03:21.639> be<00:03:21.730> an<00:03:21.790> infinity<00:03:22.150> non

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
graph there should be an infinity non

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.509 
graph there should be an infinity non
eight<00:03:22.480> okay<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:24.010> that's<00:03:24.130> how<00:03:24.250> you<00:03:24.310> draw

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
eight okay so that's how you draw

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.400 
eight okay so that's how you draw
velocity<00:03:25.299> time<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:25.540> acceleration<00:03:25.959> time

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
velocity time and acceleration time

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.920 
velocity time and acceleration time
graphs<00:03:26.680> from<00:03:27.579> a<00:03:27.910> displacement<00:03:28.510> time<00:03:28.900> graph

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
graphs from a displacement time graph

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.790 
graphs from a displacement time graph
okay<00:03:29.829> it's<00:03:29.950> all<00:03:30.069> about<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.370> gradient
