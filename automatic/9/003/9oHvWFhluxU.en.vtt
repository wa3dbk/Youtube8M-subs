00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.580 
go for 310 degrees it has a professional
cord<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.610> pretty<00:01:20.880> long<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:22.049> swivels

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
cord so it's pretty long and it swivels

cord so it's pretty long and it swivels
as<00:01:22.799> well<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.610> way<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:24.509> cord<00:01:25.080> doesn't

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
as well so that way your cord doesn't

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.289 
as well so that way your cord doesn't
get<00:01:25.500> tangled<00:01:25.740> white<00:01:26.130> curling<00:01:26.610> your<00:01:26.729> hair<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
also I like it because it has this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.390 
also I like it because it has this
little<00:01:30.240> plastic<00:01:30.659> thing<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.040> when<00:01:32.220> you're

it<00:01:52.890> has<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.570> kind<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.840> cone<00:01:55.140> shape<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.740> it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it has a kind of like a cone shape to it

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.760 
it has a kind of like a cone shape to it
so<00:01:56.219> when<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.520> curl<00:01:56.790> your<00:01:56.969> hair<00:01:57.210> your<00:01:58.020> curls

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
so when you curl your hair your curls

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.459 
so when you curl your hair your curls
gonna<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.670> more<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.210> distinct<00:02:00.810> curl<00:02:01.170> I

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
gonna have more of a distinct curl I

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.459 
gonna have more of a distinct curl I
like<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.189> curl<00:02:02.549> my<00:02:02.579> hair<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:04.229> then

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
like to curl my hair like this so then

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.679 
like to curl my hair like this so then
the<00:02:04.619> hair<00:02:04.799> up<00:02:04.920> top<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.579> more<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> wave<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the hair up top is more like a wave and

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.160 
the hair up top is more like a wave and
then<00:02:06.869> towards<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.170> bottom<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.680> more<00:02:07.890> of

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
then towards the bottom is more of

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.660 
then towards the bottom is more of
Perls<00:02:08.410> that's<00:02:08.740> kind<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.009> crazy<00:02:09.250> is<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:09.520> it

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
Perls that's kind of crazy is that it

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.910 
Perls that's kind of crazy is that it
heats<00:02:09.880> up<00:02:10.090> in<00:02:10.330> only<00:02:10.660> 30<00:02:11.080> seconds

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
heats up in only 30 seconds

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.449 
heats up in only 30 seconds
and<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:13.270> also<00:02:13.450> turns<00:02:13.900> off<00:02:14.319> after<00:02:14.739> it's<00:02:15.130> been<00:02:15.280> on

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
and it also turns off after it's been on

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.120 
and it also turns off after it's been on
for<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.819> while<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.720> turns<00:02:17.050> off<00:02:17.319> automatically

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
for a while it turns off automatically

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.089 
for a while it turns off automatically
so<00:02:18.520> if<00:02:19.030> you're<00:02:19.180> one<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.450> those<00:02:19.540> people

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
so if you're one of those people

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.880 
so if you're one of those people
wondering<00:02:21.099> did<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.760> turn<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.300> off<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:23.739> know

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
wondering did I turn that off you know

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.400 
wondering did I turn that off you know
this<00:02:24.099> is<00:02:24.280> probably<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.569> it's<00:02:26.290> also

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
this is probably for you it's also

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.760 
this is probably for you it's also
tourmaline<00:02:27.100> ceramic<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.989> way<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.620> helps

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
tourmaline ceramic so that way it helps

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.160 
tourmaline ceramic so that way it helps
reduce<00:02:30.069> frizziness<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.390> then<00:02:31.810> gives<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.140> a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
reduce frizziness and then gives you a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.559 
reduce frizziness and then gives you a
little<00:02:32.470> bit<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.680> shine<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.819> unfortunately<00:02:34.450> I

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
little bit of shine so unfortunately I

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.210 
little bit of shine so unfortunately I
do<00:02:34.780> have<00:02:35.110> some<00:02:35.890> cons<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.239> curling<00:02:37.690> iron

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
do have some cons to this curling iron

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.800 
do have some cons to this curling iron
one<00:02:39.220> thing<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.519> noticed<00:02:39.880> right<00:02:40.030> when<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.360> started

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
one thing I noticed right when I started

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.750 
one thing I noticed right when I started
pilling<00:02:41.110> my<00:02:41.230> hair<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.069> my<00:02:42.190> hair<00:02:42.430> started

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
pilling my hair is that my hair started

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.449 
pilling my hair is that my hair started
sliding<00:02:43.150> from<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.319> iron<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:45.040> could<00:02:45.250> be

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
sliding from the iron and it could be

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.690 
sliding from the iron and it could be
because<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.840> cone<00:02:47.080> shape<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:48.160> other<00:02:48.370> cone

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
because it's a cone shape the other cone

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.130 
because it's a cone shape the other cone
shape<00:02:48.940> curling<00:02:49.360> iron<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.720> had<00:02:49.959> was

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
shape curling iron that I had was

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.789 
shape curling iron that I had was
inverted

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
inverted

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.750 
inverted
so<00:02:51.610> rather<00:02:52.209> than<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:53.049> small<00:02:53.799> part<00:02:54.549> of<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
so rather than the small part of the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.190 
so rather than the small part of the
cone<00:02:54.970> sticking<00:02:55.450> out<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.900> was<00:02:56.019> actually

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
cone sticking out it was actually

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.890 
cone sticking out it was actually
inwards<00:02:57.100> so<00:02:57.340> maybe<00:02:57.940> that's<00:02:58.269> why<00:02:58.480> my<00:02:58.690> hair

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
inwards so maybe that's why my hair

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.229 
inwards so maybe that's why my hair
wasn't<00:02:59.110> slipping<00:02:59.590> with<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.830> other<00:02:59.980> one

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
wasn't slipping with the other one

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.390 
wasn't slipping with the other one
and<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.600> could<00:03:01.750> also<00:03:01.900> just<00:03:02.230> be<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.590> ceramic<00:03:03.190> I

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
and it could also just be the ceramic I

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.729 
and it could also just be the ceramic I
don't<00:03:03.700> know<00:03:03.910> what<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.269> is<00:03:04.390> but<00:03:04.660> my<00:03:04.840> hair<00:03:05.140> keeps

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
don't know what it is but my hair keeps

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.620 
don't know what it is but my hair keeps
slipping<00:03:06.069> from<00:03:06.489> it

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
slipping from it

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.870 
slipping from it
and<00:03:07.989> because<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.590> obviously<00:03:09.069> since<00:03:09.760> I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
and because of that obviously since I

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.520 
and because of that obviously since I
have<00:03:10.060> long<00:03:10.239> hair<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:10.780> was<00:03:10.900> hard<00:03:11.140> for<00:03:11.200> me<00:03:11.440> to

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
have long hair it was hard for me to

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.550 
have long hair it was hard for me to
curl<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.860> bottoms<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:13.570> if<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.170> could<00:03:14.350> see<00:03:14.470> the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
curl the bottoms so if you could see the

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.710 
curl the bottoms so if you could see the
bottom<00:03:14.709> of<00:03:14.980> my<00:03:15.100> hair<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.549> not<00:03:15.910> all<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.600> way

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
bottom of my hair it's not all the way

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.490 
bottom of my hair it's not all the way
curled<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:19.090> only<00:03:19.299> reason<00:03:19.630> for<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.109> was

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
curled and the only reason for that was

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.650 
curled and the only reason for that was
because<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:21.070> couldn't<00:03:21.430> fit<00:03:21.760> into<00:03:21.910> my<00:03:22.269> curling

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
because I couldn't fit into my curling

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.190 
because I couldn't fit into my curling
iron<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.769> that's<00:03:23.950> kind<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.489> bummer<00:03:24.700> but<00:03:25.200> of

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
iron so that's kind of a bummer but of

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.650 
iron so that's kind of a bummer but of
course<00:03:26.440> I<00:03:26.650> have<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:26.950> really<00:03:27.489> long<00:03:27.670> hair<00:03:28.120> if<00:03:28.450> you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
course I have a really long hair if you

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.180 
course I have a really long hair if you
guys<00:03:28.810> don't<00:03:29.019> have<00:03:29.109> long<00:03:29.500> hair<00:03:29.799> then<00:03:30.040> obviously

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
guys don't have long hair then obviously

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.300 
guys don't have long hair then obviously
you<00:03:30.609> won't<00:03:31.230> find<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.709> be<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:32.829> problem<00:03:33.130> for

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
you won't find that to be a problem for

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.789 
you won't find that to be a problem for
you<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.880> other<00:03:34.090> con<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.570> had<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.989> this<00:03:35.109> was<00:03:35.650> that

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
you the other con I had to this was that

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.890 
you the other con I had to this was that
the<00:03:35.890> on<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.250> off<00:03:36.370> switch<00:03:36.549> is<00:03:36.940> right<00:03:37.359> here<00:03:37.690> in

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
the on and off switch is right here in

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.539 
the on and off switch is right here in
the<00:03:37.989> middle<00:03:38.200> of<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.380> handle<00:03:38.739> which<00:03:39.220> is<00:03:39.250> where

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
the middle of the handle which is where

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.000 
the middle of the handle which is where
I<00:03:39.579> like<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.239> grip<00:03:40.540> my<00:03:40.989> curling<00:03:41.500> irons<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:41.920> I

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
I like to grip my curling irons and I

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.640 
I like to grip my curling irons and I
like<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.340> grip<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.670> hard<00:03:42.880> so<00:03:43.750> there's<00:03:44.410> been<00:03:44.620> a

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
like to grip it hard so there's been a

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.470 
like to grip it hard so there's been a
few<00:03:44.890> times<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.340> I've<00:03:45.489> accidentally<00:03:46.060> turned

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
few times that I've accidentally turned

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.690 
few times that I've accidentally turned
the<00:03:46.690> curling<00:03:46.989> iron<00:03:47.109> off<00:03:47.470> as<00:03:47.829> I<00:03:48.040> was<00:03:48.190> peeling<00:03:48.400> my

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
the curling iron off as I was peeling my

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.250 
the curling iron off as I was peeling my
hair<00:03:48.910> because<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:49.420> one<00:03:49.600> is<00:03:49.750> just<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.079> button

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
hair because this one is just a button

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.069 
hair because this one is just a button
so<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.680> could<00:03:50.829> easily<00:03:51.130> be<00:03:51.579> pushed<00:03:51.910> whereas<00:03:52.840> if

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
so it could easily be pushed whereas if

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.220 
so it could easily be pushed whereas if
it<00:03:53.260> was<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:53.859> an<00:03:54.040> on<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.370> off<00:03:54.400> switch

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
it was like an on and off switch

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.390 
it was like an on and off switch
that<00:03:56.230> probably<00:03:56.500> would<00:03:56.620> have<00:03:56.650> been<00:03:56.799> better<00:03:56.980> or

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
that probably would have been better or

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.220 
that probably would have been better or
if<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.910> on<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.239> off<00:03:58.329> button<00:03:58.660> was<00:03:58.870> somewhere

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
if the on and off button was somewhere

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.400 
if the on and off button was somewhere
up<00:03:59.530> here<00:03:59.859> right<00:04:00.359> people<00:04:01.359> usually<00:04:01.540> don't<00:04:01.870> grip

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
up here right people usually don't grip

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.430 
up here right people usually don't grip
up<00:04:02.590> here<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.239> was<00:04:04.359> one<00:04:04.600> thing<00:04:04.630> I<00:04:05.109> think

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
up here so that was one thing I think

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.199 
up here so that was one thing I think
that<00:04:05.739> was<00:04:05.829> about<00:04:06.069> it<00:04:06.130> for<00:04:06.489> my<00:04:06.609> cons<00:04:06.910> there

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
that was about it for my cons there

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.590 
that was about it for my cons there
wasn't<00:04:07.540> too<00:04:07.720> many<00:04:07.889> cons<00:04:08.889> in<00:04:09.519> my<00:04:09.670> opinion<00:04:10.180> but

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
wasn't too many cons in my opinion but

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.080 
wasn't too many cons in my opinion but
because<00:04:11.019> of<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.560> problems<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.160> I've<00:04:12.340> had<00:04:12.609> it

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
because of the problems that I've had it

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.600 
because of the problems that I've had it
took<00:04:13.389> me<00:04:13.540> a<00:04:13.569> little<00:04:13.780> longer<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:14.350> curl<00:04:14.680> my<00:04:14.799> hair

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
took me a little longer to curl my hair

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.330 
took me a little longer to curl my hair
and<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:16.030> usually<00:04:16.630> would<00:04:16.810> but<00:04:17.739> if<00:04:17.890> you<00:04:18.010> want<00:04:18.220> to

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
and it usually would but if you want to

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.979 
and it usually would but if you want to
save<00:04:18.519> money<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:19.000> want<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.420> curling<00:04:19.690> iron

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
save money and you want a curling iron

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.070 
save money and you want a curling iron
that<00:04:20.230> curls<00:04:21.160> really<00:04:21.760> well<00:04:21.940> as<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.360> can<00:04:22.540> see<00:04:22.780> I

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
that curls really well as you can see I

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.050 
that curls really well as you can see I
would<00:04:23.500> recommend<00:04:23.980> this<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.430> mean<00:04:24.640> it's<00:04:24.820> only

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
would recommend this I mean it's only

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.510
