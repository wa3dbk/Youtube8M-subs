00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
in the computer just wasn't using it so

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.410 
in the computer just wasn't using it so
if<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.030> set<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.319> hit<00:02:10.470> apply

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
if we set it to that and hit apply

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.740 
if we set it to that and hit apply
and<00:02:13.349> then<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.590> load<00:02:13.940> know<00:02:14.940> what<00:02:15.150> happens<00:02:15.540> about

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and then it load know what happens about

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.420 
and then it load know what happens about
a<00:02:15.780> Java<00:02:16.140> maybe<00:02:16.500> that's<00:02:16.709> already<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.190> yep

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
a Java maybe that's already on it yep

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.250 
a Java maybe that's already on it yep
I've<00:02:17.610> already<00:02:17.760> got<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:19.110> can

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
I've already got that on that we can

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.620 
I've already got that on that we can
close<00:02:19.440> out<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.830> here<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.130> load<00:02:20.819> minecraft<00:02:21.420> up

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
all loaded okay guys I move back and as

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.920 
all loaded okay guys I move back and as
you<00:02:26.310> can<00:02:26.459> see<00:02:26.489> by<00:02:27.150> recording<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> lot

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
you can see by recording is a lot

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.080 
you can see by recording is a lot
smoother<00:02:28.349> before<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.069> was<00:02:29.310> recording<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.910> maybe

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
smoother before I was recording on maybe

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.180 
smoother before I was recording on maybe

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
second and now I am sitting on 50

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.920 
second and now I am sitting on 50
comfortably<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.030> that's<00:02:36.209> because<00:02:36.390> i<00:02:36.720> have

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
comfortably and that's because i have

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.990 
comfortably and that's because i have
fraps<00:02:37.260> recording<00:02:37.830> at<00:02:37.920> 50<00:02:38.220> frames<00:02:38.370> per<00:02:38.610> second

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
fraps recording at 50 frames per second

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.180 
fraps recording at 50 frames per second
so<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.630> going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.930> lock<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.260> there<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:41.069> it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
so it's going to lock it there but it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.250 
so it's going to lock it there but it
would<00:02:41.370> be<00:02:41.400> going<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.880> lot<00:02:41.910> higher<00:02:42.239> if<00:02:42.930> i<00:02:43.080> were<00:02:43.170> to

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
would be going a lot higher if i were to

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.710 
would be going a lot higher if i were to
stop<00:02:43.440> recording<00:02:43.590> i<00:02:43.950> probably<00:02:44.130> go<00:02:44.400> up<00:02:44.670> past<00:02:45.209> 100

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
stop recording i probably go up past 100

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.140 
stop recording i probably go up past 100
mark<00:02:45.900> hundred<00:02:46.319> 10<00:02:46.610> which<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.640> more<00:02:48.120> than

mark hundred 10 which is more than
playable<00:02:48.690> make<00:02:49.560> definitely<00:02:50.250> makes<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.519> huge

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
playable make definitely makes a huge

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.400 
playable make definitely makes a huge
difference<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.360> game<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.900> much<00:02:52.049> more<00:02:52.200> fun

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
difference to the game so much more fun

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.830 
difference to the game so much more fun
