so upset I was so hurt but really for me

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.560 
so upset I was so hurt but really for me
it<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.219> because<00:02:02.759> he's<00:02:02.969> acting<00:02:03.210> this<00:02:03.509> way

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it was like because he's acting this way

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.480 
it was like because he's acting this way
does<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.259> give<00:02:04.409> me<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.649> right<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.979> do<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
does that give me the right to do that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.590

because<00:02:05.640> that's<00:02:05.909> not<00:02:06.060> who<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.270> am

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so each day it was one decision at a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.240 
so each day it was one decision at a
time<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.000> how

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250
