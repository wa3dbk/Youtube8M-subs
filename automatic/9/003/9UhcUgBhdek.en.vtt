the<00:03:28.639> complicated<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.480> so<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:30.980> may<00:03:31.190> sound<00:03:31.459> a

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
the complicated but so it may sound a

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.099 
the complicated but so it may sound a
bit<00:03:31.609> complicated<00:03:32.030> but<00:03:32.480> it's<00:03:32.660> actually<00:03:32.930> pretty

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
bit complicated but it's actually pretty

easy to set up so all you need to do you

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.099 
easy to set up so all you need to do you
have<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.579> sub<00:03:37.849> computer<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.720> displays

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
have the sub computer it displays

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.259 
have the sub computer it displays
everything<00:03:39.980> that<00:03:40.099> happens<00:03:40.489> like<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:40.940> checked

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
everything that happens like I checked

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:41.860 
everything that happens like I checked

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
my balance

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.210 
my balance
I<00:03:41.959> will<00:03:42.230> true<00:03:44.319> 504<00:03:45.319> myself<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.889> can<00:03:46.099> also

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
I will true 504 myself I can also

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.240 
I will true 504 myself I can also
transfer<00:03:47.049> but<00:03:48.049> you<00:03:48.290> can<00:03:48.440> find<00:03:48.680> out<00:03:48.829> how<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.010> do

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
transfer but you can find out how to do

that<00:03:50.319> this<00:03:51.319> tassel<00:03:51.889> is<00:03:52.040> what<00:03:52.220> sends<00:03:53.030> out<00:03:53.239> gold

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
that this tassel is what sends out gold

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.559 
that this tassel is what sends out gold
ingots<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.799> just<00:03:55.400> connect<00:03:55.849> the<00:03:55.970> dirt<00:03:56.150> with<00:03:56.359> some

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
ingots I just connect the dirt with some

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.180 
ingots I just connect the dirt with some
water

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
water

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.550 
water
send<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.310> out<00:03:59.680> now<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.940> uses<00:04:02.329> the<00:04:03.289> sava

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
send it out now it uses the sava

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.909 
send it out now it uses the sava
computer<00:04:04.190> itself<00:04:04.729> here<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.440> think<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.560> uses

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
computer itself here I think it uses

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.650 
computer itself here I think it uses
three<00:04:07.340> different<00:04:07.370> programs

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
three different programs

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.560 
three different programs
and<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:09.770> client<00:04:10.250> computer<00:04:10.400> here<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.270> think

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
and the client computer here I think

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.160 
and the client computer here I think
that<00:04:11.900> uses<00:04:12.320> two<00:04:12.560> as<00:04:12.710> well<00:04:13.750> this<00:04:14.750> is<00:04:14.810> pretty

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
that uses two as well this is pretty

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.640 
that uses two as well this is pretty
cool<00:04:15.700> it's<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:17.330> little<00:04:17.780> hard<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.080> set<00:04:18.290> up

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
cool it's a little hard to set up

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.870 
cool it's a little hard to set up
I<00:04:18.760> heard<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:21.190> creator<00:04:22.190> of<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:22.610> program

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
I heard the the creator of this program

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.390 
I heard the the creator of this program
will<00:04:23.510> make<00:04:23.660> something<00:04:24.080> make<00:04:24.980> a<00:04:25.010> single

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
will make something make a single

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.930 
will make something make a single
program<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.360> make<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.690> all<00:04:27.110> a<00:04:27.170> lot<00:04:27.470> easier<00:04:27.940> I'm

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
program to make it all a lot easier I'm

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.550 
program to make it all a lot easier I'm
not<00:04:29.150> really<00:04:29.300> sure<00:04:29.540> how<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.750> code<00:04:30.020> this<00:04:30.320> stuff

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
not really sure how to code this stuff

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.630 
not really sure how to code this stuff
but<00:04:30.940> hope<00:04:31.940> he<00:04:32.060> does<00:04:32.710> so<00:04:33.710> yeah<00:04:33.920> you<00:04:34.400> can<00:04:34.490> also

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
but hope he does so yeah you can also

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.520 
but hope he does so yeah you can also
transact<00:04:35.240> without<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.630> key<00:04:35.780> card<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.200> can<00:04:36.260> just

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
transact without the key card I can just

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.810 
transact without the key card I can just
type<00:04:36.800> my<00:04:36.980> account<00:04:37.280> number

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
type my account number

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.020 
type my account number
not<00:04:38.660> really<00:04:39.770> that's<00:04:40.760> what<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.000> says<00:04:41.470> again<00:04:42.470> I

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
not really that's what it says again I

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.020 
not really that's what it says again I
