00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.910
 to 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.480
 the first movement that I propose is 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.860
 an exit from behind triangulating by 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.350
 parts of santiago futsal 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.950
 I start commenting on a series of photos 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.570
 so you can appreciate the movement better 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.490
 the two intent attackers do not 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.760
 appears among them but recovers 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.890
 ball the defender of santiago futsal 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.870
 this yields to the goalkeeper and the three 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.970
 players of santiago regress 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.220
 forming a small triangle between 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.989
 they inside the triangle is 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.510
 an inter player 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.790
 the goalie knows his closest companion 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.190
 we have a defender in no man's land and 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.010
 we continue with the triangle when the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.079
 player of santiago receives the ball not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.230
 changes nothing so alone that the player 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.600
 the second line is closer to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.550
 triangle the attacker with the ball is 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.470
 it happens to the companion more stuck to band in 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.110
 this moment the defender of the second 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.409
 line arrives late to press remaining 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.780
 a free attacker who is the one who receives 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.819
 If you look at any given time of 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.460
 movement the three defenders of the inter 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.250
 they are totally glued to the band and 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.020
 they leave a lot of free space without covering 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.729
 they do not close pass lines either 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.740
 the attacker goes up with the ball by the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.509
 center what is worth it 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.060
 to mention is the good withdrawal that makes 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.909
 the defender of the inter the attacker with 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.649
 ball just made a mistake and that 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.979
 throw door when it should have happened 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.270
 his partner to face the goalkeeper 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.079
 we observe the complete movement to 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.079
 reduced speed 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.060
 let's see the technical gesture of David Pazos 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.360
 it's a dribble with the interiors of both 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.360
 feet 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.790
 I hope the video was of your 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.790
 I thank you very much
