style<00:01:42.630> life<00:01:42.899> counter<00:01:43.259> it's<00:01:43.679> kind<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:43.920> cool

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
style life counter it's kind of cool

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.610

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.640 

I'm<00:01:52.620> guessing<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.430> same<00:01:53.790> Matt<00:01:54.030> put

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
I'm guessing this is the same Matt put

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.130 
I'm guessing this is the same Matt put
the<00:01:55.650> pasta<00:01:55.860> oh<00:01:56.450> that's<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.780> back<00:01:57.930> right

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the pasta oh that's on the back right

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.710 
the pasta oh that's on the back right
now<00:01:59.150> so<00:02:00.150> here's<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.630> front<00:02:01.160> double<00:02:02.690> now<00:02:03.690> here

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
now so here's the front double now here

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.260 
now so here's the front double now here
is<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.140> back<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:05.100> guess<00:02:05.880> they're<00:02:06.090> going<00:02:06.210> to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
is the back I guess they're going to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.880 
is the back I guess they're going to
package<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.690> same<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:07.350> both<00:02:07.590> trial

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
package the same one with both trial

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.220 
package the same one with both trial
deck<00:02:08.100> since<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.580> covers<00:02:08.910> both<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.360> them<00:02:09.480> maybe

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
deck since it covers both of them maybe

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.830 
deck since it covers both of them maybe
