this one so it's back on top now when

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.460 
this one so it's back on top now when
you<00:03:54.030> divide<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.480> eight<00:03:54.750> keep<00:03:55.110> this<00:03:55.260> one<00:03:55.440> on

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
you divide it to eight keep this one on

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.840 
you divide it to eight keep this one on
top<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:57.300> remember<00:03:58.260> which<00:03:58.620> pile<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.190> is<00:04:01.850> all

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
top and remember which pile it is all

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.120 
top and remember which pile it is all
right<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.300> it's<00:04:03.450> here<00:04:03.720> right<00:04:03.780> right<00:04:04.260> there

let's take them out so the card still on
the<00:04:26.370> top<00:04:26.550> now<00:04:27.450> when<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:27.720> divide<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:28.230> four<00:04:28.530> it's

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
the top now when you divide to four it's

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.890 
the top now when you divide to four it's
gonna<00:04:29.400> be<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:30.660> bottom<00:04:30.900> one<00:04:31.290> of<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:33.600> first

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
gonna be the bottom one of the first

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.890 
gonna be the bottom one of the first
four<00:04:34.830> pile<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.820> mean<00:04:36.030> it's<00:04:36.810> right<00:04:36.990> here<00:04:38.900> now

top<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.230> second<00:05:01.560> poly<00:05:01.710> made<00:05:02.040> so<00:05:02.760> memorize

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
top of the second poly made so memorize

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.820 
top of the second poly made so memorize
that<00:05:03.900> if<00:05:04.110> they<00:05:04.230> choose<00:05:04.410> that<00:05:04.440> one<00:05:04.770> take<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.130> out

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
that if they choose that one take it out

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.920 
that if they choose that one take it out
and<00:05:07.830> last<00:05:08.490> but<00:05:08.760> not<00:05:08.880> least<00:05:09.120> it's<00:05:09.419> right<00:05:09.600> here

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
and last but not least it's right here

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.840 
and last but not least it's right here
they<00:05:10.410> choose<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.570> it's<00:05:12.570> right<00:05:12.720> there<00:05:12.930> so

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
they choose it and it's right there so

they choose it and it's right there so
it's<00:05:14.850> simple<00:05:15.270> trick<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:16.470> can<00:05:16.620> be<00:05:16.740> done

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
it's simple trick and it can be done

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.950 
it's simple trick and it can be done
anywhere<00:05:17.610> and<00:05:20.000> yeah<00:05:21.000> it's<00:05:21.180> it's<00:05:21.510> really<00:05:21.810> easy

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
anywhere and yeah it's it's really easy

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.860 
anywhere and yeah it's it's really easy
to<00:05:22.200> do<00:05:22.350> and<00:05:22.700> it'll<00:05:23.700> only<00:05:23.850> take<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.660> little
