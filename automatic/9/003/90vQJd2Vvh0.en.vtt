00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.420 
all right guys let's do this one more
time<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:02.490> was<00:00:03.120> watching<00:00:03.470> statics<00:00:04.470> most<00:00:04.980> recent

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
time I was watching statics most recent

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.639 
time I was watching statics most recent
black<00:00:05.609> aperture<00:00:06.089> world<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.319> guess<00:00:07.440> you

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
black aperture world to I guess you

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.310 
black aperture world to I guess you
could<00:00:07.799> call<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.389> he<00:00:09.389> kind<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.719> issued<00:00:10.139> a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
could call it and he kind of issued a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.509 
could call it and he kind of issued a
bit<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:11.000> a<00:00:12.019> challenge<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.259> guess<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.740> create<00:00:14.280> a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
bit of a challenge I guess to create a

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.599 
bit of a challenge I guess to create a
theme<00:00:15.000> for<00:00:15.030> black<00:00:15.389> aperture<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.220> I<00:00:17.220> consider

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
theme for black aperture and I consider

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.849 
theme for black aperture and I consider
myself<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.119> bit<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.390> musician<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.230> thought

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
myself a bit of a musician so I thought

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.759 
myself a bit of a musician so I thought
they'd<00:00:20.039> give<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.310> go<00:00:21.439> however<00:00:22.439> I'd<00:00:22.560> never

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
they'd give it a go however I'd never

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.550 
they'd give it a go however I'd never
really<00:00:23.010> worked<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.060> note<00:00:24.539> blocks<00:00:24.869> before

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
really worked with note blocks before

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.939 
really worked with note blocks before
any<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.660> so<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:28.050> kind<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.349> took<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:28.920> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
any of this so I kind of took it on as a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.189 
any of this so I kind of took it on as a
bit<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> personal<00:00:30.029> challenge<00:00:30.210> because<00:00:30.810> I
