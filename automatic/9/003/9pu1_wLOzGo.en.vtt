00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:05.040
 Dear Paulo, speaking another video that follows can warn you 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 and this time bringing a very special guest 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:15.880
 a lot with that 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.779
 this allied city to minister in the capital 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.779
 the visit of my idol 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.970
 this city if there is something absolutely characteristic 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.359
 thing that the patient the trademark 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.439
 in these places it is precisely 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.530
 the noise it produces ceaselessly 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.240
 who spend this month for the service 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.520
 and why they bring 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.460
 this noise theme 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 do not think a little about a city like são paulo 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.340
 what is decision noise 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.149
 it's not that trace 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.400
 of unceasing activity 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.859
 in their millions of people who are there touching their life 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.950
 that making your own whole world and that 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.280
 causes noise each of them has an acrimat story and the woman behind 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 that airplane 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.750
 if we search, if we go after 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.380
 each of these 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.370
 activity is adopted 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.720
 From São Paulo 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.960
 some cities that will be historical that will change the world if someone 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.860
 taking care of your own life 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.620
 it took a puff to blow our said world here 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.340
 and I want the history association 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.410
 I say that all points are the center of Sao Paulo and have been surpassing the points 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.640
 Unfortunately, I will not be able to participate. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.659
 who will have represented and verified the case but after a very 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.500
 happy' 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.290
 on the same day the companion of confinement 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.700
 one more thing that will reward those who are not interested 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.729
 time to think about this subject has been discussed since then. 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.479
 is the following r because in a way simply because today 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.499
 each one has his car 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:59.340
 possible market already by plane each one can all said the prison itself 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.110
 I want you democratized in a certain way a series of tools 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.640
 technological 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.380
 because people who like their own worlds I think this from a 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.639
 certain way 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.709
 we are doing 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:12.980
 here the announcement 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.889
 We did not conclude at a rally in the city. 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.840
 I'm going to the whole world that does not have a bit more role of builder 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.689
 in this world 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.489
 What have we been doing for some time now? 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.659
 and if we stop to think 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.099
 reminds me much more of the issue of the past lego took that which due to 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.879
 persistent in case of a similar thing in my condition will elect 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.549
 new he war 7 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.409
 another novelty here 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.409
 but what is the grace of enem rudder case actually 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.629
 I also want two breakpoints to say 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.399
 the collection to be excellent and not be easily connected six months of 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.679
 pregnancy 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:58.139
 is some how everyone had some including some with stories 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.819
 he was hit in the way whatever you want it always amused me to 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.369
 be careful in my 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:08.559
 in childhood and even toyed with talking in my teens outside 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.729
 at the time and 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:12.019
 I'm so sorry 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.789
 maybe 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:18.109
 is one of the great thanks we said work is not from the points was 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.579
 just this 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.509
 for us we are not more topics like bidding I do not know about you 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.749
 we did not pass anymore 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:29.339
 those cool architects 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:35.049
 who built cathedrals is not that they built is by works it is hard to 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.939
 tower zepherin leasing awesome 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.549
 translating 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:41.949
 What have we done now? 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.519
 is to practice a mixture of the time 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.329
 with a work of urbanists at the time we define it looks like this 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.749
 shadow here 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:53.529
 can build more inside their has to be thus the streets having ceased 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.239
 you have to have a minimum spacing 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.089
 day of those 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:59.759
 It seems that you are creating 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.759
 if you have a role as builder as I have too 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:08.179
 he is actually creating the passers-by that people build their 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:11.539
 own fears 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.629
 and she's very curious, she's thinking about it because 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.720
 when we hear many of the criticisms that we see today other points 0 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.840
 souls and content of more than two weeks 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.139
 two weeks ago the opinion of this one more I think it is very similar maybe 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.729
 with the same tolerance as some people 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.539
 It's the one with little else. 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.849
 intolerant just a little more tired or 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.330
 a little less passionate than of what than we 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
 has in relation to the big cities the base is a lot of rush 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.940
 It's too much noise you do not know I felt too much 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:48.650
 it's the queue 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.650
 sooner than 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.559
 How are you in São Paulo? 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:58.559
 I have observed over five centuries 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.480
 I'll cut a lot of people. 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.750
 they do not stop growing 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.090
 and they do not stop transforming what we consider 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.689
 it is error the human being 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.689
 they do not stop redefining our pavement heals 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.930
 city ​​are mega machines where we can explore our potential is people 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.949
 can expand we can exchange experiences on a scale 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.370
 imaginable hundreds of years ago 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.289
 and I think we're doing here on the faces of job builders 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:36.129
 - the builders manage tic but somehow we are putting here 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.080
 reach of all positions the tools use the local 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.580
 it's the cement 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.389
 at that time the electrical cables in the protocols all 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:46.469
 the apis 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:50.089
 what they are doing that is just allowing people to create their own 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:51.030
 own cities 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.389
 It gets more interesting from this whole story. 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.139
 ft even that took seven games without winning and concrete concrete be concrete 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:01.949
 The city is never the same 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:04.460
 for example what they call city 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.930
 são paulo is this here the current level of the regime 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.659
 she has how to go around the world 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.990
 many people are responsible for a large part of the race 

00:06:13.989 --> 00:06:16.339
 of today this metaphor 

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:19.169
 maximum in our work 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.240
 while the emerging or may be building their place let's go to them 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.889
 beijing lakes in nigeria 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.999
 then the concept itself 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:32.169
 what the world people are going to create is up to them 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:33.559
 chains 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:34.569
 the manager 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:36.430
 allowing today 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.270
 humiliate 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.270
 a local seasoning the track allowing today 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.990
 even in an era of absolute globalization, the gestapo 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.190
 tools today was that people create their world in their image and 

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.980
 resemblance 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.550
 similar to its authors 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.650
 like its history in the likeness of its affections 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.030
 so that's what I hope this may have been the shorter one a little bit 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.940
 but it was steel 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.119
 twenty five doors 

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:08.699
 I have it will serve the purpose of improvements nothing lighter of points was 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:12.609
 little touches already here I found in the poet's lecture of points 

00:07:12.609 --> 00:07:15.669
 0 I can speak and put my opinion 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.729
 by a lot of people 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:18.240
 big hug
