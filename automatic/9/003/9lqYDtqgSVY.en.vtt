00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
house breeding of aquarium plants

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.800
Hello everyone

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.840
I would like to share with you my way to store plants,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.080
I do not know about that did you had such a situation too,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.580
, sometimes when you want to change something in your aquarium,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.540
some species 
doesnt fit there anymore,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.920
or began to fall because of the inappropriate condition of a tank,

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:24.665
as we know plants are not cheap,

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:29.225
and begin with fully planted tank is very expensive.

00:00:31.353 --> 00:00:34.373
I keep plants in a kind of small  greenhouses.

00:00:34.644 --> 00:00:37.564
. For tall plants I use plastic bottles

00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:40.604
bottles and for low plants plastic boxes

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:46.887
Such boxes you can get  in a craft store or supermarket

00:00:46.887 --> 00:00:48.881
when buying a cake on weight,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.540
if we will ask gently,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.840
a lady should  give us such a container what we want.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.120
At the bottom of the container pour a little garden soil

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:05.165
and cover it with sand,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.280
you can also use gravel,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.780
if you wont use it after flooding you can make a swamp.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.760
After puting it all in pour  water

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:19.127
Thus prepared, the container is ready for planting crops .

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.966
All containers keep on the windowsill

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.950
the biggest advantage of such plantation is that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100
you need only watch on water level

00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:30.163
so it wont evaporate

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:32.919
The plants grow themselves

00:01:33.047 --> 00:01:35.407
you doesnt need to be worry about it

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:38.933
even on a dimly lit windowsill

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.760
The culture is so called emergent

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.180
on it there is a lot of myths that such plants

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.160
are not suitable for aquariums because after planting melt

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.260
of course there is some truth in this

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.020
because the plant must switch from the emergent culture

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.040
during this process often loses all the leaves

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.700
but if the conditions in aquarium are right plant will grow and survive without a problem

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:24.905
