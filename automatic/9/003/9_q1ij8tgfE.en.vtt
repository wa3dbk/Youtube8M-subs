 all viewers of my channel huge hello 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.640
 I am often asked how I am 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.830
 I look after hair and more specifically 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.570
 do i use any kind 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 Oil mask can be with what that is 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.049
 hair care secrets so they 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.269
 were beautiful and healthy and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.220
 silky and in this video i will share with 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.380
 by your most beloved ones 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.510
 natural masks and even visually 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.369
 I'll show you how I do it so if you 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.769
 interesting then stay with me i wish 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.810
 Enjoy your viewing, but I'll start 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.609
 Perhaps with the fact that I would say that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.510
 burdock oil I used to very often 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.190
 enjoyed but now past the length of hair 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.960
 satisfied even more than him so I 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.510
 put off a long box but still have 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.430
 I personally don't know my arsenal like 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.920
 you from burdock oil near the roots 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.559
 there is such a fluff but probably because 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.059
 the fact that the little hairs start 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.280
 grow under burdock oil 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.079
 There were such antennas down and me 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.610
 honestly don't like it and 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.370
 this moment is not like me 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.020
 I want better hair just 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.789
 glittered maybe they were be a little 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.590
 slick but this fluff me 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.010
 totally dislike me now not 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.899
 need 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.570
 so at the moment I'm not 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.280
 I use my main assistant leave 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.590
 by the hair at the moment is 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.900
 I already told coconut oil 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.159
 in one of the videos about hair care about 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.920
 that we donâ€™t really like me 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.360
 I ordered it through the site two banks already 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.830
 almost completely they me 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.710
 he is used by me 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.360
 completely begins to smell as washed away to 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.710
 what is the effect of it in general just 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.540
 super important with him just not 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.850
 go too far because otherwise there will be 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.680
 the opposite effect and hair will be dull 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.170
 and glued class oil i use 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.119
 as when mixed with any other 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 oils and individually that is 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.020
 it works equally well also 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.210
 I like and love very much 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.009
 olive oil in general in all its 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.790
 manifestations in all in interpretations 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.680
 be it facial and hair care 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.649
 body perfect moisturizer on 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.490
 hair acts just amazing 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.040
 after his hair becomes 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.200
 silky so soft just like 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.530
 babies but i think girls who 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.400
 hair prone to such a fluffiness yes 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.290
 not so naughty olive 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.300
 if it suits me because after it 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.920
 there is such an effect that is it 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.140
 softens like hair and they 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.760
 become softer and fluffy so 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.230
 what I think girls who are not 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.510
 need to have that already hair 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.760
 do not know how to electrify them and how with 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.530
 to cope with this oil is not suitable but 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.660
 but nourishes well and moisturizes you 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.580
 my olive oil is valid 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.110
 hair is very moist 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.210
 I often write comments 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.340
 what is Katya how to make hair 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.750
 seemed so moist and it's on 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.970
 in fact after olive oil 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.400
 I also use olive oil as 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.320
 yourself but better act on 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.240
 when mixed with vitamins a and type 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.570
 whom I also told they fit 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.970
 for face for general for everything if there 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.010
 some dry areas on the body and on 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.650
 hair also acts just awesome 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.930
 I use them both separately and when 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.060
 offset and in particular with olive 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.880
 butter they act just perfect about 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.700
 that vita appears so very beautiful 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.220
 shine that is, hair is very straight 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.680
 the sun and the feeling such as if 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.810
 you just after the salon is very useful it 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.540
 put on the tips but for the tips 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.980
 I have which oil 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.410
 copes wonderfully with its 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.480
 task she lets her hair do not split 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.120
 and actually yes I noticed that after 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.190
 his hair ends are much better and there is 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.620
 they have overdried this castor oil 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.870
 to help you and my last favorite 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.239
 means of care is a decoction of chamomile 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.330
 daisy for me is generally universal and 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.310
 and both saw and wash and freeze 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.709
 in cubes to wipe in the morning 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.140
 face also i really like to rinse 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.950
 this decoction hair that gives us a daisy 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.600
 she strengthens hair very well 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.790
 soothe the scalp especially if 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.320
 she's dry let's say I have very 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.510
 delicate scalp daisy 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.760
 soothes takes off any 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.890
 irritation and flaking on my skin 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.860
 the miss I use after any 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.230
 oils that is straight rinse hair and 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.780
 in general, then do not wash off just shook 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.150
 in a towel and everything but how can alla 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.660
 gurochka add that blondes are not 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.840
 Especially beautiful 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.840
 there is a daisy will give your hair some such 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.300
 a golden hue so bear so 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.310
 girls who are beautiful and do not want 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.959
 so that it is their white hair 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.790
 blond loh she appeared some 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.709
 yellowness is of course daisy 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.690
 contraindicated I will not say that it is straight 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.520
 super will give some color but even by 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.440
 my hair, I see that golden hue 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.690
 became more so prevail on my 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.310
 hair theory ended so 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.620
 let's get down to practice now I 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.390
 clearly show you how I mix like me 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.420
 I do all the masks as I put 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.920
 and so on so stay with me 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.260
 so for today's mask I will 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:47.030
 use vitamins aevit and olive 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:50.150
 oil first cold pressed me 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.310
 need 1 capsule evita just us 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.440
 here one stayed and literally two 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.810
 tablespoons of olive oil to me this 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.660
 quite enough for the roots and the entire length 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.760
 Hair I also need this 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.010
 Here is a plastic bag instead of food 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.320
 film I'll cut it now sideways and 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.120
 I will fix it later on my head and also 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.770
 I will need a hat like this 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.630
 you can use a towel but I 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.690
 I use exactly the cap because it 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.520
 convenient in principle the oil does not blot and 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.700
 and because my hair will be covered 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:23.930
 cellophane package literally pour 2 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:29.750
 tablespoons butter further pierce 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.970
 Avito vitamin and squeeze in olive 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.070
 oil and so the first thing i do is 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.050
 well felt hair to oil 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.330
 evenly distributed from the roots to 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.970
 very tips 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.919
 then I take the mixture well and stir 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.630
 I will use my fingers 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.690
 exclusively with their own hands 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.780
 fingers and I will put first on 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.150
 roots such massage movements i 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.110
 then just from the roots with the scales all over 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.600
 the length of the oil and so will be much better and 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.880
 uniform just extra 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.850
 stimulates the scalp accordingly 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.840
 blood rushes stimulated growth 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.360
 onions 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.390
 after i put well on 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.139
 the roots 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:17.439
 i will take a comb 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.719
 and comb my hair already some 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:24.310
 the amount of oil is transferred to the main 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:27.610
 hair length and then i will definitely 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:31.620
 add another full length because 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.620
 this is not enough 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:41.529
 such movements as crab 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:44.469
 combing special attention pay 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:46.659
 tips in all you need to know the measure 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:48.550
 so I hurt something, don't be so zealous 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:51.310
 more that my hair is in pretty good 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.620
 condition so the effect will be achieved 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.539
 faster and better hair will be very 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.699
 well absorb oil will not perry 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.909
 and because of this will not be saturated 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:03.430
 the opposite results will be only a plus 

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:05.789
 after i applied oil i 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:12.729
 spinning in lichku 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:21.219
 do flagellum straight higher on 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:25.300
 I attach the white gum to the crown 

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:29.979
 cellophane package now will be very 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:32.460
 funny i will be there thomas i understand that 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:36.039
 it looks very funny 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:38.529
 but everything is clear so it would not 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:40.719
 passes heat stored and after that 

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:44.169
 putting on any hat because the principle 

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:50.919
 the hair is protected and nothing on the cap 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:52.810
 will stay and so i walk two hours on this 

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:56.550
 I thank you all for having this video 

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.550
 main to new meetings bye bye
