00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
long said this is a very very the rather

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.810 
long said this is a very very the rather
old<00:00:51.660> old<00:00:52.260> model<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.860> think<00:00:54.379> yeah<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.820> least

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
old old model I think yeah it is least

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.250 
old old model I think yeah it is least
one<00:00:57.329> year<00:00:57.539> old<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:57.960> also<00:00:59.180> and<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
one year old was also and it is a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.349 
one year old was also and it is a
Cromwell<00:01:01.649> which<00:01:02.219> was<00:01:02.399> which<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.640> big<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.090> think

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
Cromwell which was which is big I think

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.119 
Cromwell which was which is big I think
that's<00:01:03.629> promoter<00:01:03.960> tank<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> strongly

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
that's promoter tank that I strongly

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.990 
that's promoter tank that I strongly
with<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.090> most<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.840> all<00:01:07.350> tanks<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
with the most of all tanks I have I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000 
with the most of all tanks I have I
think<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.810> pencil<00:01:10.140> three<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> real<00:01:10.799> help

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
think the pencil three was a real help

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.280 
think the pencil three was a real help
to<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.549> well<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.060> otherwise<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.510> can't<00:01:12.960> say

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
to do as well but otherwise I can't say

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.830 
to do as well but otherwise I can't say
that<00:01:13.530> there's<00:01:13.799> any<00:01:14.040> tank<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.390> I've<00:01:15.540> been<00:01:15.689> so

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
that there's any tank that I've been so

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.999 
that there's any tank that I've been so
afraid<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.350> make<00:01:17.150> no<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.180> don't<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:18.659> this

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
afraid to make no I don't think this

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
afraid to make no I don't think this
yeah<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.150> could<00:01:21.659> not<00:01:21.840> get

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
post simple as a hook I had one this

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.539 
post simple as a hook I had one this
specific<00:04:01.700> model<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:02.000> made<00:04:03.040> was<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.069> bit<00:04:04.220> of<00:04:04.310> fun

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
specific model I made was a bit of fun

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.930 
specific model I made was a bit of fun
so<00:04:04.579> I'm<00:04:05.000> just<00:04:05.180> definitely<00:04:05.810> do<00:04:06.319> that<00:04:06.940> other

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
so I'm just definitely do that other

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.490 
so I'm just definitely do that other
side<00:04:08.209> I'm<00:04:08.569> not<00:04:08.660> just<00:04:08.840> saying<00:04:09.049> just<00:04:09.260> different

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
side I'm not just saying just different

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.800 
side I'm not just saying just different
gears<00:04:10.100> and<00:04:10.370> where<00:04:10.459> this<00:04:10.639> box<00:04:11.239> here<00:04:11.540> believe

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
gears and where this box here believe

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.520 
gears and where this box here believe
most<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:12.079> critical<00:04:12.410> box<00:04:12.620> something

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.490 

from<00:04:16.220> this<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:17.239> can<00:04:17.420> see<00:04:17.690> it<00:04:18.079> while<00:04:18.230> Isis

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
from this you can see it while Isis

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.240 
from this you can see it while Isis
always<00:04:18.769> falls<00:04:19.040> 360<00:04:19.730> degrees<00:04:20.739> no<00:04:21.739> it<00:04:21.920> doesn't

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
always falls 360 degrees no it doesn't

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.710 
always falls 360 degrees no it doesn't
because<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.550> starts<00:04:22.820> in<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.060> way<00:04:24.190> otherwise

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
because that starts in the way otherwise

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.940 
because that starts in the way otherwise
shoveled<00:04:26.720> turned<00:04:27.710> 360<00:04:28.220> degrees

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.420 

I<00:04:30.980> think<00:04:31.460> this<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:31.730> supposed<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:32.060> be<00:04:32.120> here

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.990 

this<00:04:37.430> turns<00:04:37.850> up<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.540> down<00:04:39.490> it's<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.610> bit<00:04:40.760> tricky

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
this turns up and down it's a bit tricky

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.880 
this turns up and down it's a bit tricky
though<00:04:41.150> because<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.510> can't<00:04:41.720> really<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:42.560> just

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
though because I can't really you just

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.110 
though because I can't really you just
deliver<00:04:43.520> this<00:04:43.700> or<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.510> can<00:04:45.940> because<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:47.090> don't

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
small scale works out pretty nicely now

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.219 
small scale works out pretty nicely now
the<00:07:03.970> one<00:07:04.210> thing<00:07:04.419> that<00:07:04.690> wouldn't<00:07:04.900> be<00:07:04.990> on<00:07:05.080> this

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:05.229 
the one thing that wouldn't be on this

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:06.570 
the one thing that wouldn't be on this
scale<00:07:05.440> I<00:07:05.470> think<00:07:05.740> you<00:07:05.830> really<00:07:05.979> should<00:07:06.340> be<00:07:06.550> able

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
scale I think you really should be able

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.170 
scale I think you really should be able
to<00:07:06.760> get<00:07:06.970> all<00:07:07.210> the<00:07:07.450> details<00:07:07.600> in<00:07:07.930> here<00:07:09.180> you

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
to get all the details in here you

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.240 
to get all the details in here you
thought<00:07:10.419> I'd<00:07:10.570> say<00:07:10.750> that<00:07:10.900> this<00:07:11.290> might<00:07:11.710> be<00:07:11.740> a<00:07:11.950> bit

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
thought I'd say that this might be a bit

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.879 
thought I'd say that this might be a bit
big<00:07:12.490> and<00:07:12.790> I<00:07:13.570> can<00:07:13.900> send<00:07:14.260> some<00:07:14.470> people<00:07:14.590> think

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889 
big and I can send some people think

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:17.840 
big and I can send some people think
this<00:07:15.070> is<00:07:15.220> a<00:07:15.310> bit<00:07:15.550> big<00:07:16.139> example<00:07:17.139> compared<00:07:17.530> to

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850 
this is a bit big example compared to

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:24.090 
this is a bit big example compared to
three<00:07:21.330> you<00:07:22.330> can<00:07:22.510> see<00:07:22.660> that<00:07:22.900> it<00:07:23.139> is<00:07:23.350> rather

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 
three you can see that it is rather

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.050 
three you can see that it is rather
large<00:07:25.289> this<00:07:26.289> but<00:07:26.650> not<00:07:27.160> too<00:07:27.550> I<00:07:27.580> don't<00:07:27.910> think

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.060 
large this but not too I don't think

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.159 
large this but not too I don't think
it's<00:07:28.210> too<00:07:28.479> bad<00:07:28.690> really

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:29.169 
it's too bad really

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:31.620 
it's too bad really
