yeah<00:06:48.830> I<00:06:48.860> think<00:06:48.980> first<00:06:49.430> and<00:06:49.550> foremost<00:06:49.640> that's

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
yeah I think first and foremost that's

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.170 
yeah I think first and foremost that's
why<00:06:51.830> Ramos<00:06:52.250> when<00:06:52.370> we<00:06:52.460> first<00:06:52.670> came<00:06:52.820> into<00:06:53.000> the

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
why Ramos when we first came into the

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.770 
why Ramos when we first came into the
into<00:06:53.570> the<00:06:53.690> division<00:06:55.210> we've<00:06:56.210> give<00:06:56.360> ourselves<00:06:56.480> a

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
into the division we've give ourselves a

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.160 
into the division we've give ourselves a
good<00:06:56.900> start<00:06:57.200> so<00:06:57.580> you<00:06:58.580> know<00:06:58.840> well<00:06:59.840> wait<00:06:59.990> till<00:07:00.110> we

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.170 
good start so you know well wait till we

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.120 
good start so you know well wait till we
get<00:07:00.260> to<00:07:00.320> the<00:07:00.440> points<00:07:00.710> tell<00:07:00.830> you<00:07:00.890> that<00:07:00.980> we<00:07:01.100> think

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
get to the points tell you that we think

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.790 
get to the points tell you that we think
that's<00:07:01.610> the<00:07:01.700> right<00:07:02.390> amounts<00:07:03.320> it<00:07:03.470> would<00:07:03.680> be

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
that's the right amounts it would be

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.920 
that's the right amounts it would be
safely<00:07:04.100> primitive<00:07:04.520> then<00:07:04.640> we<00:07:05.090> maybe<00:07:05.270> reassess

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
safely primitive then we maybe reassess

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.290 
safely primitive then we maybe reassess
our<00:07:06.080> situation<00:07:06.680> and<00:07:06.860> we<00:07:07.160> assess<00:07:07.460> the<00:07:07.670> season

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
our situation and we assess the season

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.960 
our situation and we assess the season
what<00:07:08.900> you<00:07:09.050> know<00:07:09.140> coming<00:07:09.530> into<00:07:09.680> season<00:07:09.970> and

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:10.970 
what you know coming into season and

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.740 
what you know coming into season and
I'll<00:07:11.090> think<00:07:11.330> if<00:07:11.390> we<00:07:11.480> still<00:07:11.630> in<00:07:11.690> the

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
I'll think if we still in the

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.330 
I'll think if we still in the
Premiership<00:07:12.020> everyone's<00:07:12.500> happy<00:07:12.770> around

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340
