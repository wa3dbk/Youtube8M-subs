00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.259

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.820
 level there suddenly air devices with 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.070
 reading in string and tape 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.090
 for now it's okay but good 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.739
 I'll have to buy myself a year 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.320
 so at the end of me I never 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.860
 to fall a youngster is really cared 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.530
 he broke 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.840
 just at that level the mud he got 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.660
 broken yesterday when I wanted to go on the 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.300

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.930
 precisely and he broke up there 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.559
 I repair them and so here I have the 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:04.600
 balls anyway it makes me a little 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.460
 shit but hey it's like that's the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.960
 video call to ccit yes the white thing 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.790
 and toothpicks and all that debate 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.020
 it's normal and the string is that 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.790
 I repaired my helmet 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.220
 the story that I can still you 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.770
 turn videos so that's the era the 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.130
 video topics this is the module it 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.010
 manage that I had presented the week 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.979
 by last week a month ago and 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.909
 he was not finished at once 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.460
 now I finish them and he is 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.229
 really more whose hand must be 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.080
 finished taking the lead but suddenly I 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.500
 directly copy it like that it will be 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.220
 ready when I make a video 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:45.570
 so the global manach this I'm just going 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:52.030
 look for the site next 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:55.240
 here you find it on this site I 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.960
 will you master here nickel so we 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.479
 the one site 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.770
 it's just the least masters 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.990
 it's his site to him I would put links 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.640
 in the description so where you 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.340
 will be able to read a little bit of everything 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.360
 pass all that otherwise the module is here 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.129
 download the final version here 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.420
 you download the final version there 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.010
 is finished he already has 1600 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.290
 downloading 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.659
 so we'll go I'll introduce it to you 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.170
 in his last form of blow the 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.170
 louvre 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.810
 so he will launch 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:32.620
 here it is there nickel so how's that 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.390
 this almanac module works this so there 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.159
 you actually have the almanac for example 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.379
 today you know you are 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.730
 one of them that heavy malick and the 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.140
 additional challenges generated 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.060
 bloor against the type of creatures 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.260
 so there then lula the functionality 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.540
 the innermost for example if you have 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:54.849
 need xp in april hop here you have 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.299
 all xp bonuses will hold monthly 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.090
 April 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.220
 if you want to expire in the month of May where 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.120
 I will have exactly the same and then this 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.590
 that there is new in relation to this 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.329
 time is that the bonuses of Europe by 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.629
 example it's never good drop is like 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.190
 me in April 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.590
 I know I'll be able to go 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.090
 to fool all those days on piou 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.150
 for example April 29 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.659
 but for example more yesterday it was 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.120
 frosts 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.910
 the booty was 100 % and today 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.049
 the 21st in the labyrinth of the minotaur 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.400
 so there it can be nice 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.139
 or so downright you like to drop and to 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.430
 neutral pandala you know that wanted 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.660
 know when will you be able to 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.290
 to go you can go there all 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.730
 just on September 5th etc or if you 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.810
 like drop is just about 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:45.090
 dragoes here you know it will be the 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.199
 November 21st when that's really good 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:51.160
 the same for if you have trades to 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:53.919
 do for example minors here is there 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.260
 all these dates there one per month 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:04:00.699
 apparently know December you'll 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.090
 a coup bonus their april mode this is 

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:05.739
 the 28 miners save 10% of their 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.959
 ingredients when they manufacture 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.299
 objects so that's it really 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.479
 nice 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:16.419
 then for example handyman gains 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:18.549
 experience increased by 50% on 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.079
 do it yourself have a 10% chance of saving 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.760
 ingredients did not wait but I 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.389
 saw I do not sleep that I framed my 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.650
 camera here it is better like 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.320
 so here I think it's really nice 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.290
 and general bonuses had for example 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.690
 in the cities you know the dates 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.250
 in the cities of braga this thing but 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:43.360
 you got good at what date you will save 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:45.460
 15% on foot ghost also amakna as well 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.180
 as and all areas of amakna with the 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:53.740
 savings of ingredients of the year to 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.160
 pandala ocaÃ±a and leap appendices with 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.160
 leap years 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.300
 the experienced guy is increased from 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.979
 50% for all trades so it will be 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.120
 in 2016 next year if you are 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.130

 that you are prepared and you 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.960
 let's tell you to avoid being 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.250
 taken off guard there you will have more than 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.979
 excuse to say ah I did not see

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:54.490
 so here he is also 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:56.139

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:20.160
 turn on that 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.770
