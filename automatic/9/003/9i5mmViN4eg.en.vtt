pattern to come up with deals with

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.819 
pattern to come up with deals with
doubles<00:00:11.080> from<00:00:11.289> the<00:00:11.440> kick<00:00:11.679> in<00:00:11.889> hand<00:00:12.299> and

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:13.829 
doubles from the kick in hand and

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:19.290 
doubles from the kick in hand and
tighten<00:00:14.829> it<00:00:14.889> down<00:00:17.130> pretty<00:00:18.130> cool<00:00:18.429> it's<00:00:19.060> nice

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
tighten it down pretty cool it's nice

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.140 
tighten it down pretty cool it's nice
driving<00:00:19.960> kind<00:00:20.590> of<00:00:20.679> feel<00:00:20.920> to<00:00:20.949> it<00:00:21.189> and<00:00:21.580> it

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
driving kind of feel to it and it

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.640 
driving kind of feel to it and it
doesn't<00:00:22.420> really<00:00:22.509> sound<00:00:22.810> it<00:00:23.080> sounds<00:00:23.259> tricky

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
doesn't really sound it sounds tricky

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.669 
doesn't really sound it sounds tricky
but<00:00:23.949> doesn't<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.990> I'll<00:00:26.080> play<00:00:26.320> it<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:26.589> I'll

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
but doesn't but I'll play it and I'll

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.929 
but doesn't but I'll play it and I'll
show<00:00:26.890> it<00:00:27.009> to<00:00:27.039> you<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:28.240> a<00:00:28.330> lot<00:00:28.449> of<00:00:28.539> fun<00:00:28.689> so

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
show it to you it's a lot of fun so

00:00:29.939 --> 00:01:04.049 
show it to you it's a lot of fun so
there<00:00:30.939> we<00:00:31.089> go<00:00:59.579> alright<00:01:00.579> so<00:01:00.820> basically<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
there we go alright so basically the

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.969 
there we go alright so basically the
basic<00:01:04.449> pattern<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.110> if<00:01:05.320> you<00:01:05.409> take<00:01:05.619> out<00:01:05.770> the

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
basic pattern of it if you take out the

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:15.569 
basic pattern of it if you take out the
doubles<00:01:06.340> from<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.610> kick<00:01:06.790> in<00:01:06.909> hand<00:01:07.150> just<00:01:14.579> so

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
doubles from the kick in hand just so

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:25.560 
doubles from the kick in hand just so
we're<00:01:15.700> like<00:01:15.880> my<00:01:16.090> other<00:01:16.240> one<00:01:24.119> except<00:01:25.119> you<00:01:25.210> plant

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
we're like my other one except you plant

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.819 
we're like my other one except you plant
it<00:01:25.720> all<00:01:25.840> on<00:01:25.960> your<00:01:26.049> right<00:01:26.229> hand<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
it all on your right hand and the

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:35.370 
it all on your right hand and the
backbeats<00:01:27.520> just<00:01:27.759> on<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.930> is<00:01:35.049> one<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.290> those

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
backbeats just on this is one of those

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.780 
backbeats just on this is one of those
beats<00:01:35.649> that<00:01:35.829> are<00:01:35.950> pretty<00:01:36.100> cool<00:01:36.369> even<00:01:36.610> without

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
beats that are pretty cool even without

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.969 
beats that are pretty cool even without
ghosting<00:01:37.450> anything<00:01:37.899> just<00:01:38.140> having<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.799> heavy

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
ghosting anything just having a heavy

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.219 
ghosting anything just having a heavy
thick<00:01:39.280> backbeat<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.450> really<00:01:40.689> pushing<00:01:41.140> the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
thick backbeat and really pushing the

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:48.270 
thick backbeat and really pushing the
kick

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.310 

alright<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:49.760> it's<00:01:50.090> really<00:01:50.330> not<00:01:50.510> hard<00:01:50.570> but<00:01:51.049> I'll

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
alright so it's really not hard but I'll

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:13.809 
alright so it's really not hard but I'll
slow<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.590> down<00:01:51.710> real<00:01:52.100> quick<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:57.500> up<00:02:12.819> as

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
slow it down real quick I up as

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.340 
slow it down real quick I up as
you<00:02:13.940> can<00:02:14.030> see<00:02:14.239> it's<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.720> pretty<00:02:15.020> basic

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
you can see it's just a pretty basic

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.610 
you can see it's just a pretty basic
pattern<00:02:16.360> then<00:02:17.360> when<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.540> put<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.840> kick<00:02:18.080> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
pattern then when you put the kick the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.280 
pattern then when you put the kick the
doubles<00:02:19.070> on<00:02:19.370> doubles<00:02:19.910> which<00:02:20.570> is<00:02:20.690> essentially

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
doubles on doubles which is essentially

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.530 
doubles on doubles which is essentially
a<00:02:21.400> like<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> 9<00:02:22.700> stroke<00:02:23.030> roll<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:25.130> then<00:02:25.730> nine

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
a like a 9 stroke roll and then nine

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.660 
a like a 9 stroke roll and then nine
would<00:02:26.780> be<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.110> backbeat<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.980> that's<00:02:34.519> the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
would be the backbeat so that's the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.660 
would be the backbeat so that's the
beginning<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:35.090> it<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:39.530> that's<00:02:40.400> basically

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
beginning of it so that's basically

00:02:40.670 --> 00:03:04.000 
beginning of it so that's basically
essentially<00:02:41.330> it<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.560> make<00:03:03.560> sure<00:03:03.590> when<00:03:03.950> you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
essentially it and make sure when you

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.180 
essentially it and make sure when you
play<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.600> roll<00:03:05.900> between<00:03:06.110> your<00:03:08.829> with<00:03:09.829> any

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
play like a roll between your with any

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.150 
play like a roll between your with any
anytime

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.180 

make<00:03:14.940> sure<00:03:15.170> your<00:03:16.170> kick<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.830> header<00:03:19.160> make<00:03:20.160> sure

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
make sure your kick and header make sure

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.530 
make sure your kick and header make sure
they're<00:03:20.610> taking<00:03:20.880> up<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.060> right<00:03:21.210> amount<00:03:21.480> of

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
they're taking up the right amount of

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.390 
they're taking up the right amount of
space<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.870> know<00:03:24.560> people<00:03:25.560> tend<00:03:25.770> to<00:03:25.860> do<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.190> it

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
space you know people tend to do that it

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.600 
space you know people tend to do that it
puts<00:03:26.640> too<00:03:26.760> much<00:03:26.850> or<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.540> tribe<00:03:28.410> or<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.490> just

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
puts too much or a tribe or you just

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.080 
puts too much or a tribe or you just
relax<00:03:30.890> let<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:31.980> notes<00:03:32.190> take<00:03:32.460> up<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.910> right

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
relax let the notes take up the right

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.930 
relax let the notes take up the right
amount<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.420> time<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:34.020> they're<00:03:34.770> given<00:03:35.130> being

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
amount of time that they're given being

00:03:35.940 --> 00:04:05.510 
amount of time that they're given being
16<00:03:36.510> thurs<00:04:03.770> that's<00:04:04.770> pretty<00:04:05.100> cool<00:04:05.220> when<00:04:05.340> your

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
16 thurs that's pretty cool when your

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.730 
16 thurs that's pretty cool when your
pad
