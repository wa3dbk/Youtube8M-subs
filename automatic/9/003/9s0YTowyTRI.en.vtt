00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.550
 second place 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:05.600
 why sit 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.690
 worthless 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.789
 it was obvious that that had consequences 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.309
 the animals 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.559
 for me it is the criminal court i hope i am within or to paris the council of state 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:17.680
 but there's more 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.939
 for the project 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.060
 the earthquake in breda in september wants to couple i look at where they come from 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:25.289
 come 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.960
 yet it is not clear how many people work 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.080
 how can you do this in your work 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.550
 this involves a multiple of the traffic outside of victims 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.960
 benefits are welcome 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.300
 done with the final 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.300
 3 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.850
 through the expansion of our tax money 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.710
 washing man 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 why should we not make their mailbox measurable? 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.810
 but I disagree you are not logged in 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.480
 the impact of the basic something like that 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.920
 who has nothing to do with it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.920
 I have it myself 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.100
 then the philips became the expected super spectacle investigation into bennekom 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.710
 more often outside 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.660
 worn and grave who do not see a ticket I see this case 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.230
 with the fictional 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.890
 you are 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.270
 watched on average 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.030
 children of the wife of semi-final 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 we work 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.660
 the assenaar's report is a meeting afternoon game rules a lot 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.660
 smaller than imagined 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.140
 weijers looked after 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
 but we are in it 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.020
 by the only one that I can do 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.330
 thanks to muiden 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.130

 Piet I want my best friend 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.890
