why I'm doing this piece yeah so this

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.090 
why I'm doing this piece yeah so this
device<00:00:43.000> looks<00:00:43.239> pretty<00:00:43.600> simple<00:00:44.050> but<00:00:44.860> it's

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
device looks pretty simple but it's

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.460 
device looks pretty simple but it's
actually<00:00:45.460> very<00:00:45.489> complex<00:00:46.150> and<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.510> result<00:00:46.930> too

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
actually very complex and the result too

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.310 
actually very complex and the result too
many<00:00:47.680> is<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:47.980> magic<00:00:48.910> money<00:00:49.360> machine<00:00:52.140> if<00:00:53.140> you've

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
many is a magic money machine if you've

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.110 
many is a magic money machine if you've

the Student Union couldn't pour beer
faster<00:01:07.750> so<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.650> engineering<00:01:09.340> major<00:01:09.729> put<00:01:10.270> his

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
faster so the engineering major put his

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.590 
faster so the engineering major put his
