00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
to use these keys that might be a little

the<00:00:51.829> battery<00:00:52.390> personally<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:53.540> find<00:00:53.809> this

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
the battery personally I find this

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.380 
the battery personally I find this
design<00:00:54.409> very<00:00:54.710> attractive<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:55.820> great<00:00:56.180> that

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
design very attractive it's great that

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.750 
design very attractive it's great that
the<00:00:56.510> screen<00:00:56.780> has<00:00:56.809> very<00:00:57.290> thin<00:00:57.649> edges<00:00:58.100> around<00:00:58.309> it

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
the screen has very thin edges around it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.049 
the screen has very thin edges around it
so<00:00:59.210> it's<00:00:59.510> not<00:00:59.629> bulky<00:01:00.080> el<00:01:00.769> Bello<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.400> otherwise

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
so it's not bulky el Bello is otherwise

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.620 
so it's not bulky el Bello is otherwise
very<00:01:02.390> similar<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.439> LG<00:01:03.890> g3<00:01:04.100> s<00:01:04.489> but<00:01:05.210> you

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
very similar to the LG g3 s but you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.230 
very similar to the LG g3 s but you
should<00:01:05.840> have<00:01:06.140> in<00:01:06.320> mind<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:06.920> g3s<00:01:07.549> is<00:01:07.820> much

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
should have in mind that g3s is much

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.090 
should have in mind that g3s is much
more<00:01:08.450> advanced<00:01:08.960> has<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.200> better<00:01:09.500> screen<00:01:09.860> and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100

more advanced has a better screen and
better<00:01:10.460> specs<00:01:10.850> though<00:01:11.659> at<00:01:11.900> first<00:01:11.930> glance<00:01:12.380> you

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
better specs though at first glance you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.600 
better specs though at first glance you
might<00:01:13.009> think<00:01:13.310> they<00:01:13.670> are<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.000> same<00:01:15.610> with

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610
