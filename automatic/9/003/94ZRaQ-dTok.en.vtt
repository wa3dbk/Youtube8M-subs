00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.990
 mass phase but runs a fan belly 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.420
 I still do not have it 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.950
 maybe a little bit at the bottom 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.279
 belly to come 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.560
 but you can gain a bit of fat 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.970
 yes not avoid 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.199
 it is not so simple pure 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.019
 build muscle mass 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.300
 I want to make it to a spectator quickly 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.349
 question, I'm coming fast now 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.890
 wants to answer 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.110
 as said factually and quickly the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.590
 question was one should in the mass phase 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.989
 also exercise the belly and that is 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.879
 the answer, of course, that mine 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.610
 Many do not think so because 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.010
 they say you're evi sore and you 're 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.770
 you can not see the sixpack anyway and 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.719
 the wall of belly venice and the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.789
 You can not see muscles underneath 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.350
 so why should you train and 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.730
 I think you should just in the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.790
 masterphase because if you do that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.430
 then do you practice your own 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.010
 abdominal muscle on earth with her you are in 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.130
 the mass phase and you have to hard the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.520
 hard train so for example with 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.640
 orange with weight or negative with 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.350
 dish or cable as I said 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.869
 very very heavy abdominal exercises with it 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 you enlarge your individual packs 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.170
 could, so to speak , become one then 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.420
 maybe not seeing one too was 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.610
 but she is a little bit covered in fat 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.850
 makes for a lot of times in the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.220
 single packs and so the better 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.320
 after that, if you come back later 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.540
 At the real phase, yes, you can 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.299
 I think it will be so difficult to follow me 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.540
 not understood so trained here 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.630
 the belly on mass you enlarged yours 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.060
 sixpack you do not see that though 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.729
 if you get the d phase then he will 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.520
 really hard come out before 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.210
 and then yes and if you only then 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.890
 would start training the sixpack 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.610
 ok camera is somehow sometimes 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.959
 it happens that you see here so me 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.730
 say again in the last sentence if you 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.380
 then only would train in the defi 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.720
 phase then the sixpack would be slow 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.520
 come and otherwise as if their fat from 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.400
 you can see it coming right away 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.140
 fierce sixpack and that 's it 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.450
 Camera has broken 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.450
 Well, I hope you
