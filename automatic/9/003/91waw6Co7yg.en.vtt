information at this current moment in

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.929 
information at this current moment in
time<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.229> even<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.400> case<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
time but even so if this was the case I

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.190 
time but even so if this was the case I
doubt<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.659> any<00:01:06.869> huge

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
doubt there would be any huge

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
doubt there would be any huge
differences<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.830> changes<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:08.820> be<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
differences and changes there could be a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.460 
differences and changes there could be a
different<00:01:09.330> car<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.750> different<00:01:10.049> outfit<00:01:10.320> that's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
different car or different outfit that's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.289 
different car or different outfit that's
available<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.070> apart<00:01:11.340> from<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.820> doubt

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
available but apart from that I doubt

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.149 
available but apart from that I doubt
there<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.540> be<00:01:12.600> any<00:01:12.810> major<00:01:13.080> changes<00:01:13.409> but

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
there would be any major changes but

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830 
there would be any major changes but
anyway<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.820> being<00:01:15.000> said<00:01:15.090> let's<00:01:15.659> move

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.099 
of the Christmas DLC as well which would

be a great Christmas present in my

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.930 
be a great Christmas present in my

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
opinion and moving down to the final

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.420 
opinion and moving down to the final
line<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.120> code<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.840> have<00:03:31.079> holiday<00:03:31.560> bonus<00:03:31.950> xp

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
line of code we have holiday bonus xp

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.190 
line of code we have holiday bonus xp
cap<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.209> value<00:03:33.540> itself<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:33.959> set<00:03:34.109> to

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
cap and the value itself is set to

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.830 
cap and the value itself is set to
12,000<00:03:34.980> which<00:03:35.310> in<00:03:35.459> my<00:03:35.639> opinion<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.269> huge

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
12,000 which in my opinion is a huge

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.809 
12,000 which in my opinion is a huge
amount<00:03:37.079> of<00:03:37.169> RP<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.650> make<00:03:37.829> from<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.220> single<00:03:38.549> job

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
amount of RP to make from a single job

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.819 
amount of RP to make from a single job
so<00:03:39.389> it<00:03:39.510> appears<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.840> rock<00:03:40.139> star<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.530> going<00:03:40.739> to

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
so it appears that rock star is going to

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.379 
so it appears that rock star is going to
be<00:03:40.889> very<00:03:40.919> generous<00:03:41.609> over<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.000> Christmas

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389
