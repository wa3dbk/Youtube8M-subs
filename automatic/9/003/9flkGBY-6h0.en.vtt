ingredients who have three cups of flour

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.870 
ingredients who have three cups of flour
we<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> third<00:00:13.469> cup<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.710> Splenda<00:00:14.370> our<00:00:14.519> sugar

we have a third cup of Splenda our sugar

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.210

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.130 
powder and we have quarter spoon of salt
now<00:00:20.520> salt<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.090> not<00:00:21.119> actually<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.990> make

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
now salt is not actually going to make

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.320 
now salt is not actually going to make
our<00:00:22.320> scones<00:00:22.710> salty<00:00:23.310> it's<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.880> flavor<00:00:24.180> enhancer

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
our scones salty it's a flavor enhancer

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.790 
our scones salty it's a flavor enhancer
so<00:00:27.330> let's<00:00:27.570> mix<00:00:28.260> all<00:00:28.500> these<00:00:28.740> ingredients

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
so let's mix all these ingredients

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.620 
so let's mix all these ingredients
together<00:00:31.430> it<00:00:32.430> looks<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> lot<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.300> flour

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
together it looks like a lot of flour

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.990 
together it looks like a lot of flour
but<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.440> reality<00:00:34.880> it's<00:00:37.129> it's<00:00:38.129> actually<00:00:38.610> quite

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
but in reality it's it's actually quite

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.330 
but in reality it's it's actually quite
good<00:00:39.090> because<00:00:39.450> our<00:00:40.140> scones<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> be

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
good because our scones are going to be

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.389 
good because our scones are going to be
quite<00:00:41.610> big<00:00:42.469> like<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> scones<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> see

in<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.579> store<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> you're<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> paddle

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
in a store so you're just with a paddle

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.979 
in a store so you're just with a paddle
you<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.620> mix<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.039> together<00:00:50.250> add<00:00:50.700> about<00:00:51.510> 20

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you just mix it together add about 20

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.290 
you just mix it together add about 20

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
flour so that the texture becomes of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.560 
flour so that the texture becomes of
moist<00:01:03.960> crumbs<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.040> now<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.000> mix<00:01:06.360> our
