00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.080
 Introduction to fractions. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.600
 Pizza. 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.700
 Let me order another pizza. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.000
 Great pizza. 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.300
 Pizza will be divided into equal parts. 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400
 This pizza is all. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.600
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.200
 Divide the pizza into 6 equal portions. 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:18.400
 One of these, six parts can express one on six. 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.400
 This number is read as hexadecimal. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:42.600
 Two of the six parts can be expressed as two on six and read as VI. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 This type of fractional numbers is called. 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.440
 Full. 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.400
 part. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.400
 Fractions express part of the whole. 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.400
 1 after 6. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:15.200
 Fractions can be written using two complete numbers and a line. 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.400
 The figure above the line is called a numerator. 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:33.080
 The number is called under the underlined line. 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.000
 Full. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 parts. 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:59.600
 The denominator tells us the total number of parts in its entirety. 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:33.200
 Rugs tell us how many parts of the whole are taken. 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.200
 Full. 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:04.500
 Note that the breakers can not be zero because we can not make zero parts of the whole. 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.100
 End. 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:26.340
