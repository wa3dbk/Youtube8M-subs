comparing<00:00:03.929> an<00:00:04.080> iphone<00:00:04.440> 5<00:00:04.710> prototype<00:00:05.370> i

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520

received<00:00:05.879> from<00:00:06.060> an<00:00:06.180> anonymous<00:00:06.359> source<00:00:06.710> to<00:00:07.710> the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
received from an anonymous source to the

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.820 
received from an anonymous source to the
iphone<00:00:08.400> 4s<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.120> white<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:10.440> most<00:00:10.620> recent

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
iphone 4s in white the most recent

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.690 
iphone 4s in white the most recent
iphone<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.700> apples<00:00:12.000> lineup<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.710> if<00:00:14.610> we

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
iphone and apples lineup so if we

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.060 
iphone and apples lineup so if we
compare<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.089> both<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:16.170> can<00:00:16.410> see<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
compare the both we can see that the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.900 
compare the both we can see that the
iphone<00:00:18.029> 5<00:00:18.300> prototype<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.400> slightly<00:00:20.400> thinner

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
iphone 5 prototype is slightly thinner

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.490 
iphone 5 prototype is slightly thinner
than<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.020> 4s<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:23.269> is<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.650> quite<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.710> bit<00:00:25.920> longer

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
than the 4s it is a quite a bit longer

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.200 
than the 4s it is a quite a bit longer
the<00:00:28.500> screen<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.039> lot<00:00:29.250> larger<00:00:29.460> which<00:00:30.060> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the screen is a lot larger which is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.990 
the screen is a lot larger which is
great<00:00:30.840> for<00:00:30.929> watching<00:00:31.230> films<00:00:31.679> playing<00:00:32.669> games

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
great for watching films playing games

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120 
great for watching films playing games
it's<00:00:33.210> not<00:00:33.329> as<00:00:33.450> large<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.989> samsung<00:00:34.530> galaxy<00:00:34.559> s3

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
it's not as large as a samsung galaxy s3

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.260 
it's not as large as a samsung galaxy s3
screen<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.570> that's<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.430> bit<00:00:38.430> too<00:00:38.460> large<00:00:38.850> for<00:00:39.000> my

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
screen but that's a bit too large for my

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.910 
screen but that's a bit too large for my
taste<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.290> hits<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> spot<00:00:42.230> it's<00:00:43.230> same

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
taste so this is hits the spot it's same

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.049 
taste so this is hits the spot it's same
width<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:46.460> it<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> couple<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.940> other

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
width and it has a couple of other

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.319 
width and it has a couple of other
changes<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.660> well<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:49.620> take<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.829> look<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
changes as well we take a look at the

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.810 
changes as well we take a look at the
prototype<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> front-facing

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
prototype and see that the front-facing

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.270 
prototype and see that the front-facing
camera<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:55.010> moved<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> center<00:00:56.910> no<00:00:57.420> longer

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
camera has moved to the center no longer

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.560 
camera has moved to the center no longer
to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> left<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.600> speaker<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:02.570> coarse

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
to the left of the speaker and coarse

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.390 
to the left of the speaker and coarse
screen<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.960> larger<00:01:04.320> down<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
screen is larger down here we have the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.700

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
on one microphone the audio jack has

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
on one microphone the audio jack has
moved<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> bottom<00:01:18.390> no<00:01:19.380> longer<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> top

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
moved to the bottom no longer at the top

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.440 
moved to the bottom no longer at the top
of<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.250> top<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.549> only<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.119> hold<00:01:21.360> button

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
of the top we only have the hold button

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.660 
of the top we only have the hold button
and<00:01:24.110> we<00:01:25.110> also<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.500> new<00:01:25.710> dock<00:01:26.070> connector<00:01:26.580> it

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and we also have a new dock connector it

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.300 
and we also have a new dock connector it
seems<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.720> dock<00:01:27.900> connector<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.560> 4s

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
seems like the dock connector on the 4s

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.910 
seems like the dock connector on the 4s
is<00:01:29.549> quite<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> bit<00:01:30.479> larger<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.439> take<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.650> look<00:01:31.799> at

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
is quite a bit larger you take a look at

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.499 
is quite a bit larger you take a look at
this<00:01:31.979> image<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:34.470> looks<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.799> this

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
this image here and it looks like this

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.700 
this image here and it looks like this
some<00:01:36.509> type<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.720> new<00:01:37.020> dock<00:01:37.259> connector<00:01:37.619> that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
some type of new dock connector that

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.660 
some type of new dock connector that
Apple<00:01:38.070> has<00:01:38.100> developed<00:01:39.979> obviously<00:01:40.979> that's<00:01:41.460> why

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
Apple has developed obviously that's why

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.580 
Apple has developed obviously that's why
I<00:01:41.700> can't<00:01:42.000> plug<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.570> don't<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.439> this

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
I can't plug it in I don't have this

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.609 
I can't plug it in I don't have this
dock<00:01:43.829> connector<00:01:44.960> we<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.110> take<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> look<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
dock connector we can take a look at the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
dock connector we can take a look at the
back<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.930> same<00:01:49.110> camera<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.920> flash<00:01:50.450> apple

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
back so the same camera the flash apple

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.050 
back so the same camera the flash apple
logo<00:01:52.399> iphone<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:56.399> seems<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
logo iphone it seems like it's a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.200 
logo iphone it seems like it's a
prototype<00:01:57.299> since<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.460> also<00:01:59.460> has<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.790> serial

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
prototype since it also has the serial

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.539 
prototype since it also has the serial
number<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.479> XX<00:02:01.020> XX<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:05.189> back<00:02:05.399> is

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
number the XX XX you and the back is

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.240 
number the XX XX you and the back is
made<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.090> matte<00:02:07.020> black<00:02:07.500> aluminum<00:02:08.099> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
made out of a matte black aluminum it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.660 
made out of a matte black aluminum it
seems<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:09.679> nice<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.979> touch<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.400> doesn't

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
seems like nice the touch it doesn't

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.980 
seems like nice the touch it doesn't
leave<00:02:11.760> any<00:02:11.940> fingerprints

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
leave any fingerprints

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.160 
leave any fingerprints
and<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:14.340> hope<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.330> doesn't<00:02:15.540> shatter<00:02:15.750> as<00:02:15.990> easily

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and I hope it doesn't shatter as easily

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.910 
and I hope it doesn't shatter as easily
as<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:17.270> 4s<00:02:18.270> does<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.740> take<00:02:19.890> a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
as that 4s does and so you can take a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.310 
as that 4s does and so you can take a
look<00:02:20.130> here<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.340> got<00:02:20.630> nice<00:02:21.630> little<00:02:22.340> bruise<00:02:23.340> here
