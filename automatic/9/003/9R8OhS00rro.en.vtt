 betting all fitness today I'm going to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.059
 tell a story of richards andrÃ©s 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.490
 which is really spectacular and it was a 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.920
 Roman bodybuilder boy had the body 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.990
 of a bodybuilder but in being a child 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.720
 and is that with only two years of age 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.869
 started to train and with eight years already 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.460
 I raised in bench press more than 80 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.619
 If you want to listen kilos all 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.670
 records there we start in a new 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.670
 video going on this 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.949
 it is the story of the child or 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.290
 bodybuilder called milk pieces and sometimes 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.059
 very small and as I said before to 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.640
 the two years has begun to train and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.000
 is that his parents were a couple of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.300
 Russians who 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.950
 martial arts experts a couple and 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.739
 especially the father very fond of 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.390
 bodybuilding world who attempted 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.450
 instill this hobby to your child 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.570
 and how did all this start, according to 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.750
 mind i am son richard read his panels 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.550
 trained being very small and others 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.700
 years old he came to his parents to 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.710
 train and as a gameplay 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.500
 we started to start freezing the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.229
 weights paint a limiting logically no 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.720
 I did not have that strength that brings us to 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.119
 sing and what his parents decided 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.330
 how I saw that child liked everything 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.590
 that moment of the prisoners because it went to 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.630
 build a dumbbell to buy 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.789
 half-kilo dumbbells 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.670
 approximately and that he started doing 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.619
 practice the game form only that 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.800
 good a little madness quotes 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.500
 from his parents then 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.300
 richard for splitting a very childhood 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.940
 different to half of the rest of the 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.650
 children because logically he spent all his 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.550
 childhood 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:02.800
 just training and taking a 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.500
 very strict diet so you can eat 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.660
 a bit like the rest of the people do 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.560
 children his father was the one he was made 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.330
 trained and nutritionist to see but 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.370
 due to a conviction that he had to 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.340
 enter prison in 2006 by 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.130
 mistreating his wife so good a little 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.200
 Richard's life changed already left him a 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.730
 little of being so strict in the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.180
 workouts and nutrition and pull 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.310
 let's say that a little bit could recover that 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.340
 childhood that he had lost they had 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.220
 stolen in part by those demands that 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.560
 they are very exaggerated for such a child 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.630
 small one of the most outstanding data 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.019
 is that Richard with only eight years of 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.600
 age was able to lift 81.6 kilos in 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.040
 three benches in more than 80 kilos with only 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.030
 eight years the truth that is an act 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.750
 spectacular and another where in account is 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.330
 that his parents and trying to emulate 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.739
 arnold schwarzenegger him his idol 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.650
 admitted in interpretation classes 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.739
 to see if it manages to become a 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.299
 star of the movie world just like 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.190
 I already said that I was going to do 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.930
 arnold schwarzenegger the most criticized 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.910
 in this story he was always his father 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.030
 by his mind the children to such strict 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.670
 life from the little one in a life that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.700
 I really was not a normal child and 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.160
 current and especially because always 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.489
 is that doubt that if the child 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.940
 really everything I ate was natural 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:35.050
 and I say it because logically a body 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.090
 so muscular being really a child 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.550
 very unlikely due to the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.740
 testosterone that I would have inside 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.550
 of a few years so it's a little over 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.300
 all suspect having a body in a 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.830
 so spectacular body being a child 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.320
 multiple things here the end of today's 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.490
 richard the child bodybuilder a story 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.980
 spectacular 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.900
 I leave you below with pictures of him 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.940
 so you can see his spectacular physique 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.280
