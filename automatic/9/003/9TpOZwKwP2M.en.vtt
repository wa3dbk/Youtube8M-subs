00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
out yet you go back you'll notice this I

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.660 
out yet you go back you'll notice this I
guess<00:01:15.110> they<00:01:15.229> call<00:01:15.410> it<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.680> road<00:01:15.950> yeah<00:01:16.520> I<00:01:16.550> think

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
guess they call it a road yeah I think

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.790 
guess they call it a road yeah I think
it's<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.880> road<00:01:17.110> you'll<00:01:18.110> know<00:01:18.229> so<00:01:18.289> that's<00:01:18.470> kind

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
it's a road you'll know so that's kind

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.940 
it's a road you'll know so that's kind
of<00:01:18.860> up<00:01:19.190> in<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.460> air<00:01:19.550> there<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.380> use<00:01:21.380> landmarks

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
of up in the air there and use landmarks

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.820 
of up in the air there and use landmarks
we<00:01:22.130> wish<00:01:22.310> it's<00:01:22.580> pretty<00:01:22.820> obvious<00:01:23.830> actually

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
we wish it's pretty obvious actually

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.170 
we wish it's pretty obvious actually
it's<00:01:24.950> not<00:01:25.070> terribly<00:01:25.580> obvious<00:01:25.729> than<00:01:26.090> that

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
it's not terribly obvious than that

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.679 
it's not terribly obvious than that
actually<00:01:26.510> yeah<00:01:26.659> it<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.960> kind<00:01:27.350> of<00:01:27.500> if<00:01:27.710> that's<00:01:27.950> it

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
actually yeah it is kind of if that's it

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.880 
actually yeah it is kind of if that's it
it's<00:01:29.689> a<00:01:29.720> big<00:01:29.960> landmark<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:30.619> it<00:01:30.680> should<00:01:30.860> be

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
it's a big landmark so it should be

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.700 
it's a big landmark so it should be
terribly<00:01:31.310> hard<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.790> spot<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:33.439> jump

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
terribly hard to the spot you just jump

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.370 
terribly hard to the spot you just jump
up<00:01:33.770> here<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:34.600> you<00:01:35.600> move<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:36.020> here<00:01:36.700> take<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.729> leap

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
up here and you move up here take a leap

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.649 
up here and you move up here take a leap
leap<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:40.250> then<00:01:40.700> right<00:01:40.939> there<00:01:41.210> right<00:01:41.509> on<00:01:41.600> the

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
leap and then right there right on the

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.080 
leap and then right there right on the
ground<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:43.509> the<00:01:44.509> other<00:01:44.720> symbol<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.619> vault

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
ground is the other symbol of the vault

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.569 
ground is the other symbol of the vault
discover<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.470> there<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.710> go<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:51.770> have
