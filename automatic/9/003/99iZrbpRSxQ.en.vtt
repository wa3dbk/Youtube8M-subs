00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.870
 ruth student is still cooking with 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.440
 mineral water have daily t 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.179
 for them a health hazard 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.650
 because that contains water from her tap 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.949
 at more than allowed up to 7 times over 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.949
 the limit 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.719
 I have bad things already 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.579
 feeling 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.190
 She shows us the old pipes in her 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.329
 kitchen 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.410
 no wonder you drink water 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:57.960
 contaminated 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:01.079
 It flows through leaded lead pipes like these 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.980
 they have not been allowed since 1973 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.019
 be installed 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.270
 a scandal that they still have 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.720
 in apartments there is the doctor roland 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.640
 For years he is looking over 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.130
 the fatal health consequences of 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.880
 Lead in drinking water on here on the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.369
 Show the sanitary industry the chronic 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.619
 taking lead is the problem man 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.490
 can also say there is a lead 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.140
 insidious poison that should say that 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.509
 it's not what i am today 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.150
 I have taken what I have some 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.950
 markets but you take that 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.009
 stay for the rest of your life 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.470
 circumstances from the drinking water and it 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.899
 accumulates in the body because it is 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.759
 in the body how calcium behaves and in 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.920
 all cells come in and 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.950
 especially in the bone is deposited 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.570
 and being collected on 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.870
 ruth schüler lives in this old building in the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.480
 third floor 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.000
 Other residents have too much lead 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.250
 in the water on the ground floor one works 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.410
 Nanny 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.960
 She looks after five children and cooks tea for them 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.960
 and lunch with everything tap water 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.830
 the message from contaminated 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:24.520
 drinking water in the apartment of hers 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:26.940
 neighbor a shock i am also quite 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.940
 honestly 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.510
 that's all for me 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.660
 of course that cleared everything 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.910
 and wish to be made especially in 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.910
 Old buildings can still lie lead pipes 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.770
 furthermore, a sample gives us the 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.200
 Learn about it in the lab and want 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.720
 knowledge is also their lead content over 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.060
 the limit 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.590
 in 50,000 apartments in hamburg alone 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.590
 estimates the tenants' association 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.620
 the value is higher than ten micrograms 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.860
 landlords have to do something per liter 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.200
 that's what the Drinking Water Ordinance wants us to do 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.180
 make the test randomly 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.680
 old buildings and let the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.659
 take resident samples 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.719
 the risks of lead are in the water 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.159
 known for a long time 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:19.099
 That's why the limit is in Europe 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:23.430
 Gradually reduced since 1998 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.090
 before 2003, it was 50 micrograms per 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.870
 liter 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:32.459
 then it was halved to 25 micrograms 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.769
 and since 1 12 2013 may not exceed 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.010
 ten micrograms of lead in liters of water 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.010
 his 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.430
 leave in an independent environmental laboratory 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.070
 we examine the vials 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.770
 the result is alarming the first 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.720
 Mother's day sample of the limit 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:04:05.430
 exceeded 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:10.110
 13 7 micrograms lead a day mother 35 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.830
 infants are especially children 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.560
 endangered 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.049
 the lead what the kids before the 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.150
 bored record about what the 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.890
 mother passes them on and then with the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.049
 still drinking water 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.570
 affects the development of the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.640
 Nervous system of the brain from where 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.820
 Links are formed in this 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.919
 time where developments take place completely 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.090
 in short, one can say lead 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:40.230
 does the same for the results of others 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.460
 Analyzes are scary of 15 samples 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:48.300
 6 are above the limit 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.919
 even values ​​of 60 61 and 68 micrograms 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.919
 six times higher than allowed 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.659
 We drive to the renters association we want 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.090
 know how can that be that always 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:03.139
 there are still so many lead tubes in spite of one 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.180
 transitional period of 15 years 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.650
 Siegmund Chychla from the tenants' association is 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.110
 The case of Ruth Schüler from Hamburg 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.360
 barmbek is obviously afraid of the 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.879
 landlords here invest the 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.039
 are required around the flats or 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.759
 the rooms in the contractual condition 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.599
 offset 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.580
 and therefore approvingly buys that 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.310
 especially for small children here 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.990
 permanent damage occurs in this case 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.449
 you would have to examine more closely 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.310
 I even assume that here is the 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.740
 suspected of bodily injury 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.479
 could say what the bandages said 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.319
 North German housing company too 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.960
 our results one weighs off the 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.419
 number of risky bonds in the 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.069
 flats of our member companies 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.870
 according to our knowledge only 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:55.530
 still a negligible size 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.180
 his negligence can become 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.900
 homeowner now but not anymore 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.210
 Afford 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.849
 tenants have the new limit 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.190
 more rights you can hire the landlord 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.400
 sue repair and even that 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.380
 Turn on health 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.289
 important is that every landlord 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.069
 negligent or intentional the tenant 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.710
 Not informed about lead in the water 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:22.139
 unlawful acts to boxes 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.159
 haul to the third floor red 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.830
 student is tired of it 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:28.460
 that is not only impractical but 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.460
 also expensive 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.099
 an interview with market rejects the 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.419
 landlord of ruth student from only 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:47.759
 after doing the health 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.319
 turned on comes movement in 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.909
 the thing 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:53.750
 Now the landlord finally had to come along 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:53.750
 start the renovation
