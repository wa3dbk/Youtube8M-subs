00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
sprout that's what we're learning today

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.390 
sprout that's what we're learning today
at<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> yarn<00:00:17.039> needle<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.760> length<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.240> yarn<00:00:19.400> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
at a yarn needle and length of yarn and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.640 
at a yarn needle and length of yarn and
we'll<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.539> start<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.020> I'm<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.439> have

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
we'll just start so I'm going to have

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.560 
we'll just start so I'm going to have
this<00:00:22.830> threaded<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.430> we're<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> come<00:00:24.390> up

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
this threaded on we're going to come up

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.290 
this threaded on we're going to come up
through<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.990> top<00:00:25.260> I'm<00:00:26.099> gonna<00:00:26.220> make<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.269> I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
through the top I'm gonna make and I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.490 
through the top I'm gonna make and I
won't<00:00:27.480> pull<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.779> all<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:27.990> way<00:00:28.109> through<00:00:28.230> I'm

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
won't pull it all the way through I'm

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.259 
won't pull it all the way through I'm
just<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.830> kind<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.070> hang<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.760> but

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
just going to kind of hang on to it but

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.550 
just going to kind of hang on to it but
then<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.900> make<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.080> loops

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
then I'm just going to make some loops

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.780 
then I'm just going to make some loops
at<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.070> top<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.800> make<00:00:35.309> as<00:00:35.489> many<00:00:35.640> as

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
at the top and you can make as many as

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.610 
at the top and you can make as many as
you<00:00:35.969> like

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.190 

me<00:00:43.620> me<00:00:43.770> one<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.460> think<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.690> give<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.900> specific

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
me me one more I think I give a specific

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.010 
me me one more I think I give a specific
number<00:00:46.560> in<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:47.010> book<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.900> you<00:00:48.900> know

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
number in the book but you just you know

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.860 
number in the book but you just you know
do<00:00:49.350> what<00:00:49.560> do<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:50.010> looks<00:00:50.220> good<00:00:50.310> to<00:00:50.580> you<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.540> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
do what do what looks good to you then I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.140 
do what do what looks good to you then I
am<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.710> pull<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> through<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
am going to pull it through to the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.000 
am going to pull it through to the
inside<00:00:55.940> it's<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> loss<00:00:57.239> loop<00:00:57.920> there<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:58.980> go

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
inside it's a loss loop there we go

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.130 
inside it's a loss loop there we go
sniff<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.040> I'll<00:01:02.460> tie<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.000> off<00:01:03.890> later<00:01:06.140> then

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
sniff that I'll tie that off later then

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.300 
sniff that I'll tie that off later then
I'm<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.410> take<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:09.770> contrasting<00:01:10.770> color<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
I'm going to take my contrasting color I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.310 
I'm going to take my contrasting color I
am<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.180> using<00:01:12.300> these<00:01:12.600> colors<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
am just using these colors for the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.180 
am just using these colors for the
example<00:01:13.860> today<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:14.970> gonna<00:01:15.149> pull<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:19.190> come

example today but I'm gonna pull up come
up<00:01:20.280> break<00:01:20.550> through<00:01:20.910> the<00:01:21.899> bottom<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.470> those

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
up break through the bottom of those

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.280 
up break through the bottom of those
loops<00:01:22.979> at<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.280> top<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:24.540> I'm<00:01:24.660> just<00:01:24.750> gonna<00:01:24.990> wrap

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
loops at the top and I'm just gonna wrap

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.889 
loops at the top and I'm just gonna wrap
around<00:01:27.680> tightly<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:29.720> can<00:01:30.720> take<00:01:30.899> my<00:01:31.050> finger<00:01:31.410> out

I'm gonna wrap going up to leaving some
little<00:01:43.710> loops<00:01:43.890> at<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.100> top<00:01:44.190> exposed<00:01:44.880> come

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
little loops at the top exposed come

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.880 
little loops at the top exposed come
back<00:01:45.720> down<00:01:46.220> got<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> tight<00:01:48.170> wrap<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.709> that
