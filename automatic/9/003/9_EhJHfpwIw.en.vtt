00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 because there is a video project must want 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.360
 we high the thermal today and you 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.320
 Introduce low pressure areas first 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.150
 Let's put the pressure of the air 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.789
 Air pressure is the effect of a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.609
 Air column whose weight on the floor 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.699
 or the higher you push a person 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.630
 the lower the air pressure 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.869
 Air pressure is in one unit 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.510
 stated hektopascal takes everyone 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.870
 eight liters of wine hectopascal from then on 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:38.010
 you have to be barometer now we come 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.579
 to distinguish the pressure between 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.260
 foundation and civil engineering prayer 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.480
 solar radiation heats up the air 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.210
 and rises on now forms at 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.640
 ground deep in the height cools the warm 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.390
 air and are back to ground 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.840
 there is now rising up on the ground 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.190
 madness insanity command the line with 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.769
 same program show 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.840
 on such cards are high pressure 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.619
 again with a hartz iv areas with 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.229
 denoted by a t now we explain 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.850
 some examples 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.619
 an example is the country system 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.600
 solar radiation heats up the land 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.000
 faster than the water it forms 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.680
 a deep thermal out in the air 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.470
 the lake flows in it is called 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.850
 wins or onshore wind in the 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.979
 height are rising 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.979
 Ascended air masses to see off 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.350
 and develops for a whole day 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.119
 stop the circulation the water 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.340
 saves the warmth of the night better than that 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.470
 land it now forms a deep over 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.079
 the waters secretly high 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.780
 over the country from sr stands offshore 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.060
 wind busy we come to the pressure 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.430
 areas of Central Asia in 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.530
 Central Asia is cold in winter 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.689
 until 2070 hectopascal 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.140
 because the chain heavy air on the ground 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.040
 press in the summer there are deeply up to 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.020
 980 hectopascals 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.579
 because the warm air is on the ground 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.939
 does not press too hard like the cold one 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.160
 air 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.160
 That was our little presentation about 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.130
 thermal high 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.520
 low pressure areas we hope that you 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.520
 everything understood
