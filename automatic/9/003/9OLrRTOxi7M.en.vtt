enjoy here we have an assembled
centrifuge<00:00:35.180> basically<00:00:36.180> how<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.450> operates<00:00:39.649> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
centrifuge basically how it operates the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.889 
centrifuge basically how it operates the
feed<00:00:40.860> holes<00:00:41.070> from<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> feed<00:00:41.640> pump<00:00:41.940> gets

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
feed holes from the feed pump gets

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.470 
feed holes from the feed pump gets
hooked<00:00:43.140> into<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.670> feed<00:00:45.000> tube<00:00:45.210> runs

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
hooked into here this feed tube runs

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.170 
hooked into here this feed tube runs
down<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.899> center<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> machine<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:48.000> about

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
down the center of the machine to about

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.130 
down the center of the machine to about
this<00:00:48.390> point<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.969> fluid<00:00:51.300> comes<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.989> at

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
this point here the fluid comes out at

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
this point here the fluid comes out at
the<00:00:52.170> end<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> feed<00:00:52.739> tube<00:00:52.980> travels<00:00:53.910> through

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
the end of the feed tube travels through

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.930 
the end of the feed tube travels through
the<00:00:54.420> ports<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.989> conveyor<00:00:55.610> comes<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the ports and the conveyor comes to the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.740 
the ports and the conveyor comes to the
inside<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> bowl<00:00:58.309> obviously<00:00:59.750> this

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
inside of the bowl obviously this

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.119 
inside of the bowl obviously this
machine<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.289> rotating<00:01:03.500> which<00:01:04.500> forces<00:01:05.010> the

you can see is a unitized stand it
travels<00:02:25.060> like<00:02:25.269> this<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.959> raised<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.099> lower

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
travels like this is raised and lower

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.740 
travels like this is raised and lower
like<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:27.879> all<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.180> safety<00:02:28.420> systems

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
like this so all the safety systems

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.990 
like this so all the safety systems
remain<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.470> place<00:02:29.709> at<00:02:29.950> all<00:02:30.040> times<00:02:30.370> handrails

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
remain in place at all times handrails

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.080 
remain in place at all times handrails
are<00:02:31.239> always<00:02:31.510> installed<00:02:32.610> we<00:02:33.610> have<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.760> fall

here<00:02:39.400> as<00:02:39.599> per<00:02:40.680> safety<00:02:41.680> regulations<00:02:44.730> these<00:02:45.730> are

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
here as per safety regulations these are

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.550 
here as per safety regulations these are

which<00:02:47.739> are<00:02:47.890> adjustable<00:02:48.519> you<00:02:48.700> just<00:02:49.569> back<00:02:49.780> these

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
which are adjustable you just back these

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.420 
which are adjustable you just back these
bolts<00:02:50.410> out<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.590> little<00:02:50.799> bit<00:02:51.010> then<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.220> can

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
bolts out a little bit then you can

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.949 
bolts out a little bit then you can
slide<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.849> plate<00:02:52.030> up<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.420> down<00:02:52.569> for
