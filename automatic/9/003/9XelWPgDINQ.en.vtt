00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.379
 with the four elements with which 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.250
 we will work that are in order 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:10.889
 pentatonic arpeggios 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.490
 scales of a tonics and chromatic scale 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.369
 because in that order because the arpeggio is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.410
 extremely stable is only the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 chord notes 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.099
 if we pass to the tonic penalties 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.630
 that clarified I will not have pentatonic 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.699
 for all my chords 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 I'm going to have losses that work very 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.949
 well for my 251 mayor but I do not have 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.370
 a tonic goal semi diminished ni 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.920
 altered for the fifth degree 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.300
 of the minor but the pentatonic 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.839
 they work like arpeggios with tensions 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.449
 valid a minor pentatonic is not more 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.710
 that a seventh minor chord that has 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.839
 an eleventh that is a very very attention 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.970
 very neutral a major pentatonic is not 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.680
 more than an arpeggio, more tribalism than 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.269
 has a sixth and a ninth that are 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.409
 very valid tensions for both 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.170
 the major chords as for the 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:07.470
 dominant chords then yes yes 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.679
 is very successful harmonically the first 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.119
 step to start adding notes 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:14.119
 tensions on the pentatonic scale 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.899
 then we continue with the scale of the 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.909
 tonality of the tonality of the I'm 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.380
 He is working because it is five years 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.789
 has following sounds of which 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.280
 there are some that can become a 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.380
 little tense but I'm having a 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.890
 more tension and I'm defining a 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.930
 little bit more the function of the chords 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:39.490
 add more notes that differ from the 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.910
 at the scale of the notes that make up the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.910
 chord 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.410
 more melodic elements but with the 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.380
 risk that they are a little bit more more 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.080
 tensos a little less structured and 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.550
 finally my chromatic scale 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.310
 It has all the sounds of our 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.110
 music system then it's a good 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.750
 element for my tense chords 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.620
 they make him the dominant ones 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 generate a tension 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:15.520
 almost dissonant to face 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.660
 ours to our chord to that chord 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.610
 tense rough that asks me for a resolution 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.510
 in another I agreed the moment I step 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.010
 of my chromatic scale that very intense to 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.340
 solve in an arpeggio with a scale 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.880
 pentatonic they are are very structures 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.620
 very closed very relaxed is like 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.470
 the music direction that I am giving 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.010
 It is much more accurate as more 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.010
 definite
