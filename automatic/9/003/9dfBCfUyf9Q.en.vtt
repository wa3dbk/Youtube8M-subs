 gilding and a pinch of salt I'm going 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 start by putting my yeast

 Baker damman I take them there 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.390

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.789
 minutes I'm going to put so my flour 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.289
 I spent a week and so as we are 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.309
 with my yeast so in a first 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.309
 time I'm going to mix 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:16.590

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.680
 turn slowly 4 to 5 minutes 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:32.390
 now I'll be able to add 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.720
 my butter in plots and beat two 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.720
 three minutes 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.670
 so my butter is entirely 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.490
 incorporate then do not hesitate time 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.220
 in time to scrape the edges of your 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.520
 vat here to make it all right 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.520
 homogeneous 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.210
 I will get rid of my paw 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:10.940
 so I'm sprinkled so a farida 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:12.950
 my salad bowl I pour it does not you I 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.870
 will soon give my paw a little bit of 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.330
 flour then it's the pope who needs 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:24.410
 to rest until tomorrow morning 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:29.630
 so I'm going to film it and a direction 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.110
 the fridge until tomorrow I leave my dough 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.420
 brioche 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:38.570
 but my fridge so she to say that 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.270
 I'm going to get rid of it so 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.630
 my work plan that I leave in 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.780
 lightly and I pour my dough into it 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.780
 Brioche 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.840
 so I roll it in the shape of a pudding for 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.530
 can form small sticks then 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.580
 in the meantime I have buttered and floured 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.790
 my mussels and I only butter one 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.810
 silicone mold 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:14.750
 so I detail it so as to have some 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.600
 pieces that fill two-thirds 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.890
 My flattery then I mold a 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.810
 little flap I put aside and 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.810
 I try to form a ball years 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.650
 here I put it in my mold I pass 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.040
 at my second skates are the same I do 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.200
 a first then a second and then I 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:50.510
 do a third and then I try to 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:50.510
 train mabul bajard actually still a 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.920
 here I am going to fill the rest of my 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.140
 molds then the other trick is to 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.230
 take the dough is to bring back a 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.230
 maximum end inwards 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.890
 here I put it in the mold I go to 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.270
 present let them grow for at 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.160
 about an hour or an hour and 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.650
 half you really need the dough 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:41.040
 she exceeds the edges of the mold my paw 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.780
 pushed well I prepared a gilding 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.200
 that is to say, an egg yolk with a 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:52.260
 little bit of water and I will go through 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:57.300
 above and buns; but over a 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.850
 little bit of sugar in small grains so 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.390
 in the meantime I warmed mauron 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:06.419
 my oven at 160 degrees and sends them 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.750
 bake for about 20 to 20 to 25 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.360
 minutes 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.440
 it's really to watch so it's 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.440
 party for the powerful 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.760
 our brilliants 68 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.560
 we're going to take them out the kilns waouh on 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.410
 gets something very very pretty 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.510
 link there it smells like bakery in my 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.960
 cooking I will let them rest 10 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.850
 minutes before unmolding 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.780
 we will unmold ooh there it is unmolded 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:44.380
 all alone so they are pretty 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:48.690
 mellow you could almost use it 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.690
 as a worker so much and without discomfort 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.170
 so here we will sacrifice a brioche 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.380
 we go there fucking two to see 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:02.580
 really that it is soft here is 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.900
 so there she is very very soft 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.420
 so those that were cooked in my 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.100
 silicone mold look like 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.390
 mushrooms 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.450
 I think I'll take care of it tomorrow 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.640
 morning for my breakfast and I 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.150
