00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello everyone this is my first video 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.450
 I'm not good, not the first since I've 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.490
 had another account before but I decided 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.559
 erase it since apparently that was a 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.719
 of my main distractions in my 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.730
 further studies that I made the mistake of 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 tell my friends about my account and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.390
 I was doing videos by pure 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.520
 boredom and leisure of which at 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.039
 principle I thought it was a good idea 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.990
 you know it 's fun to do things that you 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.480
 like to spend time with friends 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.400
 great with them laugh at the mistakes 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.369
 that sometimes happen when one is 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.530
 filming but nothing happened that all 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.930
 the opposite turned out to be embarrassing and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.000
 even annoying it was still a topic 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100
 of teasing my friends so for 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.230
 cut it once I closed my account and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.809
 along with it all my subscribers 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.030
 all my efforts the hour invested 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.270
 in the video edition the dialogues that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.190
 I had to think everything has been in vain 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.750
 but let's stop remembering the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.750
 gone and let's start the video 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.320
 as I said in the title this video 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.330
 It will be a small analysis of the history 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.890
 Looks and nicky I think it's over 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.840
 tell him what I'm going to say to 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.270
 continuation has high content of 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.190
 spoiler and therefore could ruin 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.140
 you read the story or the excitement of seeing the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.160
 anime so you are already warned 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.690
 first curiosity 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.760
 if it can sound something sissy this 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.100
 curiosity but it has a lot to do with 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.140
 the ages of the protagonists more than 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.880
 all with gauze age and one with what 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.770
 that the next question came to me 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.020
 maybe your age will not be 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.970
 increased or decreased when making the trip 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.940
 to the past the answer to this question 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.369
 it's with a simple if the traveler's age 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.900
 of time will continue to increase 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.880
 naturally or does not matter if you're a 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.610
 time traveler will continue to age 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.740
 as an ordinary person the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.660
 The only time that will be affected will be the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.970
 of the universe so that they understand it 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.490
 little better I will explain it with an example 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.710
 let's say I make a trip to the future 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.200
 the time it took the trip for me 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.180
 It would have been a week in the meantime 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.870
 time spent in the world would have 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.570
 been 5 years 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.550
 the same happens if I travel to the past my 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.220
 age would not vary too much with age 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.590
 of the world then you can say no 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.600
 it matters how many trips she makes 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.300
 will age slowly and will remain 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.280
 young for a certain time ah but 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.230
 wait that means that the powers 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.480
 of time in the space that deutsche you 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.580
 provided they could be used to not 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.470
 never age the truth if they could 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.270
 be used the fact that deutsche 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.610
 continue to age despite 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.830
 he could use his powers was that he already 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.110
 I would have had too much experience with 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.240
 that charge so he just got bored 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.030
 of being god and decided to leave him the position 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.080
 to another good one I think it has been like that if 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.270
 you do not agree 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.460
 you can use the comment box with 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.110
 all freedom will be at ease 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.110
 share arguments with you 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.480
 this curiosity gave me a lot to think about 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.880
 since if it's true if you kill someone 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.340
 when you travel to the past it disappears 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.380
 Soon, it is one of the most important rules 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.690
 obvious ones that we have seen applied 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.790
 in almost all series of trips in the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.980
 time because this rule does not seem 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.840
 affect there is one after all he killed himself 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.630
 herself in the past should 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.940
 disappear to me too I thought 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.890
 I miss that that did not happen even though 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.720
 what create the answers is very simple 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.970
 but at the same time a bit complicated 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.010
 understand the answer it is yes you are 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.860
 killed herself but there is one that 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.750
 killed belongs to a parallel world the 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.490
 parallel worlds or the realities 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.320
 alternatives are created according to 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.690
 decisions that we take this is 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.820
 would explain in the same anime for example 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.590
 in chapter 23 at the moment when 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.660
 he murmured he was teaching djukic usa 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.120
 First world images we can notice 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.860
 that in two of them his kit appears 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.170
 protecting fasting from the ninth and the 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.360
 seventh thing that did not happen in the second 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.220
 world although we're talking about 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.380
 the same characters with the same 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.150
 characteristics the moment in which 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.980
 she decided to go back to the past and 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.050
 killing herself provoked 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.150
 another world will be created therefore the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.159
 second and one would not come to be his past 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.530
 of the first and one but would come to do 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.599
 another and one whose decisions and mentality 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.670
 would be the same as the second and one 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.590
 before winning the game and the second and 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.660
 one would be the same and one as the first 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.370
 but these would already have a concept 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.740
 prior to what the game of 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.720
 survival in other words are the 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.030
 same people but with different 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.430
 thoughts and for having that difference 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.280
 it did not disappear how difficult it is to explain 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.530
 this theory I'm not a physicist so I do not 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.539
 come to inflate the ovaries that my 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.370
 explanation state harder than the 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.949
 explanation given in the anime what 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.260
 I explained the simplest I could if 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.030
 Some of you did not understand him anymore 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.889
 who has comprehension problem or is 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.800
 he was making himself straw while 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.880
 I was listening to this let's go to the 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.880
 last point of the day 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.890
 I already got a bit lazy writing 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.960
 so let's get to the point a paradox 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.760
 according to my understanding it is a fact that 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.890
 it should not have happened or that it happened by mistake 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.750
 in the course of history these to 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.820
 the time can cause a series of 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.280
 tremendous or catastrophic effects in the 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.550
 future or so to speak more than everything is 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.410
 a confusion an error in the history of 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.420
 look and nicky I found some paradoxes 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.700
 or things that in my opinion of not having 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.580
 happened the second world would follow the 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.290
 same course as the first world one of 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.720
 they are the case of the three skeletons 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.370
 found in the gauze house and if not 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.410
 would have been that there was a third 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.270
 skeleton the ratio of gauze and with 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.000
 Yuki would have followed as it would have 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.130
 been in the first world the second 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.350
 paradox would come to be the kidnapping of 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.210
 yuki if the obsession that she had for 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.860
 he would not have been so strong the point 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.660
 of attacking the freedom of the 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.640
 person they would have had more 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.130
 trust in your relationship and therefore 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.890
 Yuki would have fallen in love faster 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.990
 what she expected good with this 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.880
 last point finished the first part of 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.800
 this analysis I hope this 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.030
 explanation has helped you understand 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.950
 better the series 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.320
 and you have enjoyed it as well as I 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.420
 I did a lot, I highly recommend the 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.590
 series is worth seeing with nothing more to say 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.590
 I say goodbye bye
