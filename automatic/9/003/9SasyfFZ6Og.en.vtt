kit right here what's amazing with oil
pastels<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.520> basically<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.420> similar<00:00:18.690> to

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
pastels is basically it's similar to

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.519 
pastels is basically it's similar to

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
watercolor pastels but it's more of an

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.700 
watercolor pastels but it's more of an
oil<00:00:22.890> form<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.269> take<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.439> more

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
oil form you can take this and be more

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.109 
oil form you can take this and be more
of<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.859> bake<00:00:26.099> with<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.060> example

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
of a bake with it and like for example

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.509 
of a bake with it and like for example
if<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.570> know<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.769> person<00:00:29.039> has<00:00:29.279> blue<00:00:29.490> eyes

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
if I know this this person has blue eyes

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.569 
if I know this this person has blue eyes
I<00:00:30.000> could<00:00:30.240> take<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.599> right<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.960> there

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
I could take that right in there

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.700 
I could take that right in there
smudge<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.880> like<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.630> take<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> little<00:00:34.500> bit

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
smudge it on like that take a little bit

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
smudge it on like that take a little bit
of<00:00:34.770> my<00:00:34.890> thinner<00:00:37.520> for<00:00:38.520> example<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> have

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
of my thinner for example I want to have

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.690 
of my thinner for example I want to have
a<00:00:39.390> blue<00:00:39.690> background<00:00:39.899> here<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.590> I'm<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.430> going

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
a blue background here so I'm just going

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.750 
a blue background here so I'm just going
to<00:00:41.730> paint<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> blue<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:43.399> with<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.579> it

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
to paint the blue in there with this it

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.580 
to paint the blue in there with this it
gives<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> little<00:00:45.149> bit<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> texture<00:00:45.719> but

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
gives it a little bit of a texture but

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.990 
gives it a little bit of a texture but
if<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.770> didn't<00:00:47.039> want<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.640> texture

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
if I didn't want to have that texture

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.279 
if I didn't want to have that texture
like<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:49.250> can<00:00:50.250> literally<00:00:50.670> take<00:00:51.289> my

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
like that I can literally take my

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.540 
like that I can literally take my
thinner<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.960> go<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.430> will

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
thinner and go on to it and it will

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.639 
thinner and go on to it and it will
blend<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:58.100> little<00:00:59.100> more<00:01:00.410> still<00:01:01.410> leaving

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
blend it out a little more still leaving

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.060 
blend it out a little more still leaving
a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.070> bit<00:01:02.190> texture<00:01:06.290> but<00:01:07.290> oil<00:01:07.619> pastels

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
a little bit texture but oil pastels

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.270 
a little bit texture but oil pastels
generally<00:01:08.580> are<00:01:08.760> great<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.920> working

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
generally are great for for for working

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.859 
generally are great for for for working
with<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> canvas<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.330> creating<00:01:12.720> that

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
with the canvas and in creating that

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.160 
with the canvas and in creating that
texture<00:01:14.509> well<00:01:15.509> usually<00:01:15.630> when<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:15.960> my

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
texture well usually when I do my

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
texture well usually when I do my
paintings<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.740> want<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.340> half<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.729> half

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
paintings I want it to be half and half

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910 
paintings I want it to be half and half
you<00:01:18.689> probably<00:01:18.990> can't<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> screen

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you probably can't see it on the screen

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.109 
you probably can't see it on the screen
but<00:01:20.070> there's<00:01:20.280> still<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> little<00:01:20.790> bit<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> more

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
but there's still a little bit of a more

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.420 
but there's still a little bit of a more
of<00:01:21.210> effect<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.170> once<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.680> have

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
of effect there and then once I have

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.420 
of effect there and then once I have
that<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:25.200> mineral<00:01:25.500> spirits<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.100> thinner

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that the mineral spirits or the thinner

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060 
that the mineral spirits or the thinner
on<00:01:26.640> there<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> could<00:01:27.090> take<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.420> again<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.680> go

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
on there I could take this again and go

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.179 
on there I could take this again and go
on<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.390> blends<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.259> was

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
on to it and it blends on there I was

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.749 
on to it and it blends on there I was
working<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.670> eyes<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:35.070> oil<00:01:35.310> pastels

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
working on the eyes here so oil pastels

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.219 
working on the eyes here so oil pastels
are<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> great<00:01:36.270> way<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.810> being<00:01:37.590> able<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.979> add

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
are a great way of being able to add

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.749 
are a great way of being able to add
texture<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.829> something<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.369> working<00:01:41.490> on

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
texture to something you're working on

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.370 
texture to something you're working on
to<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.150> able<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> work<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:45.350> surface<00:01:46.350> that

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
to be able to work with a surface that

to be able to work with a surface that
you're<00:01:46.590> working<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:48.470> usually<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.530> try<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
you're working with so usually I try to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.440 
you're working with so usually I try to
when<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> work<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.729> color<00:01:50.939> have<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> blue

when I work with a color have a blue

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.880 
when I work with a color have a blue
here<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> little<00:01:52.200> bit<00:01:52.350> more<00:01:52.500> blue<00:01:52.680> there

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
here I have a little bit more blue there

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.490 
here I have a little bit more blue there
I<00:01:53.130> want<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.060> repeat<00:01:54.420> my<00:01:54.600> blue<00:01:54.840> again<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.290> one

then<00:02:01.680> we'll<00:02:01.800> make<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.980> swirl<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> I

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
then we'll make a swirl like that so I
