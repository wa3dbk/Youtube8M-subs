starting to break off a CSC so I cut the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.980 
starting to break off a CSC so I cut the
battery<00:00:11.309> connectors<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.090> its<00:00:12.240> esc<00:00:12.809> and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
connections more solid so I did end it

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.109
