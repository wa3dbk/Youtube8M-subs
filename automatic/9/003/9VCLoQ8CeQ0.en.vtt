00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.780
 most open television chain that 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:09.350
 define to me understand it seems to me that it is 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:12.830
 because he is a huge player 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:16.040
 Today I'm coming, you 're going to be the best 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.830

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.230
 the big screen

 wason with a combination of scenes from 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.870
 fiction and real images unpublished the 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.650
 director Ã¡lex of the church about 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:34.160
 public the mysterious soccer star 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.739
 you see a player so close 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.100
 the documentary has the testimony 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.409
 of teachers and friends of messi as well as 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.010
 history soccer cracks like 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.690
 maradona cruyff iniesta or more was leo se 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.050
 I would have stayed in Argentina, I do not know if 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.330
 had come what follows not in full 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.940
 javier valdano sports whirlpools like 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.010
 screenwriter of the documentary has presented 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.949
 the film for the first time in river of 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.960
 good janeiro I said at some point that 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.510
 we had two problems one of months 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.759
 He had said all and said that Messi 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.370
 it does not say anything but 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.970
 frankly 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.310
 it seems to me heroic to keep 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.230
 in such a normal tone being a player 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.700
 so exceptional an anecdote that 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.170
 like it a lot when we teach the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.170
 documentary to the father of I need 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.299
 d 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.740
 much distrust thinking that the 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.840
 defensive look that brings us to 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.610
 question why they families very 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.210
 careful with the image are very 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.210
 hermetic 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.570
 we finished the documentary crying the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.140
 The footballer's family has already seen the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.920
