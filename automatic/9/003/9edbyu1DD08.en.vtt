00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.680
 in Spanish version 3.2 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.710
 hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.410
 delivery in this case it is a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.320
 short video to finish with 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.640
 the construction menu and see very by 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.640
 above the light menu 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.880
 we started watching how I finished my 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.190
 pizzeria as you see I have added a single and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.970
 given a touch of color to each of the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.960
 doors for the moment I'm finished 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.170
 the decoration 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.140
 at the end of the video delivery the most 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.079
 It is probable that I returned to this point and 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 Finish in more detail by adding new 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.010
 3d elements 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.790
 let's see the last six menu icons 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.790
 building 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.430
 you will see how they are common for all 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.700
 other menus except for the one 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.910
 documentation prove each of them 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.190
 they are so simple and intuitive that 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.940
 to determine would be to make you lose 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.940
 our time 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.210
 and with annotations will allow us 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.010
 incorporate dimension lines to our 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.640
 draft 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.680
 and with annotations you can include text 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.370
 with this icon 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.290
 and with reference lines the same thing 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.690
 allows you to draw referenced lines 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.250
 to help us at the time 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.190
 to draw along our 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.610
 draft 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.710
 icon or copy and order will allow us to 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.280
 reference the copies of the elements 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.620
 according to its different options icon 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.620
 we will use more than once 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.540
 icon views allows us to capture mode 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.180
 of image in the camera track of 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.960
 our project another icon that can 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.960
 be useful 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.290
 and cone synopsis of the project allows us 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.260
 see each of the inserted elements 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.550
 by their names our useful planes and 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.460
 designated areas 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.460
 with this we finish the construction menu 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.680
 let's start to see quickly the 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.829
 light menu 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.750
 the first icon luminaries this icon 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.930
 will help us insert in our model 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.610
 we will see the different luminaries in 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.430
 the next video tutorial 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.560
 the icon or lamps will show us the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.470
 luminous data assigned to it by the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.410
 lamp of a certain luminaire and 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.600
 Sometimes you can change them if 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.990
 well it is not advisable 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.840
 the edit joints icon for 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.120
 those opening luminaires indicate 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.330
 the opening of it and where it 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.050
 orients the luminous flux 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.050
 the filter icon treats the light by 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.690
 color filters the consumption icon of 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.870
 energy can inform us the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.110
 consumption of our luminaires 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.450
 and finally the six icons that already 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.440
 we have commented previously are 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.440
 common to all 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.480
 we have reached the end of this delivery 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.250
 in the next video we will place the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.870
 lights and we will start to see the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.810
 results go unloading luminaries 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.720
 to have them on hand and be able to place them 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.440
 in your projects I mine and
