00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.440
 most of that is a real problem 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.330
 that during reconstruction and renovation always 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.270
 reappears because the doors are 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.270
 bulky unwieldy and especially heavy 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.009
 to help with your own foot 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.570
 mostly not the desired success 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.000
 when you finally make it 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.199
 one of the door bender mount almost 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.629
 the other again does not end 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.489
 rarely with a pinched hand and 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.230
 often works only after several 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.690
 try a nuisance for everyone 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.089
 home improvement remedy that creates 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.309
 practical set of fried elements it 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.120
 consists of a lever bracket and a lever 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.120
 einfÃ¤delte 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.570
 you put the lever hanger between door 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.969
 and targearge and hang the door completely 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.720
 Easy out of the hanger is with silicone 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.259
 overdrawn 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.330
 so nothing can scratch around her again 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.390
 you plug in the slotted one 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.759
 remembered sleeve to the door leaf 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.190
 with the help of the lever, the door will be up 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.830
 but not lowered 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.840
 The door is now fixed up and you 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.189
 all you need is the lower turban 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.810
 Thread lifting strap and threading sleeve 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.810
 get done away 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.580
 Here you can see the process again 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.580

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.130
 not only when putting in and out of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.570
