 Team is good but we have now 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:01.500
 no consistency 1 to 20 to nine for me 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:07.140
 no matter it's three points lost it is 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.439
 6 teams all points forward to the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:16.080

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:19.490

 your statement about the game is good together 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.310
 I thought we had about 60 minutes one 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 Compact overall team performance 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.290
 delivered today 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.909
 we knew that we would benefit 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.130
 if we are a disciplined one 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.820
 contest position play that we have 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 also done and the team is doing in 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.790
 a great effort is great 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.659
 to implement in the game what we do in the week 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.979
 that means people in front of the goal 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.780
 the slice of all sorts 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.759
 to bring situations to the gate 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.780
 to get the shots through the power 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.090
 they are very good and easy to the goalkeeper 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.840
 to take 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.190
 we just play between tourism 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.330

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.920
