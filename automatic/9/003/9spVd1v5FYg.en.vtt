the<00:01:48.659> way<00:01:48.750> Lewis<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.320> thinking<00:01:49.619> he<00:01:49.770> has<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.040> be

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the way Lewis is thinking he has to be

the way Lewis is thinking he has to be
bluffing

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
bluffing

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.950 
bluffing
right<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.000> when<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.540> quads<00:01:51.810> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
right because when you have quads you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.740 
right because when you have quads you
have<00:01:52.049> all<00:01:52.170> cards<00:01:52.470> locked<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:53.540> in<00:01:54.540> step

Rivoli's right out in bets a full house
playing<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.360> well<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.079> something<00:01:58.259> I

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
playing it like well that's something I

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
playing it like well that's something I
would<00:01:58.530> never<00:01:58.649> do<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.070> spot<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> preflop

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
would never do in this spot to a preflop

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.660 
would never do in this spot to a preflop
raiser<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.799> let<00:02:01.799> him<00:02:01.920> take<00:02:02.040> once<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
raiser I let him take once to have the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.319 
raiser I let him take once to have the
bluff<00:02:02.850> at<00:02:03.060> it

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
bluff at it

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.959 
bluff at it
now<00:02:03.600> obviously<00:02:03.840> Lewis<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.850> thinking<00:02:05.850> he's

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
now obviously Lewis is thinking he's

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.370 
now obviously Lewis is thinking he's
died<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.329> gone<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> heaven<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:07.049> something

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
died and gone to heaven here something

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.510 
died and gone to heaven here something
he<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.530> can't<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.069> he's<00:02:08.190> also<00:02:08.369> thinking

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
he just can't but he's also thinking

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.609 
he just can't but he's also thinking
it's<00:02:08.940> got<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> bluff<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:09.899> Ace<00:02:10.050> 9<00:02:10.080> it

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
it's got to be a bluff for an Ace 9 it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.820 
it's got to be a bluff for an Ace 9 it
just<00:02:10.920> so

they're gonna try to out smoke way
jumping<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.239> from<00:03:28.959> here<00:03:29.110> out<00:03:29.320> like<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.370> would

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
jumping to from here out like that would

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.490 
jumping to from here out like that would
be<00:03:30.610> pieces<00:03:31.300> humble<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.720> would<00:03:31.989> be<00:03:32.200> amazed

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
be pieces humble and would be amazed

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.229 
be pieces humble and would be amazed
when<00:03:32.739> shockwave<00:03:33.250> ergos<00:03:33.489> checks<00:03:33.790> check<00:03:34.000> on<00:03:34.150> the

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
when shockwave ergos checks check on the

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.830 
when shockwave ergos checks check on the
turn<00:03:37.980> well<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.220> think<00:03:39.430> what's<00:03:39.820> what's<00:03:40.390> clear<00:03:40.810> is

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
turn well I think what's what's clear is

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.050 
turn well I think what's what's clear is
that<00:03:41.020> both<00:03:41.770> these<00:03:42.010> players<00:03:42.310> actually<00:03:42.820> think

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
that both these players actually think

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.300 
that both these players actually think
the<00:03:43.209> other<00:03:43.330> guy<00:03:43.570> has<00:03:43.810> nothing<00:03:44.110> kinda<00:03:45.100> trying

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
the other guy has nothing kinda trying

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.040 
the other guy has nothing kinda trying
to<00:03:45.459> right<00:03:45.910> they<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.510> know<00:03:46.630> that's<00:03:46.840> they're

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
the flop I mean that's the first thing I

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.439 
the flop I mean that's the first thing I
would<00:04:54.190> have<00:04:54.310> never<00:04:54.490> thought<00:04:54.610> guys<00:04:55.060> gonna<00:04:55.240> make

look<00:04:59.289> like<00:04:59.470> a<00:04:59.500> horrible<00:04:59.860> play<00:05:01.860> in<00:05:02.860> hindsight

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400
