00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.299 
with the caterpillars and one without so
just<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.630> give<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.929> comparison<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.710> course

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
just to give you a comparison of course

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.009

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.259 
this wasn't my favorite I like to use
the<00:00:13.170> turtle<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:13.740> more<00:00:14.009> as<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> child<00:00:14.519> because

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
the turtle one more as a child because

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.740 
the turtle one more as a child because
those<00:00:15.900> had<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> harder<00:00:16.590> time<00:00:16.619> coming<00:00:17.160> off

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
those had a harder time coming off

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.689 
those had a harder time coming off
because<00:00:18.750> after<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.279> here<00:00:20.550> I'll

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699

show you I like it starts to come off on
the<00:00:26.910> side<00:00:27.150> which<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.810> definitely<00:00:28.140> something<00:00:28.470> I

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that was definitely a factory area at

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.730 
that was definitely a factory area at
the<00:01:23.820> beginning<00:01:24.270> luckily<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.320> fixed<00:01:25.680> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
