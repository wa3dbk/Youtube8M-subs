life and I have a couple of gloves here
that<00:00:03.500> I<00:00:03.530> found<00:00:03.770> a<00:00:03.860> Sports<00:00:04.130> Authority<00:00:04.250> that

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:04.670 
that I found a Sports Authority that

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.840 
that I found a Sports Authority that
just<00:00:04.850> came<00:00:05.029> in<00:00:05.210> recently<00:00:05.589> and<00:00:06.589> these<00:00:07.520> actually

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850 
just came in recently and these actually

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.620 
just came in recently and these actually
may<00:00:08.000> be<00:00:08.030> older<00:00:08.450> models<00:00:08.810> I<00:00:09.020> don't<00:00:09.200> know<00:00:09.350> but

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:10.630 
may be older models I don't know but

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.800 
may be older models I don't know but
Rawlings<00:00:11.630> actually<00:00:11.960> doesn't<00:00:12.260> tend<00:00:12.440> to<00:00:13.810> bring

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:14.810 
Rawlings actually doesn't tend to bring

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.560 
Rawlings actually doesn't tend to bring
in<00:00:14.960> new<00:00:15.110> models<00:00:15.470> every<00:00:15.950> year<00:00:16.430> so<00:00:16.760> they<00:00:17.270> kind<00:00:17.510> of

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
in new models every year so they kind of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.400 
in new models every year so they kind of
overlap<00:00:19.270> but<00:00:20.270> anyway<00:00:20.600> whatever<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:21.050> case<00:00:21.200> may

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
overlap but anyway whatever the case may

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.740 
overlap but anyway whatever the case may
be<00:00:21.440> here<00:00:21.920> is<00:00:22.070> a<00:00:22.100> heart<00:00:22.789> of<00:00:22.940> the<00:00:23.000> hide<00:00:23.330> that

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:11.209 
and it is the iweb that so many call but

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:14.649 
and it is the iweb that so many call but
other<00:01:11.719> manufacturers<00:01:12.319> call<00:01:12.499> it<00:01:12.590> an<00:01:12.709> H<00:01:13.659> like

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
other manufacturers call it an H like

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.429 
other manufacturers call it an H like
Wilson<00:01:14.929> will<00:01:15.259> call<00:01:15.439> this<00:01:15.590> in<00:01:15.740> there<00:01:15.950> H<00:01:16.130> Webb<00:01:16.399> so

Wilson will call this in there H Webb so

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.410 
Wilson will call this in there H Webb so
anyway<00:01:18.439> this<00:01:18.590> is<00:01:18.649> primarily<00:01:19.639> middle<00:01:19.939> infield

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
anyway this is primarily middle infield

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.859 
anyway this is primarily middle infield
but<00:01:20.569> you<00:01:20.630> can<00:01:20.749> also<00:01:20.869> use<00:01:21.049> it<00:01:21.170> for<00:01:21.200> third<00:01:21.409> base

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
but you can also use it for third base

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.149 
but you can also use it for third base
if<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:23.929> like<00:01:24.170> smaller<00:01:24.469> goes<00:01:24.679> for<00:01:24.829> third<00:01:24.950> base

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
if you like smaller goes for third base

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.999 
if you like smaller goes for third base
especially<00:01:25.939> at<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.359> lower<00:01:26.509> age<00:01:26.719> ranges<00:01:27.969> and<00:01:30.009> I

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
especially at the lower age ranges and I

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.410 
especially at the lower age ranges and I
wouldn't<00:01:31.310> recommend<00:01:31.429> this<00:01:31.789> glove<00:01:32.029> for<00:01:32.209> maybe

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
wouldn't recommend this glove for maybe

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.569 
wouldn't recommend this glove for maybe
using<00:01:32.659> it<00:01:32.929> before<00:01:33.139> the<00:01:33.529> age<00:01:33.709> of<00:01:33.889> thirteen<00:01:34.429> or

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
using it before the age of thirteen or

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.749 
using it before the age of thirteen or
fourteen<00:01:35.889> the<00:01:36.889> ball<00:01:37.039> might<00:01:37.249> be<00:01:37.279> rolling<00:01:37.639> just

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
fourteen the ball might be rolling just

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.330 
fourteen the ball might be rolling just
too<00:01:37.999> slow<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.770> might<00:01:39.950> be<00:01:39.979> too<00:01:40.310> much

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
too slow and it might be too much

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.589 
too slow and it might be too much
leather<00:01:41.329> or<00:01:42.259> too<00:01:42.499> much<00:01:42.950> stiff<00:01:43.549> leather<00:01:43.789> for

leather or too much stiff leather for

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.859 
leather or too much stiff leather for

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
you to break in fast enough at ranges

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.120 
you to break in fast enough at ranges
where<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.289> balls<00:01:48.469> just<00:01:48.619> not<00:01:48.770> coming<00:01:48.950> that

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
and maybe just a little bit depending on

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.979 
and maybe just a little bit depending on
how<00:02:16.819> fast<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.150> need<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.420> break<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.629> just<00:02:17.900> a

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
how fast you need to break it just a

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
little bit of of conditioning a little

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.600 
little bit of of conditioning a little
bit<00:02:21.440> of<00:02:21.530> conditioner<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:24.190> that's<00:02:25.190> that<00:02:25.400> one

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610
