 behind the source 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.850

 Then you use creativity, but we 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.290
 did everything for her body to be 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.450
 would be more functional even if it had 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.170
 these two bases below it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.229
