00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
I guess so because I do have a few ideas

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.869 
I guess so because I do have a few ideas
but<00:05:48.590> it<00:05:48.710> still<00:05:48.889> did<00:05:49.099> not<00:05:49.129> really<00:05:49.490> have<00:05:49.669> time

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:55.069 
that's the right way to say it
