00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.709
 in this cooking class we will be one of the 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.600
 most famous Italian desserts of all 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.129
 times make tiramisu 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.600
 you would think a classic one 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.730
 actually it doesn't exist at all 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.290
 so long had been since the late 1960s 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.420
 tiramisu stands for the twentieth century 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.340
 the first on the menu of restaurant le 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.110
 beccaria in treviso 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.390
 that lies in veneto in the north of 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.670
 Italy but also prosecco comes from 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.900
 now there are a lot of variants 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.940
 Tiramisu 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.400
 today we make a classic tiramisu 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.680
 consisting of long finger coffee 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.910
 eggs sugar mascarpone whipped cream and 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.010
 cocoa powder 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.910
 as a variant we make fresh summery 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.910
 version with red fruit 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.899
 step 1 cover the bottom of the dish with 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.899
 half the long fingers 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.539
 mix 250 milliliters cooled stronger 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.550
 coffee 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.570
 the sweetest espresso with 50 milliliters 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.449
 Marsala 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.049
 This is a sweet Sicilian we can 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.000
 also 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.979
 amaretto tia maria or brown rum 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.110
 There are Italians who swear 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.509
 with tiramisu without alcohol 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.490
 you can also omit it and leave it alone 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.229
 use coffee if you don't like it 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.430
 pour half of the coffee massive 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.430
 mixture over the long fingers 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.050
 step 2 in this recipe work with raw 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.610
 Eggs 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.280
 for small children and pregnant woman 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.869
 this tiramisu is not to be recommended 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.729
 at least use it as fresh 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.140
 possibilities because this is most likely 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.390
 such a model from smallest 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.399
 split 4 eggs and then the egg yolks with 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.530
 50 grams of fine granulated sugar in the whisk 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.310
 the egg yolks will give the extra taste later 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.470
 and the mascarpone 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.280
 beat the five minutes with a mixer 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.280
 a light yellow cream 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.979
 we do not use the proteins but we can 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.000
 you freeze to leave for example 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.740
 meringues 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.330
 you can see how you do that in the video 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.330
 merengue is making a pavlova 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.640
 by two trays of mascarpone in total 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.700
 500 grams in a large bowl loose with a 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.700
 fork 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.050
 whisk 125 milliliters of whipped cream with 25 grams 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.050
 sugar stiff 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.880
 spatula the whipped cream and the egg grams like this 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.090
 airy and loosely possible through the 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.090
 mascarpone 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.400
 do this by folding and preferably not 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.400
 by stirring 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.820
 spoon half of the mixture over the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.010
 they put long fingers in italy in the 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.930
 do not arrange whipped cream in the visit 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.550
 sometimes whipped proteins with the 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.730
 make mascarpone a little lighter and 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.730
 lighter 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.300
 runs the rest of the long fingers one 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.410
 for about a second in the rest 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.950
 and the coffee and put them on it 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.950
 mascarpone mixture 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.050
 the rest of the mixture shone over the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.050
 long fingers 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.600
 dust the tiramisu with a sieve with 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.600
 cocoa 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.480
 You can also transfer the first layer which 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.860
 cocoa spreader for the extra chocolate 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.340
 taste with then you have two tablespoons 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.340
 required 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.780
 cover the tiramisu with cling film and 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.940
 put it in the fridge let a minimum 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.079
 You can certainly keep it up for 2 hours 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.000
 prepare it in connection with the 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.290
 shelf life not earlier than a day of 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 beforehand 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.730
 finally tiramisu literally means 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.690
 track or breakdown assistance in Italian 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.690
 it gives you energy 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.550
 the great thing about tiramisu is you 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.200
 can vary endlessly with 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.300
 long fingers and the creamy sweet 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.740
 mascarpone cream blends and actually 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.650
 good with everything 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.600
 fruit chocolate nuts or caramel 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.590
 can hardly fail in it is fast 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.120
 and easy to make 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.760
 it needs some time to get away with it 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.050
 but the advantage is that 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.540
 you get the dishes that day in advance 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.030
 can make in the variant we make one 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.610
 tiramisu with red fruit and tasty 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.970
 fresh summer version also very beautiful 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.970
 looks like 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:32.310
 step 1 to 2 boxes of frozen summer fruit 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.090
 with 50 grams of fine granulated sugar in one 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.470

 bring it to a boil and leave for 5 minutes 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.580
 by cooking over medium heat 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.139
 this is how you make a fruit coulis liquid 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.139
 got fruit 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.050
 step 2 meanwhile cover the bottom of the 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.849
 damage too long fingers in italy 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.449
 users and usually save spring hours 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.880
 and sometimes 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.830
 where we see sa spring those are what 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.900
 thicker and softer than our long fingers 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.190
 and few versions are just a bit thinner and 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.479
 harder 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.280
 divide the hot fruit coulis 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.660
 evenly over the long fingers and 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.660
 let cool to room temperature 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.130
 Spit 4 eggs and add egg yolks with 50 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.840

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.460
