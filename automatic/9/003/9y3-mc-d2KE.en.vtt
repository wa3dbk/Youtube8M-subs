00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.610
 secrets of their trademark 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.479
 I want to show some new shades 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.399
 who appeared in cosmetics I already 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.020
 tried was pleasantly surprised that I 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.479
 people show up in general 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.640
 trend makeup first of all what is 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.500
 touch you can apply as a dress 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.209
 you are satisfied with a long black 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.979
 dress in the floor in the afternoon you can wear 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:56.979
 wear it during the day it is from a state of mind 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.929
 my make-up feel with the presentation 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.879
 Ivan first is what I said 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.500
 that I have enough of me for me 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.540
 this is the eternal problem of these lipsticks which 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.150
 moisturize this lipstick is really very 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.940
 very soft and light it does not stick together 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.760
 there is no such feeling as shine yes 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.400
 when out of thickening on the dome but 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.230
 It is very very comfortable and in principle 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.359
 make-up on the face does not feel that is 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.500
 from under the elbow which many girls and 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.500
 read some makeup 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.540
 200 we talk about make-up then I try 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.819
 always highlight the eyes and since i have 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.530
 nature eyes set deep i mean 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.870
 this is some kind of highlight that is applied 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.410
 forever basically that's how we so 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.660
 made a presentation of his new line but also 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.650
 I, in principle, it is my makeup that is, 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:13.069
 highlighted certain centuries highlighted 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.069
 illuminated spool and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.030
 the most unusual makeup that I 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.700
 had to watch on your face was 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.310
 for symbian for shooting for japanese here 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.830
 we filmed under the water I completely 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.260
 removed eyebrows and we did not have such 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.170
 headgear which is after processing 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.790
 in the affected photoshop looked like 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.810
 as if the view from the hair is also on the head 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.989
 and at the same time would use such 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.560
 materials that were naturally here 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.400
 Pro because we are smalt when no more 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.549
 oily and 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.079
 and rather transitional skin tones like 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.209
 as if there was a feeling that it is 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.340
 mermaid only to this sea creature and 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.470
 it was very very interesting to put 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.900
 and even reflected in the mirror 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.900
 absolutely but we will not exceed the long form
