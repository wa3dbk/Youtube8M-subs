standing in front of a screen that is
green<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.119> then<00:00:18.480> editing<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> video<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.619> that

important<00:00:22.170> thing<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.289> remember<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.800> Bradbury

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
important thing to remember in Bradbury

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.769 
important thing to remember in Bradbury
in<00:00:23.220> screening<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> color<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.630> your

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
in screening is that the color of your

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.470 
in screening is that the color of your
screen<00:00:25.170> has<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.980> be<00:00:26.099> constant<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.330> any

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
screen has to be constant it can be any

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.359 
screen has to be constant it can be any
color<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.840> want<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.500> doesn't<00:00:28.769> match<00:00:29.070> any

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
color you want it just doesn't match any

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.950 
color you want it just doesn't match any
colors<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.970> are<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.210> your<00:00:30.330> subject<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.900> you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
colors that are on your subject that you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
colors that are on your subject that you
want<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.170> keep<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.619> mine<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.250> completely<00:00:32.640> green

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
want to keep in mine is completely green

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.610 
want to keep in mine is completely green
because<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> standard<00:00:33.870> green

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
because that is the standard green

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.069 
because that is the standard green
screen<00:00:35.130> color<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.090> can<00:00:36.149> use<00:00:36.390> blue<00:00:36.630> which<00:00:36.899> is

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
screen color it can use blue which is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.900 
screen color it can use blue which is
another<00:00:37.440> color<00:00:37.710> that's<00:00:37.950> very<00:00:38.460> very<00:00:38.670> common

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
another color that's very very common

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.990 
another color that's very very common
and<00:00:39.379> lighting<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.559> another<00:00:41.190> thing<00:00:41.700> that's

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
and lighting is another thing that's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.459 
and lighting is another thing that's
very<00:00:42.090> important<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.930> order<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
very important in order to get a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.560 
very important in order to get a
constant<00:00:44.010> color<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.370> your<00:00:44.520> screen<00:00:44.820> as<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.480> can

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
constant color on your screen as you can

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.420 
constant color on your screen as you can
probably<00:00:45.780> tell<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.200> now<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.379> part<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.309> my

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
probably tell right now this part of my

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
probably tell right now this part of my
face<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.090> highlighted<00:00:48.930> by<00:00:49.110> light<00:00:49.500> because

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
face is highlighted by light because

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.950 
face is highlighted by light because
there<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.430> window<00:00:50.850> right<00:00:51.510> here<00:00:51.539> with

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
there is a window right here with

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.170 
there is a window right here with
natural<00:00:52.440> light<00:00:52.469> coming<00:00:52.680> through<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.789> means

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
natural light coming through this means

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.490 
natural light coming through this means
that<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.449> shadow<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.930> costing<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> green

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that a shadow is costing the green

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.860 
that a shadow is costing the green
screen<00:00:55.739> about<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.420> shadow<00:00:57.660> this

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
screen about here but the shadow this

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.380 
screen about here but the shadow this
custom<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> isn't<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.070> bad<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.149> color

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
custom to it isn't so bad and the color

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.090 
custom to it isn't so bad and the color
of<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> screen<00:01:00.960> up<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.620> my<00:01:01.739> room<00:01:01.770> is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
of the screen up here in my room is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.250 
of the screen up here in my room is
pretty<00:01:02.370> constant<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.899> need<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.170> do

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
pretty constant so all you need to do

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.980 
pretty constant so all you need to do
now<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.530> take<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:05.570> now<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:06.900> what

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
now is take that out now you know what

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
now is take that out now you know what
green<00:01:07.200> screening<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.680> let's<00:01:08.040> go<00:01:08.310> over<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
green screening is let's go over to the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.760 
green screening is let's go over to the
editing<00:01:09.210> program<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.869> my<00:01:10.020> case<00:01:10.229> apple<00:01:10.470> motion

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
editing program in my case apple motion

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.429 
editing program in my case apple motion
see<00:01:11.520> how<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.820> done<00:01:11.909> oh<00:01:12.240> by<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.510> way<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:13.020> i'm

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
see how it's done oh by the way if i'm

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.260 
see how it's done oh by the way if i'm
not<00:01:13.560> using<00:01:13.710> apple<00:01:14.070> motion<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.670> effect<00:01:15.060> will

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
not using apple motion this effect will

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.230 
not using apple motion this effect will
work<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.720> things<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.020> Final<00:01:16.860> Cut<00:01:17.040> Pro<00:01:17.240> Sony

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
work in things like Final Cut Pro Sony

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.690 
work in things like Final Cut Pro Sony
Vegas<00:01:18.420> adobe<00:01:19.229> premiere<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.460> it'll<00:01:20.580> also

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
Vegas adobe premiere I think it'll also

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
Vegas adobe premiere I think it'll also
work<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.090> iMovie<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.930> how<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.320> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
work in iMovie if you know how to do it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
work in iMovie if you know how to do it
but<00:01:22.710> for<00:01:22.979> me<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.549> using<00:01:23.820> Apple<00:01:24.180> motion

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
but for me I'm using Apple motion

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.050 
but for me I'm using Apple motion
because<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.500> easiest<00:01:25.530> program<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.939> do

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
because it's the easiest program to do

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
because it's the easiest program to do
the<00:01:27.180> effect<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.810> my<00:01:28.080> opinion<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.680> have

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the effect in in my opinion which I have

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
the effect in in my opinion which I have
so<00:01:29.189> let's<00:01:29.640> go<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> motion<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.509> see<00:01:30.689> how<00:01:30.750> it's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
so let's go to motion to see how it's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.990 
so let's go to motion to see how it's
done<00:01:31.110> okay<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.369> are<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.520> apple<00:01:32.850> motion

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
done okay so here we are in apple motion

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.060 
done okay so here we are in apple motion
I'm<00:01:33.299> using<00:01:33.509> Apple<00:01:33.900> motion<00:01:34.049> version<00:01:34.619> 5<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
I'm using Apple motion version 5 it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.770 
I'm using Apple motion version 5 it
doesn't<00:01:35.280> matter<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:35.549> version<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.210> motion

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
doesn't matter what version of a motion

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.260 
doesn't matter what version of a motion
use<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.619> all<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.040> them<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> chroma

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
use I think all of them have the chroma

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.120 
use I think all of them have the chroma
key<00:01:39.450> effect<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.810> them<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.860> I'm<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
key effect in them so what I'm going to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.039 
key effect in them so what I'm going to
do<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.579> first<00:01:41.970> we're<00:01:42.210> going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.450> skim<00:01:42.899> through

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
do is first we're going to skim through

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.929 
do is first we're going to skim through
our<00:01:43.110> footage<00:01:43.500> make<00:01:43.799> sure<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.250> our<00:01:44.369> subject

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
our footage make sure that our subject

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.010 
our footage make sure that our subject
is<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.930> ah<00:01:46.200> does<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.430> off<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.360> screen<00:01:48.689> or

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
is not ah does not go off the screen or

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.499 
is not ah does not go off the screen or
another's<00:01:49.710> body<00:01:49.920> parts<00:01:50.369> go<00:01:50.939> out<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> range

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
another's body parts go out of the range

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.170 
another's body parts go out of the range
of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> green<00:01:52.140> behind<00:01:52.320> him<00:01:52.770> which<00:01:53.610> case<00:01:53.880> mine

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
of the green behind him which case mine

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.990 
of the green behind him which case mine
looks<00:01:54.450> okay<00:01:54.930> we're<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.250> first<00:01:56.790> of

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
looks okay we're going to do first of

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.370 
looks okay we're going to do first of
all<00:01:57.090> before<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.420> apply<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.810> chroma<00:01:58.140> key

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
all before we apply the chroma key

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.139 
all before we apply the chroma key
effect<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.979> we<00:01:59.219> aren't<00:01:59.430> going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.670> select<00:01:59.939> our

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
effect is we aren't going to select our

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.100 
effect is we aren't going to select our
clip<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.549> at<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.790> bezzie<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> mask<00:02:03.719> tool

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
clip and so at the bezzie a mask tool

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.899 
clip and so at the bezzie a mask tool
what<00:02:04.530> we're<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.799> do<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.399> was<00:02:05.579> just

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
what we're going to do now is was just

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.809 
what we're going to do now is was just
going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> draw<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.329> simple<00:02:06.600> mask<00:02:07.369> around<00:02:08.369> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
going to draw a simple mask around the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.150 
going to draw a simple mask around the
areas<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.959> green<00:02:10.470> screen<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:11.039> our

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
areas of the green screen that our

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
areas of the green screen that our
subject<00:02:11.730> does<00:02:11.940> not<00:02:12.120> go

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
subject does not go

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.569 
subject does not go
so<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.049> looks<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.409> looks<00:02:14.620> fine<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.340> make<00:02:15.549> a

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
so that looks that looks fine to make a

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.520 
so that looks that looks fine to make a
bit<00:02:16.120> simply<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.569> can<00:02:16.750> select<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.230> and

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
bit simply you can select this and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.130 
bit simply you can select this and
change<00:02:18.099> it<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.939> the<00:02:18.969> rectangle<00:02:19.629> mask<00:02:19.840> tool<00:02:20.079> i

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
change it to the rectangle mask tool i

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.539 
change it to the rectangle mask tool i
know<00:02:20.349> that's<00:02:20.530> even<00:02:20.799> an<00:02:20.890> even<00:02:21.099> simpler<00:02:21.370> thing

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
know that's even an even simpler thing

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.149 
know that's even an even simpler thing
to<00:02:21.670> do<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.079> all<00:02:23.230> right<00:02:23.409> for<00:02:23.439> now<00:02:23.650> so

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
to do but this is all right for now so

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.630 
to do but this is all right for now so
we're<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:24.340> going<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:25.980> make<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.129> mask<00:02:27.370> a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
we're just going to make the mask a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.339 
we're just going to make the mask a
little<00:02:28.239> bit<00:02:28.359> better<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.810> once<00:02:31.989> we<00:02:32.049> got<00:02:32.200> the

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
little bit better and once we got the

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.629 
little bit better and once we got the
masker<00:02:32.709> i<00:02:32.769> want<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.040> scrub<00:02:33.280> through<00:02:33.489> our

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:33.639 
masker i want to scrub through our

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.399 
masker i want to scrub through our
timeline<00:02:34.209> just<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.840> make<00:02:34.870> sure<00:02:35.019> that<00:02:35.349> our

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
timeline just to make sure that our

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.679 
timeline just to make sure that our
subject<00:02:35.829> does<00:02:35.980> not<00:02:36.250> go<00:02:36.609> out<00:02:36.879> of<00:02:36.909> range<00:02:37.359> of<00:02:37.510> the

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
subject does not go out of range of the

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.030 
subject does not go out of range of the
mask<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:39.599> yet<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.750> looks<00:02:40.930> about<00:02:41.019> okay<00:02:41.409> so

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
mask and yet that looks about okay so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
mask and yet that looks about okay so
we're<00:02:42.159> going<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.370> do<00:02:42.489> now<00:02:42.639> is<00:02:42.670> we're<00:02:42.909> going<00:02:43.000> to

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
the video where we want our Karama key

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.379 
the video where we want our Karama key
effect<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.169> star<00:02:47.470> in<00:02:47.500> which<00:02:47.709> case<00:02:47.980> it's<00:02:48.389> 18

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
effect to star in which case it's 18

seconds or one frame in when I snap my

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.550 
seconds or one frame in when I snap my
fingers<00:02:51.629> next<00:02:52.629> what<00:02:52.750> we're<00:02:52.870> going<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.049> do<00:02:53.260> is

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
fingers next what we're going to do is

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.979 
fingers next what we're going to do is
we<00:02:53.799> have<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.069> clip<00:02:54.250> selected<00:02:54.489> we<00:02:55.030> can<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.239> usually

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
we have a clip selected we can I usually

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.020 
we have a clip selected we can I usually
you'd<00:02:56.139> go<00:02:56.319> library<00:02:56.560> filters<00:02:57.250> keying<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.790> then

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
you'd go library filters keying and then

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.699 
you'd go library filters keying and then
key<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.510> then<00:02:58.599> just<00:02:58.780> drag<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.019> on<00:02:59.230> or<00:02:59.469> click

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
key and then just drag it on or click

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.619 
key and then just drag it on or click
apply<00:02:59.980> there's<00:03:00.730> an<00:03:00.819> easier<00:03:01.060> thing<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.239> do<00:03:01.419> if

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
apply there's an easier thing to do if

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.479 
apply there's an easier thing to do if
you<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:01.810> select<00:03:02.049> your<00:03:02.260> clip<00:03:02.500> go<00:03:03.069> down<00:03:03.250> here

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
you just select your clip go down here

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.869 
you just select your clip go down here
to<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.730> filter<00:03:04.000> menu<00:03:05.129> keying<00:03:06.129> and<00:03:06.430> then<00:03:06.579> care

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
to the filter menu keying and then care

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.449 
to the filter menu keying and then care
that's<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.049> quick<00:03:08.169> way<00:03:08.409> of<00:03:08.439> doing<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.799> so

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
that's just a quick way of doing it so

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.250 
that's just a quick way of doing it so
now<00:03:09.579> as<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.969> see<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.719> green<00:03:10.989> has<00:03:11.139> already

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
now as you see the green has already

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.809 
now as you see the green has already
been<00:03:11.469> taken<00:03:11.680> out<00:03:12.010> but<00:03:12.310> all<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.459> want<00:03:12.639> to<00:03:12.700> do<00:03:12.790> is

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
been taken out but all I want to do is

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.020 
been taken out but all I want to do is
we<00:03:12.969> want<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.150> go<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:13.480> inspector<00:03:14.079> and

we want to go to the inspector and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.879 
we want to go to the inspector and
select<00:03:16.030> sample<00:03:16.389> color<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:17.049> refine<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.590> key<00:03:17.769> as

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
select sample color to refine the key as

two summer color boxes it seems that

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.349 
two summer color boxes it seems that
every<00:03:59.889> single<00:04:00.040> bit<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.340> green<00:04:00.669> has<00:04:00.879> been<00:04:01.060> keyed

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
every single bit of green has been keyed

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.800 
every single bit of green has been keyed
out<00:04:01.739> part<00:04:02.739> from<00:04:03.009> I<00:04:03.250> think<00:04:03.549> I<00:04:03.699> can<00:04:03.909> see<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.120> tiny

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
out part from I think I can see a tiny

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.439 
out part from I think I can see a tiny
tiny<00:04:05.139> bit<00:04:05.290> just<00:04:06.280> above<00:04:06.489> my<00:04:06.759> head<00:04:09.060> right<00:04:10.060> there

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
tiny bit just above my head right there

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.530 
tiny bit just above my head right there
and<00:04:11.370> yep<00:04:12.370> all<00:04:12.579> the<00:04:12.609> green<00:04:12.879> has<00:04:13.000> been<00:04:13.150> keyed<00:04:13.389> out

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
and yep all the green has been keyed out

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.030 
and yep all the green has been keyed out
so<00:04:13.720> if<00:04:13.780> we<00:04:13.959> switch<00:04:14.259> off<00:04:14.439> the<00:04:14.560> keyer<00:04:14.769> that's

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
so if we switch off the keyer that's

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.469 
so if we switch off the keyer that's
well<00:04:15.189> it<00:04:15.310> right<00:04:15.459> beforehand<00:04:16.000> but<00:04:16.239> with<00:04:16.359> all

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
well it right beforehand but with all

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.420 
well it right beforehand but with all
the<00:04:16.570> boxes<00:04:16.959> for<00:04:17.709> in<00:04:17.769> place<00:04:17.949> in<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.190> sample

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
the boxes for in place in the sample

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.980 
the boxes for in place in the sample

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
starts where our cursor is and then and

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.790 
starts where our cursor is and then and
wherever<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.800> want<00:04:32.980> it<00:04:33.100> to<00:04:33.250> end<00:04:34.200> so<00:04:35.200> as<00:04:35.620> you

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
watch the video over and there you can

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.370 
watch the video over and there you can
see<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.300> chroma<00:05:25.630> key<00:05:25.810> effect<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:26.200> worked

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
see the chroma key effect it worked

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.080

really<00:05:26.470> well<00:05:26.620> you<00:05:26.770> may<00:05:27.070> need<00:05:27.190> to<00:05:27.310> fine-tune<00:05:27.580> it

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
really well you may need to fine-tune it

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.750 
really well you may need to fine-tune it
and<00:05:28.300> change<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.050> so<00:05:29.350> that's<00:05:29.620> right<00:05:30.370> up<00:05:30.430> here

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
and change it so that's right up here

probably<00:05:32.980> to<00:05:33.250> do<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.430> fact<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:33.700> it's<00:05:33.910> very

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
probably to do the fact that it's very

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.130 
probably to do the fact that it's very
very<00:05:34.360> dark<00:05:34.510> brown<00:05:34.870> and<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:35.170> lot<00:05:35.320> of<00:05:35.350> shadows<00:05:35.770> are

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
kind of in that color range but that is
