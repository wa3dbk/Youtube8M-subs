00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.560 
but yeah that's pretty much the only oh
and<00:00:25.800> also<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.430> right<00:00:26.580> here<00:00:26.820> it's<00:00:27.390> pretty

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and also this one right here it's pretty

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
and also this one right here it's pretty
obvious<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.470> um<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.150> don't<00:00:30.150> know<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:31.050> is

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.300 
either of those uh you know either the
radar<00:03:24.209> dish<00:03:24.419> or<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.169> dome<00:03:25.470> thing<00:03:25.829> you

radar dish or the the dome thing you

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.789 
radar dish or the the dome thing you
want<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.549> cook<00:03:26.730> one<00:03:27.209> pulse<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:28.019> pulse<00:03:28.290> run<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
want to cook one pulse to pulse run and

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.670 
want to cook one pulse to pulse run and
jump<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:30.090> should<00:03:30.299> land<00:03:30.450> right<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:31.049> me<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.560> one

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
jump it should land right on me that one

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.809 
jump it should land right on me that one
was<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.799> little<00:03:31.889> bit<00:03:32.250> if<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.459> would<00:03:32.609> have<00:03:32.669> cooked

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
was a little bit if I would have cooked

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.729 
was a little bit if I would have cooked
it<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.000> little<00:03:33.419> bit<00:03:33.660> longer<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.530> would<00:03:34.590> have

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
it a little bit longer it would have

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.110 
it a little bit longer it would have
been<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.859> little<00:03:35.130> bit<00:03:35.250> more<00:03:35.400> effective<00:03:35.819> or<00:03:35.940> if<00:03:36.030> I

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
been a little bit more effective or if I

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.370 
been a little bit more effective or if I
would<00:03:36.209> have<00:03:36.389> thrown<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.780> fraction<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.260> an

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
would have thrown in a fraction of an

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.629 
would have thrown in a fraction of an
inch<00:03:37.530> higher<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:38.010> would<00:03:38.280> have<00:03:38.400> been<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.519> little

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
inch higher it would have been a little

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.059 
inch higher it would have been a little
more<00:03:38.790> effective<00:03:39.269> but<00:03:39.419> even<00:03:39.630> right<00:03:39.780> there<00:03:40.069> that

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
more effective but even right there that

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.039 
more effective but even right there that
that's<00:03:41.669> gonna<00:03:41.970> kill<00:03:42.299> anybody<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.139> flag<00:03:43.639> so

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
that's gonna kill anybody on the flag so

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:50.240 
that's gonna kill anybody on the flag so
it's<00:03:46.049> uh<00:03:46.519> dolphin<00:03:47.519> Doug<00:03:47.760> off<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:49.470> cliff<00:03:49.680> let's

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
it's uh dolphin Doug off the cliff let's

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.729 
it's uh dolphin Doug off the cliff let's
get<00:03:50.489> us<00:03:50.609> our<00:03:51.079> camera<00:03:52.079> spike<00:03:52.290> back<00:03:52.500> let's

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
get us our camera spike back let's

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.059 
get us our camera spike back let's
switch<00:03:52.980> sides<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:54.750> got<00:03:54.900> two<00:03:55.169> over<00:03:55.500> here<00:03:55.680> one

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
switch sides and I got two over here one

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.809 
switch sides and I got two over here one
is<00:03:56.810> actually<00:03:57.810> on<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.590> B<00:03:58.709> flag<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.370> then<00:03:59.579> one

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
is actually on the B flag and then one

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.650 
is actually on the B flag and then one
is<00:04:00.030> kind<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:01.220> near<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.400> B<00:04:02.549> flag<00:04:02.849> but<00:04:03.209> more<00:04:03.419> for

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
is kind of near the B flag but more for

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.509 
is kind of near the B flag but more for
those<00:04:03.810> stairs<00:04:04.200> I'm<00:04:04.950> going<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.160> show<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> one

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
those stairs I'm going to show the one

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.439 
those stairs I'm going to show the one
that's<00:04:05.730> on<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:05.879> B<00:04:06.090> flag<00:04:06.359> first<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:08.449> right

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
that's on the B flag first and right

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.330 
that's on the B flag first and right
here<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:10.230> want<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.500> be<00:04:10.590> up<00:04:10.799> kind<00:04:11.129> of<00:04:11.160> up

here you want to be up kind of up

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.390 
here you want to be up kind of up
against<00:04:11.639> these<00:04:11.790> barrels<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.359> guys<00:04:13.139> these

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
against these barrels and guys these

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.800 
against these barrels and guys these
like<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.519> flag<00:04:14.760> indicators<00:04:15.389> are<00:04:15.569> very

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
like the flag indicators are very

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.900 
like the flag indicators are very
important<00:04:16.289> when<00:04:16.410> trying<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.709> hit<00:04:16.859> nades<00:04:17.669> like

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
important when trying to hit nades like

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.250 
important when trying to hit nades like
this<00:04:18.120> you<00:04:18.329> want<00:04:18.539> to<00:04:18.599> use<00:04:18.750> those<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.169> your

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
this you want to use those to your

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.949 
this you want to use those to your
advantage<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.919> want<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.430> aim<00:04:20.549> right<00:04:21.209> about<00:04:21.630> in

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
advantage you want to aim right about in

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.010 
advantage you want to aim right about in
the<00:04:22.109> middle<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.740> this<00:04:23.300> lamppost<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.599> a<00:04:24.690> little

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
the middle of this lamppost and a little

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.470 
the middle of this lamppost and a little
bit<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.320> left<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.650> be

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
bit to the left to be

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.890 
bit to the left to be
one<00:04:26.570> grenade<00:04:26.840> -<00:04:27.020> grenades<00:04:27.350> run<00:04:27.710> jump<00:04:28.900> should

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
one grenade - grenades run jump should

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.590 
one grenade - grenades run jump should
land<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.410> one<00:04:30.560> landed<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.920> little<00:04:31.220> bit<00:04:31.550> far<00:04:31.820> so

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
land that one landed a little bit far so

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.400 
land that one landed a little bit far so
if<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:33.050> just<00:04:33.230> aim<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.440> little<00:04:33.680> bit<00:04:33.830> higher<00:04:35.410> one

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
if you just aim a little bit higher one

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.980 
if you just aim a little bit higher one
pulse<00:04:36.680> -<00:04:37.010> pulse<00:04:37.280> run<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.000> jump<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.750> should

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
pulse - pulse run and jump that should

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.600 
pulse - pulse run and jump that should
land<00:04:39.170> pretty<00:04:39.530> much<00:04:39.650> right<00:04:39.830> on<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.070> flag<00:04:40.280> see

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
land pretty much right on the flag see

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.860 
land pretty much right on the flag see
know<00:04:40.970> it<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:41.240> that<00:04:41.360> was<00:04:41.480> pretty<00:04:41.630> much<00:04:41.750> perfect

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
know it so that was pretty much perfect

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.050 
know it so that was pretty much perfect
a<00:04:42.770> little<00:04:43.160> bit<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.640> right<00:04:43.670> would<00:04:43.970> have

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
a little bit to the right would have

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.180 
a little bit to the right would have
probably<00:04:44.270> been<00:04:44.450> better<00:04:44.630> but<00:04:44.960> again<00:04:45.200> grenade

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
probably been better but again grenade

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.620 
probably been better but again grenade
right<00:04:46.400> there<00:04:46.640> people<00:04:46.880> right<00:04:47.180> there

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
right there people right there

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
right there people right there
they<00:04:48.020> got<00:04:48.170> no<00:04:48.350> shot<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:50.690> last<00:04:51.140> one<00:04:51.410> I<00:04:51.440> want

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
they got no shot and the last one I want

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.560 
they got no shot and the last one I want
to<00:04:51.740> show<00:04:51.920> you<00:04:51.980> is<00:04:52.340> actually<00:04:52.670> by<00:04:53.150> far<00:04:53.420> the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
to show you is actually by far the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.380 
to show you is actually by far the
hardest<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:54.170> actually<00:04:54.500> get<00:04:54.740> on<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:54.950> flag<00:04:55.390> I've

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
hardest to actually get on the flag I've

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.870 
hardest to actually get on the flag I've
only<00:04:56.570> managed<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.170> do<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.470> once<00:04:57.880> during

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
only managed to do it once during

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.400 
only managed to do it once during
practice<00:04:59.390> I've<00:04:59.540> been<00:04:59.660> practice<00:05:00.110> every

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
practice I've been practice every

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.970 
practice I've been practice every
practice<00:05:00.800> in<00:05:00.890> for<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.070> little<00:05:01.160> while<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:03.440> I've

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
practice in for a little while and I've

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.370 
practice in for a little while and I've
only<00:05:04.160> managed<00:05:04.520> to<00:05:04.580> do<00:05:04.640> it<00:05:04.760> once<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.380> because

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
only managed to do it once and because

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.360 
only managed to do it once and because
since<00:05:06.680> then<00:05:06.830> it's<00:05:06.980> been<00:05:07.070> pretty<00:05:07.280> much

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
since then it's been pretty much

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.860 
since then it's been pretty much
impossible<00:05:07.760> most<00:05:08.270> of<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.450> time<00:05:08.600> it's<00:05:08.750> hell

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
impossible most of the time it's hell

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.780 
impossible most of the time it's hell
land<00:05:09.050> either<00:05:09.200> right<00:05:09.470> there<00:05:09.770> or<00:05:10.010> behind

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
land either right there or behind

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.520 
land either right there or behind
because<00:05:11.210> of<00:05:11.390> the<00:05:11.570> way<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.840> roof<00:05:12.050> is<00:05:12.230> shaped

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
because of the way the roof is shaped

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.670 
because of the way the roof is shaped
it's<00:05:13.190> got<00:05:13.430> to<00:05:13.550> be<00:05:13.700> a<00:05:14.020> perfect<00:05:15.020> grenade<00:05:15.290> but

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
it's got to be a perfect grenade but

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.980 
it's got to be a perfect grenade but
it's<00:05:16.040> from<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.460> you<00:05:16.910> can<00:05:17.060> do<00:05:17.210> it<00:05:17.330> as<00:05:17.450> your<00:05:17.660> Cap'n

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
it's from a you can do it as your Cap'n

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.560 
it's from a you can do it as your Cap'n
a<00:05:18.340> what<00:05:19.340> you<00:05:19.430> do<00:05:19.610> is<00:05:19.820> you're<00:05:19.940> gonna<00:05:20.000> throw<00:05:20.390> it

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
a what you do is you're gonna throw it

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.300 
a what you do is you're gonna throw it
in<00:05:21.200> that<00:05:21.260> area<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:22.280> it's<00:05:23.320> one<00:05:24.320> pulse<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:25.040> pulse

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
in that area and it's one pulse to pulse

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.690 
in that area and it's one pulse to pulse
run<00:05:25.610> and<00:05:25.790> jump<00:05:25.940> and<00:05:26.480> that<00:05:26.600> one's<00:05:26.780> pretty<00:05:27.020> easy

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
run and jump and that one's pretty easy

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.100 
run and jump and that one's pretty easy
but<00:05:28.700> like<00:05:28.970> I<00:05:29.060> said<00:05:29.300> it's<00:05:29.450> gonna<00:05:29.570> land<00:05:29.840> if<00:05:30.080> you

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
but like I said it's gonna land if you

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.530 
but like I said it's gonna land if you
want<00:05:30.350> it<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.500> land<00:05:30.710> on<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:30.980> stairs<00:05:31.540> all

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
want it to land on the stairs all

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.360 
want it to land on the stairs all
impulse<00:05:32.960> to<00:05:33.200> pulse<00:05:33.440> run<00:05:33.680> and<00:05:33.830> jump<00:05:33.980> aim<00:05:34.340> a

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
impulse to pulse run and jump aim a

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.160 
impulse to pulse run and jump aim a
little<00:05:34.610> bit<00:05:34.760> further<00:05:35.060> right<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.960> it<00:05:36.080> should

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
little bit further right and it should

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.110 
little bit further right and it should
land<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:36.770> one<00:05:36.890> actually<00:05:37.010> landed<00:05:37.910> on<00:05:38.030> the

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
land that one actually landed on the

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.490 
land that one actually landed on the
roof<00:05:38.300> but<00:05:38.810> you<00:05:39.430> can<00:05:40.430> get<00:05:40.790> it<00:05:40.940> into<00:05:41.360> B<00:05:41.930> but<00:05:42.380> it's

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
roof but you can get it into B but it's

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.800 
roof but you can get it into B but it's
very<00:05:42.830> hard<00:05:43.130> it's<00:05:43.490> better<00:05:43.790> to<00:05:44.300> try<00:05:44.510> and<00:05:44.540> just

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
very hard it's better to try and just

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.440 
very hard it's better to try and just
land<00:05:45.170> it<00:05:45.350> on<00:05:45.440> these<00:05:45.530> stairs<00:05:46.000> maybe<00:05:47.000> right<00:05:47.270> off

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
land it on these stairs maybe right off

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.060 
land it on these stairs maybe right off
