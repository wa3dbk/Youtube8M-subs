distinct modes on it overdrive in the
top<00:00:32.610> position<00:00:33.110> then<00:00:34.110> boost<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.680> middle

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950

top position then boost in the middle
and<00:00:35.130> distortion<00:00:36.120> as<00:00:36.960> well<00:00:37.350> as<00:00:37.620> two<00:00:38.070> dip

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and distortion as well as two dip

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.060 
and distortion as well as two dip
switches<00:00:38.550> inside<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:40.020> pot<00:00:40.290> inside<00:00:40.739> those

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.940 
switches inside and a pot inside those
are<00:00:41.430> untouched<00:00:42.120> as<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.600> comes<00:00:42.809> stock<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.920> I

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
are untouched as it comes stock so I

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.400 
are untouched as it comes stock so I
believe<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> means<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.879> full<00:00:45.539> range<00:00:45.840> or<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
believe that means the full range or the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.350 
believe that means the full range or the
low<00:00:46.590> end<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.910> switch<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:51.210> way

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
low end is a switch is in the the way

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.910 
low end is a switch is in the the way
that<00:00:51.390> he<00:00:51.600> ships<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.739> much

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
that he ships it so it's not as much

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.310 
that he ships it so it's not as much
low-end<00:00:53.370> there's<00:00:53.550> more<00:00:53.730> capable<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.449> as

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
low-end there's more capable in it as

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.660 
low-end there's more capable in it as
well<00:00:55.530> as<00:00:55.710> there's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.949> compression<00:00:56.280> switch

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
well as there's a compression switch

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.000 
well as there's a compression switch
that<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.270> off<00:00:57.590> apparently<00:00:58.590> it's<00:00:58.890> more

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that is off apparently it's more

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.970 
that is off apparently it's more
noticeable<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.579> distortion<00:01:00.239> mode<00:01:00.449> and

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
noticeable in the distortion mode and

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.329 
noticeable in the distortion mode and
the<00:01:01.980> treble<00:01:02.910> pot<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.510> inside<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the treble pot that's inside is in the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.310 
the treble pot that's inside is in the
original<00:01:05.460> position<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.180> well<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.200> how

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
original position as well so this is how

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.969 
original position as well so this is how
you<00:01:07.380> get<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> from<00:01:07.979> analog<00:01:08.909> Mike<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.979> so

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
you get it from analog Mike and so

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.140 
you get it from analog Mike and so
here's<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.520> bit<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.850> clean<00:01:12.060> tone

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:25.350 

Oh

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.250 

I'm<00:01:25.750> using<00:01:26.200> my<00:01:27.210> Fender<00:01:28.210> Custom<00:01:28.240> Shop<00:01:28.570> Esquire

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
I'm using my Fender Custom Shop Esquire

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.010 
I'm using my Fender Custom Shop Esquire
with<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.530> Lawler<00:01:30.090> bridge<00:01:31.090> pickup<00:01:31.510> in<00:01:31.690> it<00:01:31.840> and

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
with a Lawler bridge pickup in it and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.150 
with a Lawler bridge pickup in it and
swart<00:01:33.010> ast<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.140> I'm<00:01:35.140> going<00:01:35.530> through<00:01:35.680> my<00:01:35.860> board

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
swart ast and I'm going through my board

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.960 
swart ast and I'm going through my board
and<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.680> there<00:01:38.830> should<00:01:39.040> be<00:01:39.070> no<00:01:39.160> tone<00:01:39.520> loss<00:01:39.760> so

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
and but there should be no tone loss so

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.590 
and but there should be no tone loss so
anyways<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:45.280> prince<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.090> tone<00:01:46.300> in

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
anyways here is the prince of tone in

00:01:46.600 --> 00:02:23.099 
anyways here is the prince of tone in
boost<00:01:46.870> mode

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:57.950 

switching<00:02:24.109> switching<00:02:24.980> now<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.579> OD<00:02:25.879> mode

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:39.520 

and<00:02:59.340> here<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:01.350> distortion<00:03:02.350> mode

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:04:08.259 

I'll<00:03:39.620> try<00:03:40.219> one<00:03:40.659> boost<00:03:50.889> and<00:03:51.909> in<00:03:52.909> the<00:03:53.030> OTO<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:07.269> in

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
I'll try one boost and in the OTO and in

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:24.550 
I'll try one boost and in the OTO and in
the<00:04:08.480> distortion<00:04:09.319> I<00:04:23.139> hope<00:04:24.139> it<00:04:24.259> gives<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:24.530> a

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
the distortion I hope it gives you a

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.719 
the distortion I hope it gives you a
little<00:04:24.740> bit<00:04:24.949> of<00:04:25.009> an<00:04:25.160> idea

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
little bit of an idea

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.689 
little bit of an idea
I<00:04:25.759> like<00:04:26.599> the<00:04:26.750> boost<00:04:27.020> mode<00:04:27.320> pretty<00:04:28.310> much<00:04:28.490> the

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
I like the boost mode pretty much the

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.719 
I like the boost mode pretty much the
knobs<00:04:28.910> in<00:04:29.180> this<00:04:29.300> position<00:04:30.340> it's<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.400> little<00:04:31.639> bit

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
knobs in this position it's a little bit

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.320 
knobs in this position it's a little bit
louder<00:04:31.970> than<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.330> clean<00:04:32.539> tone<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:33.020> Sahara<00:04:33.500> loader

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
louder than a clean tone a Sahara loader

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.110 
louder than a clean tone a Sahara loader
great<00:04:35.330> pedal<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:36.440> think<00:04:36.830> they're<00:04:36.949> 136<00:04:37.729> brand

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
great pedal I think they're 136 brand

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.439 
great pedal I think they're 136 brand
new<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.990> little<00:04:39.530> hard<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:39.860> get<00:04:40.009> right<00:04:40.190> now<00:04:40.449> but

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
new a little hard to get right now but

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.839 
new a little hard to get right now but
as<00:04:41.599> supply<00:04:42.020> increases<00:04:42.590> he'll<00:04:43.490> be<00:04:43.610> putting

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
as supply increases he'll be putting

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.460 
as supply increases he'll be putting
more<00:04:44.000> on<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.210> website<00:04:44.360> if<00:04:44.780> they're<00:04:45.320> on<00:04:45.440> the

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
more on the website if they're on the

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.100 
more on the website if they're on the
analog<00:04:45.830> band<00:04:46.099> website<00:04:46.250> then<00:04:46.729> you<00:04:46.759> can<00:04:46.909> and<00:04:47.270> put

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
analog band website then you can and put

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.950
