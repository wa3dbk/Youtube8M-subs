that<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.049> tastes<00:01:46.290> bitter<00:01:46.470> or<00:01:46.830> if<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.880> use<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.240> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that it tastes bitter or if you use it a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
that it tastes bitter or if you use it a
lot<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.900> will<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.409> give<00:01:49.650> you<00:01:49.740> a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
lot that it will like give you a

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.620 
lot that it will like give you a
headache<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.250> something<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.790> apparently

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
headache or something and apparently

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.359 
headache or something and apparently
that's<00:01:52.080> based<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.470> when<00:01:52.650> you<00:01:52.740> harvest<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
that's based on when you harvest it the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.700 
that's based on when you harvest it the
first<00:01:53.580> this<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:54.000> three-week<00:01:54.450> window<00:01:54.560> if<00:01:55.560> you

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
first this like three-week window if you

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.140 
first this like three-week window if you
harvest<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.189> within<00:01:56.400> that<00:01:56.580> window<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
harvest it within that window and

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.030 
harvest it within that window and
actually<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.750> good<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.290> tastes<00:01:58.590> good<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.950> be

actually be good and tastes good and be
good<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.400> you<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.700> if<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.939> outside<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.329> that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
good for you and if it's outside of that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.030 
good for you and if it's outside of that
through<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.750> window<00:02:01.110> that's<00:02:01.140> when<00:02:01.650> it<00:02:01.770> starts

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
through a window that's when it starts

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.219 
through a window that's when it starts
to<00:02:02.159> get<00:02:02.250> bitter<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.970> leave<00:02:03.869> things<00:02:04.079> in

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
to get bitter and and leave things in

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.429 
to get bitter and and leave things in
your<00:02:04.380> system<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.610> he's<00:02:05.790> done<00:02:06.200> all<00:02:07.200> this

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
your system so he's done all this

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.050 
your system so he's done all this
research<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.069> here's<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.519> he<00:02:08.700> puts<00:02:08.939> in

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
research and here's what he puts in

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.179 
research and here's what he puts in
chocolate<00:02:09.420> lists<00:02:09.689> so<00:02:10.319> first<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.069> most

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:11.189 
chocolate lists so first and most

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.100 
chocolate lists so first and most
important<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.880> mine<00:02:12.420> gold<00:02:12.780> cacao<00:02:13.170> powder

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
important is mine gold cacao powder

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.800 
important is mine gold cacao powder
so<00:02:14.290> cacao<00:02:14.740> meaning<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.550> part<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.360> cocoa

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
so cacao meaning the part of the cocoa

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.630 
so cacao meaning the part of the cocoa
plant<00:02:17.110> that's<00:02:17.350> what<00:02:17.620> your<00:02:17.860> chocolate<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.490> made

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
plant that's what your chocolate is made

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.130 
plant that's what your chocolate is made
from<00:02:18.880> it's<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.420> it's<00:02:19.540> heated<00:02:19.930> which

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
from it's just that it's heated which

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.320 
from it's just that it's heated which
then<00:02:20.410> turns<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.220> into<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.490> stimulant<00:02:21.940> instead

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
then turns it into a stimulant instead

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.060 
then turns it into a stimulant instead
of<00:02:22.450> staying<00:02:22.660> in<00:02:22.810> adaptogenic<00:02:23.440> where<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.890> can

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
of staying in adaptogenic where you can

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.580 
of staying in adaptogenic where you can
focus<00:02:24.430> or<00:02:24.760> be<00:02:24.880> in<00:02:24.940> bliss<00:02:25.180> whichever<00:02:25.960> you<00:02:26.470> want

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
focus or be in bliss whichever you want

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
focus or be in bliss whichever you want
to<00:02:26.710> focus<00:02:26.830> on<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:29.200> cacao<00:02:29.650> powder<00:02:29.950> becomes

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
to focus on and the cacao powder becomes

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.190 
to focus on and the cacao powder becomes
kind<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.060> carrier<00:02:31.450> or<00:02:31.810> all<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.170> other

kind of a carrier or all the other

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.840 
kind of a carrier or all the other
really<00:02:32.740> good<00:02:32.830> nutrients<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.460> are<00:02:33.520> in<00:02:33.670> here

but we don't notice it we don't notice
any<00:02:57.580> aftertaste<00:02:58.060> because<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.630> cacao<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.110> such

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
any aftertaste because the cacao is such

any aftertaste because the cacao is such
a<00:02:59.350> strong<00:02:59.620> flavor<00:03:00.840> has<00:03:01.840> hemp<00:03:02.140> seeds<00:03:02.440> which<00:03:02.680> are

a strong flavor has hemp seeds which are
really<00:03:02.980> great<00:03:03.250> for<00:03:03.550> essential<00:03:04.030> fatty<00:03:04.180> acids

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
really great for essential fatty acids

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.740 
really great for essential fatty acids
and<00:03:04.720> protein<00:03:05.310> coconut<00:03:06.310> flour<00:03:06.550> that's<00:03:07.180> free<00:03:07.720> of

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
and protein coconut flour that's free of

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.229 
and protein coconut flour that's free of
mounted<00:03:08.380> extra<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.130> sodium<00:03:09.370> caseinate<00:03:09.700> so

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
mounted extra and sodium caseinate so

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.750 
mounted extra and sodium caseinate so
often<00:03:10.830> coconut<00:03:11.830> flour<00:03:11.950> might<00:03:12.190> have<00:03:12.430> Malkin

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
often coconut flour might have Malkin

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.430 
often coconut flour might have Malkin
sugar<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.570> so<00:03:13.690> he's<00:03:13.840> making<00:03:13.989> sure<00:03:14.260> that

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
sugar in it and so he's making sure that

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.970 
sugar in it and so he's making sure that
it's<00:03:14.560> very<00:03:14.680> pure<00:03:15.900> rhodiola<00:03:16.900> rosea<00:03:17.020> so<00:03:17.800> that's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
it's very pure rhodiola rosea so that's

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.820 
it's very pure rhodiola rosea so that's
one<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.340> adaptogens<00:03:19.120> it's<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.320> plant

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
one of the adaptogens it's a plant

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.220 
one of the adaptogens it's a plant
that's<00:03:20.950> used<00:03:21.489> in<00:03:21.700> Asia<00:03:21.940> much<00:03:22.540> like<00:03:22.810> coca

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
that's used in Asia much like coca

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.130 
that's used in Asia much like coca
leaves<00:03:23.590> are<00:03:23.830> used<00:03:24.070> in<00:03:24.430> South<00:03:24.840> used<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:25.959> South

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
leaves are used in South used in South

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.940 
leaves are used in South used in South
America<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:26.830> it's<00:03:27.330> helping<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.799> open<00:03:29.799> your

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
America so it's helping to open your

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.580 
America so it's helping to open your
respiratory<00:03:30.340> system<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:31.030> basically<00:03:31.989> get<00:03:32.320> more

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
respiratory system to basically get more

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
bronchial passages and it makes you feel

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.160 
bronchial passages and it makes you feel
blissful<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:39.910> it's<00:03:40.269> strongly<00:03:41.049> Easter<00:03:43.170> Makka

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
blissful and it's strongly Easter Makka

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.289 
blissful and it's strongly Easter Makka
which<00:03:44.350> I<00:03:44.470> mentioned<00:03:44.700> his<00:03:45.700> process<00:03:46.060> for<00:03:46.209> making

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
which I mentioned his process for making

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.000 
which I mentioned his process for making
sure<00:03:46.570> that<00:03:46.840> it's<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:47.049> high<00:03:47.200> quality<00:03:47.230> Makkah<00:03:47.860> and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
sure that it's a high quality Makkah and

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.949 
sure that it's a high quality Makkah and
that's<00:03:48.220> another<00:03:48.519> adaptogen<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:49.450> lots<00:03:49.810> of

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
that's another adaptogen so lots of

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.360 
that's another adaptogen so lots of
great<00:03:50.230> things<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.560> help<00:03:50.830> you<00:03:50.920> focus<00:03:51.130> your

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
great things that help you focus your

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.710 
great things that help you focus your
stainless<00:03:53.310> set<00:03:54.310> afire<00:03:54.549> salt<00:03:54.970> so<00:03:55.209> this<00:03:55.360> is<00:03:55.390> his

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
stainless set afire salt so this is his

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.759 
stainless set afire salt so this is his
own<00:03:55.959> blend<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.890> four<00:03:57.280> different<00:03:57.459> salts<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:58.780> I

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
own blend of four different salts that I

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.850 
own blend of four different salts that I
think<00:04:00.280> there's<00:04:00.610> one<00:04:01.060> from<00:04:01.570> sea<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.170> or<00:04:02.650> two

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
think there's one from sea and or two

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.240 
think there's one from sea and or two
from<00:04:03.010> sea<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.519> two<00:04:03.640> from<00:04:03.790> land<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:05.140> we'll<00:04:05.980> go

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
from sea and two from land and we'll go

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.490 
from sea and two from land and we'll go
into<00:04:06.280> more<00:04:06.549> detail<00:04:07.030> on<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.150> on<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.350> another

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
into more detail on that on and another

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.140 
into more detail on that on and another

super food tasting night but suffice to

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.539 
super food tasting night but suffice to

rebuilding tissue bio pureeing I think

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.659 
rebuilding tissue bio pureeing I think
that's<00:04:36.050> how<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.229> say<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.440> which<00:04:37.130> is<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.310> black

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
that's how you say it which is a black

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.330 
that's how you say it which is a black
pepper<00:04:38.000> extract<00:04:38.600> that's<00:04:39.350> also<00:04:39.590> helpful<00:04:40.070> and

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
pepper extract that's also helpful and

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.860 
pepper extract that's also helpful and

Madagascar<00:04:48.020> and<00:04:48.199> it's<00:04:48.350> going<00:04:48.560> through<00:04:48.830> this

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
Madagascar and it's going through this

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.090 
Madagascar and it's going through this
really<00:04:49.940> extensive<00:04:50.510> process<00:04:50.840> for<00:04:51.410> writing<00:04:52.010> it

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
really extensive process for writing it

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.270 
really extensive process for writing it
down<00:04:52.130> into<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.610> powder<00:04:52.850> so<00:04:53.240> they<00:04:53.449> basically<00:04:53.660> are

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
down into a powder so they basically are

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.830 
down into a powder so they basically are
getting<00:04:55.280> from<00:04:55.430> Madagascar<00:04:55.970> going<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.389> Germany

it grinds it dries it grinds it about

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.710 
it grinds it dries it grinds it about
five<00:05:05.630> or<00:05:05.780> six<00:05:05.930> times<00:05:06.340> and<00:05:07.340> it's<00:05:07.669> pure<00:05:08.180> 10

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
five or six times and it's pure 10

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.420 
five or six times and it's pure 10
percent<00:05:09.050> vanilla<00:05:09.289> whereas<00:05:09.680> oftentimes<00:05:10.190> if

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
percent vanilla whereas oftentimes if

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.189 
percent vanilla whereas oftentimes if
you<00:05:10.520> go<00:05:10.669> to<00:05:10.729> grocery<00:05:11.090> store<00:05:11.449> you<00:05:11.479> buy<00:05:11.900> vanilla

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
you go to grocery store you buy vanilla

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.020 
you go to grocery store you buy vanilla
powder<00:05:12.470> it's<00:05:12.860> mostly<00:05:13.250> sugar<00:05:13.460> with<00:05:13.789> some

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
powder it's mostly sugar with some

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.659 
powder it's mostly sugar with some
fennel<00:05:14.210> powder<00:05:14.570> in<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.919> this<00:05:16.039> is<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.430> pure

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
fennel powder in it so this is the pure

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.580 
fennel powder in it so this is the pure
stuff<00:05:18.190> carob<00:05:19.190> which<00:05:19.639> is<00:05:19.940> a<00:05:20.419> natural<00:05:20.690> companion

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
stuff carob which is a natural companion

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.430 
stuff carob which is a natural companion
to<00:05:21.740> cacao<00:05:22.099> so<00:05:22.820> cacao<00:05:23.240> is<00:05:23.510> really<00:05:23.900> high<00:05:24.080> in

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
to cacao so cacao is really high in

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.890 
to cacao so cacao is really high in
magnesium<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:25.310> carob<00:05:25.699> is<00:05:25.910> high<00:05:26.150> in<00:05:26.479> calcium

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
magnesium and carob is high in calcium

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.189 
magnesium and carob is high in calcium
and<00:05:27.349> it<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.849> Cal<00:05:29.030> see<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.479> high<00:05:29.660> calcium<00:05:29.900> acts

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
and it the Cal see the high calcium acts

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.580 
and it the Cal see the high calcium acts
as<00:05:30.380> a<00:05:30.410> natural<00:05:30.530> sweetener<00:05:31.220> as<00:05:31.580> well

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
as a natural sweetener as well

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.159 
as a natural sweetener as well
tocotrienols<00:05:33.729> which<00:05:34.729> are<00:05:35.060> powerful<00:05:35.840> vitamin

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
tocotrienols which are powerful vitamin
