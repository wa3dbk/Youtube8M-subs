00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
this case I'm not so sure because those

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.650 
this case I'm not so sure because those
20-inch<00:02:08.800> rims<00:02:09.100> really<00:02:09.819> do<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.000> number<00:02:10.390> on<00:02:10.509> this

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
20-inch rims really do a number on this

20-inch rims really do a number on this
cars<00:02:10.959> ride<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:12.160> package<00:02:12.520> also<00:02:12.760> doesn't

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
cars ride and the package also doesn't

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.059

different<00:02:18.190> seats<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.120> think<00:02:19.239> I<00:02:19.450> could

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
different seats so I think I could

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.630 
different seats so I think I could
probably<00:02:19.840> pass<00:02:20.200> another<00:02:21.010> option<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.520> could

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
probably pass another option I could

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.790 
probably pass another option I could
probably<00:02:21.850> pass<00:02:22.180> on<00:02:22.510> is<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.900> active<00:02:23.350> steering

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
probably pass on is the active steering

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.160 
probably pass on is the active steering
it<00:02:24.400> does<00:02:24.610> make<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.940> car<00:02:25.120> quicker<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.720> turn<00:02:25.959> in

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
it does make the car quicker to turn in

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.979 
it does make the car quicker to turn in
and<00:02:26.410> less<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.100> handful<00:02:27.550> at<00:02:27.730> low<00:02:28.480> parking
