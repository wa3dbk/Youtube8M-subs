water on the getting wet part isn't so
bad<00:04:03.940> it's<00:04:04.359> getting<00:04:04.870> cold<00:04:05.319> when<00:04:05.739> you<00:04:05.829> get<00:04:06.010> plan

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
bad it's getting cold when you get plan

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.600 
bad it's getting cold when you get plan
and<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:07.239> as<00:04:07.420> long<00:04:07.659> as<00:04:07.900> particularly<00:04:08.590> r

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
and so as long as particularly r

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.170 
and so as long as particularly r
we<00:04:09.850> want<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.120> try<00:04:10.300> and<00:04:11.310> keep<00:04:12.310> your<00:04:12.490> chest<00:04:12.820> from

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
we want to try and keep your chest from

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.610 
we want to try and keep your chest from
getting<00:04:13.480> cold<00:04:13.720> because<00:04:13.870> if<00:04:14.050> your<00:04:14.170> chest<00:04:14.410> gets

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
getting cold because if your chest gets

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.770 
getting cold because if your chest gets
cold<00:04:14.890> that's<00:04:15.490> where<00:04:15.730> all<00:04:15.850> your<00:04:16.030> body<00:04:16.209> he<00:04:16.450> tries

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
cold that's where all your body he tries

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.949 
cold that's where all your body he tries
to<00:04:16.810> retreat<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.530> your<00:04:17.890> chest<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:18.670> hand

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
to retreat to your chest and hand

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.990 
to retreat to your chest and hand
and<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:21.709> if<00:04:21.799> you're<00:04:21.949> not<00:04:22.069> keeping<00:04:22.430> them<00:04:22.759> warm

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
and so if you're not keeping them warm

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.760 
and so if you're not keeping them warm
we'll<00:04:23.509> start<00:04:23.750> feeling<00:04:24.139> it<00:04:24.199> a<00:04:24.259> lot<00:04:24.440> quicker

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
we'll start feeling it a lot quicker

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.189 
we'll start feeling it a lot quicker
because<00:04:25.280> you<00:04:25.669> can<00:04:25.850> have<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.240> so<00:04:26.479> your<00:04:26.930> core<00:04:27.169> is

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
because you can have it so your core is

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.990 
because you can have it so your core is
all<00:04:27.500> packed<00:04:27.740> up<00:04:27.949> your<00:04:28.069> core<00:04:28.310> is<00:04:28.430> nice<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.789> warm

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
all packed up your core is nice and warm

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.240 
all packed up your core is nice and warm
and<00:04:29.330> your<00:04:29.660> hands<00:04:29.870> get<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.139> little<00:04:30.169> cold<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:31.130> you

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
and your hands get a little cold and you

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.520 
and your hands get a little cold and you
may<00:04:31.400> have<00:04:31.430> some<00:04:31.849> problem<00:04:32.240> with<00:04:32.479> your<00:04:32.870> reflexes

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
but you can account for having slower

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.980 
but you can account for having slower
motor<00:04:36.380> abilities<00:04:37.120> fine<00:04:38.120> motor<00:04:38.360> abilities<00:04:38.810> for
