far<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.560> say<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.860> though<00:01:44.009> absolutely<00:01:44.520> strike

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
on Monday hopefully they won't but I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.590 
on Monday hopefully they won't but I
think<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.100> will<00:01:47.280> how<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.329> feel<00:01:48.540> about

thinking we they're very passionate
about<00:02:19.780> their<00:02:20.080> schools<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.760> think<00:02:22.390> it's<00:02:22.540> you

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
about their schools and I think it's you

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.720 
about their schools and I think it's you
know<00:02:23.230> for<00:02:23.440> people<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.740> take<00:02:23.860> time<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.250> come

know for people to take time and come

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.480 
know for people to take time and come
here<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:24.940> actually<00:02:25.350> state<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:27.280> make

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
here and actually state it and make

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.850 
here and actually state it and make
signs<00:02:27.790> uh<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.330> think<00:02:28.630> it's<00:02:28.810> very<00:02:28.840> positive<00:02:29.440> and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
signs uh I think it's very positive and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.410 
signs uh I think it's very positive and
it<00:02:30.280> certainly<00:02:30.430> lets<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.880> school<00:02:31.090> board<00:02:31.300> know

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
it certainly lets the school board know

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.960 
it certainly lets the school board know
how<00:02:31.660> their<00:02:31.870> thinking<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.670> otherwise<00:02:33.670> you're

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
how their thinking and otherwise you're

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.550 
how their thinking and otherwise you're
guessing<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:35.170> good<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.410> have<00:02:35.470> that

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
guessing and it's good to have that

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.820 
guessing and it's good to have that
input<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:37.120> how<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.660> school<00:02:38.110> board<00:02:38.350> reacted

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
were a little shocked I think I come out

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.360 
were a little shocked I think I come out
and<00:02:43.930> said<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.590> know<00:02:44.710> obviously<00:02:44.920> it's<00:02:45.340> a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
and said that you know obviously it's a

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.910 
and said that you know obviously it's a
major<00:02:45.580> inconvenience<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:46.450> lot<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.750> our<00:02:46.930> parents

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
major inconvenience a lot of our parents

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.110 
major inconvenience a lot of our parents
have<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:49.660> put<00:02:49.810> deposits<00:02:50.350> down<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.820> in

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
have to put deposits down and and in

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.150 
have to put deposits down and and in
theory<00:02:52.450> they're<00:02:53.200> making<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.709> decision

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
theory they're making the decision

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.560 
theory they're making the decision
whether<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.400> send<00:02:54.640> our<00:02:54.760> kids<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.000> school<00:02:55.120> with

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
whether to send our kids to school with

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.930 
whether to send our kids to school with
or<00:02:56.260> go<00:02:56.410> on<00:02:56.500> vacation<00:02:57.070> technically<00:02:57.670> they<00:02:57.880> be

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
or go on vacation technically they be

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.970 
or go on vacation technically they be
breaking<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.390> law<00:02:58.450> because<00:02:58.870> they're<00:02:59.230> they're

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
breaking the law because they're they're

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.630 
breaking the law because they're they're
not<00:03:00.010> getting<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.360> kids<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.720> school<00:03:02.640> but

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
not getting the the kids to school but

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.040 
not getting the the kids to school but
it's<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.820> very<00:03:03.850> difficult<00:03:04.209> hopefully<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:04.990> will

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
it's a very difficult hopefully it will

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.600 
it's a very difficult hopefully it will
be<00:03:05.170> avoided<00:03:05.380> but<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:06.100> is<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.220> very<00:03:06.430> difficult

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
be avoided but it is a very difficult

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.699 
be avoided but it is a very difficult
situation<00:03:06.820> and<00:03:07.540> we're<00:03:07.870> not<00:03:07.990> obviously<00:03:08.560> not

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
situation and we're not obviously not

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.800 
situation and we're not obviously not
happy<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.190> because<00:03:09.430> it's<00:03:09.610> designed<00:03:10.060> without

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
happy and because it's designed without

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.030 
happy and because it's designed without

so<00:03:31.570> probably<00:03:32.140> not<00:03:32.640> but<00:03:33.640> we<00:03:34.000> don't<00:03:34.209> know<00:03:34.420> if<00:03:34.750> we

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
so probably not but we don't know if we

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.670 
so probably not but we don't know if we
talk<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:36.480> them<00:03:37.480> maybe<00:03:37.989> we<00:03:38.200> can<00:03:38.320> find<00:03:38.530> some

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
talk to them maybe we can find some

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.020 
talk to them maybe we can find some
common<00:03:39.100> ground<00:03:39.130> someplace<00:03:39.790> because

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
common ground someplace because

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.370 
common ground someplace because
ultimately<00:03:40.450> they're<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.900> ones<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:41.080> called

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
ultimately they're the ones that called

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.199 
ultimately they're the ones that called
it<00:03:41.620> ultimately<00:03:42.519> they're<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.850> ones<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.060> have

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
it ultimately they're the ones that have

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.150 
it ultimately they're the ones that have
to<00:03:43.330> say<00:03:43.510> well<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.260> negotiating<00:03:44.830> team<00:03:44.980> did

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
to say well the negotiating team did

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.150 
to say well the negotiating team did
enough<00:03:45.430> we're<00:03:46.120> happy<00:03:46.420> now<00:03:47.010> will<00:03:48.010> they<00:03:48.130> be

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
enough we're happy now will they be

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.090 
enough we're happy now will they be
happy<00:03:48.730> if<00:03:49.239> we<00:03:49.510> stick<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:50.049> our<00:03:50.080> guns<00:03:50.320> regarding

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
happy if we stick to our guns regarding

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.670 
happy if we stick to our guns regarding
their<00:03:51.880> fully<00:03:52.360> paid<00:03:52.660> retirement<00:03:53.290> benefits

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
their fully paid retirement benefits

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.039 
their fully paid retirement benefits
because<00:03:54.370> that's<00:03:54.610> what<00:03:54.760> will<00:03:54.910> happen<00:03:55.060> we<00:03:55.420> can't

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
because that's what will happen we can't

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.300 
because that's what will happen we can't
afford<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:56.680> we're<00:03:56.799> not<00:03:56.920> going<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.190> give<00:03:57.280> in

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
afford it so we're not going to give in

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.750 
afford it so we're not going to give in
