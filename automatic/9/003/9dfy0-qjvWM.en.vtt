there's also another one here between
the<00:00:25.680> board<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:28.070> actual<00:00:29.270> plastic<00:00:30.270> so

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
the board and the actual plastic so

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.920 
the board and the actual plastic so
remove<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.740> school<00:00:32.210> first<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:33.629> right

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
remove this school first the one right

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
remove this school first the one right
next<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.320> your<00:00:34.470> power<00:00:35.600> okay<00:00:37.640> remove<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.910> one

and also find a small screwdriver this

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.920 
and also find a small screwdriver this
is<00:00:43.050> smaller<00:00:43.410> screen<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.790> stick<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.300> between

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
is smaller screen so stick that between

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.369 
is smaller screen so stick that between
here<00:00:47.479> right<00:00:48.479> here<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.989> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.019> lift

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
here right here you can you can lift

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.049 
here right here you can you can lift
this<00:00:52.559> up<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.979> way<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.220> take<00:00:53.519> out<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.729> board

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
this up this way and take out the board

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.060 
this up this way and take out the board
that<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.479> found<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.900> easier<00:00:55.229> to<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that I found it easier to do this and

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:11.149 
that I found it easier to do this and
then<00:00:56.790> unscrew<00:00:58.040> once<00:00:59.040> you<00:00:59.190> find<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.580> school

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.289 

instead<00:01:11.969> of<00:01:12.030> food<00:01:12.329> are<00:01:12.539> the<00:01:12.960> spear<00:01:14.060> it's<00:01:15.060> going

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
instead of food are the spear it's going

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.440 
instead of food are the spear it's going
to<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.539> little<00:01:15.719> tight<00:01:16.999> just<00:01:17.999> be<00:01:18.149> careful

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
to be a little tight just be careful

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.099 
to be a little tight just be careful
very<00:01:18.990> careful<00:01:19.429> and<00:01:20.429> again<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.929> only

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
very careful and again this this is only

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:24.709 
very careful and again this this is only
for<00:01:22.350> people<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.850> feel<00:01:24.179> comfortable

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
for people that are feel comfortable

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.480 
for people that are feel comfortable
with<00:01:24.840> doing<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.390> don't<00:01:27.390> need<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:28.490> now

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
with doing this and don't need to now

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.179 
with doing this and don't need to now
lift<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:32.329> should<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:34.310> remove<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:36.359> we<00:01:36.509> go

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
lift up should you remove it there we go

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.050 
lift up should you remove it there we go
so<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:38.969> off<00:01:39.329> now

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.219 

is<00:01:43.509> he<00:01:43.720> places<00:01:43.990> screw<00:01:44.470> back<00:01:45.009> here<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:47.110> know

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
is he places screw back here and I know

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.609 
is he places screw back here and I know
there<00:01:47.380> was<00:01:47.470> another<00:01:47.500> school<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.810> came<00:01:50.229> long

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.340 

take<00:01:53.619> it<00:01:53.740> up<00:01:53.860> right<00:01:54.460> now

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
take it up right now

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.390 
take it up right now
now<00:01:55.770> should<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.490> able<00:01:56.580> to<00:01:56.760> lift<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:58.400> found

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
now should be able to lift this I found

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.490 
now should be able to lift this I found
it<00:01:59.549> easier<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.180> lift<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> whole<00:02:00.810> thing<00:02:01.140> don't

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it easier to lift the whole thing don't

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.410 
it easier to lift the whole thing don't
lift<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.830> board<00:02:02.159> because<00:02:02.850> if<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.150> lift<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
lift the board because if you lift the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.649 
lift the board because if you lift the
board<00:02:03.830> you're<00:02:04.830> going<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.070> damage<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.820> logic

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
board you're going to damage the logic

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.919 
board you're going to damage the logic
board<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.170> circuit<00:02:07.880> lift<00:02:08.880> lift<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.780> whole

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
board or the circuit lift lift the whole

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.960 
board or the circuit lift lift the whole
thing<00:02:10.140> including<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:11.180> heat<00:02:12.180> sink<00:02:12.480> or<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
thing including the heat sink or the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.510 
thing including the heat sink or the
metal<00:02:14.970> portion<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.720> word<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:17.270> lift<00:02:18.270> up

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
metal portion of the word and lift up

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:32.070 
metal portion of the word and lift up
and<00:02:21.680> away<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:25.530> will<00:02:26.040> expose

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.110 

there<00:02:32.320> we<00:02:32.440> go

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
there we go

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.160 
there we go
you<00:02:34.599> see<00:02:34.870> here's<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:36.120> two<00:02:37.120> heat<00:02:37.299> sinks<00:02:37.720> here's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
you see here's the two heat sinks here's

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.140 
you see here's the two heat sinks here's
the<00:02:38.349> video<00:02:39.099> chips<00:02:39.840> which<00:02:40.840> we<00:02:41.230> will<00:02:41.409> reflow<00:02:42.150> do

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
the video chips which we will reflow do

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.009 
the video chips which we will reflow do
where<00:02:43.959> we<00:02:44.080> flow<00:02:44.319> on<00:02:44.500> them<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.900> put<00:02:46.900> them<00:02:46.930> back

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
where we flow on them and put them back

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.530 
where we flow on them and put them back
in<00:02:47.409> check<00:02:47.890> your<00:02:48.040> fan<00:02:48.340> if<00:02:49.180> you're<00:02:49.360> going<00:02:49.480> to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
in check your fan if you're going to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.559 
in check your fan if you're going to
replace<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:49.900> fan<00:02:50.230> do<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.560> now<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:53.190> let's<00:02:54.480> let<00:02:55.480> me

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
replace a fan do it now and let's let me

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.460 
replace a fan do it now and let's let me
remove<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:56.250> from<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:58.049> this<00:02:59.049> is<00:02:59.260> going<00:02:59.409> to

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
remove this from this this is going to

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.770 
remove this from this this is going to
be<00:02:59.530> easier<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.190> way<00:03:00.430> lift<00:03:01.090> up<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.390> little<00:03:01.420> bit

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
be easier this way lift up a little bit

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.750 
be easier this way lift up a little bit
sometimes<00:03:02.709> going<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.129> be<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.220> little<00:03:03.370> tougher

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
sometimes going to be a little tougher

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.740 
sometimes going to be a little tougher
all<00:03:03.879> right<00:03:04.290> now<00:03:06.090> these<00:03:07.090> are<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.359> chips<00:03:07.569> you're

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
all right now these are the chips you're

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.979 
all right now these are the chips you're
going<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.989> reflow<00:03:11.129> make<00:03:12.129> sure<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.400> put<00:03:12.549> flux

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
going to reflow make sure to put flux

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.380 
going to reflow make sure to put flux
liquid<00:03:13.989> flux<00:03:14.230> around<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.829> chips<00:03:15.160> before<00:03:16.000> you

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
liquid flux around the chips before you
