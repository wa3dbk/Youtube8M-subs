episode<00:02:34.470> 13<00:02:35.540> definitely<00:02:36.540> definitely<00:02:37.110> was<00:02:37.830> a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
episode 13 definitely definitely was a

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.240 
episode 13 definitely definitely was a
very<00:02:38.340> strong<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.750> happy<00:02:40.080> ending<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.680> can

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
very strong and a happy ending and can

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.309 
very strong and a happy ending and can
lead<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.760> potential<00:02:42.480> season<00:02:42.870> two<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.080> believe

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
lead to a potential season two I believe

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.640 
lead to a potential season two I believe
although<00:02:44.190> I'm<00:02:44.640> guessing<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.209> how<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.080> ended

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
although I'm guessing that how it ended

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.190 
although I'm guessing that how it ended
was<00:02:46.860> probably<00:02:47.190> one<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:48.030> routes<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.540> think

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
was probably one of the routes I think

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.500 
was probably one of the routes I think
it<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> vision<00:02:49.860> other<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.459> it's<00:02:50.819> probably<00:02:51.390> is

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
it is a vision other so it's probably is

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.150 
it is a vision other so it's probably is
one<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.870> routes<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:52.319> can<00:02:52.349> take<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.890> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
one of the routes you can take in the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.759 
one of the routes you can take in the
series<00:02:53.549> I'm<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:55.019> going<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> spoil<00:02:55.530> which

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
series I'm not going to spoil which

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.970 
series I'm not going to spoil which
route<00:02:56.099> goes<00:02:56.940> at<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> end<00:02:57.690> but<00:02:58.620> you'll

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
route goes at the end but you'll

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.979 
route goes at the end but you'll
probably<00:02:59.160> start<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.760> notice<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.299> like<00:03:00.540> half

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
probably start to notice it like half

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.559 
probably start to notice it like half
maybe<00:03:01.530> halfway<00:03:01.890> from<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.340> series<00:03:02.670> or<00:03:02.819> but<00:03:03.450> there

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
maybe halfway from a series or but there

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.640 
maybe halfway from a series or but there
are<00:03:03.720> some<00:03:03.870> problems<00:03:04.019> were<00:03:04.260> there<00:03:04.380> like<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.620> said

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
are some problems were there like I said

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.800 
are some problems were there like I said
you<00:03:04.920> do<00:03:05.459> get<00:03:05.670> their<00:03:05.790> traditional<00:03:06.269> tropes<00:03:06.660> in

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
you do get their traditional tropes in

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.780 
you do get their traditional tropes in
the<00:03:06.930> series<00:03:07.200> like<00:03:07.319> you've<00:03:07.440> got<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.709> Sun<00:03:08.459> delay

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
the series like you've got the Sun delay

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.430 
the series like you've got the Sun delay
but<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.239> annoying<00:03:09.599> childhood<00:03:10.079> friend

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
but the annoying childhood friend

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.860 
but the annoying childhood friend
honestly<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:10.950> did<00:03:11.310> not<00:03:11.459> like<00:03:11.670> Chiwa<00:03:12.150> one<00:03:12.630> bit

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
honestly I did not like Chiwa one bit

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.259 
honestly I did not like Chiwa one bit
and<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.079> did<00:03:13.319> sort<00:03:13.560> get<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> bit<00:03:14.730> annoyed<00:03:14.940> with<00:03:15.120> I

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
and I did sort get a bit annoyed with I

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.099 
and I did sort get a bit annoyed with I
after<00:03:15.750> finding<00:03:15.959> out<00:03:16.140> what<00:03:16.349> she<00:03:16.530> was<00:03:17.359> and<00:03:18.359> you

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
after finding out what she was and you

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.400 
after finding out what she was and you
know<00:03:19.230> they<00:03:19.380> do<00:03:19.440> focus<00:03:19.739> on<00:03:20.069> these<00:03:20.280> girls<00:03:20.519> and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
know they do focus on these girls and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.660 
know they do focus on these girls and
it's<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.530> bit<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.889> hit<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.130> miss<00:03:23.280> series

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
it's a bit of a hit and miss series

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.800 
it's a bit of a hit and miss series
because<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:23.940> could<00:03:24.060> be<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.329> all<00:03:24.540> some<00:03:24.750> of

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
because you could be like all some of

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.930 
because you could be like all some of
these<00:03:24.930> things<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.380> don't<00:03:25.560> get<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:26.220> said<00:03:26.790> it's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
these things you don't get I said it's

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.059 
these things you don't get I said it's
Jojo<00:03:27.180> references<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> lot<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.530> it's

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
Jojo references a lot of it and it's

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.670 
Jojo references a lot of it and it's
situational<00:03:29.670> comedy<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.060> get<00:03:30.209> but<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.690> had<00:03:31.650> a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
situational comedy you get but I had a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.140 
situational comedy you get but I had a
lot<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.040> fun<00:03:32.220> with<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.670> it's<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:32.880> shame<00:03:33.090> that

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
lot of fun with it and it's a shame that

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.420 
lot of fun with it and it's a shame that
Sony<00:03:33.569> Music<00:03:33.930> got<00:03:34.079> they<00:03:34.170> agree<00:03:34.380> hands<00:03:35.220> on<00:03:35.310> it

Sony Music got they agree hands on it

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.860 
Sony Music got they agree hands on it

since no less could actually really

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.840 
since no less could actually really

into<00:04:08.280> trying<00:04:08.549> it<00:04:08.790> but<00:04:09.739> what<00:04:10.739> would<00:04:10.859> I<00:04:10.919> rate<00:04:11.160> the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
into trying it but what would I rate the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.789 
into trying it but what would I rate the
series<00:04:11.579> well<00:04:11.819> since<00:04:12.480> I<00:04:12.630> said<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.989> all<00:04:13.319> of<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.620> I

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
series well since I said of all of it I

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.870 
series well since I said of all of it I
would<00:04:14.040> probably<00:04:14.310> give<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.799> seven<00:04:16.799> or<00:04:17.070> a<00:04:17.160> six

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
would probably give it a seven or a six

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.909 
would probably give it a seven or a six
point<00:04:18.180> five<00:04:18.450> out<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:18.810> ten<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.200> mean<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.709> said

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
point five out of ten I mean I said

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.380 
point five out of ten I mean I said
there<00:04:20.070> are<00:04:20.099> some<00:04:20.370> problems<00:04:20.579> with<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.000> series

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
there are some problems with the series

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.529 
there are some problems with the series
but<00:04:21.959> overall<00:04:22.380> it<00:04:22.680> is<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:23.039> very<00:04:23.130> good<00:04:23.729> series<00:04:24.270> I

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539
