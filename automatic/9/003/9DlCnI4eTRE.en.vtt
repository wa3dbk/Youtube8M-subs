it was perfect for this outfit because I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
didn't want to do too much with the hair

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.920 
didn't want to do too much with the hair
I<00:01:20.620> wanted<00:01:20.979> more<00:01:21.190> focus<00:01:21.760> with<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.450> eye<00:01:22.479> makeup

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
I wanted more focus with the eye makeup

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.010 
I wanted more focus with the eye makeup
so<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:23.740> makeup<00:01:24.100> is<00:01:24.280> very<00:01:24.610> bold<00:01:25.030> with<00:01:25.690> the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
the outfit is black and white and the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.000 
the outfit is black and white and the
pattern<00:01:45.729> is<00:01:45.909> very<00:01:45.970> abstract<00:01:46.479> I<00:01:47.320> thought<00:01:47.890> it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
pattern is very abstract I thought it

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.039 
pattern is very abstract I thought it
was<00:01:48.100> very<00:01:48.130> modern<00:01:48.640> sophisticated<00:01:49.540> for<00:01:49.930> the

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
was very modern sophisticated for the

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.630 
was very modern sophisticated for the
Kandor<00:01:50.470> look<00:01:50.740> and<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.450> paired<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:54.100> outfit

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
Kandor look and so I paired this outfit

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.719 
Kandor look and so I paired this outfit
with<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:55.030> matching<00:01:55.420> top<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.530> skirt<00:01:57.100> so<00:01:57.580> it's

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
with a matching top and skirt so it's

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.510 
with a matching top and skirt so it's
actually<00:01:57.939> not<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.299> dress<00:01:58.689> it's<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:59.350> separate<00:02:00.220> top

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
actually not a dress it's a separate top

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.910 
actually not a dress it's a separate top
and<00:02:00.850> skirt<00:02:01.479> bottom<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.350> just<00:02:02.619> connected

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
and skirt bottom and I just connected

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.410 
and skirt bottom and I just connected
the<00:02:03.280> two<00:02:03.310> with<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.479> belt

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the two with a belt

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.759 
the two with a belt
okay<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.479> my<00:02:07.750> top<00:02:08.049> is<00:02:08.349> a<00:02:09.069> 1/2<00:02:09.459> length<00:02:09.819> sleeve

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
okay so my top is a 1/2 length sleeve

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.739 
okay so my top is a 1/2 length sleeve
the<00:02:11.769> top<00:02:12.040> portion<00:02:12.489> of<00:02:12.639> the<00:02:12.849> sleeve<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.480> white

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:13.749 
the top portion of the sleeve is white

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.110 
the top portion of the sleeve is white
the<00:02:14.169> bottom<00:02:14.529> portion<00:02:14.739> is<00:02:15.040> black<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.609> thought<00:02:15.969> it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
the bottom portion is black I thought it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.179 
the bottom portion is black I thought it

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
just went so well with the outfit and

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.480 
just went so well with the outfit and
like<00:03:59.959> I<00:04:00.080> said<00:04:00.140> before<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.770> is<00:04:00.800> a<00:04:00.950> patent

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
like I said before it is a patent

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.590 
like I said before it is a patent
leather<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.090> it's<00:04:02.570> black<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.230> shiny<00:04:03.709> I<00:04:04.600> was

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
leather and it's black and shiny I was

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.030 
leather and it's black and shiny I was
thinking<00:04:05.840> about<00:04:05.900> doing<00:04:06.080> a<00:04:06.260> suede<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:06.980> I

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
thinking about doing a suede but I

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.410 
thinking about doing a suede but I
thought<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.459> patent<00:04:07.760> leather<00:04:07.940> just<00:04:08.180> looks<00:04:08.330> a

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
thought the patent leather just looks a

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.470 
thought the patent leather just looks a
lot<00:04:08.600> better<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:10.250> love<00:04:10.459> that<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.850> is<00:04:11.000> pointed

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
lot better and I love that it is pointed

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.870 
lot better and I love that it is pointed
toe<00:04:11.660> because<00:04:12.200> I<00:04:12.440> think<00:04:12.800> it<00:04:12.980> just<00:04:13.250> adds<00:04:13.430> the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
toe because I think it just adds the

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.900 
toe because I think it just adds the
sophistication<00:04:14.600> to<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:15.020> outfit<00:04:15.580> but<00:04:16.580> if<00:04:16.760> you

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
sophistication to this outfit but if you

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.940 
sophistication to this outfit but if you
do<00:04:17.299> want<00:04:17.540> these<00:04:17.720> heels<00:04:18.080> make<00:04:18.530> sure<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:18.799> get

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
them a half size bigger because these

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.970 
them a half size bigger because these
tens<00:04:22.070> are<00:04:22.370> really<00:04:23.150> cramping<00:04:23.810> my<00:04:23.930> toes<00:04:24.170> just<00:04:24.800> I
