00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.919
 miranda 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.890
 the afternoon that you are here yes thank you and I 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.570
 happy to be here with you as 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.730
 always thanks for the invitation hey 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.710
 well, you are progressing with step 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.269
 sign somehow at a point in the 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.830
 competition says that it takes like from 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.050
 personal comfort with rhythms that 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.669
 better little did you know mobile if 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.650
 I definitely think that from the 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.570
 principle the thing of dancing in a couple of 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.460
 do loaded and all these things then 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.900
 I had not really done them 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.289
 long of my life then it has been all 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.510
 a challenge 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.419
 the rhythms if they have definitely been 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.699
 things that have taken me out of the area 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.120
 comfort but I think that that too 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.159
 makes you grow makes you find new 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.850
 things about you and understood the most difficult 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:46.310
 so I do not know if I believe cost itself 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.070
 that hip hop 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:55.940
 yes because I do not have the style 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:57.770
 hip hop actual faster rhythms 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.330
 before it was time to time and habitat are 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.750
 like four times at a time it's going very 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.750
 Quick 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:12.500
 then understand that now talking 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.270
 understand how you understand then the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.400
 changes that were made from the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.170
 dancers you had then to a 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.500
 extraordinary dancer recording but 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.960
 another garment arrived like julieta is like that 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.119
 and it seems that neither liked working for 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.210
 it's not really like that we have how it is 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.670
 little thing we will go to pay them 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.930
 we will connect and if from the trial 1 already 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.090
 we were connected I also say 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.950
 We worked together a couple of years ago and 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.140
 I did not see these popping since we knew each other 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.880
 but then way more danced and in 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.350
 couple today money thing that is known that 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.090
 you already have the experience for that of 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.000
 dance if we have seen that you have been in 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.860
 a musical comedy was also 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.990
 in academy where three of preparation 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:55.920
 but he had also taken classes 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.920
 dance if I started dancing at age 15 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.050
 very different is very different because 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.700
 especially they are things of the feet clear 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.470
 it's a style I started dancing like 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.709
 style musical comedy where 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.600
 also manita man and body but 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.000
 focusing more towards the touch that is like 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.920
 more free from above and what matters 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.330
 really are the rhythms are the feet 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.550
 then again connect with the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.350
 dance with the coordinating part with 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.230
 the upper part of the body, that is if 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.600
 it has been my son paolo years accompanied 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.310
 this morning, keep track of this 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.170
 last week of dancing 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.700
 thank you very much times with limited 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.000
 on the contrary this one is all floating 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.000
