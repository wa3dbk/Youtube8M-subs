paper up to the middle I mean up to this

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.479 
paper up to the middle I mean up to this
line<00:03:52.620> here<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.580> side<00:03:53.879> room<00:03:54.180> edge<00:03:54.330> fold<00:03:54.890> up<00:03:55.890> to

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
line here the side room edge fold up to

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.110 
line here the side room edge fold up to
this<00:03:56.940> line<00:03:57.319> okay<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:58.560> again<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.549> don't<00:03:59.879> have

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
this line okay and again you don't have

this line okay and again you don't have
to<00:04:00.299> fold<00:04:00.599> all<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.900> way<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.560> just<00:04:01.620> need<00:04:02.099> to

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
to fold all the way you just need to

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.050 
to fold all the way you just need to
fold<00:04:02.610> up<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.450> diagonals<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:04.890> object<00:04:05.849> this

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
fold up to the diagonals so object this

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.800 
fold up to the diagonals so object this
line<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.780> this<00:04:07.170> line<00:04:07.380> here<00:04:08.450> okay<00:04:09.620> like<00:04:10.620> this

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
line and this line here okay like this

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.199 
line and this line here okay like this
so<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:13.349> this<00:04:14.010> part<00:04:14.280> here<00:04:16.250> right<00:04:17.250> do<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.000> same

so now we have to chill fold here on

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.330 
so now we have to chill fold here on
this<00:04:47.800> line<00:04:48.100> okay<00:04:48.760> and<00:04:49.920> at<00:04:50.920> the<00:04:51.040> same<00:04:51.280> time

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
you're going to fold here is diagonal

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:07.230 
you're going to fold here is diagonal
here<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:59.340> fold<00:05:00.340> up<00:05:00.730> like<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:02.820> okay<00:05:05.850> so<00:05:06.850> and

here and fold up like this okay so and

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.480 
here and fold up like this okay so and
the<00:05:07.420> same<00:05:07.600> time<00:05:07.810> you're<00:05:07.930> going<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.200> make<00:05:08.490> this

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
the same time you're going to make this

here okay now you're going to make a

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.260 
here okay now you're going to make a
valley<00:05:38.710> fold<00:05:38.830> along<00:05:39.780> this<00:05:40.780> line<00:05:41.050> here<00:05:41.350> okay

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
valley fold along this line here okay

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.330 
valley fold along this line here okay
like<00:05:43.270> this<00:05:43.570> and<00:05:43.900> at<00:05:44.530> the<00:05:44.620> same<00:05:44.800> time<00:05:44.860> you<00:05:45.160> can

like this and at the same time you can
see<00:05:45.640> that<00:05:45.850> you<00:05:46.150> have<00:05:46.890> this<00:05:47.890> line<00:05:48.370> here<00:05:48.730> and

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
see that you have this line here and

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.380 
see that you have this line here and
this<00:05:50.470> line<00:05:50.740> here<00:05:51.100> right<00:05:52.320> so<00:05:53.320> you're<00:05:53.530> going<00:05:53.710> to

this line here right so you're going to

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.170 
this line here right so you're going to
make<00:05:55.390> a<00:05:55.620> valley<00:05:56.620> fold<00:05:56.740> along<00:05:57.130> this<00:05:57.460> line<00:05:57.790> and<00:05:58.000> a

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
make a valley fold along this line and a

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.630 
make a valley fold along this line and a
mountain<00:05:58.540> fold<00:05:58.720> along<00:05:58.870> this<00:05:59.200> line<00:05:59.470> like<00:06:00.430> this

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
mountain fold along this line like this

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.750 
mountain fold along this line like this
you<00:06:01.330> just<00:06:01.600> have<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:01.810> pull<00:06:02.590> here<00:06:02.890> this<00:06:03.520> layer

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
you just have to pull here this layer

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.800 
you just have to pull here this layer
like<00:06:04.300> this<00:06:04.890> okay<00:06:07.230> and<00:06:09.090> do<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.270> same<00:06:10.510> thing

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
like this okay and do the same thing

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:23.429 
like this okay and do the same thing
here<00:06:11.590> into<00:06:11.920> the<00:06:12.070> next<00:06:12.400> line

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:23.439 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:41.590 

let's<00:06:24.439> keep<00:06:24.649> doing<00:06:24.949> this<00:06:27.759> show<00:06:28.759> all<00:06:28.939> sides

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:52.280 

the<00:06:42.600> model<00:06:42.960> will<00:06:43.440> look<00:06:43.500> like<00:06:43.650> this<00:06:44.070> now<00:06:51.290> you

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
the model will look like this now you

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:59.180 
the model will look like this now you
just<00:06:52.830> have<00:06:53.010> to<00:06:53.280> pull<00:06:53.910> here<00:06:56.300> this<00:06:57.300> layer<00:06:58.190> so

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190 
just have to pull here this layer so

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.040 
just have to pull here this layer so
after<00:06:59.670> you<00:06:59.820> finish<00:07:00.270> here<00:07:00.570> curling<00:07:02.360> all<00:07:03.360> the

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
after you finish here curling all the

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.250 
after you finish here curling all the
sides<00:07:04.350> of<00:07:04.560> the<00:07:04.710> model<00:07:05.510> the<00:07:06.510> model<00:07:06.540> will<00:07:06.900> hold

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:07.260 
sides of the model the model will hold

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.400 
sides of the model the model will hold
the<00:07:07.740> shape<00:07:08.010> a<00:07:08.370> little<00:07:08.700> bit<00:07:09.090> better<00:07:09.410> because

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
the shape a little bit better because

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.970 
the shape a little bit better because
each<00:07:11.280> curl<00:07:11.730> here<00:07:12.170> each<00:07:13.170> Curtis<00:07:13.560> part<00:07:13.800> in

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:13.980 
each curl here each Curtis part in

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.560 
each curl here each Curtis part in
virtual<00:07:14.430> to<00:07:15.300> lock<00:07:16.370> two<00:07:17.370> layers<00:07:17.700> together<00:07:17.910> like

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:18.570 
virtual to lock two layers together like

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:24.230 
virtual to lock two layers together like
this<00:07:18.780> ok<00:07:21.320> so<00:07:22.320> if<00:07:22.560> you<00:07:22.710> use<00:07:22.890> a<00:07:22.920> paper<00:07:23.250> to<00:07:23.580> hold

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
this ok so if you use a paper to hold

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.240 
this ok so if you use a paper to hold
the<00:07:24.420> shape<00:07:24.660> a<00:07:24.720> little<00:07:24.900> bit<00:07:25.170> better<00:07:25.440> than<00:07:25.740> this

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
the shape a little bit better than this

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:32.950 
the shape a little bit better than this
one<00:07:26.520> the<00:07:27.480> results<00:07:27.900> going<00:07:28.080> to<00:07:28.170> be<00:07:28.260> better

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.140 

what's<00:07:33.960> not<00:07:34.170> really<00:07:34.500> strong<00:07:34.860> but<00:07:35.430> if<00:07:35.910> you<00:07:36.120> use

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150 
what's not really strong but if you use

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.280 
what's not really strong but if you use
blue<00:07:36.630> or<00:07:36.870> if<00:07:37.140> you'll<00:07:37.490> put<00:07:38.490> here<00:07:38.850> a<00:07:39.290> chocolate

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.290 
blue or if you'll put here a chocolate

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.860 
blue or if you'll put here a chocolate
inside<00:07:40.650> or<00:07:40.890> something<00:07:40.920> inside<00:07:41.820> it's<00:07:42.630> going<00:07:42.780> to

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:42.870 
inside or something inside it's going to

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:48.740 
inside or something inside it's going to
look<00:07:43.020> really<00:07:43.230> nice<00:07:44.450> and<00:07:47.120> it's<00:07:48.120> going<00:07:48.330> to<00:07:48.510> hold

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:48.750 
look really nice and it's going to hold

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.130 
look really nice and it's going to hold
the<00:07:49.020> shape<00:07:49.910> ok<00:07:50.910> so<00:07:51.240> thanks<00:07:51.660> for<00:07:51.750> watching<00:07:52.020> this
