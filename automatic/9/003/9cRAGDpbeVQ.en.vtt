white to these this end of the table
could<00:01:47.900> have<00:01:48.020> taken<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.290> further<00:01:48.590> down<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:49.040> book

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
could have taken it further down to book

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.730 
could have taken it further down to book
only<00:01:50.240> having<00:01:50.600> two<00:01:50.840> looks<00:01:51.110> whether<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.590> black

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
only having two looks whether the black

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.680 
only having two looks whether the black
will<00:01:51.950> clot<00:01:52.130> into<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.430> corner<00:01:52.790> if<00:01:53.330> it<00:01:53.479> does

will clot into the corner if it does

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.170 
will clot into the corner if it does
this<00:01:53.870> is<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.020> good<00:01:54.229> chance<00:01:54.470> if<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.830> doesn't<00:01:55.180> go

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
this is a good chance if it doesn't go

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.310 
this is a good chance if it doesn't go
to<00:01:56.240> get<00:01:56.390> rid<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:56.660> red<00:01:56.869> above<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.140> black

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
to get rid of that red above the black

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.700 
to get rid of that red above the black
spot<00:01:57.530> quickly<00:01:58.479> obviously<00:01:59.479> does<00:01:59.900> pot<00:02:00.170> yes

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
spot quickly obviously does pot yes

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.670 
spot quickly obviously does pot yes
again<00:02:01.460> it's<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.300> cross<00:02:02.509> RG<00:02:02.930> me<00:02:03.050> play<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.500> shot

again it's a cross RG me play that shot

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.460 
again it's a cross RG me play that shot
if<00:02:03.830> he<00:02:03.860> plays<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:05.180> white<00:02:05.330> on<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.840> green<00:02:06.290> or
