II and so I'll say okay well what is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.090 
II and so I'll say okay well what is
this<00:00:33.120> exactly<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.809> he<00:00:34.440> wanted<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> explain

this exactly and he wanted to explain

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
this exactly and he wanted to explain
that<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:36.149> essentially<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:37.670> mineral<00:00:38.670> type<00:00:39.000> of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
that it's essentially a mineral type of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.450 
that it's essentially a mineral type of
electrolyte<00:00:40.020> tincture<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.680> will<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
electrolyte tincture if you will and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160 
electrolyte tincture if you will and
what<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.730> does<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.870> say<00:00:42.989> that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
what this does and I have to say that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.450 
what this does and I have to say that
since<00:00:43.530> i've<00:00:43.649> been<00:00:43.680> using<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> past

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
since i've been using this for the past

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.830 
since i've been using this for the past
six<00:00:44.850> weeks<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:45.809> i<00:00:46.550> I<00:00:47.550> mean<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.450> blowing<00:00:48.780> my

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
six weeks or so i I mean it's blowing my

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.779 
six weeks or so i I mean it's blowing my
mind<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.260> absolutely<00:00:49.680> amazing<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.520> what

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
mind it's absolutely amazing so what

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.549 
mind it's absolutely amazing so what
this<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.480> essentially<00:00:52.170> he<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.379> saying

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
this is is is essentially he was saying

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.260 
this is is is essentially he was saying
I<00:00:52.649> believe<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.010> comes<00:00:53.160> from<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:54.110> salt<00:00:55.110> lake<00:00:55.320> in

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
I believe it comes from a salt lake in

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.029 
I believe it comes from a salt lake in
salt<00:00:57.270> lake<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.930> ute<00:00:58.379> are<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:58.770> ran<00:00:58.890> there

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
salt lake or ute are so I'm ran there

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.220 
salt lake or ute are so I'm ran there
and<00:01:00.000> what<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.270> does<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.539> that's<00:01:00.690> actually<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
and what it does is that's actually the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.009 
and what it does is that's actually the
captured<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> natural<00:01:02.699> minerals<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
captured the natural minerals in the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.469 
captured the natural minerals in the
lake<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.470> they've<00:01:05.129> pretty<00:01:05.700> much<00:01:05.760> kind<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.119> put

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
lake and they've pretty much kind of put

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.539 
lake and they've pretty much kind of put
that<00:01:06.600> into<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.869> bottle<00:01:07.380> format<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.189> while<00:01:08.369> it's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that into a bottle format and while it's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.050 
that into a bottle format and while it's
important<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.570> because<00:01:11.000> instead<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
important to you is because instead of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.480 
important to you is because instead of
just<00:01:12.299> drinking<00:01:12.900> water<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:14.070> know<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.220> feel

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
just drinking water you know I feel

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.469 
just drinking water you know I feel
after<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> workout<00:01:14.970> during<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> workout

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
after a workout during the workout

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.910 
after a workout during the workout
before<00:01:15.780> work<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:18.200> what<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.320> need<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.740> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
before work out what you need to do is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.609 
before work out what you need to do is
also<00:01:20.189> replenish<00:01:20.759> your<00:01:21.659> electrolytes<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.500> when

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
also replenish your electrolytes so when

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
also replenish your electrolytes so when
you<00:01:22.710> sweat<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.430> lose<00:01:23.840> potassium<00:01:24.840> sodium

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you sweat you lose potassium sodium

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.210 
you sweat you lose potassium sodium
chloride<00:01:25.790> some<00:01:26.790> very<00:01:26.970> important

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
chloride some very important

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.160 
chloride some very important
electrolytes<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.970> necessary<00:01:30.509> for

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
electrolytes that are necessary for

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.990 
electrolytes that are necessary for
things<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:31.920> muscular<00:01:32.310> contraction

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
things like muscular contraction

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.289 
things like muscular contraction
thoughts<00:01:33.770> electrical<00:01:34.770> communication<00:01:35.400> so

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
thoughts electrical communication so

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.940 
thoughts electrical communication so
pretty<00:01:36.509> much<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.840> able<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> function<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.619> if

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
pretty much be able to function and if

cells<00:01:49.259> need<00:01:49.649> electrolytes<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.310> order<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
cells need electrolytes in order to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.550 
cells need electrolytes in order to
absorb<00:01:51.119> water<00:01:51.390> retain<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.079> function

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
absorb water retain it and function

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.380 
absorb water retain it and function
properly<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.520> what's<00:01:53.790> cool<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.329> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
properly so what's cool about this is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.819 
properly so what's cool about this is
that<00:01:54.570> i<00:01:54.930> don't<00:01:55.350> know<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.470> you've<00:01:55.560> ever<00:01:55.619> heard

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that i don't know if you've ever heard

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
that i don't know if you've ever heard
of<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.009> condition<00:01:56.729> called<00:01:56.880> hyponatremia

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
of this condition called hyponatremia

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.380 
of this condition called hyponatremia
which<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.500> essentially<00:01:59.149> drinking<00:02:00.149> too<00:02:00.360> much

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
which is essentially drinking too much

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.620 
which is essentially drinking too much
water<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.890> happen<00:02:02.070> where<00:02:02.630> let's

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
water and that can happen where let's

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.719 
water and that can happen where let's
say<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> sweat<00:02:04.890> fest<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.399> workout

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
say you have a a sweat fest of a workout

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.340 
say you have a a sweat fest of a workout
or<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.060> go<00:02:06.149> for<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> run<00:02:06.450> outside<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.049> 40

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
or you go for a run outside and it's 40

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
or you go for a run outside and it's 40
degrees<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:07.829> humidity<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.399> 40<00:02:09.209> degrees

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
degrees with humidity and 40 degrees

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.930 
degrees with humidity and 40 degrees
celsius<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.229> 110<00:02:11.069> let's<00:02:11.310> say<00:02:11.430> fahrenheit<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
celsius so 110 let's say fahrenheit and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.730 
celsius so 110 let's say fahrenheit and
you<00:02:12.420> 7<00:02:12.690> apps<00:02:12.810> with<00:02:12.930> sweat<00:02:13.260> fest

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
you 7 apps with sweat fest

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.620 
you 7 apps with sweat fest
all<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.040> sweat<00:02:14.340> you're<00:02:14.940> losing<00:02:15.240> all<00:02:15.450> these

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
all is sweat you're losing all these

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.510 
all is sweat you're losing all these
electrolytes<00:02:15.990> now<00:02:16.380> here<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.130> sphere<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
electrolytes now here the sphere the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.190 
electrolytes now here the sphere the
options<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:18.060> just<00:02:18.240> chug<00:02:18.480> back<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.750> ton<00:02:19.170> of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
options you can just chug back a ton of

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.310 
options you can just chug back a ton of
water<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.870> develop<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.930> condition<00:02:22.110> like

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
water and develop a condition like

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.260 
water and develop a condition like
hyponatremia<00:02:23.130> where<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.340> don't<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.090> enough

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
hyponatremia where you don't have enough

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
hyponatremia where you don't have enough
sodium<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.930> hold<00:02:25.080> on<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.410> water<00:02:25.650> and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
sodium to hold on to that water and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.760 
sodium to hold on to that water and
that's<00:02:26.370> that's<00:02:26.670> obviously<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.150> huge<00:02:27.300> issue<00:02:27.770> but

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
that's that's obviously a huge issue but

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.840 
that's that's obviously a huge issue but
still<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.100> obviously<00:02:29.370> want<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.550> drink<00:02:29.700> water

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
still you obviously want to drink water

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.340 
still you obviously want to drink water
so<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.330> most<00:02:30.510> people<00:02:30.780> do<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.140> drink

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
so what most people do is the drink

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.780 
so what most people do is the drink
water<00:02:31.560> as<00:02:31.740> well<00:02:31.890> as<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.040> sports<00:02:32.340> drink<00:02:32.490> all

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
water as well as a sports drink all

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.680 
water as well as a sports drink all

hydration okay so basically you do and
as<00:03:28.770> you'll<00:03:28.980> see<00:03:29.160> here<00:03:29.250> I'm<00:03:29.370> gonna<00:03:29.460> try<00:03:29.610> to<00:03:29.700> go

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
as you'll see here I'm gonna try to go

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.370 
as you'll see here I'm gonna try to go
as<00:03:29.850> close<00:03:29.970> up<00:03:30.210> as<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.420> can<00:03:30.630> it<00:03:30.780> said<00:03:30.960> basically

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
as close up as I can it said basically

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.780 
as close up as I can it said basically
it's<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:31.920> very<00:03:32.130> clear<00:03:34.190> solution<00:03:35.190> okay<00:03:35.460> that's

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
it's a very clear solution okay that's

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.220 
it's a very clear solution okay that's
all<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.600> just<00:03:36.630> add<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> couple<00:03:37.110> drops

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
all it is so you just add a couple drops

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.780 
all it is so you just add a couple drops
into<00:03:37.680> your<00:03:37.770> water<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.220> you'll<00:03:38.310> see<00:03:38.460> you<00:03:38.580> kind

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
into your water and you'll see you kind

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.220 
into your water and you'll see you kind
of<00:03:38.820> just<00:03:38.970> doing<00:03:39.390> its<00:03:39.600> magic<00:03:39.750> through<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
of just doing its magic through the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.520 
of just doing its magic through the
water<00:03:40.410> there<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.660> this<00:03:42.660> essentially<00:03:43.080> turns

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
water there and this essentially turns

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.950 
water there and this essentially turns
your<00:03:43.920> water<00:03:44.280> into<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.730> sports<00:03:45.090> drink<00:03:45.240> without

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
your water into a sports drink without

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.110 
your water into a sports drink without
the<00:03:46.200> sugar<00:03:46.380> okay<00:03:46.890> this<00:03:47.460> is<00:03:47.580> so<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.000> is

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
the sugar okay this is so this is

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.430 
the sugar okay this is so this is
awesome<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:48.600> whenever<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:48.930> worked<00:03:49.140> out<00:03:49.290> now

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
awesome so whenever I worked out now

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.230 
awesome so whenever I worked out now
before<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.920> worked<00:03:50.160> out<00:03:50.280> during<00:03:50.580> my<00:03:50.640> workout<00:03:51.120> in

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
before I worked out during my workout in

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.700 
before I worked out during my workout in
afterwards<00:03:51.750> as<00:03:51.900> well<00:03:51.930> as<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.380> know<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.530> time<00:03:52.680> I

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
afterwards as well as you know in time I

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.590 
afterwards as well as you know in time I
playing<00:03:52.920> soccer<00:03:53.160> or<00:03:53.310> tennis<00:03:53.400> my<00:03:54.180> water<00:03:54.420> bottle

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
playing soccer or tennis my water bottle

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.650 
playing soccer or tennis my water bottle
is<00:03:54.870> full<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.470> water<00:03:56.040> with<00:03:56.730> several<00:03:57.060> drops<00:03:57.330> of

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
is full of water with several drops of

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.220 
is full of water with several drops of
this<00:03:57.960> water<00:03:58.290> eat<00:04:00.560> so<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.830> couple<00:04:02.700> things

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
this water eat so a couple things

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.350 
this water eat so a couple things
we<00:04:04.769> got<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.069> home<00:04:05.280> Amy's<00:04:05.879> like<00:04:06.000> hey<00:04:06.150> what's

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
we got this home Amy's like hey what's

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.030 
we got this home Amy's like hey what's
that<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.750> said<00:04:07.140> was<00:04:07.319> this<00:04:07.500> new<00:04:07.650> electro<00:04:07.950> life

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
that I said was this new electro life

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.940 
that I said was this new electro life
thing<00:04:08.220> from<00:04:08.400> our<00:04:08.549> buddy<00:04:08.940> lucas<00:04:09.319> so<00:04:10.319> she<00:04:10.379> puts

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
thing from our buddy lucas so she puts

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.350 
thing from our buddy lucas so she puts
them<00:04:11.040> in<00:04:11.129> her<00:04:11.190> water<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.790> first<00:04:12.150> thing<00:04:12.330> she

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
them in her water the first thing she

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.420 
them in her water the first thing she
noticed<00:04:12.629> just<00:04:12.959> like<00:04:13.110> wow<00:04:13.349> it<00:04:13.980> makes<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.250> water

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
noticed just like wow it makes the water

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.370 
noticed just like wow it makes the water
tastes<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:14.940> much<00:04:14.970> better<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.569> again<00:04:16.199> there's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
tastes so much better and again there's

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.170 
tastes so much better and again there's
no<00:04:16.440> artificial<00:04:17.130> flavors<00:04:17.639> or<00:04:17.850> anything<00:04:18.120> like

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
no artificial flavors or anything like

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.030 
no artificial flavors or anything like
that<00:04:18.269> but<00:04:18.630> what's<00:04:18.870> happening<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.799> it

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
that but what's happening is that it

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.400 
that but what's happening is that it
naturally<00:04:20.519> softens<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.299> water<00:04:21.479> it<00:04:21.660> raises

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
naturally softens the water it raises

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.710 
naturally softens the water it raises
the<00:04:22.949> pH<00:04:23.190> of<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.550> water<00:04:23.639> making<00:04:24.090> more<00:04:24.389> alkaline

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
the pH of the water making more alkaline

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.360 
the pH of the water making more alkaline
because<00:04:25.199> it's<00:04:25.440> adding<00:04:25.740> all<00:04:25.860> these<00:04:26.010> great

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
because it's adding all these great

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.430 
because it's adding all these great
electrolytes<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.090> minerals<00:04:27.510> back<00:04:28.050> into<00:04:28.110> your

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
electrolytes and minerals back into your

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.469 
electrolytes and minerals back into your
water<00:04:28.620> so<00:04:29.190> what<00:04:29.580> they've<00:04:29.729> created<00:04:30.030> with<00:04:30.330> this

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
water so what they've created with this

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.270 
water so what they've created with this
is<00:04:30.690> essentially<00:04:31.169> it's<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.380> natural<00:04:31.650> way<00:04:32.040> of

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
is essentially it's a natural way of

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.450 
is essentially it's a natural way of
recreating<00:04:33.290> retreating<00:04:34.290> Earth's<00:04:34.650> natural

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
recreating retreating Earth's natural

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.760 
recreating retreating Earth's natural
process<00:04:36.330> of<00:04:36.510> mineralizing<00:04:37.110> water<00:04:37.470> for

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
process of mineralizing water for

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.460 
process of mineralizing water for
instance<00:04:38.039> you<00:04:38.160> go<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.400> mountain<00:04:39.060> stream

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
instance you go to a mountain stream

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.560 
instance you go to a mountain stream
that<00:04:40.470> water<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.979> pretty<00:04:41.669> much<00:04:41.789> clear<00:04:42.240> like<00:04:42.479> you

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
that water is pretty much clear like you

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.810 
that water is pretty much clear like you
could<00:04:42.690> drink<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.169> water<00:04:43.320> out<00:04:44.190> of<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.490> stream

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
could drink that water out of the stream

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.490 
could drink that water out of the stream
in<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.030> lot<00:04:45.150> of<00:04:45.180> cases<00:04:45.419> from<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.930> mountains<00:04:46.320> and

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
in a lot of cases from the mountains and

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.090 
in a lot of cases from the mountains and
the<00:04:46.530> reason<00:04:47.460> for<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:47.639> is<00:04:47.910> because<00:04:47.940> as<00:04:48.449> as<00:04:49.100> the

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
the reason for that is because as as the

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.620 
the reason for that is because as as the
water<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.639> know<00:04:50.760> comes<00:04:51.030> down<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.330> mountain

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
water you know comes down the mountain

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.300 
water you know comes down the mountain
going<00:04:51.960> through<00:04:52.169> all<00:04:52.289> these<00:04:52.410> streams<00:04:52.830> it's

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
going through all these streams it's

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.189 
going through all these streams it's
hitting<00:04:53.729> rocks<00:04:53.970> its<00:04:54.270> collecting<00:04:54.720> minerals

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
hitting rocks its collecting minerals

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.950 
hitting rocks its collecting minerals
off<00:04:55.560> these<00:04:56.430> rocks<00:04:56.729> which<00:04:57.090> are<00:04:57.270> adding

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
off these rocks which are adding

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.140 
off these rocks which are adding
alkalinity<00:04:58.590> for<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.830> water<00:04:59.039> purifying<00:04:59.940> it

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
alkalinity for the water purifying it

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.060 
alkalinity for the water purifying it
and<00:05:00.330> that's<00:05:00.780> what<00:05:00.990> we've<00:05:01.110> tried<00:05:01.289> or<00:05:01.590> that's

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
and that's what we've tried or that's

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.950 
and that's what we've tried or that's
what<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.220> lot<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.430> purification<00:05:02.880> systems<00:05:03.600> try

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
what a lot of purification systems try

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.900 
what a lot of purification systems try
it<00:05:04.020> or<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:04.350> lot<00:05:04.470> of<00:05:04.590> good<00:05:04.620> purification<00:05:05.520> systems

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
it or a lot of good purification systems

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.360 
it or a lot of good purification systems
try<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.570> recreate<00:05:07.220> within<00:05:08.220> their

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
try to recreate within their

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.670 
try to recreate within their
purification<00:05:08.840> process<00:05:09.840> unfortunately<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.530> lot

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
purification process unfortunately a lot

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.159 
purification process unfortunately a lot
of<00:05:10.950> those<00:05:11.039> costs<00:05:11.430> thousands<00:05:11.849> of<00:05:11.940> dollars<00:05:12.169> this

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
of those costs thousands of dollars this

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.400 
of those costs thousands of dollars this
costs<00:05:13.620> literally<00:05:14.340> nothing<00:05:14.460> so<00:05:15.360> that's<00:05:16.289> why

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
costs literally nothing so that's why

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.390 
costs literally nothing so that's why
I'm<00:05:16.500> telling<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.740> about<00:05:16.770> this<00:05:16.919> because<00:05:17.190> I

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
I'm telling you about this because I

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.900 
I'm telling you about this because I
don't<00:05:17.849> often<00:05:18.000> recommend<00:05:18.570> specific<00:05:18.990> products

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
don't often recommend specific products
