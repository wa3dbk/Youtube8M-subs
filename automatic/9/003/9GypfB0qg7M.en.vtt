extremely busy digging holes and making
ponds<00:00:08.630> now<00:00:09.630> that<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:09.929> works<00:00:10.139> come<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.650> an<00:00:10.740> end

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
ponds now that that works come to an end

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.129 
ponds now that that works come to an end
for<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.309> end<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.700> year<00:00:11.880> I'll<00:00:12.719> be<00:00:12.750> able<00:00:12.990> to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
for the end of the year I'll be able to

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.660 
for the end of the year I'll be able to
get<00:00:13.259> out<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> lot<00:00:13.769> more<00:00:13.950> detecting<00:00:14.490> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
get out a lot more detecting and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.340 
get out a lot more detecting and
there'll<00:00:15.240> be<00:00:15.299> plenty<00:00:15.509> more<00:00:15.719> videos<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.320> come

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
there'll be plenty more videos to come

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.349 
there'll be plenty more videos to come
but<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.160> meantime<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.150> very

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
but in the meantime this is just a very

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.130 
but in the meantime this is just a very
quick<00:00:18.619> collection<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.949> clips<00:00:20.250> from<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:21.869> very

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
quick collection of clips from the very

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.710 
quick collection of clips from the very
small<00:00:22.670> short<00:00:23.670> hunts<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.240> I've<00:00:24.359> been<00:00:24.510> doing

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
small short hunts that I've been doing

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:39.540 
small short hunts that I've been doing
lately

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.960 

this<00:00:40.550> one<00:00:40.760> was<00:00:41.060> a<00:00:41.090> really<00:00:41.600> weak<00:00:42.200> signal

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
this one was a really weak signal

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.110 
this one was a really weak signal
proximately

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
proximately

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
proximately
oh<00:00:45.160> my<00:00:46.160> stuff<00:00:46.400> six<00:00:46.820> seven<00:00:47.210> inches<00:00:47.330> down<00:00:47.720> maybe

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
oh my stuff six seven inches down maybe

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.770 
oh my stuff six seven inches down maybe
and<00:00:48.380> there's<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:48.890> imprint<00:00:49.340> of<00:00:49.400> a<00:00:49.490> coin<00:00:49.730> there

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.060 

so<00:00:53.780> there's<00:00:54.110> obviously<00:00:54.200> a<00:00:54.440> coin<00:00:54.680> in<00:00:54.920> this<00:00:55.010> hole

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
so there's obviously a coin in this hole

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.890 
so there's obviously a coin in this hole
somewhere<00:00:59.860> there<00:01:00.860> he<00:01:01.520> is<00:01:01.550> our<00:01:02.030> two<00:01:02.300> silver<00:01:02.750> as

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
somewhere there he is our two silver as

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.750 
somewhere there he is our two silver as
well<00:01:03.050> first<00:01:03.680> dig<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.670> it's<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.210> silver<00:01:06.640> look<00:01:07.640> at

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
well first dig and it's a silver look at

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.640 
well first dig and it's a silver look at
that<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:07.910> literally<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:08.750> stepped<00:01:09.290> into<00:01:09.500> the

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
that I literally just stepped into the

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.260 
that I literally just stepped into the
field

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
field

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.660 
field
there's<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.450> style<00:01:12.010> came<00:01:13.010> over<00:01:13.250> here<00:01:13.400> switch

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
there's the style came over here switch

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:24.580 
there's the style came over here switch
to<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.880> detector<00:01:14.300> on<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:22.280> first<00:01:22.880> dig<00:01:23.590> weak

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
to the detector on and first dig weak

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.710 
to the detector on and first dig weak
signal<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.509> it's<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:27.130> 1925<00:01:28.130> six<00:01:28.550> months<00:01:28.820> what<00:01:29.690> a

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
signal and it's a 1925 six months what a

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:40.600 
signal and it's a 1925 six months what a
cracking<00:01:30.200> start<00:01:30.380> oh<00:01:37.330> go<00:01:38.330> see<00:01:39.430> George<00:01:40.430> the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
cracking start oh go see George the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:48.210 
cracking start oh go see George the
sixth<00:01:41.000> penny<00:01:43.090> that's<00:01:44.090> not<00:01:44.270> too<00:01:44.479> old<00:01:46.179> 1944

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
sixth penny that's not too old 1944

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
sixth penny that's not too old 1944
reasonable<00:01:49.220> depth<00:01:49.429> Oh<00:01:49.580> probably<00:01:49.819> about<00:01:50.000> ten

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
reasonable depth Oh probably about ten

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.570 
reasonable depth Oh probably about ten
inches<00:01:50.509> or<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:50.810> deep<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.860> rule<00:01:52.009> is<00:01:52.250> just<00:01:52.460> to

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
inches or so deep the rule is just to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.460 
inches or so deep the rule is just to
find<00:01:52.729> that<00:01:52.940> give<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:53.509> good<00:01:53.899> signal<00:01:54.289> but

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
find that give a a good signal but

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.190 
find that give a a good signal but
they're<00:01:54.830> awful<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.220> truck<00:01:55.429> down

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
they're awful a truck down

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.169 
they're awful a truck down
that's<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.319> George<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.740> sixth<00:01:58.179> threatening

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
that's a George the sixth threatening

00:01:59.179 --> 00:03:04.230 
that's a George the sixth threatening
bit<00:02:00.640> three<00:02:01.640> pence<00:02:02.170> from<00:02:03.170> 1940

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.810 

so<00:03:05.240> James<00:03:05.510> found<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:05.990> one<00:03:06.200> with<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.830> Vista

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
so James found this one with the Vista

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.850 
so James found this one with the Vista
Gould<00:03:08.210> and<00:03:11.080> I'm<00:03:12.080> not<00:03:12.230> sure<00:03:12.380> where<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.680> is<00:03:12.740> but

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
Gould and I'm not sure where it is but

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.220 
Gould and I'm not sure where it is but
it<00:03:13.160> was<00:03:13.250> given<00:03:13.340> a<00:03:13.490> good<00:03:13.640> signal<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.180> went<00:03:15.020> over

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
it was given a good signal I went over

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.650 
it was given a good signal I went over
it<00:03:15.290> with<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.530> truck<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.070> it<00:03:16.130> read<00:03:16.330> 1242<00:03:17.330> both

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
it with you truck and it read 1242 both

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:35.760 
it with you truck and it read 1242 both
wheels<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.830> it's<00:03:28.010> spin<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.490> world<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:29.420> it

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.500 

that's<00:03:36.770> a<00:03:37.040> totally<00:03:37.550> unusual<00:03:37.820> pattern<00:03:38.300> of<00:03:38.360> late

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
that's a totally unusual pattern of late

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.780 
that's a totally unusual pattern of late
noughts<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:38.810> crosses<00:03:39.340> just<00:03:40.340> flip<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.790> over

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
noughts and crosses just flip it over

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.990 
noughts and crosses just flip it over
blank<00:03:43.790> on<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.060> side<00:03:45.190> does<00:03:46.190> this<00:03:46.310> have<00:03:46.490> a<00:03:46.520> live
