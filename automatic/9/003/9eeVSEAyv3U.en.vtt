when you meet a serving of something
like<00:05:27.920> for<00:05:28.160> example<00:05:28.220> i<00:05:28.790> recall<00:05:29.300> in<00:05:29.390> the<00:05:29.480> article

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
like for example i recall in the article

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.510 
like for example i recall in the article
i<00:05:29.870> talked<00:05:30.110> about<00:05:30.230> how<00:05:30.380> when<00:05:31.070> a<00:05:31.100> serving<00:05:31.460> of

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
i talked about how when a serving of

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.060 
i talked about how when a serving of
almonds<00:05:31.970> says<00:05:32.510> it's<00:05:32.720> about<00:05:32.900> 170<00:05:33.560> calories<00:05:33.740> on

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
almonds says it's about 170 calories on

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.650 
almonds says it's about 170 calories on
label<00:05:34.430> you're<00:05:34.790> really<00:05:35.090> only<00:05:35.240> getting<00:05:35.600> about

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
label you're really only getting about

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.530 
label you're really only getting about
130<00:05:36.440> because<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.400> label<00:05:37.760> and<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.060> nutrition

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
130 because the label and the nutrition

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.000 
130 because the label and the nutrition
facts<00:05:38.780> are<00:05:38.960> not<00:05:39.110> taking<00:05:39.440> into<00:05:39.560> account<00:05:39.650> the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
facts are not taking into account the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.070 
facts are not taking into account the
fact<00:05:40.040> that<00:05:40.310> you're<00:05:40.520> not<00:05:40.610> going<00:05:40.850> to<00:05:40.910> digest<00:05:41.360> all

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
fact that you're not going to digest all

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.360 
fact that you're not going to digest all
the<00:05:42.380> almonds<00:05:42.710> so<00:05:42.740> someone's<00:05:43.100> going<00:05:43.220> to<00:05:43.250> get

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
the almonds so someone's going to get

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.400 
the almonds so someone's going to get
wasted<00:05:43.820> and<00:05:43.970> that<00:05:44.419> also<00:05:44.720> doesn't<00:05:44.990> take<00:05:45.260> into

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
wasted and that also doesn't take into

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.440 
wasted and that also doesn't take into
account<00:05:45.740> the<00:05:46.040> fact<00:05:46.340> that<00:05:46.669> fiber<00:05:47.000> has<00:05:47.270> an

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
account the fact that fiber has an

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.480 
account the fact that fiber has an
effect<00:05:47.780> on<00:05:47.900> your<00:05:48.230> digestion<00:05:48.710> of<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.070> almonds

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
effect on your digestion of the almonds

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.370 
effect on your digestion of the almonds
and<00:05:49.730> also<00:05:50.150> that's<00:05:50.780> going<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.050> lower<00:05:51.200> the

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
and also that's going to lower the

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.650 
and also that's going to lower the
amount<00:05:51.470> of<00:05:51.650> calories<00:05:52.040> you<00:05:52.130> absorb<00:05:52.490> as<00:05:52.669> well<00:05:52.850> so

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
amount of calories you absorb as well so
