you<00:01:08.400> know<00:01:08.520> right<00:01:08.730> now<00:01:08.910> I<00:01:08.940> think<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you know right now I think this this

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.810 
you know right now I think this this
whole<00:01:10.020> period<00:01:10.680> before<00:01:10.980> the<00:01:11.280> game<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.670> really

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
whole period before the game is really

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
whole period before the game is really
important<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.510> think<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.260> only<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.620> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
important I think not only for the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.320 
important I think not only for the
coaching<00:01:14.010> staff<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.550> players<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.090> to

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
coaching staff for the players to to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270 
coaching staff for the players to to
kind<00:01:16.050> of<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.260> familiar<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.770> each<00:01:16.860> other<00:01:17.040> once

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
kind of get familiar to each other once

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
focusing a lot on our physical condition

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.700

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
we can get down to the nitty-gritty in

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.030 
we can get down to the nitty-gritty in
terms<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.750> playing<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:25.380> positioning<00:01:25.860> but

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
terms of playing and positioning but

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.580 
terms of playing and positioning but
these<00:01:26.670> three<00:01:27.150> games<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.810> essence<00:01:28.260> will<00:01:28.440> be

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
these three games in essence will be

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
these three games in essence will be
very<00:01:28.800> important<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.370> terms<00:01:29.550> for<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.420> coaches

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
very important in terms for the coaches

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.620 
very important in terms for the coaches
to<00:01:30.990> evaluate<00:01:31.560> where<00:01:32.100> players<00:01:32.370> are<00:01:32.729> who's<00:01:33.360> at

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
to evaluate where players are who's at

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
to evaluate where players are who's at
their<00:01:33.750> best<00:01:33.930> form<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.400> so

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
their best form and and so on and so

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.990 
their best form and and so on and so
forth<00:01:35.610> so<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.290> think<00:01:37.290> they're<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.620> use

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
forth so I think they're going to use

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.820 
forth so I think they're going to use
the<00:01:39.000> friendly<00:01:39.390> games<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.229> assess<00:01:40.590> each

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830

now obviously the team is a little

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.080 
now obviously the team is a little
different<00:02:18.190> because<00:02:18.250> we're<00:02:18.489> closer<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.970> age

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
different because we're closer in age

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.520

with<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.930> lot<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.140> other<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.769> players<00:02:29.980> on

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
with a lot of other of the players on

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.800 
with a lot of other of the players on
the<00:02:30.250> team<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.760> youth<00:02:30.910> program<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.630> I

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the team and the youth program so I

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.670 
the team and the youth program so I
think<00:02:32.200> there's<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.910> sense<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.200> film<00:02:35.200> alienness

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
think there's a sense of film alienness

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.570 
think there's a sense of film alienness
amongst<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.610> players<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:39.370> fact

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
amongst the players and and the fact

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.430 
amongst the players and and the fact
that<00:02:39.640> we<00:02:39.819> are<00:02:39.849> closer<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.299> age<00:02:40.510> allows<00:02:40.989> us<00:02:41.230> to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
that we are closer in age allows us to

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.710 
that we are closer in age allows us to
have<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.190> special<00:02:42.489> team<00:02:42.940> bond<00:02:43.269> and<00:02:43.540> team

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
have a special team bond and team

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.420 
have a special team bond and team
chemistry<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.319> think<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.769> you<00:02:44.860> can<00:02:45.010> you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
chemistry that I think that you can you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.520 
chemistry that I think that you can you
can<00:02:45.580> see<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.849> when<00:02:45.880> we<00:02:46.060> play<00:02:46.299> against<00:02:47.260> up<00:02:47.410> their

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
can see it when we play against up their

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.120 
can see it when we play against up their
national<00:02:47.890> teams<00:02:48.099> and<00:02:48.370> within<00:02:49.360> camps<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.130> you

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130

national teams and within camps and you
know<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.250> think<00:02:51.430> that's<00:02:51.580> one<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.760> our<00:02:51.910> strengths

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.810 
know I think that's one of our strengths
on<00:02:52.569> this<00:02:52.720> team<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.310> hopefully<00:02:54.310> that's<00:02:54.700> going

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
on this team and hopefully that's going

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.270 
on this team and hopefully that's going

there's something special for around the
corner<00:03:35.819> well<00:03:36.819> i<00:03:36.880> think<00:03:36.940> first<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.390> foremost

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
corner well i think first and foremost

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.880 
corner well i think first and foremost
we<00:03:37.780> needed<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.080> focus<00:03:38.200> on<00:03:38.470> getting<00:03:38.560> out<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.830> our

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
we needed to focus on getting out of our

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.949 
we needed to focus on getting out of our
group<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.280> you<00:03:40.090> know<00:03:40.209> from<00:03:40.420> then<00:03:40.540> on<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.870> so

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
group and you know from then on it so

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.770 
group and you know from then on it so
it's<00:03:41.170> a<00:03:41.230> one-off<00:03:41.410> game<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:42.209> on<00:03:43.209> any<00:03:43.420> given<00:03:43.600> day

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
it's a one-off game so on any given day

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.059 
it's a one-off game so on any given day
and<00:03:44.019> it<00:03:44.080> could<00:03:44.290> beat<00:03:44.410> anyone<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.920> know<00:03:45.010> you

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
and it could beat anyone you know you

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.530 
and it could beat anyone you know you
saw<00:03:45.280> that<00:03:45.430> in<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.610> Federation's<00:03:46.150> Cup<00:03:46.299> were

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
saw that in the Federation's Cup were

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.539 
saw that in the Federation's Cup were
you<00:03:46.840> know<00:03:46.930> we<00:03:47.080> upset<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.410> light<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.799> Spain<00:03:48.069> and

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
you know we upset the light to Spain and

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.210 
you know we upset the light to Spain and
so<00:03:49.299> I<00:03:49.569> think<00:03:49.690> right<00:03:50.230> now<00:03:50.350> our<00:03:50.500> main<00:03:50.650> focus<00:03:51.040> and

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
so I think right now our main focus and

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.039 
so I think right now our main focus and
a<00:03:51.250> main<00:03:51.430> goal<00:03:51.670> is<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.150> get<00:03:52.600> out<00:03:52.720> of<00:03:52.810> our<00:03:52.900> group

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
a main goal is to get out of our group

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.140 
a main goal is to get out of our group
first<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.620> then<00:03:53.799> from<00:03:53.950> then<00:03:54.100> on<00:03:54.250> it's<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.030> one

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
first and then from then on it's the one

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.580 
first and then from then on it's the one
off<00:03:55.269> game<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.630> anything's<00:03:55.900> possible<00:03:56.049> you

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
off game and anything's possible you

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.140 
off game and anything's possible you
know<00:03:56.709> I<00:03:56.890> think<00:03:57.220> your<00:03:57.310> world<00:03:57.519> cup<00:03:57.700> creates<00:03:58.030> an

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
know I think your world cup creates an

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.150 
know I think your world cup creates an
environment<00:03:58.420> unlike<00:03:59.049> any<00:03:59.230> other<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.650> I<00:04:00.130> think

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
environment unlike any other and I think

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.800 
environment unlike any other and I think
I<00:04:00.580> just<00:04:00.640> being<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.030> part<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.360> that<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.510> being

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
I just being a part of that and being

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.780 
I just being a part of that and being
you<00:04:02.290> know<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.620> focal<00:04:02.980> point<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.310> those<00:04:03.549> types

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
you know the focal point of those types

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.430 
you know the focal point of those types
of<00:04:03.880> environments<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.510> an<00:04:04.600> amazing<00:04:05.079> thing<00:04:05.109> and

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440
