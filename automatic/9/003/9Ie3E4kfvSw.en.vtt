 hello you dear welcome to 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:10.389
 I show you my recipes today 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.670
 we need our salad first 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.740
 If I respect him please be careful 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.270
 your big and a little bit thick 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.110
 they are the best for it 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.510
 suitable 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.660
 the aubergines are grilled 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.590
 Actually, I'm not there at the moment 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.560
 can separate 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:30.570
 he'll be at 250 degrees in the morning 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.860
 oven about 30 to 45 minutes 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.839
 in addition we need one more 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.180
 onion I cut it small 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:39.549
 half point parsley too small 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.760
 cut two peppers I have 

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:45.190
 then grilled on the hand then cut 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.369
 You can either use the paprika 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.589
 Eggplant two peppers with red peppers 

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:53.140
 barbecue but the skin goes to the 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:57.070
 paprika is bad but it works 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.900
 even to buy grilled peppers 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.050
 then you can not have that from me 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.260
 then so 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.150
 Support is taken then needed 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.410

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.950
 cut juice of half a lemon 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.620
 salt remains flickr and olive oil 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.350
 As you can see , eggplants are already 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.370
 grilled and now you can just the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.370
 skin off 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:35.000
 so now you can get the eggplants 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.000
 just cut all the pieces 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:53.450
