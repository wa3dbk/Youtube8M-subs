00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.620
 hello and welcome to the new 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.330
 tutorial with the question is mine 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.160
 controller resp 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.230
 an android device ever with the 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.830
 controller compatible 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:30.230
 There is the six access compatible 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:34.630
 checker you have to stand that that 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.870
 app tests if the device is compatible 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:42.070
 So it has to be cleared that's the one 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:47.480
 most important thing actually 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.510
 must be present steadily so state 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.830
 we have it down here 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.370
 this is probably your first time 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.800
 if yes once pressed on start 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.050
 he begins to pick up in the normal case, too 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.910
 directly the super rights 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.620
 Now you get the address here 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.090
 me is the 14 pc blah blah blah blah blah 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.590
 and this address we must now the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.380
 teach controller 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.990
 we make that we attach to time 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.100
 the cell phone on the side and left the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:24.080
 controller simply by usb cable to the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:27.890
 computer on as soon as it is connected 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.770
 we have to be on the screen now 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.740
 sees the six experts do that 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.780
 are country program for windows amount 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.700
 of the leads you see that he is the same 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.800
 Begins to install the operator once 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.070
 The drivers are simply installed 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.150
 address your cellphone will show you there 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.330
 then enter on counter 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.210
 then it will be done now we can do that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.560
 So stick out the controller again 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.590
 Now the controller has the address of 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.090
 the android device stored there because 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.130
 I have to connect with something 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.570
 can now list here is available 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.260
 controllers that is expected 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.200
 control 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.369
 just press the ps3 button 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.540
 and see you soon 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.239
 that here the such begins now 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.430
 stands here compilation of the device is 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.519
 compatible or how that also means the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.090
 means it is love when we are now 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.530
 go and we will move then 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.670
 the nice list I always introduced 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.739
 when will you really see if 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.739
 I now for example extra 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.340
 downton that means button 10 was 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.370
 pushed down I go back to one 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.660
 button down it goes off that's because 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.030
 it a try button here at all and 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.980
 play it looks like then 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:52.019
 that means the device recognizes that the 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.480
 Compatibility check is now complete 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.209
 the controller runs along with the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.879
 Handy everything as he did with the 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.629
 then she does it with the right app 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.379
 next video 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.379
